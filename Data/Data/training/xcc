people who will say to other people i know jesus i know that he loves us i know that he UNK us i know that he is risen from the dead and that the good news is that we will also rise from our own deaths
the big fear that all UNK has is that when you die that's the end of it
UNK resurrection means that we will not die not in the sense of eternal death
we will move through a period now that we call death but we will not die in the sense of UNK
UNK death and resurrection means exactly that
so let's just er to put it in context again we saw that on the day of the UNK jesus instructed his friends to go on UNK the good news throughout the world to help others become disciples and bring to them and bring them to membership of the church through baptism
jesus knew however that before they would be ready to undertake this work they needed power they needed a special power
the apostles didn't have the understanding or the courage to do this by themselves
when jesus had returned to his father the apostles did as he had told them and returned to the city
once more they felt lost and afraid
when jesus when while jesus had been with them they had the confidence
now they were not sure what to do
for ten days they UNK in the upper room
then on pentecost sunday pentecost day ten days after the UNK and fifty days after then resurrection the apostles had an experience which not only changed them but changed the whole history of the world
you see man from the very beginning man and woman has been afraid
and the thing the biggest thing that we've been afraid of is death and the things that lead to death like sickness and like UNK like weakness
these are the things that make us afraid and we build ourselves secure places so as that we can't or don't have any need to be afraid
what jesus is saying is you don't have to be afraid of death any more
i've been through death and i've UNK death
pentecost
you see it's one thing for jesus to say that it's another for us to believe it and accept it
i mean i can tell you that there's water in the pipe if you're UNK but you need to go to the pipe with a glass and turn the tap on in order to er not to be UNK any more in order to receive the water
there is something you have to do in order to receive the gift
even if it's only stretching out your hand to receive the gift it's something yo you all of us have to do
er but in order to stretch out our hands in order to turn the tap on er sometimes that takes courage er because s people might be laughing at us
they'll say oh there's no water in that tap you know
and you say well there is i know there is
and er sometimes it takes a bit of courage to walk over to the tap when everybody's saying there'll be no water and for you to turn that tap on
of course when everybody finds that there is water there's all sorts of excuses then
oh yeah somebody must have been there you must have put it in yourself you must have done
people give you that sort of excuse
er right
er can i read just through this pentecost er with you
erm when pentecost day came around they had all met in one room
notice there immediately when we're frightened we like to have other people around us
we don't like to be on our own
it's harder to be frightened on your own
they'd all met in one room
when suddenly they heard what sounded like a powerful wind from heaven the noise of which filled the entire house in which they were sitting
and something appeared to them which seemed like tongues of fire
these separated and came to rest on the head of each of them
they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in foreign tongues as the spirit gave them the gift of speech
now there were UNK men living in jerusalem from every nation under heaven and at this sound they all UNK
evidently the sound that has been heard in the upper room is not just in the upper room but it's er it's UNK within the whole district
these guys come to the sound
each one UNK to hear men speaking in his own language
they were amazed and astonished
surely they said all these men speaking are UNK
how does it happen that each of us hears them in his own UNK language
UNK people from UNK and asian UNK and egypt and the parts of UNK around UNK as well as visitors from rome jews and UNK and UNK
we hear them preaching in our own language about the UNK of god
everyone was amazed and unable to explain it and they asked one another what it all meant
can you imagine that you know just using your imagination again to slip back to those er these things hadn't been experienced
you know i mean it's difficult to erm to grasp
it's rather like you know you know one remembers the feeding of the five thousand
these were extraordinary UNK they weren't you know things that were daily available
but for our need at this moment we have to look at what the holy spirit is doing
so the holy spirit and the symbol that was er found most useful by the holy spirit was fire
just as you look at the UNK flame there burning erm it's a symbol
i mean it's actually giving light out but er there's one over there if anybody
yeah
can't see it
the er it's actually giving light out but if you were to try and grasp that light in your hand you couldn't
you know you can't feel you can't grab hold of light in your hand
and you can't actually grab hold of wind er in your hand either
you know i mean if you try and grab the wind all you you're left with is a UNK
but those symbols of fire and of wind are useful because when we say god is in us when we say the holy spirit is in us we can't actually grab anything and say you know we can't actually put it on a video and say that little bit to the right of my heart is the holy spirit
you can't do that
the holy spirit is erm is not visible in the same way that wind isn't visible
and yet the to say that the wind doesn't exist because you can't see it would be erm would be pretty dangerous if you were standing on a cliff and saying there's no wind around here and there's a UNK gale blowing you off and into the water
erm so some of the things that we can look at with wind for example of the er you know the power and the destructive nature of wind the cooling nature of wind the UNK nature of wind the disturbing nature of wind
erm you know when you're th we were just talking about the upper room and erm and the great wind that was noise that was felt
there aren't many people who aren't afraid when there's a lot of wind about
most people on a very UNK day and we had a couple you know in the winter there didn't we and UNK wind UNK and there aren't many people who say you know in the middle of that storm oh i feel quite comfortable i'm quite happy with this
you know i mean you're wondering whether it's going to blow the UNK pot off or all sorts of things
but having said that if you're standing er at the UNK after a hot day or something and there's a cool er UNK coming in off the sea the same thing is er is a UNK thing
it's hard to define
fire too is a similar thing
it can be UNK or destroying it can be UNK life giving
it can UNK enthusiasm you're on fire with love you know and er you know the power that's generated by fire
okay
the thing that's suggested just to sort of er bring that round to you to you know rather than just have me speaking is to suggest that er if i start a sentence er perhaps you know people could join in with the finish of that sentence you know
so if i say the holy spirit is the one who gives us
what would you say
how would you finish that sentence
the holy spirit is the one there's no right answer to this let me say
it can be anything that you feel you know
the holy spirit out of all that we've been speaking about and listening to you can give us the end of the sentence
hope
hope
the holy spirit is the one who gives us hope
UNK
i mean this generation needs hope
the holy spirit is one who gives us
strength
strength
yes indeed
the holy spirit is one who gives us
comfort
yes
true
the UNK
erm any more
the holy spirit is the one who gives us
protection
protection
they're some of the things that you can think out and er work out you know that's what we've been trying to do
we've got a thing called the changed man er little handout
and you're asked to complete this work in pairs if it's easier
working in pairs
getting a bit short of time
yeah i think it might be if you could just actually talk through it really rather than asking them to do it
it might be as well
oh right yes
now let me just work through this with you so as er wh you know it's unfortunate there's such a lot in these things that er
mm
y you tend to run short of time so then peter stood up with the other eleven apostles and in a loud voice began to speak to the crowd
this is after pentecost now
this is after he's filled with the holy spirit
fellow jews and all of you who live in jerusalem listen to me and let me tell you what this means
this is what the prophet job spoke about
this was a prophet in the old writings of the jews and er one of their one of the people who they looked to for wisdom
and what he said UNK about the future saying what would happen in the future in this case
i will pour out my spirit on everyone
your sons and your daughters shall UNK my message
the holy spirit has been poured out and it's UNK man
it's rather like er i had a plant the other day a UNK and it had been there for about two weeks and it was a lovely plant and er i noticed it beginning to UNK and i thought oh well it's finished now it's in a pot
and then i poured some water on it and it's lasted a further two weeks
it took on a whole new lease of life
erm when the spirit is poured out on us our life changes too and from being UNK we become UNK
listen to these words
jesus of UNK was a man whose divine authority was clearly proven to you by all the miracles and wonders which god performed through him
this jesus you handed over to be crucified but god raised him from death setting him free from its power
god has raised this very jesus from death and we are all witnesses to this fact
what you see and hear is his gift of the holy spirit which he has poured out on us
all the people of israel then are to know for sure that this jesus whom you crucified is the one that god has made lord and messiah
when the people heard this they were deeply UNK and said to peter and the other apostles what shall we do
peter said to them each of you must turn away from sin and be UNK in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of his holy spirit
so we've got column one and we have the picture of the cock in the background UNK
as if it wasn't bad enough there was there was there's the cock UNK in the background and in column two we have the picture of peter er smiling and confident welcoming just like the spirit that UNK him really
i think it's fairly erm straightforward isn't it
in column one we may think er UNK fearful hiding weak afraid are words that might describe peter's state of mind his emotions
after the coming of the holy spirit we might say that he is strong sure UNK confident powerful leader
a changed man
just like to we should have had a little bit of discussion there but we're moving quickly
in our day and age can you think of someone who has been so full of the spirit that he's had the courage to UNK even when his own life was at stake
someone who's had the courage who knowing that what they were saying was UNK powerful people still taking that risk and saying what they felt to be true and just
can you think of anybody
erm martin UNK king
martin UNK king
absolutely
UNK
UNK
archbishop UNK he was a bishop in el UNK and er he was an archbishop and erm he was shot because he opposed the people who were in power
and we can think of other people like mother theresa too in the face of so much er you know what people have said to her is you know don't you think that er what you're doing is just a drop in the ocean
you know you've got a million people and you're just looking after a thousand maybe more
and she has got the courage to look at that million people which takes courage and look at the thousand which she is helping and saying no love is never wasted
you know it's er it's a mystery force and what i do for one in some way affects the million
that takes courage to actually think in those terms
okay we'll move on to the seven gifts of the holy spirit
we've got a thing there i think with them on have you
ah
oh sorry
they have now
they have now
right
the UNK there is representing the holy spirit traditionally and from the UNK are seven channels
seven is in jewish thought and in christian thought for that matter is a perfect number
it's er it's not meant to UNK all of the gifts that the spirit gives us
er it's simply meant to say that any gift that the holy spirit gives you is a perfect thing and it's erm that seven there it's erm it's just trying to bring that idea across
notwithstanding that there are seven things that we can talk about er when we say gifts of the spirit
erm we might say for example er that all of these gifts you've heard of the word grace
er UNK grace natural grace you know now they're it's all it's all help from god but clever UNK have decided to split them up into various things just like the way i mean for example er there's so many different things made from oil you know er like erm UNK er petrol diesel
it's all oil UNK
it is in fact all oil but for trying to understand the thing it's better to try and break it down if we can and that's what's being done here
so wisdom is a gift of the holy spirit and that particular thing is to er help us to judge in the way that god does
erm what is the way that god judges
i think he judges with mercy you know erm it's erm perhaps sometimes when we're asked to be in a situation where we have to give an opinion then it should be if we have wisdom er a UNK erm balance
to help us to understand
the gift of understanding is to help us to understand all that god has told us
which is a lot isn't it really once we come down to it you know we've had a two solid hours of what god has been trying to teach us today
right judgment is to help us to know what to do in difficult situations
these are things that when you're confirmed you will have the ability to reach into
you will have the erm when you're confirmed there'll be a difference in you that isn't there now
you will have the ability to turn the tap on
at the moment in a way you don't have that ability to turn the tap on
erm but after you're confirmed you will have er you know the ability to say yes lord i want to have wisdom i want to have right judgment
courage
the courage of peter er after his UNK is something that was given him by the holy spirit
but peter had to accept it
and UNK peter had to accept it not just once you know and then he was a changed man
he was a changed man but he also there were times when he failed again when peter failed again
and if you read the UNK you'll discover those where er he you know er he was with paul on one occasion and er he'd been eating with UNK and er then some jews came up who believed that eating with er non jews even though they were followers of jesus was wrong
and er and peter because of his fear of the jews says okay i won't do that any more i'll go and i'll just go and sit with the jews
and paul comes up to him and says you're totally wrong out of order here peter erm you know what you know i mean you're afraid that's your problem
and er and peter says you're right er i was wrong to do that
you know so you have to reach out on a daily basis for these gifts
you know so when you're confirmed it won't be okay i'm on the boat now it will be making use of those gifts whatever they may be and they'll be UNK your own in each one the UNK be UNK you know to the person you'll have to make use of it on a daily basis not just simply okay i'm on the boat
erm i think that's about it really
okay
we can er
right
i'm sure that we'll touch on those again to actually finish erm to actually finish with erm our prayer
just put your papers down for a couple of minutes please
jesus said i shall ask the father and he will give you another advocate to be with you for ever
let's pray in the silence of our hearts that god will send the holy spirit to fill us with promised gifts
perhaps there is one gift you feel you need very specially
without getting your papers out can you remember erm finish with
day by day
these things i pray
to see you more clearly to love you more UNK to follow you more nearly
may god bless us and keep us
may god send us his holy spirit and make us UNK followers of jesus christ our lord
amen
thank you
there's just one more handout that i need er to give you
if you fill this in at home
erm have you all got the date when we're meeting again
yes
yeah
can you all remember
now i'm not sure whether it's
saturday
twenty first
yeah
yes
so there's two sundays off
right
there's easter sunday and the sunday after that because some of you may well be off on holiday
so we're meeting back here on the twenty fifth of april at two thirty
okay
erm we've also there's also a bit of homework in there do you remember that was given out erm one of the early sessions and you will be expected to have erm thought quite a lot about that and to have worked through that
if i could also ask those of you who haven't decided on a confirmation name i think really by the time we meet again you should
so i mean i won't take them now if you have thought erm and if y if you have er decided on a name i won't erm make a note of it now erm but if you can all remember that we definitely need the confirmation names sorted out
also i do need the name of your sponsor and their address and also i would like to see if possible by then any erm UNK certificates that we haven't seen
have you got a got a problem with it or
okay
erm the problem being that if erm if it is from another parish erm the UNK in that parish can really be very slow in erm supplying you with erm a copy of it
erm so if erm she doesn't leave it any later than monday if she gets in touch with the parish UNK would be very grateful
erm we'll talk some more too about the away day at the next session
erm really what er i wanted to do was erm to sort out the person who is actually going to the UNK mass
erm so catherine you said you didn't think you'd go you could go
i can't
and kate you can't go
can you go UNK
yeah
so we've got UNK
and you're you don't think that
i'm not sure
so
i'll find out for next week
no
that's no good because the mass is on thursday
it's thursday
which thursday
this thursday coming
are you around or did you say you thought you were going away
i thought we are going away to wales
you don't know when
no
right
ben what about you
er i'm not sure
you're not sure so you haven't right okay
and what about you UNK
i'm going i am going away
so you're going away
so UNK it looks as though it's down to you
alright so would you like to do that for us
i explained quite well i think didn't i on erm friday when i saw you what was involved
erm if i just give your name to liz she'll probably get in touch with your mum
erm but she may well pick you up about eleven o'clock
starts at half eleven alright UNK
and then you will be coming to evening mass won't you
because we'll need you to process
erm so you're definitely away
are you are you definitely away catherine or are you is it just the day that you're going out
will you get mass
yeah i don't know
i'll get in touch i'll give her a ring because we actually we were looking erm out of the twelve of you altogether we were looking for six of you to actually have your feet washed on UNK thursday evening at the at the mass at the service on UNK thursday evening
what happens is o you know you know that erm twelve people have their feet washed er during that erm service and erm what we wanted was six confirmation ca er candidates to actually have their feet washed on the UNK erm by father and then to ask those six to then go down into the congregation and wash the feet of one other person each making twelve altogether
really sort of as a sign of service erm to community
erm it doesn't look really as though out of certainly out of this six that we're going to get three
but you may be around mightn't you
and you may be around
yeah
peter anyway
erm are you around on
may be around
that
right
and UNK you're when are you going away
well we're going away erm on the friday morning
ah right okay
well
we might be able to come to the mass but i'm not sure
alright i'll i think it's probably better if but kate you're away definitely
okay
well i'll give your parents a ring then
it's probably you know better me to do that and make certain erm but if you were here would anybody be prepared to do that
to actually have their feet washed and then go down and wash somebody else's
it's nothing to be bothered about really you know it it's a good thing to do
it's only a it's only a token
yes it's not erm you do have to sort of take your UNK and shoe off but only of one foot
and you'll just have a some water you know poured on top and then you'll have a UNK to wipe your feet
you won't be involved in that UNK really cos you'll be part of the erm UNK with the oils you see
but erm what we would like is for any of you who are actually here at that time to attend that mass and to be involved in some way to do some sort of erm service
so okay
think about it anyway and i'll try and get in touch with your mums and UNK erm
it's not because we can't get anybody else it's because we want to involve you
but er
yes it is
be because you know it really is it's erm er it is sort of really we see it as sort of part of the confirmation programme really and your involvement in it and it's all sort of quite erm special to confirmation so it would be nice if you could be involved
alright
but i'll
so certain things on testing
you're probably very proud of your UNK and erm there's UNK there's the temptation to keep making minor improvements just to make it a bit better
er but any change you make to a computer system is likely to introduce bugs into the system so that it doesn't give the right answers any more
er so you have to resist that temptation
if there's something that isn't working there's a well known UNK with computers don't fix it
erm what you need to do is if you can save up all the changes for one batch and then do them all together
cos there's economy to scale on first economy is the scale on understanding the system
before you can make changes to the system you have to understand it and that takes an awful long time
er so there's economy to scale on that and there's the economy to scale on testing too
if you have to test an something then there's economy to scale if you test the ten things instead of one
erm when you start testing you shouldn't input the real numbers to start with
you shouldn't start with nice simple constant numbers maybe thousands all the way across cos the UNK very good at UNK patterns and when you put nice simple numbers in the eye can see these UNK patterns clearly and highlighting errors
on this spreadsheet here i haven't input my s constant round numbers
if you look at that spreadsheet then nothing seems wrong with that seems okay
seems wrong certainly
but if i put nice round numbers in the green cells are the input cells
thousand across all the columns here erm nice round numbers input elsewhere
then most of the rows also come out with nice round numbers except this one row here stands out
numbers look a bit odd there
i'll have to investigate
so you start with nice you may then change one or two of the numbers to check various aspects
you start with nice constant round simple numbers
there's all sorts of ex it's probably UNK to test every single cell
you have to concentrate too on extremes the first and the last in a row or a column
erm there's no many different aspects of two extremes
does anybody here write spreadsheets for other people to use
so it's solely for your own use
if you write a spreadsheet for somebody else you might be using a sixty six UNK four eight six UNK processor erm UNK and somebody is using a steam driven i b m a t or something and it runs quite UNK on your machine a reasonable speed and you give it to somebody else on that steam driven thing and it takes ages to do anything and er you press a button and they wait half an hour sort of thing
this happened to you some way or other
you need to research into this don't you
but it's given you a spreadsheet it takes ages to load it
even load it
so there's that to consider as well if you're writing spreadsheets for other people
erm
when you finish testing well as you test you start off with simple numbers and you then start changing some of the numbers to test other aspects and eventually you're happy that everything seems to be working alright
now what you probably do is just UNK all the input cells back to zero
erm and you lose that test data set
it's a good idea to keep that test data because later on you're almost certainly going to make changes and you'll therefore need to re test the system and a quick way to re test the system is to put all that test data in again and see if you get the same answers
and if you don't then you can see very quickly what's gone wrong and probably where it's gone wrong as well
so keep that test data set
that's another good reason for keeping all your inputs in a separate area
it then makes it easy to save all your inputs into a separate file when they're all in one separate input area
if you've got them scattered about all over the place it makes it much more difficult to try and save them and later on get the data back in
it's very easy to do all in one separate area combine and put the test data file back in again but very difficult when scattered about
erm said that
no matter how erm simple or small a change you're making you'll probably think oh that's bound to work no need to test that such a simple change
you'd be surprised
you have to test every single thing
now even if you test things thoroughly as you're building your spreadsheets then it's quite possible that something you do later on affects something you do earlier on
so you need to go back when you finish the whole system and test everything again
erm but you won't remember all the things to test as you forget very quickly so as you're building the spreadsheet you ought to write down a list of things you're going to go back and test
sorry
that's a point testing certain aspects
it'll often pay to think about er the order in which you test
because if yo if you got to the end of testing and then you found an error you might have to go all the way back to the beginning again because what it affects something that you did earlier on so you have to go back and test everything again
but if you thought about the order that you test then if something doesn't work you may only have to go back a few steps and re test
when do you enter
yeah well that's a fact of life for the UNK out
i suppose you might a very simple spreadsheet then er just adding up a column of numbers is hardly get that wrong
er that's true
but then there are underlying UNK in one two three and in dos and a certain rare combination of circumstances it's possible that
it's highly unlikely that summing up a single column of numbers
but it's possible
this could be certain circumstances and there are when you get the wrong answer
that column of numbers
if you knew what the combination of circumstances were then you could perhaps re do your spreadsheet with a different way to avoid it
but er you're not going to know all bugs that there are in the software
but having said that if the something doesn't work
well human nature being what it is then erm you're likely to blame lotus
so oh lotus is not working properly
but ninety nine times out of a hundred it's your spreadsheet that's at fault
you had this experience before
blamed it on lotus
test er UNK in the next topic
the same reasons as er testing er you ought to do it as you go
because if you come back later on and try and document your spreadsheets then an awful lot is forgotten
so you have to spend time or time to re understand what you were doing before you can document it properly
when i write a system for a client then i do the documentation in advance of writing the system
erm an another advantage of doing that is it ensures that you do in other things which is design a system
nobody documents the spreadsheets
nobody designs the system
people just jump straight in do the first bit erm having done the first bit they then think about how they're gonna fit in the next bit and you end up with a UNK mess that er doesn't fit together doesn't work together too well
if you plan things as in most in life if you plan ahead you can actually er do it a lot quicker
and that certainly applies to building computer systems
planning ahead building your spreadsheets
you probably end up writing the system file quicker and have a much simpler system which also maintain in far less time
you can also have far less errors etcetera
so if you do the documentation in advance in the documentation yeah in the documentation i explain what spreadsheets there are where things are on the spreadsheets the various procedures for how to do certain things
you do this go here and there and go there do that and so on
you've actually thought through exactly erm how the spreadsheet is going to be designed
er now certain documentation are very valuable
one of those is the spreadsheet map
it's a UNK eye view as to where everything is on the spreadsheet
so this is the whole spreadsheet and erm these green boxes within the spreadsheet are the different areas within the spreadsheet
erm so in the top left of this spreadsheet i've got some documentation below that some blank rows a key parameter section here
below that to the right is some imported data and so on
so i know where things are on the spreadsheets
and not only that i've written some text on the spreadsheet showing the process that's going on
so the first thing that happens is data gets er imported into the spreadsheet here and second thing that could happen is er the unwanted records get deleted
step three is something called run UNK so something specific to this spreadsheet gets extracted and so on
so i've got a good idea what's going on that spreadsheet what's on it where it is and what's happen what happens in the processes
they're very useful pieces of documentation
as i was saying before the most important thing to understand is the overview
once you understand the overview you can start to work your way and understand the individual detail
er it's a good idea to got documentation actually on the spreadsheet itself because then it doesn't go missing
i'll put the file name the date and time that's what we were talking about before
if you want a file naming convention you might want to explain the different elements of the file name
erm if you're responsible you might want to put your name down if you're the UNK of this spreadsheet
you probably don't want to do this i would imagine
but anybody who UNK your spreadsheet in the future erm anybody who UNK your spreadsheet in the future may want to understand something about it so you're obviously going to be a good source of providing that information
or there's anybody in your own organization who is responsible name the UNK and the files etcetera may want to know is this your file
do you want to delete it or whatever
it might be useful to know who was doing that
erm even if you inherit some spreadsheets from this person that's left that's useful knowledge because you don't have to spend time searching for whoever might have created this spreadsheet
erm this is a general method spreadsheet that UNK code handled it applications and department say that erm
did you hear that
yeah
she had to stay here to midnight
right erm
so er what the description was there by the way it's not meant to be a description of the person
what it is this thing that follows is that any changes you make any UNK are likely sources of problems
if somebody calls you up and says something's not working always ask well what did you change recently and ninety five percent of the time it's that that's the cause of the problems
the that they changed recently
so you want to make a note of what's changed so when you make a change who made it
a description of the change
why does this spreadsheet exist
so that's an important thing to know
what's the overall purpose of this spreadsheet
so here is some text explaining that
on this slide i've kept the text pretty small because stays on this line but er you've got more text than i've got there to explain the purpose of this spreadsheet
and very importantly is er a list of instructions on how to use it in order to erm update it for the current month
you do this and this
to do some other tasks you do this and this and so on
so you have a list of procedures for erm what you have to do and this one will certainly be very useful to anyone else who's going to use the spreadsheet
but it's also useful for yourself because you can forget a couple of steps even though you've built this spreadsheet and er when you update this spreadsheet for the following months you know occasionally you might forget a step
well it's like you check the lists you can quickly even if you think you remembered it you can still quickly read through to see whether you've done all those different things and you do sometimes forget so it's useful for that as well
er if you were writing a written article then you may well include references or sources of information that help you write that article
same way on your broad spreadsheets you may include sources of references mainly people that you've spoken to that provided you information
maybe various UNK such as the lotus manual
you may be using some particular part in the spreadsheet that you consider to be unusual er you may want to include a page reference so that er you can understand it again
hello yeah i'll get him to call you back then bye
er then it when you're looking at the back unusual part of the lotus again you know which page of the manual to go or all of the help screens
tells somebody how to get to particular help screens or people often have difficulty finding things on the help screens so some instructions for where to find a particular piece of information on the help screens can be useful
you can create a basic form of map on the spreadsheet
in fact the UNK wig whenever you use it you don't have to actually draw a diagram that map that we just saw with boxes and arrows and things you could draw that on the spreadsheet with the UNK wig
on a text spreadsheet though you can't draw things but er you could use some letters UNK roughly where the different parts of the spreadsheet are
so you could you could create a crude form of map on the spreadsheet particularly on a text spreadsheet like this
good idea to have a list of all the file names cos er you may want to copy this system to some other computer
but you you'll probably i would imagine over a period of time put a number of extra files in that directory that you're going to need
so identify which of the files you need er would be useful so that's what this would do
sorting them
okay
thanks very much and if you er were to er accidentally lose some files you would know which files have gone missing
er another useful piece of documentation is a diagram listing all the files that you've got in your system
so there's a box for each file and there's a flow of data from one file to another a little arrow showing how the data passes from one file to another
er it'd be a good idea to also write the file names
these are just the descriptions but the file names would be useful to appear on those ends of those boxes as well
and if you were to write a manual er though that's probably unlikely for most of you
basically if you write a manual for somebody else to use then er there's a standard layout of UNK computer UNK that is to have a getting started section tells you how to UNK in some of the basics like how to start it running erm the how to section is very important
the procedures and how to do certain tasks
you ever used a lotus manual
no
a lot of people don't
never seen it most people i don't think
er but they have a lot of steps on how to do things
you do this and this
for all sorts of different tasks
so that's probably the most important part of the manual
er with reference section perhaps describes all parts of the system and the index is very useful even though it's only a dozen pages long your manual
so if you're looking for something bit of a pain having to UNK through half a dozen pages if you can go to the index and then jump directly to the relevant page and then save you a bit of time
on most modern word processing software it makes it very easy to create an index
ho who uses any word processing software
what software do you use
couple UNK
UNK
i'm not sure i'd call that modern word processing
does that UNK create indexes for you
no
not that you're aware
oh right
okay
it it's that what you're used to
no
word for windows
word for windows which certainly is that is a modern word processing package right
er any questions on that
er have a quick revision then our final test
oh right okey doke alright thanks very much
bye
see you UNK
bye
bye UNK
cheerio
have a nice weekend
thank you very much
did you want to go on this side
so the last time we had a break was er well actually we didn't do the useful formulae did we last time
so we can include that in it
right are you ready
right i think it's the left turn to go first
erm if you got er a label in b three and another label in b four
how do you enter a formula that joins them together
plus b three UNK b four
right good
right
er if you got a number in one of the cells that you're joining
you got a label in one cell and a number in another cell you want to formally join the two together er what's the formula
b three b four
b three b four
yeah
so the number is b four let's say
yes it is
that's right plus
do you think b three
b three b UNK got the number
plus b three erm and you got a brackets that way and erm b four has the at stream
at stream yeah
open brackets no at stream open brackets
yeah
b four
yeah
close brackets
oh yeah er give you half for that
put it across to this side you know the question
never done it before
you didn't get it quite right
the brain
there would be a plus in front of the UNK comma zero you missed th the UNK
ah
now string b four comma zero four no decimals
okey doke
er over to the left erm if you're using file combine copy to copy data across and you want to copy both numbers and er labels
there may be some formulae but you don't want the formulae how do you do it the file combine copy
what do you do
there's three steps i want
well the way i'd always done it before was change it to value before i combined it
but then you
yes
yeah
when you got
three steps
yeah
yeah
oh is it range value
ah well that's one of the steps
you've had it and you combine a
ah well that's another method
i'm saying if you're using file combine copy because you want numbers as well as labels
yes that's the first step put it on manual
then you do file combine
then you do the file combine yeah
and then you do the range copy
range value
you do range value do you
er and how do you do the range value
added value to the field that you're into the field that you are in
you copy it into the field that you're already in
you copy it to itself
okay you can now try
yes yeah there you go
er range
erm what's the disadvantage of the extract method
that is er saving a range from the prompt file using extract and then going into the other file and doing a file combine in that extracted file
what's the disadvantage of that method
it on things
the extracted file
take it to the combined product
yes you er change the from file and you save it but then you forget to do the extract
th that's the risk with it
that's the same problem with your method by the way
if you use range on the from file to copy it you may change that file save and forget to range value to a different range
right okey doke over to the left
erm what doesn't file combine add to copy
sorry
what doesn't file combine add copy
labels
labels is one thing
there's two things
erm
formulas
formulas
formulas that's it
it doesn't copy labels
or whatever
right the other side
er if you create a file linking formulae in one two three release two erm when you retrieve a file that contains the file with the formulae er does it update the file links as you retrieve it
that's the question
yeah when you retrieve it does it update the file links automatically or do you have to do something to make it update
update it manual
yeah i thought you did
yes why i am asking you or i did i say
it does automatic but it wasn't
isn't that right
yeah well that's right
therefore it was on automatic
yes that's right
it is automatic in release two but it's not in release three that was the other question
never mind
oh sorry two part mistakes
across to the er the left erm can you erm create a file linking formula that links not just one cell but a whole range of cells
so you create a range name in the from file that covers a range of that say ten cells
erm does that work
no
you can only do one
yes you only link one cell to one cell
that's right
okey doke
erm in one two three release three erm when you retrieve a file it doesn't it doesn't automatically update a file
er give me two methods of updating the linking formulae in release three or four
two methods
does it
er in one two three release three and four it doesn't update the linking formulae when you retrieve the file
er give me two methods for how you can update the linking formulae
would it
no
i'll pass it across
over here one method
no
no the one method was to open the other file the on the prompt file and the two files
you had both files in memory and automatically UNK
yeah
and the other method was to go to the menus and choose file admin link UNK
alright
erm over to the er left erm how do you make a directory
go into dos first
into dos
i want to create a directory called put off the root directory
go into dos right
go into dos backslash c d
backslash
c d when you can do anything
right
so what d how do i make a directory put then
m d backslash
right
fine
the root directory
okey doke
er over to the right
one two three and you want to change the current directory to point at this directory put
what do you do
backslash directory i think you can just type in file
yes file directory i'll put there then
okey doke
over to the other side erm
how do you delete all files that have two in positions three and four of the file name
delete space question make question mark what was it
two
er twenty two
twenty two UNK dot UNK
yeah
that's it
the other side
sorry
only occasionally
erm when you start testing your spreadsheets what er type of numbers should you input
even or round numbers
round numbers
nice ro that's one aspect of it yes
round numbers
what do you call a round number
a hundred
a hundred yeah okey doke
erm one aspect
golden rule
that's it
yes that's without a consistent across all there
good
well done
er right over to the other side
erm what's an advantage of having your inputs in a separate area for the purpose of view testing
erm what's the advantage of having your inputs in an separate area from the view of testing
you can use them again if you're re testing
yes
UNK use it again er yes can you say a bit more
what do you want me to change
a bit more
er you could use them again that's true but you could do anywhere i suppose them again but er
but that's why you never put them you put them in numbers
and that means
sorry
save them
save them extract yes
you can save them more easily than when they're scattered about
yeah you can do that
right okey doke
over to the to the right erm give me er three very important parts of the computer documentation
the design specifications is that what you mean
that's wa that's the overall thing you're talking about is it
no t the actual main parts of the documentation
who wrote the spreadsheet
because that's detail really er i was looking for the main parts
what on the spreadsheet or design the spreadsheet
er off or on the spreadsheet
sort of like things like if you've got a if contents spreadsheet where it comes from what files
er well you used well you're getting a bit more detailed but wh what is that thing
sorry
cleared out having cleared directory
clear directory
no perhaps my question was too vague
i wa wanted sort of major pieces of UNK of the individual details on that documentation schedule major bits
the input area
the report to calculations
oh no that's i guess i'll just have to UNK my question
er
well what's a spreadsheet map
that's another question
what do you put on a spreadsheet map
that's one of the important of the documentation
and then it then it goes down
yeah then it goes down to UNK or whatever what they are has any of that worked
i don't know somebody's spreadsheets
that's three things that are in there
so wh how do you what's on the map
erm come on
you've got squares
you've got squares
you've got writing
what the lines what the lines showing
showing the cells the different cells
shows you yeah you got boxes showing you where things are on the spreadsheets and you got some tags saying what those are
you got arrows showing flow of data
what else do you have on the spreadsheets
erm the name of what the what the erm spreadsheet looks like
er not in that well there might be on that but er but that there what resources are on the spreadsheet
on that batch
how are things that were numbered one two three four five six
oh extra process
yes extra processes that are going on
i'll give you er four for that
well you didn't get the rest of the question at all
erm what give me erm give me erm seven things yeah seven things to put on this spreadsheet
seven pieces of documentation actually on this spreadsheet
amendment
that's one yes
date
what the amendment was
the date
the date time file name
date time file name
yes that's two
who created it
sorry who created it
yes that's three
run instructions
run instructions
yes that's four
what it's for
yes the purpose of it that's five
file names
had that one
the date it's been and updated
we had that one
who updated it
what it
we had that one
references
i suppose you could but it's not one of the things i had listed
did somebody say references
yeah
what did you mean
who do you talk to if you need any information
oh yes that's right yes reference
that's the right thing
six
one more
give us a clue
i've just talked about it
who to talk to
sorry
we've just talked about it in this room
the other thing
the map
the map
that's it
well done
shall i give them that
that's a quarter
quarter
i'll give you that
yeah
right over to the right erm give me another important piece of documentation
map was one
the invoice
the invoice
i'll pass it across
created
how about the user manual
well yes er well that's one i was after
there's two pieces that are missing
not including the user UNK
can't give you that one
two other useful pieces of documentation
what amount
no he he's said that one before
is there a design document
well may well be but er i wasn't after that has anybody think of anything
we only did it er seven minutes ago it shows you how quickly you forget
er list of the file names that's one of them and one of them open this to everybody anybody who can get it gets a point
what directories in it
no well maybe but er it wasn't what i was after
updated UNK
er well that's part of what's on the spreadsheet it's some sort of diagram
sorry
not exactly well not exactly
diagram representing the things that are in the system
folders
files is that what you said
i said folders actually
yeah files
well you already got one
well i don't think anybody got it really
there was too many
so let's see the left got seven that's nine and the right got er three four
who's that for
right thank you all very much for having formulas now
would you like to start off by telling us when you joined county council in which department
mm it was the eleventh of october nineteen thirty nine
mm
it was a UNK day or at least the old erm quarter day for paying rents and erm it was generally known in those days as muck spreading because erm it was usual time for erm the farm workers to get ready for the winter ploughing
anyway if i could just erm describe how i managed to get there in the first place which was all a matter of luck i suppose as much as anything erm i went to the east UNK schools for erm blind and deaf children at UNK on sea from nineteen twenty eight to nineteen thirty six erm in those days erm education for the er disabled er continued until sixteen
they always assumed that er the disabled were two years behind the normal child so that er
mm
we had to spend a couple of years erm longer at school
erm i never had any idea as to what i might do when i left school in fact erm apart from basket making and er one or two manual skills of that sort erm there wasn't much available
but erm it was suggested about a year or so before i left that i might take what was called the UNK scholarship to erm the royal college for the blind which in those days was at erm upper norwood s e nineteen and erm so erm i had no objections i didn't i didn't see any future at all in it anyway but erm i took this erm scholarship examination went up to the r n c to work erm some papers and to be interviewed and erm much to my surprise they erm offered me one of these UNK which was worth forty pounds a year for three years in the commercial department of the college which was an innovation really as erm primarily a college of music for erm blind students and erm so off i went to the r n c of sixteen and erm did my three year course and got erm some r s a certificates and erm was reasonably successful i suppose i perhaps i wasn't as UNK as i should have been
i was much more interested in football and cricket really but erm anyway i left in the july of nineteen thirty nine when things were getting a bit erm dubious in the international sphere and erm
mm
still had no prospects of employment and i don't think er my parents had any erm particular ideas and my father who worked for erm roads and bridges department was speaking to the chief clerk at that time that was er his name was in fact and erm he was a very sympathetic character and er he said he'd have a word with erm with somebody in the county council and erm see if they could find me employment as a UNK and erm using the argument of course that the education department had up to that time at the r n c erm paid the balance of the fees for my course erm i could just mention to you that the scholarship was worth forty pounds a year fee
full fees were a hundred pounds a year and erm the education department ha had assessed my father's contribution towards the fees at six shillings a week which was about fifteen pounds a year
they were paying something like forty five pounds a year for my training
well erm had a word with erm who was about oh fourth in line in the erm education hierarchy in those days and erm then spoke to who was the chief education officer and er i think they were a bit erm bit UNK about employing a blind UNK because erm it was something that they had never had any experience of but in the end they thought it was worth a try and er especially after supporting me at the college and erm also perhaps they had in mind that many of the erm employees would be leaving if war broke out and erm in fact by that time war had probably started
mm
but anyway erm it came as a bit of a shock to me when who was at that time the UNK adviser or UNK organiser as they used to call him turned up at home at UNK where we lived at the time and er said he'd come to collect my typewriter we had no notice of this anyway was erm a jolly old soul and erm he went off with my typewriter and erm shorthand machine and the next day my father brought me into ipswich and erm well i saw and did a bit of typing and erm that's how it all started
you were the first blind person to be employed in the county council
in the county council yes
mm well there have been subsequent erm employees of course but
mm
i felt that it was a bit of a responsibility to erm to justify the employment of
yes
erm a blind person
i also remember incidentally the first letter that i had to erm type a young chap who was erm shortly called up for service in the army came in and erm dictated a little letter to me to see how erm how i got on and erm it was a letter to parents in UNK whose daughter had just been er transferred to a grammar school and erm in those days of course the if the distance was more than three miles the education committee er provided a cycle and UNK and UNK and erm the object of the letter was to find out the child's inside leg measurement
well yes i wondered whether i'd got it right you know it sounded just a silly thing to ask and erm and i erm had to consider that probably asked whether i had erm made a mistake in my shorthand before i actually typed it but erm anyway they seemed erm reasonably satisfied and everybody was very kindly and erm UNK and
mm
and so i stayed there but erm travelling from UNK wasn't very easy of course that were
how did you travel
by bus mhm
and erm but erm even so getting to and from the bus was a bit of a problem unfortunately i've never had erm been one of these people who have got the nerve to erm go about a great deal by themselves and erm being up in london you know immediately before the war i had erm it wasn't very easy getting about so erm and erm i wasn't very
confident really
mm
but anyway erm people used to be very helpful and erm
mm
so i managed for a few weeks and then i went to lodge with my sister at UNK
mm
and from there of course the bus service was erm much better
they had two or three different bus services and erm the bus went past county hall so that it was quite
mm
quite easy well it was comparatively easy only trouble was of course that erm at night erm one had to go right down from county hall to UNK corner to get on the bus because they were so full by the time they got to county hall and erm so i used to walk down there with erm a chap from the education department who was in the works and stores a chap and erm he was quite helpful
mm you never had a guide dog
oh no
in fact there were very few guide dogs at that time and erm i've never felt that erm it's i mean maybe just my erm UNK really but i never wanted a dog lying about all day because once at the office i stayed put as it were until it was time to go home and i could have taken the dog i suppose during the lunch hour but i preferred that time to erm to reading
mm
and just relaxing and erm in any case as i say er guide dogs were few and far between at that time
mm
and i've never wanted one since because er luckily i've got erm my wife who we get about together
mm
what can you remember what your salary was when you
yes it's erm it was seventy five pounds a year at age nineteen
mm
and erm i actually received twenty seven and UNK a week to start with it was paid weekly but subsequently erm we went on to the monthly erm payments and er but that's what i had and er i used to pay my sister fifteen shillings a week for UNK
mm
but erm interestingly enough my salary until after the war was charged to erm civil defence
i think it was erm a bit of a UNK that erm i was extra to establishment really and i was only temporary on the temporary staff until erm well a year or so after the war when all these things were sort of sorted out and erm i was on the permanent
how many hours a week did you work
erm well
i think it was about forty four
mm
but of course erm as a sort of public to the er a gesture to the public erm but one stage during the war when things were getting a bit UNK on the war front it was decided that erm we should work extra hours as erm to show that we were pulling our weight so we used to instead of starting at nine o'clock until erm half past five and working on saturdays as well of course erm we had to start at half past eight and finish at six and it was a bit of a UNK really because nobody erm you know well the end of the half past five you were pretty well tired out so erm the rest of the time
mm
you were really kicking your UNK and erm quite apart from which in the winter time the er conditions were pretty UNK because they had the erm anti UNK over the windows and erm big blinds which had to be drawn as soon as it was UNK because er of course you weren't allowed to show a light and erm if that was it became really thick
mm
mm i don't think the cleaners were all that erm good at their job i mean they were er perhaps that's a bit unfair to them to say that because erm the collection of dust was erm pretty dreadful
mm
with all the books and files around and er it became anybody with any chest troubles erm
mm
found it v very difficult cos erm atmosphere as i say was erm really dreadful
mm
it got very hot and erm UNK and unpleasant
mm
so erm and that went on for i suppose till the end of the war when er when we had a reduction in hours again we went back to the normal nine till half past five
mm
mm we did have to UNK enough there was always a tradition when i started er of working on UNK erm an extra quarter of an hour because that was committee day
and erm i don't know what the idea really was i think it was possibly so that erm that people concerned with the committee meetings could erm sort themselves out and
mm
for a little more time to
this was just presumably education committee
yes it was just the education department
yes mm
at least as far as i can remember
mm
mm do you remember anything about the a r p during the war
oh yes its erm county hall of course was the county control centre for erm air raid precautions
mm
erm ca before i go on to that can i just erm tell you what erm where we worked
yes certainly sorry
erm the archway from st UNK is still there isn't it
mm yes
now just on the left as you go under the archway there was a small door
mm
i don't know whether it's still there but
yes
erm you went into the small door and then turned right
mm
there was erm men's UNK on the left hand side and then our enquiry office was immediately on the right hand side
you went a little farther along past erm 's room
being the chief clerk and then turned left and down quite a long corridor which in those days was erm UNK up with four by four timber posts because er presumably they thought if the county hall got a direct hit the ceiling might come down
but er they were a bit of a nuisance because more than once i must admit i erm i UNK with them which rather made me aware of their presence but anyway erm then just beyond i am sorry on the erm right hand side a little way down this corridor were the stairs up to the next floor which was in those days public health
mm
and right next to those were stairs down to the basement but they've still got the basement mm
yes that's right second floor is education now
is it
yes
oh yes because erm
i know it because i finished up erm then just beyond the erm the stairs down to the basement was arthur 's room
mm
and then
got the general office now
mm and then the next erm one down on the left was where i worked with erm a chap named tom
erm his he passed away s some years ago
erm interest interestingly enough erm UNK was very friendly with er UNK son kenneth who was erm planning officer in some area now sussex
mm
i think but continuing down the corridor erm which was all the education department you came to the UNK room right at the bottom of the corridor on the left
mm
and then erm turning right you went past the UNK and before you got to the door out into erm UNK street
mm
there was a large room which was the control room and er in there they had erm four three or four erm telephones which were UNK constantly for twenty four hours
mm
and they took messages from the erm various a r p points throughout the county
we're talking about east suffolk of course
yes
not erm the whole of suffolk and erm the county hall staff as a whole was divided into six shifts erm and each shift was on duty for twenty four hours a day for twenty four hours on
mm
and erm so that erm the shift that was on say sunday would erm be on again on the saturday and so it erm you know you got a different day
mm
each week and erm the shift which was on duty say on sunday would have monday off they were they could erm go home on monday
mm
and erm the six shifts had erm controller and generally speaking these were heads of department the erm the mr who was chief education officer at that time
incidentally he wasn't known as chief education officer he was secretary for education he only became chief education officer after the war but erm he was the controller of shift e and most of the education staff were on shift e
it so happened that erm tom tha who i was working with see he was on shift er shift f and er there was always a bit of UNK between the various shifts as er as to erm you know who did the better job and all this sort of thing
they were always erm making UNK comments about the entries in the in the log book which the UNK had to keep erm of the messages that came through
mm
but erm they erm they had their meals in the canteen which was one of the committee rooms UNK for that purpose and erm i think erm the UNK younger people used to quite enjoy it really i mean they used t ha
what did you think of it
well i was never on it i was exempt and erm the younger people were they had the opportunity of not erm being on the shifts
oh i see it wasn't compulsory then
it wasn't compulsory er erm up to the age of about eighteen i think
mm
i think erm you know there were one or two sort of erm UNK meetings and that sort of thing
yes
as you could imagine because erm they had all the whole building to erm to UNK about in
yes
and er i think the younger people quite enjoyed it but the older ones of course found it bit of a bind er particularly after erm the sort of UNK
mm
wore off a bit i mean there was erm everybody was feeling very UNK at the beginning of the war but after four or five years the erm UNK wore off
mm
and erm
was there any financial incentive for
not re no
but erm as far as financial incentive goes erm it was about a year or so after erm i started there i think when er they introduced it the erm war bonus which was a supplement to normal salaries
mm
and erm as usual this was erm this created a bit of controversy because erm temporary staff according to the reading of the minute didn't er weren't entitled to war bonus because erm they'd been appointed at a certain salary and er that was that and er but in the end we managed to get our war bonus as well so we were on equal UNK with the with the other staff
mm
but erm there were one or two little UNK of that sort where erm temporary staff were erm regarded as a bit er second rate citizens
mm
and erm with all the erm younger men and some of the girls of course er volunteered for the services
mm
er we had quite a number of married women coming in to er to work as part of their war effort and erm so that there was quite there was quite erm quick turnover of staff at that time
mm
and erm to be fair to them i don't think that erm some of them were particularly interested in their work and er
mm
the war effort was really erm a way of getting out of erm away from home because the women were erm found themselves left on their own
mm
cos the men had gone to the services
mm
but erm yes that was the erm that was the a r p erm
mm
story
yes
bu coming on now to your relation working relationship with west suffolk i mean did you have much contact with staff in west suffolk or
very little really erm we had contact with other authorities of course in the course in erm er particularly in connection with evacuation erm evacuation took up erm quite a lot of staff and time at that er particularly initially because erm suffolk was in a peculiar position or at least the east suffolk was erm at the beginning of the war of course erm east suffolk was an evacuation er was erm a reception area
mm
and erm there were all sorts of funny stories and erm some of them not quite so funny about erm the way that the children and erm mothers from UNK came by sea and landed at felixstowe
yes i've heard about that yes
and erm it was really remarkable because er i mean presumably the germans were told about it and erm kept u boats and the from shipping out the er
mm
out the area but to bring them from by sea from UNK to erm felixstowe is a bit
by rail
yes
mm
and erm then of course when they reached felixstowe everything was a bit UNK because th they had to sleep on the floor in the schools down there
mm
and then they were UNK to an UNK crossroads where erm a rather UNK erm UNK chief UNK officer then had to decide where the buses had got to go to
and so you know looking back on it was all rather funny but erm it wasn't at the time of course particularly for the children and erm mothers
did evacuation just take place over two or three days or
yes mm
mm
but erm it had sorted itself out after well more or less after a week or two a lot of the UNK of course didn't stay very long they went back home because erm i know mother had a little boy from erm UNK when we lived at UNK and er he went back after a while the mother used to come down and visit him from time to time they were very came from very poor circumstances and the
mm
mother used to spend most of her time in the local when she did come and er
mm
in the end she took the children home with her erm it was so different from what they'd been used to in those erm
mm
east well in the east end particularly UNK was not much better
mm
but erm anyway the erm children were absorbed into the schools of some sort
mm
but erm then became we got round to the erm question of getting the children into similar schools to the ones that they'd been in and erm i came into this in fact i came into all sorts of things erm well by accident then i suppose anyway not for any other reason but erm mr erm who was the secretary for education he had a personal assistant a chap named erm he was a very UNK chap erm and er a rather UNK bit of an UNK really because erm he'd been erm he'd trained as a doctor and erm he'd left the course before completing it
then he went erm into the navy for a short time and for some unknown reason he managed to get out of the navy and came as mr 's personal assistant and erm one of his jobs was to erm get these pe children sorted out and i used to write no end of letters for him to erm places like erm UNK and UNK and mainly the northern UNK of london erm about certain children who had been attending central schools which were something which were something that erm east suffolk couldn't offer and erm trying to decide whether they ought to go to grammar school or one of the area schools as they we then were
mm
in suffolk and erm most complicated situations we got into
mm
the erm UNK actually was dealt with by a section connected with the er county accountants department
mm
which subsequently became the UNK and erm they used to erm collect the contributions from parents and there again i got involved because they were short of UNK at one time
mm
and erm we had to write to parents and er collect contributions which were UNK
mm
how large were the were the classes with these UNK of all these di did it boost up the numbers in the
yes somehow they used to accommodate them but
mm
you see it wasn't very long after that they were deciding somewhere in er erm i think whitehall that erm suffolk should become an evacuation area
mm
so that at that point erm we ceased to receive UNK and felixstowe went to UNK felixstowe grammar school
i am talking about grammar schools actually because erm the work that i was concerned with was in the secondary education which erm translated really means meant grammar school education so that the schools that erm i had most contact with were the grammar schools
felixstowe went to UNK and UNK
erm UNK enough UNK grammar went to UNK
erm UNK which was the only other one which UNK in total they went as a school rather than a you know the individual children
erm UNK went to UNK in erm nottinghamshire
mm how we how were the children transported
just
oh they went erm
by train
they went by train yes
mm
and erm the they went as a unit staff as most of the staff as well went
mm
with them and one or two remained behind but er yes it was interesting how erm i always found it rather funny that er you had to go to UNK to UNK to UNK to school
and erm if i could just mention that we had eight grammar schools there was erm in UNK order they were UNK er UNK sir john the man er bungay grammar which had er small boarding house
erm felixstowe UNK oh sorry i missed out UNK grammar school which was the really famous one
mm
mm fe felixstowe grammar school UNK and mills grammar school UNK and UNK and UNK
mm
UNK was by far the biggest erm and UNK had a peculiar sort of administrative set up because they were what was described as erm a divisional executive and erm they had powers over their own committees apart from higher education which in modern UNK is further education
we used to call it higher education and erm so we had to deal with the UNK grammar school in the same way as we did with the other schools and also with the erm technical institute which was at UNK that was the only erm purpose built erm centre for further education in the in the county at that time
mm
ipswich of course was a separate power we had nothing to do with ipswich
mm
the erm UNK technical institute was actually in UNK road and that got a direct hit
mm
er luckily as far as i know nobody was erm nobody was erm nobody was killed
there may have been one or two injured
mm
but the principal of the technical institute at UNK was quite a character a mrs a miss g c and i remember it was the day after the erm the bombing and the building was pretty well UNK and er miss rung up and said she'd got an idea she said erm how about UNK a bus a double UNK bus i could have my classes in the bus and erm
it c it could er be driven around when there are air raids to get out of danger
but she was a marvellous person erm
mm
erm it may be that erm because of my generation but you don't get the same sort of personalities nowadays as you did in those days erm mr for instance he was he was a most UNK sort of erm fellow of what one would describe as a real gentleman mm mind you he used to have his UNK at times but
mm
he was erm a very fine man really i suppose
mm
i remember erm one morning he came in a bit of erm he was obviously very annoyed about something and er when he was in those sort of UNK he used to expect erm all sort of reports to be presented and er he wanted er statistics which nobody else had ever thought of and erm arthur who as i have s UNK before was erm really my sort of guardian angel he sort of er did a great deal for me
he was erm the chap sort of chap who was erm who was able to calm things down he er
mm
he had a way with him and he was got on very well with mr and er he told us afterwards that erm the whole trouble was that the children's baths had UNK that morning
oh dear
and it turned mr into a bit of a UNK but erm
mm
i don't suppose you'd er get that sort of relationship nowadays and of course it was during the war when people er the fact that erm there was a war on erm was a UNK down or up or at least a UNK of people's situations they
mm
they were all in it together and er there was perhaps not quite so much erm side
mm
as erm as they would otherwise be
so there was more sort of community spirit
sort of
yes that sort of thing yes
yes i well remember er i use when i was staying down at UNK there was erm a lady there who worked in the UNK department who ca who herself was UNK from london and er i used to catch the same bus with her but she never would speak to me erm and erm one morning er she lived down at UNK and one morning they had some erm er german planes over UNK and they were doing some machine UNK and that sort of thing and erm and we met at the bus stop and she was full of it and erm that sort of broke the ice it was
it was really amazing
mm
how erm gonna just because there'd been this UNK incident it made her UNK her tongue and er
mm
because if i might say so disabled people were treated UNK in those days they are not er erm people i think were a bit er UNK about making contact with them and erm a lot of people wouldn't erm you know give you a hand if you were
oh really
crossing a road
and that sort of thing
oh really that's a sort of discrimination
it's much better now er erm you know people have become a little more understanding of course
mm
mm must have been very difficult then to get around sometimes then
oh well it was yes and erm you know if people are friendly and er talk to you and you know even if you don't want help if they offer it's always appreciated
mm
erm
would you like to say a little bit more about the actual work of your department
yes erm arthur as i have mentioned earlier was erm the fourth in command as it were and erm if i can just sort of go down the erm the UNK order mm leslie was the chief education officer
in those days called the secretary
he had a personal assistant who er well didn't come into the UNK really erm because he merely erm was filled in when mr couldn't er attend various functions
then the assistant secretary for education was erm a very interesting chap erm he was a mr a o d and erm he was he had erm an UNK school background he hadn't a degree or any qualification but he'd been in so long that er he'd worked his way up to erm s erm to assistant secretary for education and he was a jolly chap and erm and he produced a dictionary of erm of the suffolk dialect which has became quite erm quite a classic work really
mm
and then erm next in order was erm UNK who was the chief clerk and then there were a number on level UNK there was erm UNK in charge of works and stores arthur who was erm as i've said was my erm the guardian and erm in the finance section was charlie and erm then there was the typing pool
erm when i first started erm i think the UNK felt that erm as an ordinary UNK i ought to er be in the typing pool but the i'm glad i didn't because i don't think i would have felt very happy amongst er
other women
yes so many ladies i d i don't know how many there were about erm five or six i think
mm
so i've shared a room with erm this chap tom who was er he had been in the first world war and er though he seemed old to me at the time i suppose he was probably in his thirties and erm he joined the home guard and erm lived because he was bombed out where he lived in he moved out to UNK had accommodation out there and er he was in the unit at UNK and so that used to take up quite a bit of his time and other erm members of staff were of course also had fire watching and erm various civil defence activities quite apart from the work on the a r p shifts
mm
arthur erm he was exempt from erm er these sort of civil defence activities i think bit of in the road where he lived
yeah that is
mm
but erm he'd always had a UNK heart and erm at times he wasn't at all well
mm
mm it's interesting t to think that he's now in his eighties and er
he's survived all the er heart condition that he ever did have
mm
and in fact er UNK he was much erm much fitter than he was when i first knew him
mm
but he was a very kindly man and er he introduced erm me to a lot of things which i wouldn't otherwise have erm been able to do or at least i wouldn't have g had the erm been invited to do
mm
and the work of our little section erm which UNK of tom myself arthur and a young girl erm of about fifteen sixteen
erm was the erm running of these eight grammar schools erm evening UNK erm tom was er sort of commander in chief of evening UNK
mm
erm then there were all sorts of odds and ends which i think very largely were erm the result of mr wanting to erm build up a name for his suffolk doing rather more than perhaps some other authorities
mm
and er particularly in the field of agriculture erm we had erm an agricultural organiser and erm he ran experimental UNK in erm places like UNK and UNK market
we also had an agricultural UNK organiser erm with experimental UNK and he went round to schools as well and er
mm
looked after erm the work done in school gardens
mm
and erm one of er of the various committees that erm arthur was in charge of was an agricultural sub committee which in turn had a sub committee called the poultry sub committee
now erm for some reason or other we were responsible for the UNK poultry breeding station scheme which was erm initiated by the department of education or the ministry of education as it was then at that stage
erm sorry of agriculture not education
mm
and erm these were poultry UNK be erm scattered all over the count er county who yes the erm UNK poultry breeding station scheme was erm initiated by the ministry of agriculture and erm there were a number of farms scattered all over the county erm where they were open to inspection and erm we had erm had a mrs who went round and UNK the UNK and erm they had to UNK each year to erm sustain their UNK
mm
and erm you'd be surprised really how much er correspondence and er
erm arguing and er they was going on about this because if mrs went to a farm and then said that she saw some hens there that didn't look particularly fit erm and said they'd got to be UNK and if the farmer thought otherwise then we got into all sorts of UNK because we knew nothing about poultry
mrs er presumably did
mm
and erm there was no final erm sort of er judgment to be had so erm then we had to call meetings of this little sub committee who finally made up their minds and i remember typing reports quite long reports about erm UNK island UNK er crossed with light sussex and light sussex crossed with er brown and erm i knew precious little about poultry at that time
don't know very much now but er it er became most UNK and i used to and i used to like
meetings with the poultry sub committee which then reported to the agriculture sub committee
mm
and that in turn of course reported to erm to the full education committee
another UNK of this erm little secondary education section that erm arthur was in charge of was the library and erm the library sub committee he erm had to look out for much to the UNK of erm bill who was the UNK at the time
mm
because erm bill thought that er really the library was his pigeon loft er not arthur 's
mm
erm so that erm there were all sorts of erm little by products from the agriculture and library and that sort of thing that er we had to erm deal with
who actually was responsible for buying the books in the library
oh the UNK was
UNK mm
but he had to report of course to the library sub committee
mm
and arthur was erm sort of clerk to the library sub committee
yes
but erm mr took t felt a bit i think about er
having to go through another person
mm
but erm he was alright very friendly really
mm
and erm in fact we were looking erm my wife found a copy of the UNK anniversary erm of the county council the other day
we were looking through that and erm mr was the first er county UNK in east suffolk
mm
and we knew him quite well because er before we moved my parents moved to UNK we've lived at UNK and he lived erm well next door but one to us and er so we knew mr quite well
mm
erm the work that i became as it happened mostly concerned with was the erm UNK of major UNK as they were then called which subsequently became called county awards and er which were UNK in those days only at universities
mm
and erm er we had er each there was a ministry of education form to be completed a statistical return and erm when i first started there were no more than seventeen university students with these major UNK
now it doesn't mean to say of course that there were only seventeen people in
no
east suffolk at university because a lot of erm the more well to do parents would erm would probably turn up their UNK at the small amount of
mm
of the value of the scholarship and not bother to apply in the first place but the major scholarship was worth at its maximum a hundred and fifty pounds
mm
a year for three years
mm
and fifty pounds of that was UNK which had to be UNK at the end of the course in sixteen equal quarterly UNK
oh i see
so that erm the collection of the loan was erm quite a major operation in itself because though erm there was a form of agreement and each agreement had to have two UNK and erm you could always go to the UNK if the student after the course
mm
erm failed to pay up it erm there were all sorts of circumstances which erm made it difficult for the student or difficult for the student or there were certain students of course who just erm tried to avoid paying altogether
mm
and erm at that time of course when we got to that sort of crisis we erm had to send a memo over to the er clerk of the council's department er
the clerk of the council is now of course the chief executive
mm
and erm he would take er legal action or at least that was the idea we hardly ever got any erm any change out of the le legal department and as often as not it was written off
mm probably cost as much to get the money back
oh yes but erm this we found wa always was the case with the er county council legal department that er by the time they got round to it the people had either gone abroad or something had happened er
mm
so it was written off in the end
mm
er the most interesting case erm i remember was a chap who erm having completed his course erm joined the r a f and erm he was missing at UNK when they had the rather UNK attempt at landing at UNK during the war and er but he was never erm posted as erm having died and erm it was years afterwards it was in the nineteen fifties in fact before we could get the department of education to agree to the loan being written off because erm obviously he was by that time he had to be assumed as
mm
dead and not just missing
mm
but erm another funny story that er always sticks in my mind is er when we sent UNK to the UNK department and there was only the UNK department they were they were trying to erm improve their public image as
we were told because of the shortage of paper we were told only to use UNK papers er paper that had already been used for letters or UNK when writing to the UNK department and erm we erm used to get the UNK paper that we could and then you had to UNK it and type it erm without too much space and erm that went over to the UNK department then erm when it got over th oh sorry you had to trim off the edges erm so that there was no spare paper left around the memo so that er you know there was just this little bit of paper with the
yes
message on it or the er instruction on it
mm
and then when it got over to the UNK department they used to stick it on another piece of paper so that they could put it on the file
and er that may sound er a bit exaggerated but i can assure you that's what happened that er to go to be able to file these little UNK of paper they had to stick it on another sheet
yes
it was rather funny
do you remember the introduction of sort of computers or any sort of UNK
not erm not within the time which we are talking about really
no
this was erm well we were at county hall of course and er subsequently we erm they built this what was described as a derelict aircraft carrier and
mm
and er we moved over there because erm the department was splitting at the UNK really because immediately there was erm the war was over and there were all sorts of plans for erm for development and that sort of thing and erm as i've already mentioned there were two only two graduates in the whole of the education department who was mr and er his personal assistant and erm then after the war there were three graduates appointed all of them from erm ex service men there was arthur who was erm lieutenant commander in the navy there was erm UNK i can't remember his christ proper christian name
he was in the r a f erm and then there was a chap named harold who was lieutenant colonel from the army
erm he subsequently went to erm UNK as chief education officer
mm
but erm and these people were assigned erm three separate sections erm harold for instance he took over further education which was a term which hadn't been erm was not an accepted term in those days because we'd always er referred to it as higher education
mm
and UNK was erm dealt with schools and erm er no i'm sorry arthur dealt with schools
UNK had a very special job he erm he was in charge of the post war planning and erm he spent no end of time and er a great deal of research having er committee member er committee meetings to do with the setting up of county colleges
mm
and erm the UNK of erm secondary education which all UNK of course really from the nineteen forty four act
mm
yes
and erm er in the end of course hardly any of it was implemented
we never did get erm any county colleges
mm
funds were limited for school buildings
we er yes we erm one thing that did happen of course was that the area schools as they were called in those days became erm described as modern schools
mm
and erm they was erm quite funny really because erm UNK school was then UNK senior school erm was on the black nineteen twenty six UNK of schools erm for erm closing and er erm UNK somewhere
mm
but er under the nineteen forty four act UNK senior school then became UNK modern school and we thought we thought that the silly term to go to a school which in nineteen twenty six had been er
on the UNK
mm
because there was erm before the war there was a UNK of schools which were due for UNK reorganization and erm
mm
UNK
can you remember where any of the others were on the UNK
er no that was er erm most of most of the UNK had been dealt with erm it had been a fair amount of erm reorganization and er UNK
mm
but erm
course it was the UNK act of nineteen forty four which set up this three stage
it was yes
national ladder
there was grammar erm secondary grammar secondary technical and secondary modern
mm
but there again secondary technical erm really didn't get off the ground
mm
erm there were some erm secondary technical erm facilities of course at one or two of the schools before the war
erm they had a machine quite advanced machine shop at the UNK grammar school and er interestingly enough that became er used whilst the grammar school was UNK as a training centre for erm
er one of the members of staff of the UNK grammar school a chap named johnny erm was in charge of his trainees and erm there again erm arthur and our section became responsible for erm all this in service training for er women mainly because the men of course had joined up and erm the used to come in quite often and er he got used to get so upset because he couldn't erm he got at cross purposes with some of these ladies
and erm he was always talking about erm different types of UNK and UNK and things like that and er none of us had any idea what he was
talking about it was far too technical for us but
erm arthur used to listen and in the end er i think johnny went off you know satisfied that somebody had listened to him
but erm that was erm financed of course by the ministry of labour at erm as the erm education department were responsible for the general administration of it
mm
and erm UNK market had erm machine centre erm that was used during the war for erm certain courses er particularly for erm tractor drivers they used to er have a week's course they had to apply to the education committee and er we got these applications in and erm they spent a week at UNK market then in they used to stay in UNK if they came from great distances and erm they would learn about the maintenance of erm of UNK and er i suppose it's quite a good thing really because er it was difficult to get any repairs done in those days
mm
and er that was one of tom 's extras because i could very well remember erm we had very little erm time off at christmas and there was one year that erm we just had the christmas day and erm tom had this meeting on the christmas eve to decide who should erm attend the next week's tractor course and erm everybody was sort of feeling in the sort of christmas spirit and
mm
er perhaps tom himself was erm not really concentrating very much but i know when we came back after the christmas day the boxing day that is erm tom was quite UNK as to what had gone on the UNK on the christmas eve so i remember we c we put our heads together and erm came to erm some arrangement as to who should be invited for this next tractor course and nothing was ever said so i expect the right people went after all but erm it's funny how when he was
mm
a bit UNK and i think everybody else was er
a bit UNK as to what was going on the christmas eve
mm
the erm education for the forces was another erm
oh yes you mentioned that
another UNK of course and erm there again erm mr who er kept a finger in a lot of pies he erm with the w e a of course and erm the cambridge extra UNK board of studies
he was very friendly with erm who was in charge of the extra UNK board and erm then possibly because of this connection erm we were asked by the erm ministry of defence to provide lectures and courses for erm units of h m forces stationed in the area and erm so a panel of UNK was erm formed and erm they used to go out the units used to have their own education officers usually a sergeant or perhaps a second lieutenant and erm they used to come into the office and say that they'd like somebody to go out to their UNK unit or a unit stationed somewhere out in the sticks and er lecture on this that or the other and erm we were supposed to try and fix them up and erm the panel erm it had quite a number of erm people on it that erm i can't remember who they all were i know that erm you'd hardly believe this but there was a chap named mr and another chap named mr
yes
and they used to erm they were UNK
and they used to go out to these units and take slides and er lecture to the to the men about birds and er natural history and mr himself he was famous for three different lectures that he used to offer
one was from erm from UNK to UNK and the other one was from UNK to UNK because he was in the first world war i think he was serving with the UNK regiment and erm i don't know how he managed this i never did understand
anyway he was a captain in the army and he had these slides of erm his journeys erm er in UNK and he used to show this with er great UNK not only to erm units of h m forces but also to the er shifts the a r p shifts he used to UNK them by
mm
showing these films
then he had another one about er UNK who was erm i never did know very much about UNK but she was erm a lady of some UNK in er in egypt a at erm either just before or just after the first world war
then erm of course there were people who UNK on er gate courses on UNK german there was a friend of doctor who used to go out and to units and erm give lessons in german and erm there were there was a unit of polish erm soldiers stationed they had an UNK train believe it or not which was erm parked at UNK and erm every so often particularly at night they used to UNK up and down the line
now what they what they were supposed to do erm i never did know but there were quite a number of these er men who lived in this train and they had a lieutenant who's quite a UNK chap by all accounts he used to come into the office a chap named lieutenant and erm this was one of the things that landed on joyce 's plant er plate and er she used to meet these education officers and arrange for courses and in the er in lieutenant 's case of course there was er instruction in english which erm UNK who was a headmaster of er area school he undertook classes for these polish chaps but er so often of course these erm these units were only in the area for a limited space of time so you couldn't arrange anything very comprehensive
mm
erm i remember one er i think it was UNK hall or some big house at UNK where erm they had erm a UNK for UNK i think they were probably in training there and erm their education officer came in and wanted us to arrange a course erm and she wanted it described as a school for UNK
about erm you know early marriage and all this sort of thing and erm that was a bit of a UNK because erm nobody knew really what to
mm
lay on for them and erm also of course erm i know people like erm mr and mr they used to be picked up by er by some chaps in a UNK or army truck
they used to go all the way out to these erm UNK stations and erm they used to very often they were situated in a in a sort of pit in a dug out and erm when they arrived of course er the education officer had forgotten to tell the troops that there was a lecture that they were supposed to attend and er nobody turned up
they used to get erm these people on the election panel used to be paid a couple of UNK a time for their lectures
mm
but they were always a bit erm unhappy when they gave up so much time and er there was nobody there to listen to them when they got there
a bit unfortunate really
erm another lecturer that i can remember was erm a chap named who was head at UNK r e y school near UNK
he was very interested in UNK and he used to lecture on the stars and that sort of thing
erm of course it has to be remembered that all these lectures or at least most of them were erm voluntary UNK and the men used to turn up because they were told to and er whether or not they showed little or no interest very often and it was all erm well a bit of a waste of time
mm
mm
what would you say were some of your UNK memories of your time spent with the county council
erm ah now that erm i think i was reasonably happy most of the time erm i know if i can sort of look at the other side of the coin erm i became a bit UNK as the war went on and er obviously it wasn't going to last much longer
mm
er men were coming young men were coming out of the forces and er they wanted their jobs back and er i began to wonder what was going to happen to me if because i was on the temporary staff and erm there was no guarantee that i'd be able to stay erm and then of course erm i was thinking of probably getting married and erm er the salary at that stage wasn't er wasn't very much to get married on
i can't remember wha exactly what it was but er it erm had gone up a little since erm since i first started
but i certainly remember going to mr and erm i felt very bold when i went and said that er you know sooner or later i'd erm i'd get married and er set up a home and that sort of thing and erm i said er what are the prospects of erm getting a reasonable salary
he was then on a f salary of about four hundred a year i think
so it gives you some idea of what the salaries were like in those days
mm
he said erm well what would you think was reasonable
er what would you be able to manage on sort of thing and i said about two hundred and fifty a year and er you know that was quite realistic in those days but erm obviously it wouldn't go very far now would it
no
it wouldn't
but erm if i could just erm expand a bit on this erm on this erm major awards er because it was quite interesting particularly because of the present er uncertainty about what's going to happen about UNK grants
mm
erm just er when i first started i've already mentioned i think that erm there are about seventeen erm students at universities with major UNK within the maximum of this erm hundred and fifty pounds a year and erm we inter had to interview all these erm applicants erm which wasn't a very UNK task because there weren't so many of them but
mm
we had to get erm reports from the examining boards erm on their performances in the higher school certificate exam erm they had to take two main subjects and two UNK and according to the recommendations of the examining boards then by and large they er received a major award or they didn't but erm there was a UNK prize for those who didn't erm get a major award because there were a few what they called special loans erm offered by the education committee
these were fifty pounds a year
mm
and but of course they were loans and had to be UNK at the end of the course
er teacher training erm which was then of course a two year course
erm they were not interviewed they if they were accepted by a teacher training college they received erm a maximum of fifty pounds a year but erm as far as i can remember there was no loan erm element in that but i m i may be wrong because er but i never can remember erm writing to recover loans from the training college student
mm
but erm after the erm forty four act of course things began to er develop quite quickly and erm we then had what we called erm UNK awards or minor awards we called them in the first place
mm
erm for various things and er one of the earliest er minor awards which the education committee had was to erm a girl from ruth who wanted to take erm a course for erm the n p s the UNK er UNK
mm
exams and erm she was about the first i think and there was erm somebody else who wanted to take a course in erm youth leadership but erm very quickly the numbers increased till the time i left of course we were dealing with thousands
mm
literally thousands and the expenditure had gone up to well over a million pounds
mm
but that was er not until UNK oh at the time of reorganization that we of course the numbers increased dramatically then with erm when we took the borough students over and er also those from west suffolk
mm
but i erm became responsible for erm awards
well i say responsible i was really responsible to erm the e what we c that were then known as assistant education officers
erm but erm i had go was allowed a great deal of UNK
i don't know whether people thought that erm if they UNK with me i wouldn't er i wouldn't play or what it was but then anyway erm when the war ended as i say i got a bit erm worried and erm i then got in touch with er mr who was then er then taken over from sir UNK clerk of the council or chief executive and erm he suggested that erm i might take a course for the erm home workers diploma for the blind which erm was well it was a sort of specialized er social worker really
they used to have people UNK for erm blind individuals
mm
so erm both my wife
my wife used to work in the education department incidentally
and erm we both decided we'd take this diploma and er mr erm in his UNK let us erm go off to the workshops and do some practical work and erm my wife lived at stow UNK and i was lodging in ipswich and er he even allowed us to study in the in the erm enquiry office in the evenings
i think he was a bit UNK about that because he didn't know whether erm he was doing right by allowing us to be together in the
enquiry office after office hours anyway
erm we did er the studies and erm too i took the diploma
phil my wife erm had UNK just at the time of the exam
so she didn't
take it in the end but erm anyway i got this diploma and er then i was quite annoyed because erm social services then erm pu the welfare for the blind was dealt with by the public health department and a vacancy occurred in the public health department for erm blind welfare officer or at least a welfare officer for the blind and i applied for it and erm they er didn't make an appointment because they didn't er get in other applications but they di they didn't offer me the appointment
so i had a bit of an up and a UNK and er erm created quite a UNK with erm mr the clerk of the council professor
i thought this was very unfair and erm but then luckily really because erm i don't think i would have let the job would have been difficult even if er i'd had my wife as for UNK me around to these various people
erm i then erm sent a memo to the t erm county er clerk of the council and erm applied for UNK and erm so i was then taken i was put on the permanent staff
taken off the UNK grade on to what was then called higher clerical and erm given the job of erm looking out for erm er awards er both university and teacher training and
erm the minor awards or UNK awards as they became and that's erm i was given this job and er that's how it's built up really over the years
mm
it started from something erm quite small and finished up with something fairly large really
yes
and it's be it's been a very fascinating job because in the course of the years obviously one has met erm parents and students and UNK and erm university tutors we've got to know quite well because erm there were all sorts of problems as you probably know with
mm
in these establishments
mm
and er the students themselves have all sorts of problems and UNK of course we had erm a great number of mature students
mm
and er as often as not they were ladies who had been separated or divorced and er they had all a lot of sort of UNK problems and it became almost a we welfare of job
as much as erm a grant situation
mm
the grants the of the grants of course increased over the years and the main thing about erm awards of course was to assess them and this is something which erm i always felt a bit self conscious about because we had this erm very comprehensive form where parents and erm oh individuals when they were the students themselves had to complete and give very precise details of income
mm
and financial circumstances and erm this was something of course that i had to leave to the people who were working got himself another job
so that erm nobody really kn was the most UNK job when you had to erm assess literally thousands of students in the end
mm
and erm i always felt sorry for the people working in inland revenue because er they were they were having to do it all the time
mm
but erm we never used to get the new rates of grants and the new regulations out from the erm ministry until oh early june and all this work had to be done erm obviously before the
mm
new term st new academic year started
mm
and everybody was UNK to know how much they were going to get and er we were always trying to head them off by saying that er theirs was next on the list and er
mm
so sometimes students would get their grants quite late
we always tried to get some payment to them before a term started
mm
erm it never with reorganization it was a bit of a problem because erm i well remembers too just after reorganization the county UNK took all the telephones off the hook so there was no communication between our department and theirs
so you couldn't tell whether their whether a UNK cheque had gone out or not
oh dear
and there was no contact at all department er it got really UNK
and erm of course computers didn't help in the slightest because er i think the er i may be wrong about this but as i understood it erm the computer UNK worked for west suffolk but at the time of reorganization he'd got himself another job
so that erm nobody really knew how to program the erm
the thing and in those days they used to have the UNK cards you know erm they still have this
yes
and erm they used to have to send these cards to birmingham to be processed and there used to be a van going out from er UNK house to birmingham
i think two or three times a week
and erm they had er a lot of girls over at birmingham who used to prepare these cards for the computer
mm
but erm it was erm rather silly really
right well thank you mr it's been a long and varied career
it's erm
UNK
it hasn't really been erm all that UNK but at least by staying put rather than going off at i i'd thought about at one time erm UNK to new UNK but er erm when i found out what the conditions were like out there i decided to stay and er
mm
we had the ch young children then so that erm all in all i am not sorry that things turned out as they did because erm as luck would have it you know
mm
it's er worked quite well
mm
and er i managed to get er do forty odd years and erm now i'm quite happy on the pension that they gave me
you retired in nineteen eighty
er july nineteen eighty yes
mm
i could have gone on of course erm longer but er i wanted to do erm i've always wanted to write and so i've er been able to do that since
mm
and erm my wife who's a teacher had erm a very UNK experience just after i retired so it was erm it was as well that i retired when i did because i was then able to stay at home and er
yes
see after her
yes
that about su UNK it up i think
right well thank you very much mr
so what job is it you do in the factory
oh i get the samples now
i used to be a UNK worked a machine but i got moved to the samples about six years ago
aha
have you worked in b m k in a long while
er forty years
forty years
mhm
is this was this your first job
or did you
yes
no i came straight here from school
mhm you have a wealth of experience then
so have you enjoyed working here
do you like it
yes i liked the UNK
mhm
and i like the job i've got now
mhm
but er
so what d what is your job now involve what do you do
we cut up small pieces of carpet into different sizes and we've got about fifteen different folders
mhm
for each range of carpet
we stick it on with a hot glue gun
mhm
and it gets sent out to all the representatives and all the shops
mhm and is it basically kind of regular hours you do
you don't do shift work
no we do overtime but no shift work
mhm
and what first attracted you to the job
did you have er relatives that worked here or was it the pay or
when i left school i had an aunt
aha
in the factory
and that was basically how you got
yes
do you have a lot of friends
it used to be quite a custom that you know that
aha
the families just followed
mhm
one another in
mhm
into the works and that and that was how i started
mhm
it's not so much like that now
no it's not
no it's not
so do you have a lot of friends in b m k you know over the years have you made any firm UNK
oh aye you do
mhm
you get attached especially at the UNK because you're working in twos
oh i see
and over the years if you've been working with the same partner
aha
but my friend UNK is still a UNK and we still work together too
mhm
mm
oh aye you get to know people that you've for years and years
have you any nicknames for each other
er no i don't think so
really
i know some of them do but
not ones that you talk about anyway
does do has technology affected your job
have they brought any in any machines that change things
er not in my job no
no
no
in other parts of the factory maybe
aye but not where i work
not where you work
everything's you just done with your hand
mhm
aye
cheaper
are there no union any more
we're in a union oh i'm in a union
i pay union every week but er
which union is it that you're in
it'll be the like the carpet general workers in carpet industry
yes aha
mhm
aha
but er never have i seen anybody for it
no
i just joined it after we came over but
mhm
i know a lot have pulled out of it
mhm
mhm
mm why is that
do they think it's useless
a lot do think it's useless
mhm
but there again if there ever was a strike or that you've a wee bit protection
aha
mm
so you have
what do feel about the UNK to non union and these new committees that they've now set up
is it a big difference or
oh it's just a fact now you've just have to go and do as you're told
mhm
i mean you if you're sent to do a certain job now you've just got to go and do it
mhm
years ago that just wouldn't have been
the idea of changing a light bulb years ago
really
i mean if it had been an UNK job and
they had quite strong union years ago
oh aye oh aye just wouldn't have got given these jobs years ago
aha
but now everybody just kind of UNK in and gets on with it
mhm
so they do
so how do you find er arrangements things do you think the women are satisfied with the kind of provisions that there are made for them the like of maternity leave and pay and things like that health and safety
och i think so aye i think they are
it's
because er i mean you they still get their maternity leave
mhm
and they've got to have their job kept open for them
is that right
oh that's good quite
aha mhm the job's got to be there for them up till twenty six weeks i think
so you feel quite secure
oh i think so
and er are there any opportunities like to come back and work part time if you've got children
no we don't have a lot of part UNK
they have recently started
in this factory here they do a UNK shift
mhm
i think it's at the picking
mhm
but er not that factory over there they don't
mhm
erm so do you have a family
yes i've got two daughters
and do you how do you organize things like looking after your family will everybody muck in or
well they're all married aye they've all grown up you see
grown up now
mhm
when you were working here did you always kind of
when i started at first erm
i just de depended on my mother
mhm
because i had some personal problems at the start and the two girls were small when i come working
mhm
but my mother was there
mhm
and then they've grew up now
oh that's good
cos one got married in december oh the oldest one's still in the in the house
aha
just having me that we manage fine
and what do your daughters do they work
er UNK but she's not working just now
mhm
and UNK works at the airport
mhm
at UNK
so you wouldn't encourage them to work in work in here
och it's been a good job to me
aha
mm
i mean and when i was a UNK i really enjoyed it because i had job satisfaction at the UNK
aha
with nice carpets and
aha
it's good to know they're maybe still lying on somebody's floor
do you think there is a lot of that people are quite proud of the work they're putting in
not so much now
no
no
in the past
mhm
mhm
mhm don't have the same pride now
why do you think that is
i don't know it's i think it's now jus just a job now you know it's
mhm
just
mhm
specially after it was taken over i think it was
the kind of spirit of things is
mhm
mm so it's a big change from
aye
the way it used to be
it is oh aye
do you feel it's kind of downhill
it's er it's still running but that's it
aha
it's still a job to come to but
so do you feel that i mean in the in the years you've worked here is the women as important as they always were in the factory
you know how they used to do a lot of weaving they don't do so much now
no there are only two women at the weaving now
mhm
there used to be about a lot of them there used to be a whole floor er
mhm
when it was in street
they were all women
mhm
but we've only got two now
mhm
the majority
er
now working in different departments then
the UNK are all women
mhm
and the winding is all women they do shift work
mhm do you think that women are just better suited to these jobs is that right women
well i don't know because years ago they trained er chaps to do the UNK and they were UNK they were managing fine
mhm
they were on a night shift too then
mhm
when they had the boys in
mhm
and you could do it
mm
but er they just don't seem to employ the boys
aha
to do it now
and how about apprenticeships and things are there any apprenticeships for women
they've started recently they d they didn't do it for years we hadn't been training anybody and that was unusual because when it was the big factory you were always bringing in the school UNK
aha
but we've got apprentice UNK i mean er now being trained and there's er four new UNK
mhm
young girls being trained for the UNK
mhm do you
so that's
feel that's maybe a good thing
oh aye had to be because i mean you don't stay young forever
mhm
you've got have somebody
that's right
coming behind you that's able to do it
that's right aha
it's bound to be a good thing
and is it i mean it used to just be men who would do these things and
mhm
women maybe worked in the jobs and yet didn't have a piece of paper to prove
aha
they were only going on their reputation
yes
factory
mhm
mhm
so what do you i mean do you get on alright with the management or do you feel that it's mostly is the management mostly male and do you feel that er there should maybe be a wee bit more representation for the women workers in management
oh i suppose there could be better representation for the women because the management is all male
mhm
so it is
mhm
but er
have they not had pressure from people that would
mhm
prefer bit more er maybe more opportunities for women to go into management
to go up into management aha there's nothing like that in here
mhm rather than bringing people in
mhm
from outside
i mean the management we've still got is the same as what we had
mhm
seven year ago when it was changed over nothing's changed there so
mhm
mhm
it's just the same
and what happened at the UNK did they just fire you all and then UNK you
they worked it down and down and down for two or three months
mhm
there were always people getting paid off and eventually out of about two hundred UNK there were only eight left
mhm
and that's we come over here then and that
mhm
was all we had
two or three UNK eight UNK i think it was four UNK
mhm
er but gradually they've been building the workforce back up again
mhm
it's quite healthy just now
so where were you based before this
just on the other side of the river it's been knocked
oh i see
down now
office block is have
aha
you seen the big glass UNK
aha
that's all that's left standing that
aha
was all b m k right round about it
aha
they had the winding place
mhm
and the UNK work and the spinning mill they did their own spinning and everything
mhm
they don't do that now
no
no
they still do their own winding but they d they don't do their own UNK
mhm
or spinning that's bought in now
mhm
mhm
we get told that erm in the early times there was quite a bit of social activities going on lots of clubs and things
mhm
and er
film shows and things like that
oh years ago
mhm
they used to have a UNK club and all the sports they had the golf and er UNK and pool and swimming
like that
swimming club i used to go to the swimming club
mhm
did you ever win anything
er no
just for the fun
no just for fun
how about the works dances
what were they like
were they good
oh aye yes oh aye they were good
yes they were
big occasions
we used to have er what they called the dance in summertime
aha
when the boys were out with their UNK and sports jackets and
and girls all in their big UNK out UNK
whereabouts would that be held
they were all held in the grand hall
oh aha
mhm
mhm
er did everybody go
oh aye five hundred people at a time went to them and
mhm
then we had works big ball in the wintertime when you went with your long dress on and your gloves you know your
used to be great
did you do was it spot UNK and UNK and things
oh aye
all that kind of thing
aye that's
did you have like a UNK
yes
mhm
mhm good
i mean went to this kind of thing it was
oh aye it was
awfully popular
mhm
talked about for a week afterwards
aye
oh it was a highlight the works dance
you don't have anything like that now
no nothing i think it's UNK now
aha
er
they still have a they hold a christmas UNK
do they
aye but it's
is it mostly younger ones that go to that
no i find that usually quite a mixed crowd goes to it
oh that's good
aye they do
so how about trips did you go on any works trips
oh we used to go on the works trips aha we used to go to UNK
UNK
aye we went on the train to UNK and we used to have a lot of trips
was that quite a kind of regular thing
mhm that was your that was your summer outing
aha
aye we used to have a works magazine
aha
in fact if i'd known i was coming here i could have brought you some in let you seen what we used to do
smashing aha
er we used to have the works magazine that was come out every month
aha
cos we used to have a lot of factories you see
mhm
there was and in ireland
mhm
yeah that's right
mhm
and the one that in canada
mhm
well we used to get the news for the and that was put in the magazine too
mhm
that's right
who got married who'd babies who died
mhm
i just let everybody big family ken you know everything about everybody
that's good aha
but er
i heard they was maybe gonna start up another magazine
we've had a magazine since we came over but i don't think they just had enough to put in it and
mhm
there
right
hasn't been one published for a long while
mm
er the news UNK they called it
yes
mhm it was just a wee bit quite a big one we used to call it
mhm
quite a good thing
aye it was good
full of gossip
did you have any children's parties or things like that
they used to have that too but they don't have that
mhm
now because they
no
used to have a welfare committee
aha
aye
and they had and the older children were taken to the pantomime
mhm
and the young ones go to the christmas party
they were held in the canteen
mhm
and er oh it used to be great fun
and how did you raise funds for that
it was just taken out of the welfare every week
mhm
we used to pay for
mhm
but they don't have a committee or anything
mm
like that
no
now
mhm and do you do things like maybe send people out to visit the sick people that were off
mhm
off their work
yes
mhm with a basket of fruit or something
oh and send flowers
mhm
oh we still do that if we know anybody's off
do you aha
and from our own departments in each
aha
department does it if there's anybody off ill
send flowers and that
and how about pay UNK do you go through the whole with the UNK and that
yes
that's still going on
and take them round the factory
yes take them round the factory
does that happen so much now
aye still do it
quite a lot
mhm
aha
mhm
that's good
we had one just the other about a fortnight ago
aha
so we did
oh aye still have the pay off
you're wild
and UNK the word
big woman out there at the wi the weaving one of the UNK and if there's one of the chaps who there getting married oh she UNK them down to the weaving
so she does she ties them see you come in the morning to clock in and it's oh my god it's
it's i mean she covers them with waste and oil
but she'll not let anybody by without putting something in his box
do they still do that now with people that are maybe er completed their apprenticeships do they anything to them
no they don't much they used to do that mhm
i know they used to do that aha
mm no UNK great fun
tie them up
did i ask you about nicknames
aye you did
you're not letting us know anyway
oh you must have some nicknames for the bosses
there must have been nicknames but er can't really don't really remember
mhm
mhm
do you find that erm the likes of yourself and your UNK do you have a lot of kind of views in common and things do you think that you're maybe kind of the same political UNK or whatever
oh aye oh aye i think it's mhm
that comes through the job
mhm
maybe
aye you usually find that
the same kind of outlook on life
mhm
so i mean your yourself how do you feel the UNK been changed over these few years
aye
oh there's nothing left in it
you know you used to have a choice of jobs but you don't now
declined very much it
mhm
the industry in this town used to be great but everything's shutting
just not there any more you've got to go to the town now to work
do you think the younger generation are in a worse position than what you were in when you started work
aye mhm
oh aye aha
definitely
do you see improvement on
i don't think so
maybe in the in the UNK districts maybe but i think they'll have to travel to go to work
aye
mhm
i can't see much more coming back to the town now
mhm that's right
they've just made it into a town where people are travelling out to go to work
aye
cos they've developed urban job
i can't ever see the factories coming back that used to be with you know they're all be smaller work loads now
aye
mhm
where they're at one and two thousand people working for them i can't see that ever coming back you know like the
mhm
mhm
how many folk used to work here when it was kind of at it's
i think there was eleven hundred before they started
UNK
aha
mm
i think it was about eleven hundred
so what would you say now maybe about four to five hundred
aye we're back up to about five hundred i think
mhm right
so
do you feel quite erm your jobs are quite safe you don't feel under
not really not really you just we've been there seven years now
mhm
and it's just been another seven years you've been able to work
mhm
but you don't know just how long it's going to be going on
mhm
mhm
mhm
cos if it ever gets where it's not making money i suppose it'll just shut
mhm
so it will but however it's been quite fortunate just now quite busy
thanks a lot
thanks very much
you're welcome
the UNK that going we just supply one
our work goes to the UNK
mhm
department
mhm
have you been in b m k like for a number of years is this your first job or do you do jobs
no i worked at er in an office i worked in offices before i got married and eventually had my daughter
and then after i had my daughter i was going to go back in there but at the time it was just like a UNK position
mhm
and now it's a wee bit further on than that
and i thought it was UNK
but in UNK thinking back i should just have and waited for something else come along
aha
so i had a job for about a year er in a fruit shop and then i didn't like the saturday work
so i decided i'd have a go in a factory aha and i come in it was over in the other place the noise was unbelievable really unbelievable
mhm
i said i'll never stick this and all these women and they said no it isn't very so twenty one years later
here i am i'm still here
you're quite settled now aye
no i'm not settled and i'm not happy but
but the work market is not that good i mean i don't
that's right
have a degree
yeah
in anything all i
yeah
was doing was a shorthand UNK
aha aye
so a and there's nothing much in i'm at the
no
stage that i want to put
that's right
my UNK on my back
and find out what's going on in the world
before it's too late i mean i don't want to reach
mm
fifty or sixty and say is
mm
this it
because that's it
yeah mhm
but i would i would like to just like pack it in and go
i'm trying to wait till my daughter's married
aha
mm
cos she's still erm she finishes in december up in glasgow this her it's like her fourth term at glasgow
mhm
doing an UNK degree in maths so i'm waiting till she's finished and then
mhm
that'll be it
mhm
mm
i feel as if i'll have done my bit
i find that actually speaking to people my dad mum and dad well my mum works in an office my dad works in a factory and they've always been very much sort of you know go out and get your education and
mhm
do you find that people working in here are like that with their children do you think they sort of push them so you don't you know don't end up working in a factory like me
no i wouldn't say that at all you can only guide your children or show them the road you can't actually force them
mhm
unless they want to do it themselves
aha
cos i often wonder don't you get fed up all these exams and
mhm
my daughter travels up and down to glasgow cos she didn't want to stay she wanted to be at home
mhm
she must be fed up going up and down to glasgow
and all these tests and they've a project here and this that and the other
mhm
but no she must do it while she's young
mhm
cos she found out in her first year she had a mature student and i wondered how old a mature student and he turned out to be thirty five and he was married
his wife was supporting him and he was doing jobs on the side
yeah
and he couldn't UNK the first year he failed the first year and he failed the UNK
mhm
so she decided this is the time to do it when you're young
yeah
and you've no re no hang ups no responsibilities nothing in the sign
mhm
so er when she wants to do it i'm behind her
yes
she's had her chance and i'm doing all i can to help her but at the end of the day it's on her shoulders
aha
if she fails at the last hurdle well she's gave it her best shot
feel about how the way the women are treated in b m k do you think that i mean is there enough provision for women UNK erm are you taking into consideration do you feel on er is do you feel that you're not your needs aren't particularly UNK for i mean in the sense of you might not have experienced this yourself but like er maternity provisions things like that i mean you get maternity leave do you feel that
oh that's ok that's okay aha
that your job is safe that you could come back or
it's as safe as any job is in today's industrial
aha
climate i would imagine
but most of the women over there they you could say they're by the age of UNK
mhm
except for the ones that they've just started recently
mhm
believe or not i could be one of the younger ones in my forties they're all kind of past that
mhm
but they they've got to start these younger people although out there in there are a great number of ex UNK but whether they would want to come back
mhm
i don't know
mhm
but
and has the it technology changed a lot
yeah some things has as i said we work off these er graph papers and they do them now by computer
aha
but the range of colour is sometimes so close and they can't give you a great diversity and the UNK shining on it and sometimes the sun coming in
mhm
can give you a headache
mhm
whereas before they used to hand paint them all well we know this is time consuming and expensive whereas you just program it in and
mhm
you've got your copies of it if you happen to tear one they can give you another copy like that
mhm
whereas if it got torn in the hand painted days then you're talking a long length of time
yeah it was serious yeah
so that way the technology but the machines are basically what they had
mhm
from nineteen twenty three
yeah
with some exceptions
has that led to a reduction in the workforce do you think do you now have machines that can do jobs that too much
no not really
pre er you know how it went into the UNK
mhm
and the old b m k s well there was about er two hundred people in the department that's when everything was boom
mhm
now the there's only twenty eight thirty cos we we've a much smaller market
so now have to go for the contracting the overseas jobs
mhm i see
but the domestic market people just can't afford twenty five
mhm
thirty pound to do out their lounge or a bedroom or whatever a square
that's right
yard or square metre
you not get any UNK from working in here
unless you talk about cheap carpet get some cheap carpet
aha
that's about it
that's really it
mhm
no special offers
well nothing much else you can
mhm
get when you
mhm
work in a carpet place the only thing is
aye
the end product
so there's no
and it's not an item that you're er UNK every two or three months this is an expensive
that's true yes aha
item
if you're doing out a lounge you're maybe talking about seven or eight hundred pounds if you want a top of the range carpet
aha
so you just do not do this
yes
in a bedroom you're looking for something at one ninety nine or two ninety nine
you just couldn't possibly do it
aha so er wondering we know there's no unions any more in the factory that's right isn't it
there are unions but the m the management don't really entertain them but people
aha
still pay their money every week
aye
i do not do this but some pe everyone's entitled to throw their money away if they like
and of course i think that maybe the UNK and the other UNK they might be in their equivalent union
yes aha
but the carpet union there is still a number of people that do believe in it
are you on any of these committees that you know the organizing committees erm that are sort of built up to solve problems within the you know the various departments or do you know anyone
they have a quality circle thing
aha
yes er no i'm not in that
and they have another er UNK committee for the management and representatives from each department
it's just the works like a trade union thing they sit down and the UNK tell them or the UNK say what about this that and the other
mhm
and they come to some agreement and the management tell what's happening how many orders they've got
er if a department's busy or maybe need to shift personnel from here to there
mhm
if that department isn't really that busy
aha
so they have that they say they don't need unions because they've got a good working relationship
do you feel that works or would you prefer a union set up
it seems to work in here because er the carpet industry if you speak to people in different firms say they all work the same way it seems to work on a
mhm
shoe string er from hand to mouth
mhm
er nothing really that organized but every carpet place seems to be the same
mhm
it it's not you it's not until you've probably worked in another place and come here or go
aha
from here that you
right
would see a difference but people that have always worked in here don't notice any difference
aha
but is it's a special kind of climate in here
mhm
aha just basically i mean how do you find working and you know UNK children bringing up a family and doing your UNK do you how do you organize it do you find that you get up early and do work in the morning will you do a bit of work when you go home or does your partner help out with the work
oh just everybody has to pull together mhm
everybody UNK in
mhm your UNK do various things
well i've only got one daughter and she is er extremely good
she does all the washing and ironing and that kind of thing
mhm
er and the work just gets done you don't need to do it every day
aha
i'm not a UNK i'm not
no you can be when you're
working full time
oh i think there are other things to do
i find
aha
UNK depressing and boring
aha
i mean i w i couldn't say that i would be happy being in the house all the time
i hate cooking and i've never tried to UNK in my life
i love eating by the way
but i just er i don't see any point in cooking three meals a day and washing dishes three or four time i don't find it satisfying not that this is extremely fulfilling but
mhm
you seem to get a bit of everything
mhm
and i need the money to finance my climbing and other kind of things that i do
mhm
but i don't see this as the be all and end all
mhm
i couldn't possibly stay in the house
no
impossible
no
i'm not er highly UNK and i don't er feel the need to produce children
mhm
i'm not a wonderful mother
because erm my daughter's at the stage that she's probably
mhm
looking after me
mhm
but i'm not the least bit UNK
right so erm
i'm probably a bad example i'm what you're wanting to find out
no not at all not at all
so do you feel that erm i mean i know that you've been here twenty one years and do you think women are more important or less important in the factory than they were
i heard when i started looking into the project at first that erm the women used to do most of the weaving but you don't actually do the weaving now and they used to basically you know make up the larger part of the work force is that the case now
well that's in relation to the weaving that they do
years ago they had all these narrow UNK about this size and this is where women worked they called it the narrow section and maybe mostly for hotels or you know in the UNK days they had UNK your UNK probably UNK runners or holes and the carpet just went like that and there'd be a piece of UNK up the side
mhm
well there was a lot of call for that
mhm
and women worked in that department whereas the men worked at the huge UNK
mhm
UNK which are very heavy very heavy and through fashion changing and i mean people don't have these things any more
a lot of pubs and hotels will do the their places out in these narrow sections so if one gets worn they can lift it up and
mhm yeah
replace it
but houses when you're doing a house you don't tend to do that now you just have your broad UNK
mm
and fit it in
so in that relationship
the d the women are redundant as it were
yes
there only is two well there are two one they do UNK
mhm
and the they'll turn a week about
but the there's not the call in this er place for women in the weaving department
mhm
but our department hasn't changed the women are just doing the same job as they did sixty
mhm
years ago
and probably in the picking as well
in the winding it's just their lot hasn't changed a great deal
mhm
except i would say the UNK are worse off cos they're doing three shifts
right mhm
and i just couldn't UNK that i don't think
aha
mm
so erm have you got do you have a lot of friends through work do you find i mean do you sort of organize things after work do you ever go for a drink
well a lot a lot of people er do er ju just about three weeks ago two women from our department retired so we had er we had a night out up in that's where they live so there is that kind of thing
aha
or if on the few occasions that someone gets married they hold a night
aha
er and some of the girls do like make up parties and things like that
some
mhm
of them go to the weight training at
mhm
but as i say i don't do that kind of thing i prefer to go away to the hills
aha are you a keen UNK
and do my thing
mhm
my daughter thinks i'm mad
when it came to my UNK birthday she said what would you like for your birthday
i said i'd like a really good pair of trainers
and i'm no good at tying UNK so she got me a pair of UNK you know with the UNK
aha
she said why can't you be a normal mother and just want UNK or UNK
i said well that's not much good when you're hanging from the end of a rope
and who do you go with
i go with my husband
your husband
mhm
and whereabouts do you go just
oh UNK you know just
mhm
up there
do you do you stay up there do you have
mhm
a caravan
no a tent or we've got an estate car if it's just a weekend UNK and it's maybe wet we just sleep in the back of the car
aha
so complete change from this place anyway
aha and you meets up with so many wonderful people
aha
it gives you something else to talk about
that's right aha
instead of just going to UNK for some UNK or
i mean i don't drink a lot i mean maybe after i've been out in the hills you have got to drink something to replace the sweat but i'm not a great UNK and i don't i don't smoke and i don't like UNK or anything like that
mhm
so you've got to find something else to do
that's right a healthy pursuit
i used to play a lot of UNK and swimming but i've got bored out of my ears so it's something to keep fit
mhm
so i bought myself a bike and i've been popping backwards and forwards to my like
how about
ah but as i say my daughter thinks i'm mad
how about nicknames
you have a lot of nicknames in the factory
er well er the just these two people that retired there er they used to come this man in a car from that was their lift to their work
and it was the days of the c b
mhm
and he had this handle a and er they were saying we'll need to get UNK a handle
ah i said well what about the dolly sisters
so that stuck and eventually when that place folded and we came over here er we just called them the UNK and that was they were referred to everybody knew who they were
aha
the UNK
aha
so that that's a bit of it in there
aha
so you just basically you all
a and
know each other by your ordinary names
mhm
you don't shout nicknames
mhm
at each other no
well not in our department anyway i don't know i can't speak for anybody else
aha right
although i've worked in nearly all the departments you don't really get to know the people that well
mhm
have we missed out anything is there anything
i don't know
you'd like to tell us
cos we're UNK at this
och aye
i mean er does it bother you at all that well i mean are most of the men managers
managers men
er the management
where's the opportunities for like female apprentices and things like that
nowadays i mean i know there never used to be apprenticeships for women but
well i don't know if there are any women i couldn't tell you whether any girls have applied to be like trainee UNK that's people that sort
mhm
the UNK
or the trainees in our department would be female anyway
mhm
and the way the management work in here i can say is they aim they're promoting anybody to a UNK they usually promote somebody that's actually no threat to themselves
there's a kind of yes man that that's the way the carpet industry works in general
mhm
they don't promote somebody that's gonna UNK past them up the corporate ladder although you couldn't
say this place
is a giant corporation
mhm
aha
but sometimes i do feel that the girls i know a couple of people in other departments that you could say would do the job equally well as the man they've put in they probably
aha
have bu be a better UNK
aha
yes
but i saw that in the UNK and when i worked in there they would bring people in
mhm
oh
m
they wouldn't promote
no er if you had a degree
aha
and you absolutely no knew nothing about producing plain bearings you were sitting in the chair and probably a guy that worked his way through the factory floor who knew the job inside out he was still
a deputy
aha
but because er you maybe had a degree well you get in there and you have to start
mhm
learning all this but you didn't know all the
mhm
the ins and outs
mhm
but that happens all over
mhm what's the pay like compared to other factories in the area
it's quite low
is it
mhm
because er how many years ago is it
seven or eight years ago we we're on UNK we made our own wage
er and most of us had in excess of a hundred pound maybe a hundred and six a hundred and ten pound but when this guy bought place over there was a kind of flat rate and we'd to drop sixteen pounds to ninety
mm
pounds
well at the time you're thinking god that's better than twenty or twenty five pound if you were unemployed
that's right
on the brew kind of thing
mhm
so you jumped at the chance but it is i think th poverty wage in europe is it not about a hundred and forty a hundred and forty five pounds
well we're nowhere near that nowhere near that
mm that's right mm
that's why when i hear my daughter talking about getting fifteen or twenty k a year i'm going it would pay me two or three years for god's sake
you can look after me then
but saying that if you want a decent wage in here you have to work a lot of overtime
yes
and most people do
mm
because er i from the management point of view if you have got four hundred people and you work a lot of overtime that saves you having six or seven hundred people
mhm
and if you want to cut back you can either cut down on your workforce or you can cut down in the
mhm
overtime
in my department just now they're working seven days a week
mhm
and four nights overtime
mm
i couldn't do that not that i want to
do you think the conditions make people kind of like minded in like the respective politics and things like that
do you think it's sort of you know do you hold a lot of views in common with people you work beside or
not no not really
not really
we've got quite a mixture
can you tell us what er what section you work in
i work at the weaving
in the weaving
section aha
and
and what do you do
i'm what you call a UNK
aha
which involves like when the frames comes off the weaving and they're UNK left i strip the UNK off
mhm
off the weaving frames
mhm
that's basically my aha
it's quite spec specialized so
no
it's not specialized no
mhm have you ever worked in any other factory
aha i worked in UNK i've been left now two year
and how did you find that
er i liked the UNK but some i just don't know some of the girls get kind of one thing by the other i can object to i think it was actually the atmosphere of the girls that worked in the department that i
mhm
just objected to
mhm
but it was a good job
and have you worked in here for many years
oh yes
ca more than i care to remember
aha
unless it been like i left from my kitchen
aha and is this your first job
aha
you left straight from the school
yes
and er what attracted you to the job did you know somebody that worked here
er no we just like actually applied like UNK were they were looking for girls then UNK b m k and this was the one that
and how did you do that
did you just walk round the factories and put your name in the office
no we just er came down to personnel office and
aha
asked if there was any jobs going
mhm
so they took a list of they took your name
your names
mhm
and then sent for you
right erm so do you think the place has changed much in the years that you've worked here
oh factory wise aye aha
mhm
i mean it's gonna seem it was an awfully big factory over there it's a different factory entirely
mhm
mhm
more like a big shed here
that's all it is
mhm
but you cannot expect i mean we was actually lucky there was a job there now when it closed down
mhm
i was lucky the factory started up again
mhm er so how did you find arrangements when you left to have your children did you feel that your job was secure
did you feel satisfied
i suppose a job more or less was always secure at that time aha
mhm
because it is a kind of semi skilled you know
it was always more or less
mhm
secure
and what happened when you came back did you er wait until your kids were that wee bit older or did your family
well
help you out
nigel started a kind of evening shift that you was there with your kids during the day and then your husband got them at night and you come out and worked at nights so it
mhm
kind of works
oh that's
well that was mhm
and are you from
sorry
are you from
aha
and so was it do you just travel er the bus
it's er i stayed up like aha in street at the time you know
so it was quite convenient
so were there any nowadays you know if there's any opportunities to come back part time if you've got small children
no there was nothing like that no i think there's only one girl i've ever part time
mhm
it's started up again
mhm
we work to my knowledge only one girl
mhm
erm so do you feel that in the years that you've worked here are women just as important in the factory and make up a large part of the workforce now as they as they've ever done
they do important jobs in the factory
well i think actually not as many as there were the like in the other years ago but that's to be expected nowadays
i would say there were more men in important jobs in here than there is
mhm
does that ever cause any UNK if there's you know if the a man's a head of a section where there's a lot of women who maybe feel that you could do the job as well
no it's more petty things that's UNK than actual the actual
aha
job it's just petty things that
mhm
like obsessed girls you know
mhm
if one gets a better design if one gets UNK and the other doesn't get the they just scrap you know scratch one another 's eyes out
is there a lot of that
oh ye you'd actually think they was making their own pay the way they carry on i mean
aha
you've got to
it doesn't matter what job but there's a wee bit UNK among just the girls themselves
mhm
mhm
aye and have you any nicknames for people in the factory
oh y we used to have the sisters
they retired a fortnight ago called the oh aye there are a few nicknames for them including the sisters
anybody else
erm they call me UNK which i UNK
why's that
my name's and my sons get called UNK so i get called UNK
erm no just to kind of or the wee one or something like this aye
mhm
mhm
or the UNK
oh bi aye the big one
mm UNK
aha
mm
yeah what else
oh do you do anything
do you ever keep up with people outside work
and have you made any friends that you do things maybe go for a drink or
well actually before we come here like back here we've had weekends in belgium
mhm
and weekends in london
and we're booked up to go and see cats in january oh we've quite a few and then like there actually UNK quite good at organizing for er charity
mhm
and we have nights out and things like this for that
mhm
oh definitely
and what do you do you just put so much a week in a kitty for that
well if we're going to be
somewhere
no we used to actually do that like you had nights out maybe christmas and certain times of the year you had a night but that's kind of stopped here
no it's more like just save ourselves more
mhm
or less you know
there is a girl that UNK money if you want to give her it
mhm
she UNK for all the charities and her she's a great organizer terrific
she UNK everyone
and do you get a lot of er pay UNK and things in the factories now
you get a few but not our bit it's actually more at the picking now where all the young ones are
mhm
there not many there it's just them started
mhm
like er there's four young ones just out of UNK
mhm
and what do you do when somebody's er having a pay off do you do her out and the
aye the works aha
and is that done in the work
er no the girls take it home
mhm
and do the quoting in their spare time
mhm
there's a lot of work involved in that
and do they make up verses and things for it
mhm
take her round the factory
round the factory aye
mhm
aye
it's not changed
no how about the men do you do anything for the men
UNK and oil and you name it mhm
really
mhm
there was a big gi big woman once in
here at the weaving oh and she's huge and oh she goes for the men
she does the works on the men and we leave it all to UNK
aha
what was i oh yes erm do you find that like maybe like one section thinks they're a wee bit better than another section
mhm
because of the kind of job they're doing or the fact that they're getting a wee bit more pay
they do mhm they do
and who thinks they're best
erm UNK i would say department thinks they're one up on everybody else
mhm
the cream
the cream aha
from under the cow
and that's where i used to work in but that's the reason i left because i thought actually some of them was getting kind of UNK
aha
aye
this that and the next thing
mm anything else i was going to ask you i think that was about it was it
aye well i mean the social activities you used to have in the old place were th were those any better than over here
when we started here it looked er but we'll only get actually six weeks said you've got six weeks work that's all
mhm
but it's lasted about seven year so you never can organ but once we did start i did enjoy the ones over here because over there when your kids were small you didn't go out much anyway but now that your kids are up you've got it and personally i enjoyed the ones that started but they don't have christmas dance barn dances and things like this they don't UNK we have to have to organize like that UNK
mhm
but the work doesn't organize anything like that
did those used to be big things
mm they used to have like big dances and thin in the grand hall of all places but music was once a year things like that but they don't have that now
mhm
did they used to have clubs and stuff the
oh they have er we can join the cricket club like er b m k workers pay in so much and they are members of the cricket club
mm
you can go to that
mhm
i don't think there was really that many
mhm
down for that
mhm
mhm
and do you get any UNK like do you get any discounts in the town through
aha they'll say you get a card like d for the UNK and things like that
mhm
UNK not much mind you but it's always helped
you don't get any cheap carpets no
you're joking
you're joking we get our chicken and that's it at christmas
you get a chicken at christmas
we get a chicken at christmas aha sorry a turkey
a turkey
a turkey we get that at christmas
to take home
mhm frozen and you've by the time you've UNK it in forty eight hours it's no use for christmas time that's
what i've got against it
so you've got to actually store it till new year cos you can't you haven't got time to UNK it out
mhm
but that's our UNK that's it
a turkey
is it the fair holidays you get
aha
a fortnight at the fair
fortnight at the fair
mhm what's your kind of favourite places for going
well the last f four year i've been abroad
mhm
we've been to the UNK islands and was er UNK last year i've been to yugoslavia
mhm
oh aye places
mhm
mhm
i like to try a different pace very year to see what it's like
aha
and do a lot of people go abroad now do you think from the factory
mhm
but you have to work UNK hard to all year round to get
aha
that fortnight i mean it's
mhm
mhm
impossible to like if my husband and i didn't work
whereabouts does your husband work
he works in
mhm
mhm
you've to work and you've to work overtime and you be round the clock
mhm
mhm
you've to work to get that fortnight
and do you find that if you didn't have the overtime then you you'd be struggling with your wage
och aye because i actually dropped twenty pound coming from the UNK to the job i'm doing just now
mhm
dropped twenty pound this actually me on the bottom scale
mhm
i work at just now
but is it a better job do you think
no i wouldn't say it was a i would say it was far UNK and
mhm
i mean before you used to have your own your own like the job i'm i was started for i've got sweep all the floor the place where we work
mhm
i've got to do that twice a day which i didn't know we actually had to do when i started it
mhm
mhm
aye
aha i would resent i'd resent that
mhm
because i'm not kidding you see that i mean i've to buy big bags of it
mhm
mhm
aye i object to it
and when did you move to that job
as i say i didn't i thought the girls was plus that fact it was a lot of concentration for the UNK
mhm
and with this in this thing now that b m k's in every had got to be spot on
mhm
and you could easily make a mistake with the work you get all worked up
i used to get worked up if i made a mistake i mean i UNK and a nervous breakdown UNK
no way
mhm
so i thought then it was time to move
mhm but so you're quite happy in your job
i like it fine except for this UNK i object to all this mess it's doing and
mhm
things like that
mhm
that's the only thing i've got against it
mhm
but how do you feel b m k could other factories in the town do you think it's a good factory to work in
well basically i see we get less holidays than every other factory
mm
i mean we're not allowed as many holidays as most of them but then again it was starting up so we just had to take it that way
mhm
aye
it's either that or you'd no job and
mhm do you have a family
but i actually think if there's more factories opened up in and thing i think going with the talk a lot of men especially men would look for jobs elsewhere because you don like in here the men don't get paid if they're ill
i mean
mhm
you only get like they ge the guys are on get pound a week if they're ill
aye
fifteen pound at the most they in other factories they ge for six month men get their full wage
mhm
well they don't get that in here unless you're higher up the scale like a UNK or something that's things like that
aye
but down the scale a bit and the men don't get i feel sorry for them i mean you've kids and everything
mhm
the likes of us we've got a man behind us but the likes of them i feel sorry for they cannot actually afford to be sick and that's it
yeah
mhm
so
do you have a family
i've two boys aha
and where do where do they work
er one's in the works for himself he's UNK and there's one works in the UNK
he used to work in here
mhm
mhm
but he started in the UNK about two months ago
mhm do you find that's a common thing that mothers and UNK maybe get their kids a job in where they work
well i don't think they would actually but my sons are into to trade you know
mhm
but it closed down it's closed so
mhm
i just got him in here and then he got into er the UNK
mhm
so it was better conditions in there
mhm
i mean he liked his job in here right enough but it was more money and better conditions in the UNK so
aye
mhm
he bought a flat do he had to go where he was getting aye more money and then again as i say if he was ill he would get his pay for so long
mhm
mhm
it's just things like that just
you have to weigh up the UNK and cons
mhm
mhm and you feel that youngsters nowadays have maybe less opportunity than you had yourself when you were leaving school
och aye i have aye
mhm
girls it's a shame really i also find they didn't need to they don't didn't need to work as hard as the ones years ago
mhm
they only will stand for the same i don't think they're going to stand for the same conditions
mhm
that we used to have to make our own and i'm not kidding you and was ne was a you know
mhm
with things like that i think the young ones that way
mhm
have kind of changed
mhm
i mean i think we're all when theirs were running about but they're
mhm
kind of UNK i think the younger ones
mhm
i think they're a lot UNK
do you think the young the younger generation are too lazy
no i mean it not lazy i would say they're UNK put it that way
aye
mhm more common sense than we had
mhm
so do you ever see the town picking back up again and getting a few more factories in the
mm i'd hope so but i don't think so
so
look at one time the and you had er well you've got UNK walkers but there are not as many works in that either
mhm
cannot see it no
this is what i mean
do you think there's a kind of widespread feeling that nearly everybody feels like that
aye and they feel as though they've got to stick to the job they've got especially at our age
aye
where could we get a job at our age
mm
so you've just got to
mhm
it's that or nothing
mhm
and unfortunately the bills comes in just the same as you've got to stick it
right thanks very much
alright
winding
aha
and what do you do in winding
it's hard to ex oh it's winding it's hard to explain the machines do you not get round and about
no
to see them
we haven't been round yet so
you'd really need to see them to i mean i couldn't explain it to you really
mhm
mhm
they're automatic now you know
mhm
well we put the wool on and that but
mhm
it winds automatic
yeah
and cuts off
you really need to see them to
aye so how long have you been in here
oh since this firm took over well it was not b m k you know but it was taken over by the
mhm
the new man and that
mhm
but i've been in there since the beginning
mhm and has it changed a lot do you think
no not really no
not really
no
the job changed the UNK changed
no just the same machine we had over on the other side aye it hasn't changed at all
mhm
erm i was going to ask you
er how did you get the job at first
was it somebody that you knew that worked in here
no not really
that was a case i worked in a hotel for years and years and it closed down with the new bypass and that and just a girl beside me she was coming for an interview to the b m k and i came with her
mhm
i'd have never been in
mhm and when was that
oh
er sixteen year
mhm
aye it's about sixteen year
you've been here all that time
mhm
in the same job
mhm
do you enjoy it
oh yes aha
do you have a lot of friends working in here
ah well work friends aye
mhm
oh aye they're all quite friendly
and do you keep up with them after your work
no not really no
not really
no
no
i'm not really some of them do the younger ones and that a bit
mhm
not really
what's the kind of age of folk in your section
well i'm the oldest
er UNK i mean the students here they don't count really
who's the youngest
oh it must be UNK
i think UNK about the youngest
mhm
aye she must be
what else have i got here
oh do you have any nicknames for each other
no not re no
no
no we don't
no
honestly
no
not ones that you talk about anyway
no i'm being honest no
aha
no
i don't know about younger ones and that but no
aha
honest to god
mhm
no nicknames
mhm
i don't know what they say maybe behind your back or that but honestly i don't think no
there's nobody really got a UNK in here
aha
mhm have you any worked in any other factories in town
no never no
just this one
mhm
mhm
i'm not from the town
mhm
where is it you're from
oh right so you have to travel in
mhm
on the bus
aha
mhm er there's something else i was going to ask you but
oh aha within the sections is there is there some sections you think that feel they're better than other sections because they've got like maybe more pay or they feel they've special
oh aye oh aye we feel that
and who's that do you think
any department
every department thinks they're better than the next one
oh better
no oh well aye but you'll find out for yourself
no wages and that i mean it does vary from section
aha
to section
aha
and we feel we've the UNK not the biggest wage kind of thing you ken
aha
but i suppose there are other jobs have more responsible in that so
aha
this is what happens
mhm do you wear like different can you tell by what the person's wearing like do you wear different UNK for different jobs
no wear your UNK just wear your own
you cannot tell aha
mhm
and is it quite regular hours or do you work all over the time
we work shifts
shifts you work aha
just the winding that works the shifts
and what hours is that
two till se that's six to two to ten and ten to six
mhm
but that we're the only one that do the shifts
and how do you find that
i like the more
you'd rather have the
you get used to them
mhm
time
oh the night UNK no bother
i don't like the back shifts
do you think the place has changed much since the UNK
i don't think it's changed at all really
no
mm
no
no
er are you in a union
aha
mhm but it's not
what for i don't know
just for more money that's all
aha
it's not recognized anyway
mhm what one is it
carpet union
carpet union
mhm
and it's not everybody's in a union
no not everybody's in it no
i suppose the ones that came from the old factory you know were kept on and that
mhm
but new
so how many folk are working in your section
UNK there's er five fourteen UNK
fourteen
aha
was there any more er when you started working here
there was only two when we started here
only two
me and another girl
that was
all you know when it was transferred there was only the two of us
aha
and then they sent back for the you know the ones that had been there before
but that worker she left she got oh she wasn't married but she had a family
mhm
and do you get any UNK like cheaper carpets or anything
you're joking
we get them cheaper outside
anything
no
right that's all we wanted to know
you got the name for
do you find the i mean do you find the management alright do you get on okay with them and everything
mm aye
nobody really UNK
no there isn't really
cos in my office there's quite a lot of bosses in my office
mhm
cos it's the production control so
mhm
just talk to them like anybody else does
what do what do you actually do in your office is it like telephone duties or typing or what
a bit of everything
just do everything really
mhm
do you get to know all the different people that UNK ring up all the different clients and that
well we don't speak to clients it's just salesmen and
aha
people i speak to
mhm
talking to quite a lot of different people
mhm do you get to know basically everything work
so how did you get erm the job in the office
was it just a within the factory out about it
no it was been here for six weeks and i was just expecting to leave
mhm
and i was gonna go and apply for but then neil he sent for me and just asked me just told me there was a job come up in the office and if i wanted it
mhm
i was to go
so it was just luck really
were you relieved
i don't know i didn't really want to work in an office
no
i'd prefer to work in a factory
mhm
that's right if i didn't work in the office i didn't work in the factory
oh i see aha
so you didn't have a great deal of choice
oh well anything else
i don't think most of these questions apply to you actually because they're mostly like for the kind of older women i was gonna ask them about how they er coped with the you know running a house and
i'm not gonna insult you by asking are you really that old
you're not planning to get married in the future then
yes
would you recommend this job to er other folk your age or
i didn't have very good qualifications
aha
here good qualifications
excuse me
aha
have you ever thought about like maybe going to college or
no
no
i'm just not i'm not interested in it no
you're not academic you don't like it
no
so what kind of hobbies have you got
do you do anything like do you have any friends from work that you see outside of work
's boyfriend he works here
oh well you met him did you meet him here aha
well it hasn't been a complete loss
well i don't know
do you do anything i mean do they do any trips like to the lights of blackpool or anything now
well occasionally somebody runs something but not very often
aha
do they have a football team now
they used to but don't think they haven't got one now
no cos
they've just got a UNK team and a golf club and
aha
things like that
aye and are a lot of people involved in that work in the factory
just the men
mhm the women don't have any clubs then
och no we can't have that you'll
have to start some
no just the men
just the men what's the kind of proportion of women to men in the factory
i'd say it was about half and half in the factory but higher up it's all men
all men aha
does that UNK you
not really it doesn't UNK me but i know there are some like women older than me in my office that know they're not gonna get anywhere because it's all men
mhm
mhm
a wee bit of UNK
aye cos about six month ago there was a job come up in our office for like a trainee assistant manager type well an assistant to an assistant manager kind of thing so i applied for it and another woman in the office applied for it cos she's been here for like sixteen years or whatever
mhm
so and she knew about the office and i knew about the office and knew everything they were wanting me to know but a man got it from outside so
oh right
it was a bit
aha
do you ever feel like changing at all
no not really
no it's all men
do they ever send you on training courses or anything like that
no
do you feel your job's secure
as long as the UNK here i'll be here i would
mhm
it's a job that they need somebody to do they couldn't just
mhm
pay you off and things
aha
would just pile up and you'd always need somebody
aha so
somebody
okay
mhm
