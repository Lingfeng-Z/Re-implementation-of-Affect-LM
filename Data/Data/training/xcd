mick national officer
president as delegates will know this is my first report to congress from the public services section and in the time available could i warn delegates and onwards to eight hundred thousand members their families and all their friends and the eight million members of the t u c and their families and their friends a UNK group of british people who president now consider theirselves as past present and future patients of the n h s and rightly so
well do i have news for you and them
in april and may of this year the junior minister of health in april tom announced from the shared platform with david the tory mp for UNK but better known as a leading member of the tory think tank that regulations had been lifted to allow private capital to have free access to the n h s
to undertake buildings of hospitals the complete management of hospitals and to retail a full range of health service products
president david followed on and said and i quote the successful UNK of the national health service depends on agreements being excluded from the present unions and he has not been UNK
president this was UNK by the secretary of state for health in may last month by golden virginia UNK that further offered an invitation to the private sector to form a partnership with the government to take over our public sector n h s to provide the UNK and the UNK skills and imagination of the private sector of british industry
what an example what a record
u k private industry nil the rest of the world ninety nine and still playing with plenty of time on the clock
congress to it further we have no UNK we are no longer patients we have all been UNK customers and clients the new management UNK use the language of the private sector corporate customer targeting they refer to theirselves as commissioners of health service care working with the internal market
fund holders talk about buying the best products available at the lowest price regardless of the inconvenience to their customers
mick just one second
colleagues let's keep it quiet please
regardless of the inconvenience to their customers who might have to travel further UNK away from their homes and communities for treatment
UNK have to manage their financial budget they're told like any other small or medium sized businesses
they want to develop purchasing skills cash flow skills cost control skills and labour cost controls
president for those who have i'm sure who'll these UNK are we used to call them family doctors
congress president the government have got no UNK to announce publicly that their intentions to UNK the n h s on a date that will give the leading time with the UNK and p r that they've done before to sell shares to sell shares in the british public in a public nationally held n h s there will be no seats there will be no inspector UNK and others as there've been with telecom gas water and electricity
the present private health service companies like b u p a that already are all ready to move into the front door and take over so this year my first report on the n h s could be replaced in nineteen ninety four on the report on the private health care industry unless we take action
based on the following delegates i've been lucky like many of you to live in a country where i have had available to me a national health service that has been the envy of the world
like you on occasions my family and i along with my parents have had the benefits of being able to use the national health service free of any ongoing financial burden to the family
there is an opportunity now on the fifth of july when this may well be our last chance to demonstrate all of us along with health service workers cos they can't do it on they o on their own
and UNK publicly and UNK on that day which is a date we should be celebrating the forty fifth anniversary of our national health service instead we will have to demonstrate to save our national health service
president delegates brothers and sisters i will be there on the fifth of july
i hope you will be with the health service workers not just because i have the honour and privilege of being a national officer with this greatest union in the country
not because i directly res have some responsibility for representing our membership within the health service but because as i said earlier this is my health service this is your health service it's our UNK health service that we have enjoyed the benefits since nineteen forty eight
i will be out there because i am and this may have surprised a lot of a very UNK appearance of me i'm gonna be a granddad in august and october this year
and no tory government is gonna take away our health service from my grandchildren who will be born in a national health service hospital and hopefully will enjoy the benefits and the care during the rest of the nineties and well into the next century
i move my report to congress
thanks very much mick
colleagues turning to UNK report page seventy one
yes eric london region
erm i suppose we ought to say welcome to the health service mick
erm i doubt if you'll get too hard a time from us
possibly not covered in the report is the commitment that this union is giving to the health service
we've created a new sector i i've seen over the last three or four years changes in the way that we've tried to represent our membership in the health service from the old industrial conferences to combined industrial conferences into the er current erm section that we've now got
the problem is that we seem to have dropped the health service off more and more and more over that period of time and i think to be fair the programme sums it all up two motions on the health service
it used to be a major debate at this congress
it's not just the better the members that we've got working in the health service it's about everybody in the room and everybody in the country who wants to use it and we've gotta get it a bi a bit higher up on the agenda at this union and i hope mick that you can give us the confidence and give us the commitment that that's what we're gonna get from this union
seventy two
yes
president congress
i should like to ask mick regarding the long service ambulance personnel
a lot of them now are being took off a and e work put on out patients and most on it's now the art of trust
i was took on to be able to keep the written terms and conditions
thank you very much
thank you seventy three seventy four and seventy five
mick
thank you president
er eric erm asked about er profile and resources and er hoping i would er provide the conference confidence er of our membership in the health UNK of getting the profile up
eric i reported to the c e c on saturday night when presenting the health service conference report that i would be making a detailed report to the next er meeting of the public services section committee on resources er on what i see in the first five month of my er ten year of office er what we need to do to play our part in the public service to extend ourselves within the er the health service
that report i trust will be adopted by the er the public services national committee and go back to the c e c for the UNK and er watch this space
i just birmingham region i think the delegate who came up second about long service ambulance staff and the going down
if i could see him at the back i'll er i'll just get the question a bit more clearer and i'm sure i can help
thanks very much
alright thanks very much indeed mick
colleagues national health service composite motion fourteen and motion three o five
er composite fourteen to be moved by liverpool region
president congress
doug liverpool north wales and irish region
health service worker
the latest demonstration reforms proves the point what trade unions have been saying since the UNK of trust hospitals and i think the word trust is the wrong word to use
it should be UNK hospitals because the people who work in the service were all guaranteed certain things which have not come to pass whatsoever
the whole trust of the reforms is to break up the n h s piece by piece
if you worked in the industry you would see what was happening and you would be UNK
you just do not believe the moves that they try to do
the main thing is they don't inform you of what's happening now until it's happened and then they say oh well we didn't need to UNK with you cos it doesn't affect your members
but in knock on affects it does
through privatization of occupation and health
privatization of finance privatization of all the UNK workers
that more or less exhausted now
the only people who seem to be UNK from the privatization is the senior management executives
morale in the service is at an all time low
through the pressures put on our members by the private contractors if they get recognition and not guarantee no sick pay reduced holidays no check off the i could go on and on and on
then the fortunate staff who are still employed and they're regarded as fortunate that you've still got a job because that's what the management use repeatedly to professional people like nurses sisters and other professional organizations who work within the health service you're very lucky to have a job
there's very many unemployed
why should you complain
our nurse members have been waiting now some of them since nineteen eighty eight for grading appeals
there are twenty eight thousand up and down the country waiting to find out have they got the correct grade
that is a legacy of the late mr kenneth clarke health service minister now the new chancellor
god help us with the economy if he comes up with a UNK idea like he did over these grading appeals
so because of the embarrassment mrs UNK has instructed all her regional health authorities to clear the backlog of these grading appeals
but mr UNK another minister of health decided in nineteen ninety one that he would do with a famous thing called section thirty two
but he was in a peer mechanism which had been a UNK thing with trade unionism management for many years with no replacement
so what they decided to do they would accept the clinical grading appeals which says that a panel can be up to six members of three members of management and three members of trade unions
the UNK region where i work have decided that they wouldn't accept that
they would accept the panel of one trade unionist and one member of management
and they said that was the only way that they could clear the backlog within the time limit that mrs UNK has set
this union and other unions have protested most vigorously to the UNK region and they decided then to go ahead with the appeals by approaching other trade unions not necessarily involved in clinical skills like the UNK and the UNK of the a u e w and the UNK
no UNK to their craft that's their job but would you like it if you were sister working in intensive care or an a and e department to have your appeal judged by a UNK or a joiner and that's what's happening in the UNK region at the moment
we have other stupid things like a nurse training college let's close it
so we close it down to make it way for a new hundred UNK day hospital UNK be not private guaranteed no way will it be private
but it can't be managed in this country cos nobody's got the expertise of the management of these sort of hotels
so we're bringing the UNK airlines to come over and manage it
so we close a nursing college and we're gonna make it into a hundred UNK day hospital and it's gonna be managed by a UNK airline company
that's the sort of thing that's going on at the moment
i could go on and on and on
i have to show you this cos that is the disgrace and you all saw it we read it on tuesday
there's no way that child should have died but you know what these famous words in real terms in real terms we are putting more money into the health service
the people who are putting money in the health service i don't care whatever city you go to you will see an appeal for a new kidney machine a new special baby care unit you're the people the public are putting the money in because they're certainly not
the only money they put in to the chief executives and their two yearly pay re review performances that they get for cutting other people's wages or contracting health services and for somebody to have to travel that distance for a to die is absolutely appalling and it's a disgrace
i could go on and on and on and i've listened all week to the debates and i agree with what john said on sunday
i think a lot of people do
if we don't get together collectively to get rid this government you and your families and mick and his grandchildren there won't be a health service there
i move
comp fourteen formally seconded
thanks very much indeed
motion three o five to be moved by london region
did you formally move
oh he's coming right
sorry
john from the london region
president comrades
erm congress the UNK review of the health service in london contains many UNK aspects midst conclusions stem from the UNK belief that market forces will resolve all the problems
that's sheer and utter rubbish
this is a UNK document and indeed it comes to very UNK conclusions
the under funding of the n h s has been the main cause of our having reached this crisis point
closures and UNK are simply destroying internationally UNK centres of excellence and creating a positive area for redundancies voluntary and compulsory early UNK and UNK of about twenty thousand personnel
this massive attack on the labour force in the inner london the most heavily deprived districts in the country UNK the social dimension the climate of deep recession and the added importance of an economic entity in local UNK management
a massive reduction in beds erm will have no doubt a follow up in the rest of the united kingdom with its inevitable result on health care and jobs
the UNK march of the trust program is UNK to swallow up the n h s as we know it health care delivery biased in favour of the money orientated terms and conditions for the workers on a take it or leave it basis short term contracts as the norm and reduction in sickness entitlement
certainly longer hours and less pay all that was hard fought for UNK back in our faces
the intent of UNK will add greatly to the expected one hundred thousand job losses in the capital in nineteen ninety four a rise of thirteen percent
are they UNK or just mad
people in poverty is no way to help the inner UNK
the n s the n h s UNK from the highly skilled and professional to the semi skilled manual workers UNK clerical maintenance nursing and midwifery personnel mostly locally based
what's to become of the pool of labour when the heart and soul is torn from london by the ruler of the political obviously no consideration for the human consequences of its policies
major i also mean my man his decisions and bed closures courts disaster
patient care will suffer demand for care will increase and er primary care will this point again and again
while they UNK over the prices in the trusts you must continue to suffer and the socially deprived remained bottom of the waiting lists
now look at the tragedy of UNK
closure will destroy both the historical and the UNK
the royal UNK place of care and UNK to go another victim
what about queen mary's UNK
hope for the UNK
i UNK him greatly
UNK giving life with great UNK and many more
congress fight indeed with all your might
they have got it wrong
help to put it right
all must have heart
UNK john major's government seem to be twin spirits who know exactly the price of everything but the value of nothing
can no one rid us of these UNK and UNK
i move
thanks john
is that formally seconded please
no
no
eric london region section three o five
sorry to take a little bit of time but i did point out we've got two motions on the health service and erm i think it's a little bit more important than just er formally seconding
the arguments in UNK too many beds in london
there's too many beds in london there's a small outfit called the e b s the emergency bed service
because they have so much trouble finding beds in london hospitals they've got this little company set up to do the job for the doctors so there is no way in the world that i can believe there's a shortage of beds
the hospitals of excellence as some people have put them the major teaching hospitals all in london nationally they import that expertise once people have done their training
you get rid of those hospitals in london you're gonna lose the opportunity and the colleague from liverpool UNK it up they shut a nursing college right
and that'll go on and that'll continue to go on
the major training is done in london
nowhere else will be able to afford to do it so let's not pretend that it's not gonna affect those people outside
the trust certainly won't train
that's an area where they're not gonna get involved unless there's an awful lot of money and yes there is money for them for a training budget but certainly not enough to cover what would be lost if UNK and let's face it if they win UNK it will just continue
the specialist units that would go cancer units heart units children's units
colleague again showed you one there was another one on television today
a child that's er been unable to have an operation because of the closure of the westminster children's hospital
these things are going on all the time
other hospitals will not pick up i don't care what the virginia UNK says or any of the others from the kenneth UNK he's the one who did the major destruction job on the n h s
he then did it in employment you know it's obviously now gonna continue i don't know quite erm how much more damage he can do on the economy but that's the guy who started it all
we've got a major problem in the health service
it's back door privatization
the are too few beds in the health service whether we like it or whether we don't and what they're trying to do is force people to use the private sector
that colleagues whether we like it or not is back door privatization and we've gotta fight to oppose it
thanks eric
c e c are accepting both these with a statement colleagues and i ask UNK to put that view for the c e c
UNK speaking on behalf of the c e c on composite fourteen and motion three o five

on sunday in his general secretary's address john UNK reminded everyone in the labour movement that we need to need to express our arguments simply if we want to get the message across
earlier this year i heard the whole of the debate about health care reduced by the media to just four words
it was about the debate about health care in america and the words were provided by an american reporter
so the fir four words need to be translated from american into english
but those fe four words tell us a lot about what lies ahead for the n h s in britain unless we're very careful
the words were coverage and cost containment
by coverage they meant the fact that thirty five million americans are not covered by health insurance
they are exposed to whatever illness or injury lady luck throws at them
and the free market system doesn't protect them because they tend to be too poor or too old for health insurance cover
either they can't afford private health insurance or the american insurance companies regard them as a bad risk to be acceptable
today in britain michael is looking for ways to make people take out private insurance against all sorts of possibilities
poverty in old age is one
health care must be another on his list
you can bet your bottom dollar
by cost containment the american media meant that the u s a spends almost twice of national income on health as the u k does but for no better results overall
americans are no UNK on average than we british
the americans burn up lots of their health expenditure paying UNK bills
today in britain's n h s we are spending more and more on accountants and fi financial consultants and less and less on health care workers
since nineteen eighty nine the number of n h s managers has risen by eight thousand while over eight thousand nurses and UNK jobs have been lost
all over the tories are trying to import UNK techniques
n h s trusts has been going out of their way to recruit managers with experience in private profit sector
they want bosses who will be in human american human resources techniques like things related pay and personal contacts
one very recent in those UNK at UNK hospital in west london has been invited to invited the staff to hand back this year's pay rise
in return for probably not making staff redundant
probably
i think it's their idea of a loyalty bonus
you pay the boss instead of him paying you
we also now have g p UNK
with these you can forget all you ever heard about health care based on medical need
their UNK is jumping over UNK to jump queue jumping to be precise
other doctor's patients are having their operations UNK in order to allow the patients of g p UNK to be treated first
money talks is exactly what we warned about
cash coming before care
congress i didn't look into any crystal ball
i simply watched an american t v news item but it gave me a frightening vision of what the future could hold in store for us unless we fight the tory policies with all our might we can UNK
that fight will be helped if you vote for composite fourteen and motion three o five
thank you
thanks very much UNK
as UNK indicated colleagues the c e c are supporting comp fourteen and three o five
we'll take the vote
all those in favour of composite fourteen
against
that's carried
motion three o five
all those in favour
against
that's carried
colleagues just before we go on to election systems er there is a meeting at lunchtime and two of the principal speakers at that meeting is UNK grant mp and billy
they're both sat at the back of the hall would you extend a very warn welcome colleagues
thanks very much
election systems colleagues motion one four eight one four nine motion twenty eight
now mo motion one o three has been withdrawn by the northern region
at the end of the debate i'll call ernie to put the c e c point of view in respect of the three motions left because they're seeking reference
call motion one four eight to be moved by midland
les midlands and east coast region
moving motion one four eight
president congress
last year at blackpool i moved a motion calling for review of the c e c election procedure
we agreed to reference back
we agreed to reference back this year
i asked the c e c and congress to re UNK the commitment given to us
the supreme body on this great union and the vote re vote in return reflects the fault in the system
postal votes are a disaster
the answer that our voting is no worse than any other union's is not satisfactory
we should be in the forefront and not compare our UNK with others
i'll look forward to a working party to be set up to address this situation
this should not be put on a back UNK
i move
thanks very much
is that formally seconded
motion one four nine midland
john midlands and east coast region
president colleagues i'll be very brief
this motion has been put up this year because there are changing circumstances which really do require us to give elections to the c e c deeper consideration
for instance with the UNK of branches we could find ourselves in a very UNK position of more than one members wishing to be considered as a candidate for the c e c
therefore it makes sense that the branch in the first instance should be addressed by these people so that we can make up our minds at that level as to who we feel will be the best person to start recommending to go forward
now i do understand that the c e c has already set up a working party to look into this whole issue of elections to the c e c and no doubt that will also include a review of the byelaws
my region UNK this and hopes this motion will be given due consideration
i move thank you
thanks very much john
is one four nine er seconded
thanks very much
motion twenty eight
midland again
peggy midlands and east coast region
president before i start could you er please ask erm at the doors if they could keep quiet a bit because delegates can't hear some of the debates
you me you mean colleagues who have gone outside and they're having a chat and a smoke what have you
yes
that's right
yes if ya can hear me outside we're watching ya
just keep quite while UNK speaking
i have had some stick this week
president er delegates
this union has done a great deal for equality
isn't it time that members standing for c e c elections were given the same equality with regional secretaries who as we all know all year round in all regions when a leaflet or a booklet goes out to members in most of them there is a photograph of the regional secretary
UNK obviously the purpose of this is to create an identity with the members
by UNK this an amendment to rule eleven you'll be giving the colleagues standing in future c e c elections the same facilities
i understand the c e c are seeking reference
my region has agreed to er reference after it's been seconded
thank you
thanks very much peggy
is that formally seconded
thanks very much indeed and i understand that the region midland region are prepared to remit one four eight one four nine and motion twenty eight
is that correct
conference accept that
thanks very much
so ernie will be very pleased to know that he's not required to er star this morning
section secretary's report keith process and construction section
keith national secretary
president and congress
it's my privilege and pleasure to present to congress the first report of the process and construction section
congress will recall that over the years i've made references to the close working relationship which was developing between g m b and our german colleagues
given this situation it's a UNK to report that the launch of the section in february was UNK by the signing of an historic partnership agreement with our german colleagues
this agreement is the most significant UNK agreement between two european unions in different nation states and covers some one point seven million members and i was most UNK colleagues with the er welcoming comments that were made by brother david from durham city central er clerical branch from the northern region in his address
erm the partnership agreement er arose from a clear conviction by both unions that positive trade union action is better than rhetoric
that it is inadequate for trade unions to merely pay lip service to a european prospective or to be UNK by the refusal of the u k government to accept its european responsibilities and deny rights to u k workers that are enjoyed by every one of our european colleagues
we UNK that strong trade union relationships on a day to day basis must be developed in a UNK form and this agreement provides for substantial trade union cooperation in the european community and beyond and it's already UNK the interests of our members and UNK the development of free and independent trade unionism in eastern and central europe and the former soviet republics
and the importance of this work colleagues will become clearer later in this report but at this point er president i would wish to place on record although he's now has to leave er to catch his plane the UNK to my friend and colleague who was here during the earlier part of congress as an honoured guest
he's one of the co architects of the agreement and there is no doubt that his vision energy enthusiasm and dedication cannot be over UNK and is deeply appreciated by this union
congress the section held its UNK national conference in april and unanimously adopted as priorities for the section four main areas of work
recruitment new agenda agreements health safety and environment and europe
all areas in which the section has got a proven record of achievement
because of time i intend to concentrate on the european dimension
now one of the first fruits of the partnership agreement with the germans is a successful initiative on joint training and education of officers and shop stewards funded from the e c fourth programme
it's a two year project which in the first year includes three large seminars and the production of a number of booklets together with a training video
the first of these seminars was held in march when sixteen members of the g m b principally lay activists and of those principally members of the section national committee and five officers UNK with an equivalent number of german colleagues erm at the training centre in
now it was the unanimous view of the entire g m b UNK that the seminar was UNK exciting and laid the basis and the foundation for continuing cooperation on a day to day er basis with our german colleagues
the second seminar will be held in july at national college and the third will be held at the training centre of the german UNK union in october
a union with which we'll be amalgamated within the next eighteen months
now the entire project which includes language training for all the union's activists together with the conclusions reached will form a handbook on training for distribution throughout the european community
now we readily recognize congress that there's immense prestige attached to this initiative for the g m b and over two hundred activists will have jointly UNK during the two years of its existence
colleagues the important thing about the agreement so far is that we have already destroyed the myth UNK by the employers that joint work across national boundaries in euro UNK are inappropriate because of differences in trade union cultures organization and systems of collective bargaining
this UNK all g m b members and not simply those in the process and construction section
the two unions have also devoted considerable resources to promote the formation growth and development of free and independent process trade unions in the former soviet block
both unions are proud to be associated with this noble and historic enterprise and share the view that this work is essential to assist the people in those countries to build democratic political social and economic systems
we're already seeing the successes
four weeks ago in UNK the executive committee of the world international i c e f accepted into membership from russia alone organizations representing seven million workers
wind up please keith
congress we'll appreciate the significance of this situation and i commend my report
thanks very much
turning to the report colleagues one seven three one seven four
yes
yep president congress
who's the biggest
keith
oh alright you go on then
certainly the cheek is anyway
no just quicker
northern region
keith i've had a look at page one seven four chemical and allied industries and i can't find anything in there about the recent problems that we've had at UNK and UNK
so i pa i turned to page seven one seven three the new section for the process and co er construction er section and i can't find anything on there
we've had problems at UNK and UNK for some time on a change of working pattern but this is just a modern way that companies have got today of de UNK people
now we got permission to go ahead with a ballot for industrial action which took place and although it was a majority for industrial action it wasn't the required two thirds majority
i do have to thank on behalf of my UNK committee er terry who gave us a lot of help and also the er regional section who also helped us
but when it went to national everything just gone
the question is keith from my committee where the hell were you at in our hour of need
thanks very much
yes colleague
thanks president
ken midland and east coast region
president i'd like to er offer thanks on behalf of my membership in the process and construction section on the false agreement it was a very successful week and just to echo UNK words those links that we made are working and we are in correspondence with the our colleagues in and we're picking that up in terms of recruitment
thank you
thank you ken
one seven five
one seven six one seven eight one seven nine
keith
yes president congress
in answer first of all i must thank ken for er his erm his comments
erm the delegate from northern region referring to UNK and wilson
i think what we have to understand colleagues is that this report actually is put to bed print wise well in advance of this congress
it doesn't in any way claim to be an absolutely up to the minute report of absolutely everything that we've done in the previously twelve months since last congress and quite frankly it just could not be that
so we do apologize but hope you'll understand er the delegate particularly that we just cannot ensure that the report has got absolutely everything in it
the involvement of brother terry UNK
i'm glad that you commented er so UNK about brother UNK er attendance at your headquarters conference because of course brother UNK is acting on my behalf in that capacity
when you ask what happens at national level well what happens at national level in these industries is that we have dozens and dozens of requests for headquarters conferences each year
i cannot possibly and UNK and no good other individual officer actually handle all those and some them have to be delegated
in your case you couldn't have had a better officer in my view to handle that situation
i'm delighted that you were pleased with the response
thank you
thanks very much keith
colleagues we now have a very pleasant er duty
i'm going to ask tom to make a presentation
thanks very much er president er to mark the occasion of the launching of the british er UNK association we'd like to make a little er presentation to barry who's the president of that association and erm who you know of course is the chairman of the institute of professional sport and the professional UNK association has got the honour of erm immediately being part of that er body and has the assistance of course of er the many people involved there
from the g m b point of view of course we have quite a sporting section and we're proud to have this link er with both of the organizations and we're pleased to have been of some assistance to the er british UNK professional UNK association er in er this launch and establishment we felt because we've got the scottish professional footballers who are well established and er are very much an integral part of the g m b and we've got the northern ireland er footballers we've got the rugby players and we've got UNK riders all of which come under
mick the national officer has been er the link between these organizations and i hope that the er professional erm UNK association will give some credit to the g m b in erm establishing themselves and we hope as an organization that in the future that they can be successful and we can be sure they will be because they've not only got the likes of barry but they've got many other prominent er UNK who will i'm sure establish erm the association in a very er positive fashion
can i on behalf of er the g m b barry erm make a UNK presentation to you this is the er first er picture that was taken at the launch of the professional UNK association
we had it mounted and we're proud and pleased to be able to present that to you on behalf of the g m b
of course will er go down the of history because it's their very first executives meeting
many may they come back
thank you
we had tried to get a couple of er here in portsmouth but he had to attend so we thought as we prepared for this conference this morning er on the miners that it would be appropriate to get a UNK lamp to put and have them simply UNK with the erm the memory of the occasion which turned out to be
president tom erm to president and congress ladies and gentlemen er i'd first of all just like to say thank you a big thank you for your support
the professional UNK association would try er many years ago and it didn't have the support of people like the g m b and the s p f
erm i know there are a lot of genuine UNK that are members of the g m b and i want to thank you because we just want to know that
thank you very much indeed
UNK er congress
just very quickly i'd just like to endorse what barry has said erm
i was when i actually UNK into the bishop of the other day
but very quickly erm i'm actually delighted that this organization has helped breathe the life into not only the professional UNK association we are extremely grateful
thank you very much indeed
thanks very much indeed barry and don't let anybody tell anybody in the trade union movement that the trade union movement is not moving
it's moving constantly and we're increasing all the time
thanks very much indeed colleagues
colleagues now back to the agenda
g m b trains a number of motions in this particular section two four two four five two four six two four seven and two four eight
there are a number of points of view the executive want to put and i'll be calling paul at the end of that debate
first one motion two four
southern region to move
other UNK if they would come down to the front it would assist
thank you
frank southern region
in the past congress personnel departments and management have been in the privileged position of using computer technology
in some cases using it in a re UNK fashion
to UNK enhance both their arguments and their presentation when dealing with us the trade unions
most of us here will have experienced graphs that assess the performance of the workforce expenditure and income of the company
most of these are a computer designed programs which effectively help our UNK reinforce their position concerning our members their conditions and their output
we advocate training for our members encouraging bosses to offer them more
we too need to challenge this and update our own training facilities for our activists
it's time to turn the tables on the management
the g m b and the trade union generally need to have at least the resources the management have
how can we do this i hear you say
firstly the primary objective for us as a trade union must to be ensure g m b activists shop stewards and officials all have access to training and computer literacy
and adequate software must be made available to ensure g m b activists can put into practice what they've been taught and use it to the labour UNK advantage
with the right sort of software package a world of information can be at the UNK of the g m b activists involved
obviously in the initial stages not all activists would have access to UNK but most will
in national negotiations officers should make a priority of the need for UNK for our key activists under facilities agreements possibly under machinery for negotiation
software could be designed in such a way that it can be exchanged and regularly updated including information on subjects such as c o s h labour law and industrial relations and social UNK within the g m b structure
what i'd also like to say is i think it's e UNK erm UNK correct as well for us to move into computer literacy and computer designed programs
i mean the am amount of paper pushing we do in the g m b is incredible
coming onto the second part of this motion language training
this is another area that looks to our future
with the present developments in european works councils across national borders we should be learning other languages
we will meet more trade unionists from other countries in the future and as keith was saying early on our link up with german trade unions is very favourable it's a very positive step
however will we follow the traditional british concept and ignore other languages being UNK at other UNK cultures and UNK
we need to set an example as well at this present time m s f are already in a position where they're training their activists in other languages
what we need to do is get our members and make them feel that they're part of europe not UNK by it at this moment in the time there's not a lot for them in consideration of europe
we need to try and make sure from the grass roots level up we have involvement
to coin a phrase by john i live in a very small house said UNK but my windows look out on a very large world
and that's what the g m b need to do to grasp the UNK to move forward
both these concepts computer literacy and language training are ways of attacking present UNK and UNK the will within our movement
support these motions for a better future UNK our grass roots has never been more important
i move these motions
is there a seconder formally seconded

yes formally seconded

why don't you want to formally second it

mr president congress steven brussels branch southern region
seconding motion two four
many delegates have talked about europe this week about the e c about the directors' laws and regulations come out of it
one general line of agreement between all delegates is that we need to develop our links in europe
we're in europe our role in europe can only increase
what we should be looking at is how to maximum our potential to further the trade union interests in the process of european integration because one thing's for sure
if the evolution of the e c continues and it will working people must be as organized as possible to ensure that trade unions are not forgotten in the race for a single market
so how do we get organized
we must continue to UNK links with sister unions right across the e c and what better ways to target our priorities in this area by targeting the languages training in the union
especially for young members
this union aims at increasing the skills of its members with various training and education schemes
let's look at how we can get tr language training incorporated into these schemes to give particularly our young members an additional skill to use in their trade union work
we must work together in europe colleagues
we must work with trade unionists of different UNK and language groups to make sure that european movement is united and speaks with one voice
the british do not have the best reputation for language skills in fact we probably have the worst
let's be progressive enough to show our commitment to sister unions in other european countries by giving our members the language tools needed for the european trade union movement
i second the motion
please support
two four five
UNK lancashire region moving motion two four five
president conference
the withdrawal of public funding for trade union training is yet another attack on the trade union movement within this country
in particular an attack on this very union the g m b
i say in particular our union because everyone here knows we probably have the largest and best training programme of any other union in britain today
but there is a cost to that training a large cost and to some extent the allocation of public funding money UNK that cost
as i understand it nearly a hundred and fifty thousand pound is allocated each year to the g m b
as that money UNK it will inevitably put more of a burden on the union
we need to ensure that we take the opportunity to look hard enough at the decisions which are to b er to be made to UNK how our training is to be provided
we've got a number of motions on the agenda asking for the c e c to look carefully at the cost of training at the national college and at the regional education courses
we had a motion which was put before conference last year and it was carried and it was asking for a similar review to what's being asked for this morning
the cost of training should be very carefully considered
in that review which is being sought in the motion we need to think UNK not just about our own provision but to ensure that a large scale t u c provision is maintained
the t u c courses that are equally under threat as UNK public funding is withdrawn from them
the reality is the t u c provides training for more g m b representatives than does our own training programme and very often at considerably less cost and certainly in my region where we have a very close relationship with the t u t u c the training is of a very high standard
we must ensure that the t u c tr er programme remains otherwise the cost to our union funds will be UNK
therefore we've got to review the training programme
we've got to grasp the UNK
yes there's going to be pain but it's our future what is at stake when we talk about the education training of the activists within this organization
i call for therefore for the c e c to bring back to conference next year a full report on how training should be given to the education and maintaining the activists of this union
next year at conference

motion two four six education birmingham region
john birmingham region moving motion number two four six
president comrades
in nineteen eighty nine mrs margaret thatcher said i do not see why we should pay for the education of conflict
and for once in her UNK life she was right
because trade union education is conflict based
it's based on the fight for better working conditions it's based on the fight for health and safety and it's based on the fight for fair laws
what mrs thatcher and those who followed her did not say was that it would be tory party policy to cause conflict in their UNK attack upon our movement
examples of their prejudice are contained within the anti trade union legislation passed and the shame of the treatment UNK out to our brothers and sisters in such places as UNK g c h q UNK local government and the present UNK destruction of our national health service and the attendant deaths that go with it
you look round you can see the results of this misery that they have caused on any housing estate in the country in the eyes of our youngsters condemned to a life on the dole
to our men and women chucked on the redundancy scrap heap
yes mrs thatcher spoke the truth all right but it was her truth not ours
in nineteen seventy nine the grant for trade union education stood at one point six million
that may seem a lot of money
but not when you put it into context with the vast sums of money spent supporting privatization or the salaries of over privileged so called UNK of industries that once belonged to this nation
the grant has not improved in any real sense to today's figure of one point seven win wrong one point seven five million and now it's the government's intent to reduce the grant by stages until nineteen seventy nineteen ninety seven it will be removed completely
this is the UNK of UNK truth passed on by major and his gang of UNK
it is the attempted destruction of our ability to educate each other
why should they be interested in our education
it's simple
the first line of defence for the trade union movement is you
you're the ones who defend the UNK and the disciplines you're the ones who prepare the information for the industrial UNK and there's no doubt about it comrades this one is aimed at you the representatives
if your ability to gain the skills and information needed to combat the many complex issues that you have to deal with is UNK then the government and employers will have what they want
a workforce kept in ignorance and unable to organize
this is the goal of the government's plan
you'll not hear from them about the confusion methods used to present figures on profits or unemployment
you will not hear about the inequality shown to our women nor will they tell you about the workers killed by unsafe standards
you will not see government courses on combat and crisis management
no comrades the only place you'll receive such training is with our union
no wonder they choose to attack it
this motion is about recognizing what they're up to and also the valuable service offered to stewards and members through our regional and national education courses
it's also about the UNK of your personal skills
many of you who come to this rostrum this week will have been trained in the democracy of congress before you got here
our training is the best that any union can offer
it's the training of equality the training of research and a measured approach
could you wind up now please
right president and a measured approach to responsibilities and trust that is placed in you
i call upon you to maintain and improve that standard to ensure that this government does not succeed in its attempt to deny working people the most valuable asset they can UNK knowledge
and with knowledge the result of fight for fair treatment for all workers
okay president
colleagues thanks very much indeed
thanks a lot
i move
thanks very much

motion two four seven lancashire to move
john lancashire region moving motion two four seven er the one you've all been waiting to support
congress colleagues i wanna begin by UNK that this motion is not about reducing the level of training the g m b offers its members
what it is about is using our members' money to benefit the people who represent them by moving the responsibility of training from national to regional level
that in turn will allow the c e c to dispose of the national college and in the process it should ensure this future is safe
we have real difficulties getting financial information regarding the national college
you will be aware that the national college UNK a whole page in the general secretary's report
from that page eight we can UNK the fact that seven seventeen hundred stewards attended a total of a hundred and twenty four courses in nineteen ninety two
that is less than fourteen students a course
also a total of thirteen thousand three hundred and fifty three delegates used it as a conference centre
in the mid eighties we invested our members money in a national education centre and now ten years later it's become a conference centre and a hotel and we're not fully booked can be used for training the stewards along with the occasional regional council meeting for the lancashire region
can i make a point to ya
normally or sometimes rather we use the college for our regional council and i think on the last meeting we were discussing the regional council members were discussing the er the amalgamation
and we were how we were gonna combat it and in the very next room were or rather holding a conference on how to do us in
but in our own college
congress the g m b is UNK for its ability to represent people
trust house UNK is equally famous for providing conference centres
colleagues the membership is going down the contributions are going up the education grant will be history by nineteen ninety six
the national college has now become a financial liability that this union can no longer justify
regional training is the answer where stewards will receive training based on the need of the industries they are employed in
this motion is not seeking to score points off anybody
what it is doing is hoping that the college our union's future will be secure
support the motion
two four seven formally seconded
formally seconded not formally seconded steve
i read no prejudice cos i'm not allowed to so
steve lancashire region
i'm at the rostrum this morning supposedly seconding motion two four seven
the lancashire region as the last speaker said has tried through the proper channels to seek full financial information on the cost of running the college and its UNK financial burden on the union
it soon became apparent the way we were being UNK about we would have more chance of convincing UNK murdoch to stand as a member of parliament for the labour party
so what's the UNK to UNK the information we want
all we have in the general secretary's report is one page
if you miss it it's on page eight
yes it tells us six hundred and forty seven thousand pound was raised to offset the g m b cost of retaining the college
the operative word being offset
what we wanted to know was how much does offset come to
in simple terms what does it cost the union to keep the college open
if it's a great financial burden as we believe it is that money along with the money generated from the sale of the college we will be better used spent on setting up regional ar educational system
now i know this may cause a terrible dilemma for UNK and bet UNK from the UNK of the rovers return and you may well ask me what's that got to do with this motion
for those of you that didn't know several scenes of the national college are actually displayed in UNK street so now at least you've got some useful information this week
now i've gotta tell ya that in itself is enough for me to say close it anything that's related to co UNK street
personally forget as i say i say it's enough for me
but seriously i follow this report along with the lancashire region the comments made by the mover of this motion and in the interests of financial UNK i urge the conference to support this motion
thank you very much
you're speaking in opposition bert are ya
well come to the rostrum i just wish to make a point first
now colleagues after the s o c report this morning i indicated that we had a lot of business to complete today and tomorrow
now most delegates so far this morning have in fact UNK with that
but we can't have a situation where people are picking and choosing because UNK want to do it
now i know colleagues some would like to stay till sunday or maybe even monday next week but we're not in that situation so i again i do appeal to all colleagues all colleagues you know to assist in formally seconding and to thank those that have done it so far
bert
yeah
bert the UNK one branch london region
erm speaking in opposition to the motion to shut down the college
mike in the audience and he'll probably give me a UNK afterwards cos i haven't prepared anything about this and i suspect i won't be able to speak till the red light
the college is not is not an ideal site for education
the architect of the college built the hotel a bar and stuck a couple of classrooms on the end
not UNK that i think it plays an extremely valuable role in the education and the training of our activists
it should not be looked upon as a cost as a burden but as an investment for our continuing prosperity in the trade union movement and more specifically the g m b
people like myself wouldn't have had the bottle wouldn't have UNK of coming up here if it hadn't been for the good work of people like mike and harry who in my opinion do a superb job in training me you all of us in this union
UNK within the trade union movement the g m b has a centre of excellence in manchester because that's what it is
as i mentioned those tutors are possibly UNK in the world of trade union education
of course we should try and cut costs
people like me in the past used to rail that we had commercial enterprises using the college
i'll accept that if we can nick some money from the private sector to educate our activists so be it
naturally i understand the balance of the balance has got to be kept right and we shouldn't sacrifice the training of our activists to get more revenue in by UNK it out to commercial firms unison i don't know the pet food UNK association or whatever
it's got to be kept in perspective
but i've just briefly looked at the education and training part of the general secretary report and it says here national college UNK a hundred and twenty four courses over a thirty week period attracting approximately seventeen hundred g m b representatives a wide range of residential courses
well that's not bad is it for starters
and there's something else you should bear in mind as well
i do understand the need for regional education because clearly it's less expensive but it's not just what you learn in that classroom at national college and any of anybody who've been there will know that
you learn just as much in the corridors in the bars in the grounds talking to your colleagues UNK each other 's enthusiasm and i certainly every time i go to that college i come back home full of renewed hope fire and passion
oppose this motion
two four nine birmingham
president congress
cliff er birmingham and west midlands region moving motion two four nine
this is addressed to an area which we seem to miss in our training
some four and a half years ago when i was elected as a branch secretary of a fairly substantial branch in the birmingham region i had two hours with the then finance officer and he said well it didn't last the two hours and he said er well you know all there is to know now about how to run this branch
if you've got any problems have a look and see what people have done before but if you make any mistakes we'll write and tell you what you've done wrong
i haven't had a lot of letters from regional office i've had one or two
er i know i've made some mistakes which they've missed and i've managed to put those right as i went on
it is difficult especially with larger branches who still retain some considerable cash collection i turn over somewhere in the region of eight thousand pounds a year which isn't bad in this day and age
i've got to advise auditors er how they can do their job
i've gotta advise people of the correct forms the correct er way of going about things and what benefits there are available
a lot of the benefits yes we know about
but there are things that we're not UNK er we're not aware of and i'm looked on as something of an expert so god help those people who come and ask me er what there is what forms they should use and what is available on the in the organization if i'm looked upon as an expert
what i want to for you to do is to pass this and for the c e c to look at providing some education specifically to the administration and the running of branches
let's become professional at branch level because at branch level is where we carry the administration of this organization
i move
motion two four nine formally seconded
thank you very much
i call paul to put the c e c position
a UNK paul
erm paul london region er putting the response from the c e c
can i first very quickly er congratulate sue and eddie on behalf of the london region
we understand they're about to or shortly become grandparents
erm well done er the only thing that eddie now needs is UNK 's UNK pack and all his UNK will have come at once
erm congress c e c has asked you to accept motion two four with the qualification support motions two four five two four six and two four eight and accept motion two four nine also with the qualification
we are seeking the withdrawal of motion two four seven
motion two four deals with the fundamental issues of new technology and developments towards greater union cooperation in europe
the issue of technology training is currently under review and the g m b w e a partnership in establishing the labour UNK training centre at national college for a pilot project lasting twelve months is proof of how seriously we take this subject
frank an initial training project er language training project in support of the g m b initiatives is shortly to start at national college
we really need a bit of time to evaluate that and that's the qualification that we're putting on that
the idea of financial and administrative training in motion two four nine is a good one
however it would be virtually impossible to force that onto people on the branch officers and we recommend acceptance again with that qualification
just er slightly UNK i come to motion two four seven which asks the c e c to dispose of the national college
we recognize all of us i'm sure that during periods of tight financial UNK most sectional activity is beyond examination and UNK inspection as UNK who moved two four five requested
but you know erm the training committee's view that national college has already achieved savings and approved efficiency while UNK maintaining standards and the huge number over seven thousand g m b members participating in some form of activity at a national college last year
the college provides a national UNK point for the g m b and to both national and international vis visitors UNK the best of this organization stands for
i think that the UNK of two four seven did not create or seek to create an intention of concern but you know there's something else that many speakers have done this week when they've come to this rostrum
they've talked about the way that employers that employers treat workers and do you know what that resolution does because it's printed in the preliminary agenda and i make no apologies for saying this
printed in the preliminary agenda and the staff who work UNK on your behalf all the year round see a resolution like that on the conference floor about whether or not they're gonna have a job at the end of this week it's not the best way to do business
i don't believe john that was the intent of the resolution i'm certain of that is the effect and i think in the interests of everybody i'd ask you on behalf of the c e c to withdraw that motion
if you won't i hope you if you won't then i'll ask congress to oppose
thank you very much president

thanks very much indeed colleagues
colleagues we now come to part of our agenda that's extremely pleasant
as i mentioned to you on sunday morning we usually deal with usually deal with this particular matter on sunday morning but we decided that because our new young members' section is growing in its influence and activity and of course we now have resolutions on the agenda that this now UNK er separate attention er on the agenda
and i refer of course to the g m b youth award
and of course if this union and the trade union movement is to UNK then we must encourage our young people to come through
to come through to become UNK branch secretaries yes regional secretaries and occasionally general secretaries of the union and we need more women
so i'm particularly pleased this morning that the award is going to a young woman and i'm equally more pleased that it's going to a young woman from the lancashire region
and i'm more pleased that it's going to a young member in the textiles section because that's a very difficult section
we all know textiles has had the grind for years and years and years and all our activity all our activists the shop stewards and the branch secretaries and UNK in that particular section they need a lot of support especially the young people
and in this connection the award this year goes to catherine who already has got a fairly UNK in the movement shop steward member of a branch committee trades council young members' advisory committee the national committee but i think best thing so far she's actually UNK the t u c young members' conference and that's an achievement for this union as well
so i hope she goes places i really do because young members and young trade unionists in this union are gonna get this union's support so go back to your branches and tell everybody that
we want 'em to come through
colleagues it's my pleasure to make the award to catherine on behalf of your union
thank you
er i'd like to say thanks to me branch for UNK me up first place for this award
i'd also like to say special thanks to me regional secretary ernie and also regional president UNK
er special thanks also to neil for all support and encouragement that he's given me
i'd like to say that i do sit on t u c youth forum and the g m b have the strongest most active youth section so let's keep it that way and give our young members all the support and encouragement they deserve
i would just like again to say special thanks to ernie UNK and neil for all their support and i hope they're gonna be first in bar to buy me a drink
okay now in this connection colleagues the deputy general secretary's report pages one o eight one o nine one o one two and one three and i call composite motion number nine unemployment of young people southern region
congress mr president steven brussels branch southern region
congress there's a very familiar phrase which is often used in the english language a phrase which many of you may have used yourselves from time to time
youngsters today it is said have never had it so good
you've all heard it and many of you may still believe it
but what young members what young people find UNK is that the same people who are telling them they've never had it so good in the same breath UNK them of being responsible for high community crime levels drug and alcohol abuse and the violence
but the funny thing which strikes many young people is that they are being made UNK then it is certainly not because they've had it so good
one million of them are under twenty five years of age a UNK high number you'll agree
this figure is a national disgrace and reflects totally the continued failure of this government to invest in high quality education and training for young people
despite all the fine statements that young people are the future of the country they are still a disadvantaged group and will remain so until they are made a priority policy target
one million youngsters unemployed colleagues what a waste of human talent and energy what a waste of a vital community resource
and imagine the UNK effect that this is having on them
young people three four years out of college and have never had a job
is there any wonder that their attention and UNK are diverted to elsewhere
but for those who do have a job it's hardly plain sailing
cheap labour low pay and conditions er poor conditions are all characteristics of the young person at work
they are UNK against because of their age
we can all think of spec specific cases i will describe just one
jim left school at sixteen joined a y t s scheme years ago with an UNK company
he was on the scheme for a year and then stayed as a trainee earning thirty pounds a week
he stuck this out for three years and finally qualified as an electrician in his own right
the same firm immediately sacked him because they would have to increase his wages and he's never had a proper job since
just one example of how vulnerable the young person is in the workplace
we can all think of other examples
colleagues young people need the special and particular protection of the unions
they must be a priority target group so we can prevent exploitation and discrimination and provide them with adequate training in health and safety and other matters
in this context the campaign for a minimum wage has never been more urgent
but this union does have a good track record in campaigning for young people
the young members section has come on in UNK and UNK in the last few years
young members have this excellent magazine issue which you'll find in front of you this morning
it is the only union youth magazine which exists in the u k and it specifically addresses young people's problems fears and hopes
my only criticism is that it doesn't come out often enough
we need more issues of issue mr president
but let's look at how we can increase young peop members' participation in this union at how we can address the problem of recruiting young people
fourteen years of tory government have taken their toll on the impression on young people's impression of trade unions
these UNK are more likely to be negative than positive or even neutral
never forget colleagues that there are thousands and thousands of young people in our society who are frustrated disappointed angry and in desperate need of union protection
they are the future of the g m b let's get them in and let's keep them in

motion two four eight
youth g m b scotland to move
g m b scotland moving motion two four eight
president congress
we must recognize the need to encourage a youth of the g m b to participate more fully within the union
the g m b is now the leading union in youth affairs
recruitment of the young into the g m b is essential as youth represents the future of this country as well as the future of the union
however the reality for young people whom we represent in the nineteen nineties is that they face the prospects of having to survive in a declining british economy
youth unemployment is now a serious problem in britain and many under the age of twenty five have never had a real permanent job
according to a labour par a labour party survey based on information from UNK job centres eighteen to twenty few twenty four year old out of work has risen by twenty eight percent since nineteen ninety
many youngsters have never known the satisfaction of being handed a wage packet and it can be so soul destroying for them
the feeling of UNK must be so UNK as young one as one young man told me we are the forgotten ones
this government is doing nothing to give them hope and their pride back
the g m b is a legal union in youth affairs
we have appointed a national youth officer and we have been there leading the way ensuring that young people have a voice in britain's second largest union
every region round the country now has a regional advisory youth committee and nearly all has an annual youth conference
more training of young members should be provided as well as distribution of literature aimed at young people
we must encourage a youth to become shop stewards and safety representatives
we must ensure that black and ethnic UNK are represented in our youth section and those with disabilities who are very often forgotten about
the youth represents the future of our country and our union
educate them early of the benefits of being in a trade union
we would also benefit from their outlook and their fresh ideas
the young will encourage their friends and UNK not only increasing the membership but mating making our union stronger

motion four three four northern region to move
president congress
UNK northern region moving motion four three four
congress any delegate who lives in a university town or who has a son or daughter at college can UNK to the special UNK that all banks offer to students
some banks colleagues offer twenty five pound when the student first opens an account
some offer a free UNK and others offer book tokens or record UNK
banks offer such UNK not because students are rich and represent good business to the banks not colleagues because out of the goodness of their hearts they believe students need a helping hand
no all of britain's high street banks offer special rates and free gifts to students because they know that those in training and attending college are a are the prospective workforce of tomorrow
they also know that once a person joins a bank in most cases they do so for life
in short colleagues it's an investment
motion four three four congress calls upon the c e c to adopt the same attitudes as the banks
not to give UNK but to invest in the workers of the future
after all colleagues general UNK the founder of the salvation army said why should the devil have all the best UNK
congress i urge you to support motion four three four
four three four formally seconded
thanks very much
c e c are seeking reference for four three four and i call paul
paul southern region speaking on behalf of the c e c
president congress
the c e c is asking you to support composite nine motion two four eight and refer motion four three four
composite nine is about putting young people back to work and that has to be a priority in a year which has seen youth unemployment hit the one million mark
our own young members' section earlier this year highlighted the plight of those hundreds of thousands of sixteen year olds who started nineteen ninety three without a job
this summer there'll be trying by thousands more as they come out of school and straight into UNK
victims of the government's youth training guarantee
the UNK seen scandal of major's britain a hundred and twenty thousand sixteen to twenty four year olds not on the register not in a job no scheme to join and no benefit available
a recent survey found one in six young people including some of school age earning less than one pound an hour
what sort of employers are there out there that UNK these young people
it's a disgrace and we should campaign and find out where these employers are and publicly put 'em to shame
what a way to treat young people
what a way to run an economy
okay so last week we looked at the UNK model of democracy which in essence of UNK theory in three ways
first of all it allows much more room for debate discussion UNK even UNK in UNK theory
a consequence of giving up the assumption that there's at least an easily UNK general will
so either you say there's no general will or there is something like a general will but it is not easily UNK and for either reason you would want to be much more UNK of the role UNK either as a way of getting to the truth or erm as a way of as it were making up the truth as you're going along
so that's the first difference between UNK model and UNK model there's much more room for debate and UNK of minority
secondly it gives up the distinction between sovereign and the executive in the sense that the people are not restricted only to making laws but they can also get involved in decisions about particular acts of will
so for example er on UNK model we saw the people are not UNK on the issue of whether the state should go to war or not because that's a particular act and must be left to the executive
in the UNK democracy the people would certainly decide that
the third difference was that the UNK model and it is perhaps the most UNK about it UNK democracy to other institutions of civil society including the family the workplace local governments and so on
now i discussed three objections to the UNK model last week
the first one is john stuart mill's objection which is that we can't leave everything to the people
at some point individuals must administer you can't have a committee carrying out the
committee
you must need some individual point by that committee and the same is true for governments
so it is not possible not practically possible to leave everything to the people
we'll come back to that objection
the second objection was the problem of agenda setting in a UNK democracy
how is it that the people come to be discussing certain issues
rather than other issues
how do those issues get decided and i thought there's no sensible answer
thirdly there's the old objection of UNK democracy that it simply takes up too much time and this is not a trivial objection because the thought is not that it's simply time consuming but because it's so
time consuming it's destructive of other things we value so that we value er UNK creation enjoyment conversation and so on
these things there would simply be no time left for
erm in political decision making
okay so much for last week
this week i want to start by UNK that first objection but we can't leave everything to the people
at some point we need administrators to carry out the will of the people
now the defenders of UNK democracy would consider this as a very weak objection
what they would say is that we have to perhaps we do have to leave things to the individual but we should leave as little possible to individuals as little as practically possible so that we should the people involved in making all the important decisions particularly the carrying out of them that we have to leave to particular appointed individuals
so erm we can cast this in a different context
we've got really two things in play here one is the role of individuals who administer and the other is the role of the people so we have a question of what is the proper role of the people and what is the proper role of the individual administrators
we've seen the answers from UNK democracy as little as possible to the individuals as much as possible to the people
at the other extreme we have something like UNK system where the people are given no role at all and everything is left to individual experts individual administrators so UNK system is at one everything is left to the individuals UNK democracy
as little as possible is left to individuals
somewhere in the middle we have UNK system where the people make laws but no do nothing else everything else is left to appointed individuals
there's a fourth possibility that we haven't looked at yet and this is a possibility of representative government where the people simply elect UNK the people don't make laws they elect the people to make laws
so in this case the people who carry out the will of the people make the laws on behalf of the people
so representative government gives some role to the will of the people some role to the individual to individuals but erm in a way less role
to the will of the people than UNK democracy or UNK all the individuals do is elect their governors so this is the idea that UNK called not democracy but that to of UNK
we vote in a group of people who then in this view mill's view take laws on our behalf
they also appoint administrators to carry out those laws
so this is a much more familiar model of democracy to us than any of the others that we've seen so far
and for mill representative democracy was the only way democracy could survive in the modern world
he particularly was concerned about problems of scale as a practical problem that is it may well be in a small town you could have a direct democracy a face to face community where people can talk to each other and argue with each other and meet on a regular basis but as soon as you get cities countries nations direct democracy of any sort is erm absurd
well and we have seen one response for people now making mill that is that his objections are not being UNK by computer technology they don't want to get back into that type of argument because this is really not the most important argument against direct democracy
to understand mill's view or at least to see why mill makes the argument he does make er i e not just the argument but other arguments which represent democracy
we have to understand first of all what mill thinks the proper function of government
and in his view governments have two roles
there are two things that governments ought to be doing
firstly they ought to improve the citizens both morally and UNK so it's the role of the government to make better citizens
secondly they have to manage the affairs of government well or rather erm so they have to manage the affairs of the state
what does this second claim come to what is its state of the affairs of the state well we should assume that mill ultimately UNK standard so that erm to manage the state's affairs well is to UNK general happiness
however it's surprising that in on representative government UNK barely UNK and that almost no mention at all is made of utility apart from in a very general way
however erm so two things to say about that i think we can assume
will ultimately apply UNK standard but he doesn't make much of it here and he relies on a much more intuitive idea of what manage things well and he assumes that different branches of government will have different standards of success and that we will be able to tell pretty much whether they're doing well or badly
now this is rather a UNK claim i suppose that erm the proper function of government is to manage things well i mean who would have UNK that but the other claim that governments one of the roles of governments is to improve the citizens is more surprising particularly for a liberal view and there's a more standard liberal position now would be that the moral well being citizens is not a proper matter of UNK concern
or they should the citizens should be er stopped from er attacking each other and so on but whether the citizens turn out to be morally good or morally bad in other ways in private matters whether they're morally improving or not is simply not the business of governments
it is surprising to hear that mill doesn't hold this view that he thinks that erm the moral health of the citizens is of concern to the government and it actually gives although he doesn't seem to recognize this gives a UNK to fortune to his conservative critics because of course they can say did say that liberalism was very damaging of er morality of the public and so we need a far more restrictive type of regime than mill allows us
and anyway i'm going to leave that on one side now because it's more erm a problem to UNK mill's views about liberty with his views about a proper government rather than directly about governments so i'm just going to note that and move on now
okay well suppose that erm mill is right that these are the two proper functions of government
given that he thinks he can demonstrate easily demonstrate the advantages of representative governments to show why
is far better than any alternative
first of all he UNK representative democracy with what he calls enlightened UNK which is really something like places UNK
now mill UNK that the guardian the UNK might manage the affairs of the state UNK well that there's no reason of principle why a very enlightened UNK couldn't do fairly well although mill claims that no UNK could do as well as a good democracy
i found it hard to find mill's arguments for this although he seems to be he seems to be arguing the point over several pages but erm we get pretty much UNK claims and evidence and so he wants us to consider those states which have been ruled by UNK with those contemporary states which have been UNK england versus spain say and he thinks it's obvious which type of system we ought to prefer
but he's got no as far as i can see he's got no convincing argument that democracy will do better but that doesn't matter because he thinks that the UNK criticism of enlightened UNK is that it won't improve the moral or intellectual well being of the citizens but if people are excluded from political decision making they will have no incentive to educate themselves or morally improve themselves or he thinks if they do if a UNK does allow for the moral improvement of the citizens then citizens will no longer accept UNK so that UNK is in a way self UNK here and if it one of the proper functions of government it can't survive
no morally and UNK well educated people will be prepared to tolerate UNK rather than democracy
so that's mill's argument against enlightened UNK
more interesting is his implicit comparison with direct democracy
now he doesn't actually make the UNK i think it's consistent of what he says that he ought to concede that direct democracy might be better at improving the citizens because after all the citizens have much more to do on in service of the state but his view is that direct democracy has the opposite failure to UNK that while it might be better at improving citizens it's absolutely hopeless in managing the affairs of the state and his reasons for that is that we need experts with experience in order to carry out the affairs of government and although these people ought ultimately to be held responsible to the people shouldn't sit in judgment them in every one of their decisions
so here he has erm quite a long discussion in the fact that if you have UNK people they will often make the make a quick initial assessment of a situation which is being and rejected by a more experienced person
so the experienced person will always be able to take the UNK person it's not as simple as that but if you make the administrators responsible to the people in all their decisions then you have as mill says UNK sitting in judgment on experience ignorance sitting in judgment on knowledge
so you have to UNK the administrators from direct control of the people if you if the administrators are going to make good decisions
the people just have to trust the administrators at a certain point rather than trying to er second guess all of their decisions
so a direct democracy will lead to a very inefficient running of the state
therefore representative democracy presents itself as the best compromise
it can manage the affairs of the state very well and it can improve the citizens
well how does it do that
why does representative democracy improve the citizens
because after all critics will say if representative democracy isn't the best practical realization of democracy but simply a UNK after all remember UNK comments on england the people of england think they're free but they're UNK they're free once every five years when they elect their UNK
now UNK then representative democracy isn't a UNK of democracy to make it appropriate for the modern world but a way of giving away all the merits of democracy
now mill accepts that representative democracy can be as bad as UNK it is but there are aspects of mill's views which make him sound very much like UNK as well
for mill it's very important that citizens are educated for their role and although participation on a na national level has to be something that can be restricted only to the few mill nevertheless wants active participation of the citizens in other aspects
so for example he's mill is very keen on the idea of local participation that everyone should at some point in their lives play a role in local government in some level
also he speaks very much in favour of jury service that he thinks that everyone is liable to jury service has a number of advantages
one is that it makes people er it gives people experience of participation which is itself an improving matter
it makes people consider issues from an UNK moral point of view
also it helps one in practice for voting
so jury service he thinks is a terrific way of improving the UNK
he doesn't defend it as the best way of getting the correct decision he doesn't defend it or he doesn't solely defend it that way he doesn't defend it either on the idea that people have right to be tried by their UNK for example which is the most likely defence now but he UNK jury service on the grounds of the effect it has on the UNK which is quite a novel erm
in fact there's been some discussion of this lately john UNK has argued that if UNK knew that that's why they were chosen to go on the jury it would UNK the UNK the practice of it because if you knew you were going on jury just for self education rather than to get the right results out the other end then this wouldn't give you any way of motivating yourself properly for the jury
well i'm not sure that's correct but anyway mill thinks that these ideas local participation of jury service are ways of getting people involved at the highest practical level of participation
so in other words mill accepts the arguments of UNK the arguments of the UNK er theorists that participation in government participation in public affairs is a good thing people should be encouraged to participate and it has an improving effect
the worry is if we allow participation above a certain level this will lead to gross UNK in a UNK process
so there's a maximum level of participation
societies like ours
he thinks this is an question but in small societies may be a much higher level of democratic erm intervention at all levels would be possible but it's only in modern societies that participation on a very extensive scale becomes absolutely impossible
okay so this is a rough sketch of the basic UNK now let's try and fill in a bit more details
one question that we raised a number of times is
when people vote in this democracy what should they be doing
should they be voting in their own interests or should be they be voting out of their view of what is right what is the good
it's normally thought that within the UNK tradition people should be required to vote on their interests
because after all the right decision is to find in terms of general happiness and so you would have thought that voting was the best way of finding out where their general happiness lies
so there'd be something rather odd about people voting out of moral motivation for a UNK because they would be voting their estimate of where the general happiness lies rather than putting their input into the sum from which someone else can calculate where the general happiness lies
so it's normally thought that within the UNK tradition voters are required to vote their interests and then the democratic procedure tells us where the general happiness lies roughly speaking
but mill doesn't argue this way mill argues that erm allowing people to vote their interests is UNK of them
if people are voting in their interests why not then sell their votes to the highest bidder
they have no obligation to use it UNK if their if they can use their vote UNK
rather he thinks that people ought to vote on the basis of what they think is right so he uses an with the jury service at this point
he thinks that justice UNK should put their personal interest to one side
so should voters it would be rather absurd i think well mill thinks that if UNK were expected to come to a decision on the basis of what they would prefer would you prefer this person to be sent down or would you prefer them to get off
that's not the question the question is it right for this person to be found guilty is it right for this person to be found innocent
mill thinks that voting is to be ideally UNK on this er jury service idea so that's another reason why jury service is so important for all citizens
all citizens need a highly concentrated er UNK in their lives where all they do is think about what is right in the circumstances and this will give them good practice good training to being an enlightened UNK
again i'll come back to this point about motivation because it's very important later on
so erm this is mill's counter motivation
he also realizes that there are certain threats or problems with democracy
some of these we've considered before but i'll tell you how mill feels on them
one of them this is not the first in the but one of them is that democracy may well throw up UNK
this is the point erm well plato made the point that the people we most want to rule us are probably the ones that are the least likely to want to take on that duty and ben williams made the same point the other way round that the people who rise to the top in politics are likely to be the ones that we would least like to have governing us
so i think i made this point before that the people who are right at the top of politics are the ones who are very good at UNK and so on and these are these really the qualities we want in our government
so mill thinks we need erm
thanks
mill thinks we need certain UNK to make sure that UNK don't present themselves
one thing he says which is erm a current topic is that we should limit the election expenses of any candidate
his thought is that how can we trust anyone who's prepared to pay their own money to get elected
if someone is going to put off a lot of their own money in order to get into parliament we can then we can hardly trust them to look to the general interests once they're there they'll want a return on their investment of some sorts
so anyone who's putting up a lot of their own money is UNK and there should be UNK on how much people can stand erm mill actually goes into some figures at this point and rather UNK says erm either fifty pounds or a hundred pounds ought to be adequate and i don't know what that UNK to now
erm so there should be a UNK of election expenses
in fact makes the claim that election expenses ought to be met from the public purse rather than the private purse of the candidates
tax UNK and i should think mill would be happy with that idea
although erm his second idea second way of limiting the possibilities on is rather more difficult to accept now and his claim is that we shouldn't pay members of parliament that people who go to parliament ought to be doing it out of duty and not out of er interest
what he says is that erm you know when he was writing of six hundred and fifty eight seats in parliament i don't know how many there are now but he says if we allowed for people to be paid then we have as it were six hundred and fifty eight prizes to people's six hundred and fifty eight jobs for people and he says and this is rather astonishing to hear to read this is that it will attract UNK of low class to er parliament if we pay members of parliament
well what about those people who are morally worthy i take it when he says low class he doesn't mean low moral class but mean low social class as well he probably means both things actually
what about those people of a low social class who are of a high moral class what about them
well he gives the example of a contemporary member of parliament mister andrew UNK who apparently was erm because members of parliament were not paid at this time he was sponsored by his constituents so they UNK to a he was so good they managed to UNK to and he thinks that this is the ideal solution if someone is really worthwhile then their constituents would be happy to pay their salary directly rather than have UNK jobs
okay so this strikes us as a rather UNK claim er he does qualify it he says that there may be cases where there aren't enough people of independent means in a country to present themselves he doesn't mean england here he means some of the dependent UNK and then members of parliament should be paid compensation rather than a salary
so in other words they should be paid the salaries they would have been got getting in whatever their other line of work would have been rather than special rates of the job of an m p
i mean it may well be that we have in this country we have erm pretty much mill's system because mps get paid relatively little bearing in mind what most of them could be getting elsewhere so maybe we've got something like mill's system but it strikes us as rather a UNK suggestion that mps shouldn't be paid to prevent UNK and lower classes becoming mps
okay so we have UNK against UNK much more important though mill is worried about people voting on the wrong motives
so i've said before that erm mill wants people to vote just in the same way that people cast their votes in a jury on the basis of what's right
he realizes that they can't people can't be guaranteed to do this and he points out there are four different UNK that people might have that conflict with the er moral UNK
first of all there's personal interest secondly there's class interest thirdly there's rather UNK some mean feeling in his own mind so he has the idea that people might just be rather UNK or something when they're going to cast their vote and go to some rather destructive policy
i suppose you might think in a case now you might think that er certain people aren't entitled to welfare benefits or something that
and vote for the parties that UNK them but that mean the sort of thing he doesn't make much of that
UNK erm there's the problem of UNK that is some people might be forced to cast their vote one way or another or feel they're forced to cast a vote one way or another erm which is something we are less erm familiar with
the reason why we're less familiar with that is that we have a secret ballot and so there is no way of knowing how someone has cast their vote and so there's no way of effectively forcing someone to cast their vote one way or another
however mill was against a secret ballot mill thought votes ought to be cast publicly and the reason for this is that he thought people ought to be voting on their view of what is right and so therefore they ought to be publicly accountable
people are much less likely to vote in their own interests much less likely to vote in their class interests if other people know how they're voting
mill also thinks this is a very good way of introducing female UNK at this point which he is very much in favour of if you had a if you had a vote on it should if you vote if er there was a vote among the male UNK about whether women should be given the vote and there was a public ballot then it's very unlikely they would vote against the extension of franchise because their wives and daughters would be able to see what they've done so he thinks that erm the only reason for having a secret ballot is that you're rather ashamed of what you're doing and that if you have a public ballot people will vote much more UNK
now mill realizes that the objection to this is the last problem UNK that if people's votes are known then some people might be able to put pressure on others to vote one way rather than another and as i said why the secret ballot was brought in the first place
for mill's view is that UNK is now less of a worry than people voting on their class interest or their personal interest
er here erm you can form your own views about whether mill's right or wrong i mean that the situation of a secret ballot was brought in to erm overcome as one where the local UNK who employed half the member of the town was also standing for parliament
now erm in this case would your job be safe if your vote was known and you didn't vote for your boss
i mean it seems to me in those cases a secret ballot is highly desirable and UNK would be more of a danger than people voting er from the mo wrong moral motivation
but it might just be that we can't have both and we can't ensure that people vote from the right from moral motivation rather than personal interest and we can't ensure vote
on UNK
erm at the same time so perhaps other UNK are necessary
now the other UNK have is one which is rather distinct of mill
that he thinks that erm of all of these forced UNK class interest is the most damaging and he argues there's a UNK for this we'll see why it's a UNK in a minute that certain people ought to be given more than one vote so that although everyone should have some votes not everyone should have the same number of votes
in particular he thinks the educated should have at least two votes he doesn't say how many erm that's a matter determined case by case i take it erm UNK it could be a thousand votes i mean he doesn't rule that out he doesn't say it has to be more than one er two but erm his view is that the educated to a specially privileged in a specially privileged position because they are erm more able to use their vote sensibly or to be given more than one vote so we need now there's going to be a question erm how do you know who the educated people are to make such suggestions anyone with a university degree will be pleased to hear gets more than one vote on mill's system
anyone who enters the liberal profession so accountancy medical and so on erm he made some other suggestions which we'll look at shortly
but there is something of a tension in mill's view because he thinks that erm it's very important that if there is plural voting then the people who only have one vote should be prepared to accept the situation so that the reasons why these people are given extra votes should be UNK that the public the UNK accept past critics have pointed out if that's going to be the case why is it necessary to give these people extra votes give the educated actual votes because if the UNK accept that the decisions of the educated are worth more than their own decisions the opinions of the educated are worth more than the opinions of the UNK if they really do accept that what's to stop them just following the decisions of the educated in their own vote
why not simply take advice
so there's no reason why these people should be given more votes rather their superior status can be recognized by giving them more informal influence
i was actually astonished to find mill making exactly this argument against another proposal in erm a later chapter because he considers a possibility and some people have put forward the view apparently i haven't heard of this erm in the version that mill UNK that the two stage action where we vote for people who then go to vote for the members of parliament so the individual people don't vote directly for members of parliament but they vote for people who then have elections an election among themselves
this is rather like the american system of presidential elections except that in the american system the people who are voted for are tied to a particular candidate so it's really just erm a UNK way of having a direct system rather than a genuinely indirect system here
but mill considers what reasons could there possibly be for having this two stage process
the arguments given in favour is that we vote for the wise and then the wise go on to make a proper final decision about who's best
mill says exactly what i just said in response of him that is if the people are prepared to accept these why what's to stop them consulting and asking for advice about how they should cast their vote and so mill later on gives a response to his own suggestion about plural voting in effect without realizing that what he's done
anyway that's not important the important thing is that he makes this idea that the educated should be erm given plural votes in order to protect democracy being distorted by class interest
now the most important threat to democracy and the way in which class interest may establish itself is mill thinks through UNK and this is the most er challenging threat to democracy
the numerical majority he says may just not have the intelligence to make the right decisions and what he's particularly concerned about is that the UNK poor who he calls the numerical majority will vote to UNK property
now his argument against this is not that actual right to property but it's actually against the interests of the UNK poor to UNK property
if property is UNK then the economy will so he uses some sort of incentive argument here and maybe some sort of UNK here that inequalities are necessary to make the worse off better off than they would have been without them but he thinks the UNK poor may well be too stupid
to understand this so they may go to their immediate selfish interest rather than their long term interest
there's a further point that the effects of the policy may not strike in the first generation anyway it may be long term before er UNK of property has the effect and other things so these people might vote in their own class interest against the interest of future generations
now mill seems to be very unsure what to do about this because he doesn't want to say that the poor should be UNK because after all everyone is entitled to their say in government but he does seem to be worried that if the poor are given an equal say or the UNK poor are given an equal say then they will make a very bad decision a decision which is against their own interests and this is one reason why he favours plural voting because he recognizes that the numerical majority might make a erm wrong decision so we should make sure that the numerical majority don't have UNK in a democratic process by giving another client more weight in it so he seems to between wanting to UNK them altogether which he seems to consider and just UNK their vote by giving other people more votes
in fact one thing he says er which might make you doubt his motives somewhat is that the reason for giving people more than one vote is that they're more educated but in general there is also a rough correlation between property ownership and education and so there's a good reason to give the property owners more than one vote people who own a lot of property more than one vote
now he says that someone who doesn't hold much property can prove that they're educated they should get the extra votes too but you don't seem you don't have to prove that you're er educated if you're rich you just get the votes anyway because that's a good
now actually mill did put the his erm this proposal forward he was a member of parliament for a few years and he was trying to get this discussed in parliament
no one seemed very interested in it
well what this springs up is the issue one of the issues we started with which is democracy in the UNK of the majority is what mill recognizes is that a UNK well he claims to be concerned that the majority will make a decision which is against the interests of everyone but he's equally concerned about the issue that the majority might make a decision which is against the interests just of a picked on minority people with unpopular views people who hold er members of a different religion and so on
so erm mill wants to protect minority from within the democratic procedure that is he wants to set up erm a system of democracy which is as it were proof against majority UNK
one way in which he does that he thinks is by plural voting that you give the educated more than one vote he says we have to make sure the educated don't form their own class with their own class interests but giving the educated a bigger say will lead us to make better decisions he thinks
but he also UNK a very elaborate system of proportional representation with a single UNK vote erm this is in the chapter called voting erm it seems to me actually his system is UNK but he doesn't think that i mean he argues very strongly in favour of it and various it
his idea is that you can vote if the UNK in your UNK if a person you vote for in your own constituency loses you can then switch your vote to anyone else in the country and erm you can have a list of maybe ten or twenty people and erm you will so you'll hand in your ballot paper with all these names on signed ballot paper because it has to be public you can hand in your signed ballot paper with all these names on and if your own candidate loses then er your vote goes to your second person and if that person loses it goes to the third and so on
the UNK i think is that you can't ever say that anyone has lost because you don't know what's happening in the second and third and fourth erm batch so i can't see how this system is meant to work mill seems to be fairly confident that it will
so he has an interesting idea that we can set up democratic procedures to protect the minority within those procedures so that UNK of the majority is something that UNK only certain types of UNK but if we have other types of UNK then we can protect the minority and the idea for proportional representation is often claimed in this light but actually it doesn't work as an idea because although it allows a minority to be represented is a different from being protected and so even if there's a member of parliament with the one member of parliament with your unpopular views that doesn't mean that your unpopular views won't be made illegal say because the fact that there's one member of parliament won't mean that
so his procedure doesn't work
there are other ways people have tried to protect the minority one is by saying that the that you can generate a certain set of rights from within the democratic procedure in a different way that is if UNK people need certain UNK people need to express their own opinions people need to be able to do what erm UNK where they need to and so on but more common is the view that democracy should be limited by constitutional would present the minority and this is a view that mill doesn't really defend in representative government although it seems to be very close to his view and on liberty that is we limit the UNK that this government has control over so we can't so in this view erm democracy is given a very limited role
it's very interesting to note that in contemporary political philosophy there is almost no room left for democratic decision making because in most theories that we're given more or less everything is already decided at a constitutional level i mean think of theory of justice it's the theory of justice that decides the basic nature of a constitution so the role of members of a government is simply to interpret and apply the constitution so they can make the most efficient tax policies given the basic constitution but no individual has the authority to challenge that constitution and change it by democratic means
to it's even worse i mean there doesn't even seem to be a government in the there's just a police force and an army and no one making political decisions so it's a UNK of recent political philosophy there seems to be no room left for the democratic process to do much apart from administer so the democracy is given a very minor role
okay so i think that erm some of mill's system he has given us and accounted them a type of theory of democracy but seems to me deeply by between two ideas one is that everyone will have a say in government and the other is they shouldn't be allowed UNK say if they are going to say the wrong thing so that on the one hand we have democratic equality of a source on the other hand we have an independent theory of the good and a democratic process should be allowed to UNK the good of the nation and mill just doesn't seem to be able to put these two elements in erm proper coherent fashion
so what should we conclude about our own system on the well we do have a representative democracy here it's very unlike mill's recommended scheme
we have no idea what people are meant are meant to be doing when they're voting this was a problem i raised are people meant to be expressing their interest are people meant to be voting like members of a jury
we're not told and it doesn't say on your ballot paper please be sure to remember you're voting on what you think is right rather than what is in your personal interest you were just asked to vote
so how can we defend the system that we've got
well it seems that none of the arguments that have been used so far would come close to defending the type of system that we've got
now critics of contemporary systems say so much for the worse for contemporary system we have to move to one of the other models maybe suitably amended and only then will we be truly free and equal
the best i think we can say about our scheme is something that brian barry argues
it's in a paper i didn't put on the reading list because most of it is not relevant it's called is democracy special and this in his collective papers
what barry says is simply this that suppose we accept the point that authority structures are now necessary that we couldn't have UNK we have to have
people in control
well in a modern world we've lost the faith that certain people are appointed by god to do this for us or especially naturally fitted to do it so how are we going to accept the rule of some people rather than others
well he thinks the only way that modern will accept the rule of one person rather than another is if they think they're somehow there as a result of their own action so we'll only accept the rule of erm our leaders if we think we put them there and we take them back again we put them there and can recall them and this for barry is the only merit that contemporary democratic policy democratic erm systems that it allows us to think of our UNK as having some legitimate claim to rule
without democracy we wouldn't be able to say who should rule with democracy we can we can say these people because we voted for them and that's it we can't say these people interests we can't say that these people act in common good although if they do very badly we'll try and recall them all we can say is they're there we need what we need is authority structures we need the structures more than the people UNK the roles someone's got to occupy the roles and this is the only way we've got of appointing them
so on that very depressing note er i'll leave we've got a few minutes for questions or objections if anyone wants to we've got some head shaking
right
er
right i'm not sure how
anyone else
based on
well everyone has everyone is entitled to vote and he also thinks that if the time is right when UNK women were property and he thought it wouldn't be long before married women to hold property too so he was also he wanted to reform the married women's property act
what's your own view in a UNK the way forward to democracy
don't have one sorry
er i was i was hoping to find one but er yep
right so there's a thought that somehow democracy ought to be self UNK erm the well i mean quite a long way actually two types of justification of democracy UNK and erm mill is defending democracy surely UNK and we might want to say democracy has its justification of freedom and equality
but we still need to know how i mean maybe in a UNK democracy we can defend freedom and equality to the system not in it seems absurd to say that democracy we have now is a way of embodied freedom i mean maybe weak notion of equality but nothing
no this is the last lecture
right well that seems to be it
thanks very much
can you tell us how you first became involved in the dispute
well i was working in the quarry and er it's last march turned round and said he wanted a new implemented with a new miracle saw that he had bought and he didn't really give us much warning about what he was gonna do but all he said was that er he was gonna scrap our old bonus contract and implement a new one no matter what and from various figures that were UNK about we all realized we were gonna back quite a lot worse off because of it
was the UNK implementation of the bonus scheme at that time linked t to the new s er the new saw table
i think so
it was partly with the new saw table and also he wanted to try and get more er UNK product out of the slate cos previously we had been throwing away quite a bit or giving it to and i think it really started as a family argument between him and his brother
in his brother in law in you know and er he was somewhat hurt that his brother in law will was getting a tremendous share of small blocks and he wanted to make more money out of them
h how did it become apparent that the new erm bonus scheme was going to operate to your disadvantage
well we certainly saw it as a disadvantage he thought we'd be er very well off with it
i think er through the figures that he was producing we all realized something was up and various computers flying around the place you know and the figures produced by them
that's you know it was all purely hypothetical the figures they produced but er they were comparing it to what we had pr previously been producing we all sort of realized that for a set production figure we could have been up to forty pound worse off per week
c can you give me some idea of er the level of erm i'll call it education the level of education people that were working er about the bonus scheme that er
well i think er it's quite hard to talk about it but er cer i th i think people were UNK that the bonus system that had been going since the quarry was started up again by 's father was gonna be UNK with really no consultation with the workers if you like and i think everybody thought that you know we'd been producing a lot of slate and been paid well for it previously and he should leave well alone
you know both sides were very happy you know it was up with the company or down with the company you know and i think certainly the younger lads sort of saw it as an UNK upon their future you know we've all got mortgages and the o older men who'd been working since the quarry started you know were gonna see a drop in their standard of living so i think you know people were getting a bit upset you know that a n a new fella h a new face had come in and all of a sudden you know changes were being made that were gonna hurt everybody financially
was the of the new bonus scheme the only cause for UNK at that time
i think so yes yeah
yeah i can't think of any other things that you know that would have led to us sort of UNK our labour e everything else could've settled UNK or through discussions with the union
no i think it was purely the financial aspect of the thing
when it became clear t to you that the bo the new bonus scheme was not operating to your advantage how did you go about representing your feelings to the quarry owners
i think almost daily there were discussions between our two shop stewards and the quarry owners about you know levels of production expected targets increase in production and all this and er i think you know through those daily discussions we made our side of the argument known and we told him that we'd work to rule if things weren't proper and if we didn't like it
i it's just the attitude about th the way he went about the whole thing
that's what upset us most
you know it seemed to be that we had a working rule that had UNK reasonably well over the years and all of a sudden he was UNK up various paragraphs that didn't suit him and altering bits you know and changing them round just to suit the company and all to our disadvantage
er you v UNK that you were in fact talking on quite a sophisticated level with the quarry owners in the sense that you were able to break up your argument into various categories as you've said
how was this UNK accepted by the quarry owners
erm well a at one time when we put various arguments to him he just turned round and decided that everyone over sixty would be surplus to requirements and er and sent down the road if you like
well you know we weren't too impressed with that and the next day he took that back and re employed them
but er no it seems strange you're dealing with a man who's got your future in his h in his hands yet he can turn round and do stupid things like that and totally just UNK the human aspect if you like
you mention the fact that er you were talking to a new manager or relatively new erm had w was the trouble if you like in any way related to the appointment of this new manager
well i was fairly new in the company myself so i hadn't worked for his father for long before took over the UNK or UNK or whatever he is so i i'm really not too sure about the whole thing but certainly for a quarry manager or quarry director or owner he didn't really know the slate as well as the workers and he was expecting things out of his workers and the slate the product that were really just not on
you know it couldn't be you know w we couldn't produce what he wanted and certainly the material wasn't there for the things he wanted to do and yet he seemed to assume that he knew everything and wouldn't take any advice from the experienced men in the quarry
was any attempt made by the experienced men the one who the ones who understood the rock and been in the presumably been in the industry
was there any attempt by them to ed educate him
well i think er he's of the age where he was UNK to learn
he thought that modern techniques could be put to use where in some cases they'd been tried and failed beforehand
i mean he went off to italy and bought at great expense a wire saw have had a wire saw for years and that hasn't proved successful
okay in italy on the marble it does work but on the slate it you know it hasn't worked and i think various quarries have tried it and found out that it doesn't work and yet he assumed that he knew better and you know little things like that you know he just seemed UNK to learn or UNK advice
was there any sort of attempt to er acquisition of expensive equipment now was there any attempt made to gain the er the knowledge of the workforce on what would be suitable machinery to buy
well i suppose he might have asked some of the fitters but i doubt it somehow seeing some of the acquisitions that he made from UNK when they were closing down there
and he probably asked the quarry manager and the under manager there
i know the under manager went off to italy to look at this saw
but er he never asked me put it that way what i thought was suitable machinery and he as far as i know he never asked other rock men what they thought was suitable for the rock and other slate makers what they thought was suitable for inside the mill or the diamond saw operators what sort of UNK they thought were the best
if you UNK been asked would you for what he actually bought
certainly the saw he bought for the mill i think that has great prospects and you know there's no two ways about it could help production and ease the work of the workforce
sort of in conjunction with that has to go you know i has to be tied in with a bonus contract that suits the workforce
and you know no two ways about it that saw was definitely a good acquisition
but various other bits of machinery which are now lying idle around the quarry probably would've been better left in italy or spain or wherever they were acquired from
w was there a feeling when the this saw table was acquired d did you have any feeling that it was a way of controlling the wages
no i don't think so
no
i in what way
in the sense that production could be UNK but your level of income wouldn't not be permitted t to rise
oh yeah i in that way er certainly when he produced the bonus contract to go with the saw table you know we w that was fairly plain that production would have risen in his estimates quite considerably and yet our wages in fact would have dropped quite considerably so yes i mean er it didn't seem quite to UNK in the way we would have like to have seen it
d c could you have UNK any way in which production could have been controlled apart from his down about a certain amount
well there's a physical limit to how much we could produce in a an eight hour shift and all the slate makers were UNK that the figures he UNK they could produce and what they UNK they could produce you know they were totally different
so i mean there is a limit to how much we can earn you know bonus wise
so i do don't think he could control it that much
but what we realized was that even if we hit his estimates we were still gonna be worse off
after you'd been erm in daily discussions w with the management when did it occur to you that things w just not gonna happen
well i it was i'm not quite sure we got the other two quarries in the company in the group of companies together and told them our problems and they said right okay fair enough we'll help you
and i think it was we were willing to go back to work and carry on discussions albeit without earning any bonus because we were working to rule at the time but it was what happened in er the quarry that really started the strike when he laid the workforce off because they were helping us or joining us in sympathetic action you know there was a UNK up there so i think that UNK up things considerably
we all thought right okay we'll get out for a few days and UNK come to a head get sorted out and we'd be back at work happy as anything you know everything sorted within a couple of weeks
unfortunately it was not to be
what w ho wh was the reaction when you decided you would work to rule
erm the management certainly weren't too impressed which is understandable
but on the other hand we were only working to rule we were working by rules and regulations laid down from various acts and negotiated er agreements
but erm certainly we were a lot worse off cos we were just earning a day rate instead of any bonus you know we had no bonus at all
so yeah we all thought we'll work to rule a couple of weeks UNK get sorted and we'll all be back to normal
you said that the other t two quarries were sort of l linked er with you
how did you how d how did it arise that there was this degree of cooperation
well i think there were UNK little points in all the quarries the workforce certainly hasn't been happy up in for a long time
in i think things have ticked over er various little things have been sorted but all internally without UNK to outside help
and because each of the directors seems to have a share in the brother's or brother in law's concerns you know we all thought right if they're gonna play the game together we'll play the game together and see what happens
and you know when after we had withdrawn our labour then various things arose in that needed sorting out and the bonus system there if we thought ours was unfair UNK was totally out the window
at least we were earning some money and they were ending up UNK the company money i think
was the degree of cooperation was it was it on an informal basis or was it er through the transport and general that you got together
erm we called a lodge meeting before the annual leave annual UNK and in that lodge meeting all three quarries agreed to go on a work to rule as from the UNK of work which is second week of august
i can't remember in fact if there was a transport official there
i suppose there must have been but i can't remember
so i think it started on an informal basis you know everyone was just a little bit fed up with the way they're being treated and the way you know been told how much we could earn how we could earn it when we could earn it and all this sort of UNK
so it started informally
what was what was the expectation if any er at that time regarding the effect of your action
well i think it the they've small UNK in each of the three quarries i think there are twenty in and twenty odd in and we thought well twenty men aren't really gonna hurt the quarry the companies the group of companies that much because slate will still be produced in the other two
so if we can hurt them or certainly gang together if you like cos unity is strength and between the three UNK they'll certainly slow down production and hopefully force things
lodge was there any erm were there any individuals who were particularly keen and had an idea of what they wanted and who were who were who were obviously older and more organized than the others
i think at the UNK we all thought it's not gonna last long you know a couple of weeks at the most
i remember coming home and discussing with my wife that another friend that it'd only be a couple of weeks and we'd be back to work
no i think at the UNK we were all well we were all UNK at the game if you like
so there were no little UNK little strike leaders or arthur UNK in the pack
so no i think er we all stuck it together at the start not really knowing where it was gonna lead us
why do you think it didn't fail er early on as a strike er a as the fact it was only predicted it would last two or three weeks but it was obvious at the time it was gonna go on
why didn't it fail
well had we given in then god only knows what would have happened in both our quarry and the other two quarries
i'm sure the system would have been implemented in the quarry and they would've suffered even worse than us
in their bonus would never have been sorted out
i think the whole idea of us managing to stick together for seven months you know th the fact that we did bar a few exceptions you know it's amazing
with the help of the women
ho how in fact di did you keep on go you said mentioned you were out for seven months
when it began to dawn that you were going to be out more than a fortnight or three weeks did anything emerge that w that you can see was to keep you encouraged for that period
i think as soon as people from outside of the community and the UNK community as soon as they started giving us support telling us right we'll help you both financially and you know physically and what have you know the students the women's support group when things started getting organized
you know then we thought right we're not just gonna forget about this you know we'll carry on for a little while longer and then as soon as the ball really started rolling er personally i thought well you can't back down now
how many others do you think had the same reaction t to you
erm certainly i think all of our quarry the quarry i think we were overwhelmed with the support because it was really in our place that the dispute started and a lot of other people who i'd spoken to you know they were amazed at the support we received and seemed to be the UNK the people you know the some of the lads they never spoke much at lodge meetings but after a while they'd be getting up and saying their pieces and you know i think it's just because you knew you had backing and people helping and urging you on advising you and the union helping and you know they UNK over backwards in various fields to help us
as soon as we realized we had such tremendous support and you know er right we'll give this a go and we're gonna win
y you mentioned that the that it was a great encouragement to you to have outside support
did it have you any idea why you had so much support all of a sudden
well people that i spoke to spoken to from cardiff they originally got involved because one of the lads used to work up in the factory the chairman of their labour club and after that i don't politically you know it started off completely non political but after a while people UNK on to it as a dispute that could be won and you know that would be one up for the workers and the country
unfortunately that wasn't to be i er we came a good second but there you go
people UNK onto it as something that wasn't a political strike wasn't being led by UNK what have you and it was something it was just for the freedom of the working man if you like and his standard of living was not gonna suffer because of bosses UNK i'll say it right in a while and what have you
no we we're not gonna suffer and we're gonna win we can win
you mention the fact that erm there was a feeling that it was a s because of the size of the workforce it was possibly a strike which could be won
yeah i think small workforce i mean twenty in our quarry if one or two back to work that's not really gonna help the management
you know if you got five or six thousand and a few go back to work you know they can start getting a production run going but because of the nature of our work everyone depends on everyone else
really needs the whole twenty men back to start viable production again
w was there a f a feeling during that period th you were going to win
oh yeah
yeah i was convinced we were gonna win
at the start but as things went on and just the fact that we never had any talks between the union and the management
the management UNK refused to talk all the time and after a while it just got depressing the fact that nothing seemed to be happening
how did you explain to your own s satisfaction during those months that no talks were going on that into com into communicating with the quarry
no there was just nothing we could do
it'd got to the stage where the workforce were not gonna talk to the management on a an official level you know we were still talking informally at the picket line and you know still trying to be helpful and offer our advice on what could be done to solve the dispute
but you know further up the ladder the union officials and what have you it was just they tried the council tried and all this and nothing seemed to happen
had there ever been a feeling amongst the members of the lodge that erm that with this in increasing involvement with UNK the local m ps the ministers of religion the er transport and general workers' union et UNK as well as coverage by h t v and the b c that there would be a kind of UNK of pressure and you would they would give in
yeah
we all assumed that because of the yeah the media pressure at least talks would start but i think possibly the management thought that because of this one sided pressure you know it seemed at the time that nothing nice was being said about the management you know you can almost understand them being reluctant to go into a room and offering their side of the argument
yeah i think had they given their side of the argument at the UNK then er things would've been different
but because they refused for one reason or another to dis you know to have talks with the press or television or the ministers whoever i think they burnt their boats
at what point erm did i er did it become an official dispute how at the point of becoming an official dispute
i think when we were as far as i can remember is when we were sent either letters of letters to warn us that we were gonna be dismissed if we didn't turn up for work or either when we were dismissed
er from then on you know things were really put in put into action
was that was that er on the basis of your acting c collectively as a as a lodge or was it again was it shop stewards who acted
no i ever every decision was taken at the lodge the shop stewards didn't run the strike between them and just inform us after every decision was taken by all fifty members at the start and forty members at the finish and i'm you know i'm proud to say that everyone was part of what went on
and it wasn't just a few people leading others whichever way they felt was necessary
you know sure there were committees to manage either financial affairs or various other bits and pieces that went on but even then decisions they took were taken to the lodge to be voted on
so in a sense everything that went on was erm fully exposed in a sense everyone
yeah
knew what was going on
i mean everybody knew what was going on they might have had their own interpretations of what they'd been told but that happens and as i said you know every decision was voted on by the full lodge of the three quarries
you know the decision whether we were gonna go back to work because of these threatening letters was taken by the forty well fifty members of the lodge so in effect i was sacked by people who had since returned to work but you know that's how it should be
was there any feeling when these letters were received that they were to be taken seriously or they were in fact a UNK
erm i think the wording of the letters was
oh i was in UNK of my contract well i dunno what it means to UNK some things you know i jumped to get a dictionary and found out but i really don't know what my contract was because i don't think we ever had any
but you know certainly the way the letters had been written and the fact that they became by recorded delivery you know if it was a UNK it was certainly UNK me
what did you decide er as a as a lodge whe when these letters were received
to be honest i wasn't there i was down at my sister's wedding
but from what i gathered erm yeah we were gonna carry on we weren't gonna be forced back to work cos had we gone back under their conditions then god only knows what i'd be earning now
you know about twenty pound a week i suppose or something stupid
when er when the co when the strike began to get into top gear can you give me any idea of how as a lodge you were organized er picket duty
right
when the strike first started being in the summer months we needed quite a strong picket line to talk to the tourists at various gates cos that was the main source of income at the quarry at that time
after the tourist season finished and various cars were either written off or collapsed or whatever you know whoever had a car was put forward as the picket you know er the leader of that picket er shift and then it was just a question of working round
i think we had twelve or thirteen cars so that was twelve shifts we could cover we had three gates to cover so and forty men and just shared them out and that was all UNK printed out everyone had a copy and on the whole it worked very well
you know we managed to man the gates in working hours and forced the company to shift slate at UNK hours in the morning and i think people were impressed that we managed to stick it out
you know i think that's the one UNK of having a small workforce the fact that if one sh picket didn't turn up you know all of us on your th the force on the gate if you like was er a third of what it could've been
or a half
had you never er prior to this had you ne had any experience of er
none at all
none at all
none at all
what was it like the during the first times y you went on the
it was it was fun when we first started because the weather was nice you know it was er you c take a UNK up and have a picnic and sit in the chair and read a book or whatever if there was no one around but after a while when it became a duty yeah it was hard work getting up on a UNK morning knowing full well that you probably wouldn't see any cars if you down in until about ten in the morning but you still had to be there at seven o'clock and UNK it down with rain or whatever
no it was it was hard work after then
in the erm in the early days how did you how did you approach the people who were coming up to the gate
i think from what i've heard every shift had its own little methods of trying to turn people away or advising them not to come in
certainly we just told them what the problem was told them that there was ever such a nice quarry further down the road if they wanted to visit a slate quarry
and for that i think are very UNK
and er we were UNK we tried to put our side of the argument you know there were the few people who said well i don't really care and drove in
well you know you win some you lose some
but every shift had its own methods
and i won't say any more than that
you mentioned that er after the time presumably when the winter began to come on erm became more of a an obligation how did you keep motivated to turn up
i think it was just the thought that if one shift didn't turn up or if people stopped turning up then others wouldn't turn up and it'd just UNK until everyone was just sitting at home in front of the fire and the quarries would function as normal and the fact well certainly with me i thought well we have to make an appearance to show people that we are still on strike and keep you know everyone who drives past us will be saying ah hello what's up with them
they'll be reading about it in the paper then trying to find out spreading the word and you know every time someone drove past the picket line there was a bit of bad publicity for the quarries and helpful for us
d do you think your perspective was a commonly held one
no there were others who thought sod it i'm not gonna turn up you know why should i
and i don't know certainly the shift i was with were very loyal always turned up and you know we ne we never had any problems
there were other shifts where various people after a while dropped out
but you know i think certainly the shift i was with you know i er i was impressed
the ones who erm who stuck it the ones who were always there who always turned up was there anything about them wh which could which could er identify them as people who were was it age or
no i think there were all sorts all ages i think just maybe some were more dedicated to the job and th certainly after a couple of weeks it wasn't family if you like you know family in inverted commas there
no i think just dedication and we if we made an appearance maybe something would come to a head things would get sorted if we just said forget it then stay at home then the quarry managers would say right forget it we'll get another workforce in you know it was i think it was just i think some were dedicated to the job and sort of gave it their best whereas others were slightly you know willy UNK about it and well i'll turn up today cos it the weather looks nice or i'll turn up today because the wife isn't off and or the gas has run out or whatever
ha during this erm this period what sort of business was being UNK in the lodge
erm well certainly tom would come up every week tell us what had happened if anything
unfortunately most weeks nothing had happened
and quite often it er UNK into an argument about picket duties
and the fact that quite a lot of people hadn't turned up on a certain day or that sort of thing
no i think it was just certainly tom tried to lift us or because over the winter months when nothing was happening negotiations wise you know he knew if he didn't lift us then nothing would and everyone would get so UNK they'd just say oh sod it and back to work or forget it and what have you
so er bu business wise i don't think much went on but he's more of an UNK experience
was his er presence would you interpret his presence as being fair fairly crucial for the continuing of the strike
whichever way i answer this erm it's gonna be
i think certainly we had to have a UNK to relate to and in my opinion tom was the best one to have there
you know when his boss came in then things went downhill but yeah certainly tom helped me and just the fact that there was someone there who knew exactly what was going on be it not a lot but he was trying to help us and give us advice and what have you
you know i think he was fairly crucial to keep us all together
are you more say on a more personal level was it at all obvious during the lodge meetings that people who were out people were out were under pressure to go back
erm i think at the back of some people's minds there was this pressure you know that's why a few did return to work and i mean i can understand some of them returning to work but not necessarily for the reasons they've stated
erm i think they probably thought their jobs were at threat or the continuation of employment in their quarry and the quarry would shut down which manage management had certainly UNK at yet which i considered to be a UNK because no one 's gonna kill the UNK that lays the golden egg
but in a lot of people's minds no i don't think there was that you know that threat
there certainly wasn't in mine because i'd been sacked
was there any sort of how can i put it any sort of feeling that certain individuals in the lodge would go back to work
yeah i think at the UNK of the strike there were a few people who were considered likely to be forced to get back to work or to go back to work because of what they'd said because of well just you know because of what they say in the meetings or because of what they didn't say in the meetings
you indicated that er in a sense the strike became well organized in the sense it had a great deal of support erm both moral and material and presumably financial
presumably
erm was there any w part of it of the strike organized in the sense of you giving moral support within the lodge to people who were obviously UNK
i think that's one of the reasons tom was there
you know he was always saying well next week things might get better
so stick together lads just for another week whatever we do if we go back to work or if we stay out it'll be because of a unanimous vote or a majority vote in this lodge you know w we came out together we'll go back together or we'll stay out together
he didn't want to lose people by the UNK you know and i think that was the feeling of most of us
and that's what upset us most about these people going back to work the fact that a meeting had been taken a few months before in which everybody had voted for us to get the sack and then all of a sudden they had been threatened and no vote was taken on whether we should stay out or go back and they just UNK back to that really knocked us i think
the ones who
eventually return to work were they in any sense UNK as a group
yeah i think they had their own little meetings in various pubs or whatever after our meetings and certainly the management in one of the quarries seemed to have a lot of information about what went on in our lodge meetings because of various members of this UNK i think we were all fairly sure that they would be returning to work it was just when that was the crunch
what was the feeling in the lodge when it eventually happened
erm we weren't too impressed er to put it UNK
but on the other hand we thought i suppose oh good UNK you know er rather than have a few er UNK people you know sitting on the fence we might be better off without them
but i think the number that went back you know because of the small workforce the fact that eight or nine returned to work you know that was virtually half the workforce in one quarry it made it quite awkward then
d did you decide er either formally or informally to take a particular attitude towards the ones that had gone back
i think everyone's got their own ways of dealing with them you know certainly some people ignore them you know i prefer to ignore them rather than UNK them er possibly because i wasn't really friendly with any of them that did go back i think people who were close friends have found it very awkward and i know even now they're probably looking UNK at each other you know that sort of thing
it certainly the community a bit because of them
did you do you think their return to work was in any sense crucial to the outcome of the strike
oh yeah
i think had we managed to stick it together a bit longer all fifty of us and just prove to the management that we weren't gonna be UNK back to work which seemed to be the way they wanted us to go back you know because the board had you know UNK you know i think had we managed to stick it together certainly the result would've been different
i can't say what it would've been you know what the outcome would've been but it would've been different
was there any was there any sense when i suppose it's one fifth of the workforce returned was there any sense do you feel er that you weren't going to win
no i think i thought we still had a chance albeit you know the odds had gone down a bit or increased but er no i thought we still had a chance it was gonna be harder because if we lost any more by the UNK then you know you're gonna be it would've been very awkward
no i think we still thought we had a chance
you mentioned about erm not being UNK back to work
erm which brings in the
oh yeah brilliant
when first started can you can you what you what you felt about it what you thought it was going to do
well i think some of the women and a lot of the men thought right well we'll just keep it you know between the men it's our problem we'll get it sorted
after a while we realized you know that's not on it's impossible for us to sort this out you know we need help
i think the wives found it to their benefit to get amongst other wives who were sharing the same problems you know how to pay the bills how to buy food and i think they seemed to get organized pretty well they certainly helped us a hell of a lot
you know without the women's support group especially and without other support you know we would've been UNK back to work
was there any sense in which a there was a surprise at the reaction of the w women that they first of all became very organized and were very organized and determined so determined
well a at the start of the strike my wife was just a little bit UNK that i was out of work but after a while when she fully understood the reasons i think i'd like to think that she was a hundred per cent behind me and the rest of us
and certainly by what she did with the women's support group i think she was
and cer the determination of the women that we weren't gonna be UNK back to work we weren't gonna be forced back to work we weren't just gonna end in chaos and some of us going back and some of us staying out i think it was the women possibly talking to their husbands or and just UNK each other you know that helped us no end
has erm as a lodge did you anything from the sort of organization the women had
oh yeah
i mean they UNK us no question no two ways about it i dunno what it is
i hate to admit it in fact but er no the way they got things organized got lecture tours UNK and what have you together you know i think er taught us an incredible amount
have you have you got any er idea of how i it came about that a group was so organized
i think possibly because there were UNK in the group i dunno
possibly because some of them might've been councillors and knew the ways that sort of er things went on and how to get things done officially and above board
you know we were all UNK at the game the workers but some of the women you know do it professionally had worked elsewhere knew how things went on elsewhere you know with the d h s or whatever
i think possibly because women are slightly more organized and what have you
you know they're used to a household budget and they know how to manage on however x many pounds a week
and if you take half of that away you know they know how to manage on that as well somehow
do you think that realization had s hadn't UNK until that
i never knew my wife was such a little get up and UNK if you like
erm never knew she could write such good lectures or speeches
you know she's been hiding her light under a UNK a bush
has any is there way in which you from your observation there you the erm there's been a in the relationship between the men and the and the women involved as a consequence of er this kind of activity
well i do i don't know really but er certainly i probably discuss work a lot more with my wife now than before and let her know what's get going on there
and probably other people do as well
you know because i think we all thought it was our problem we can sort it out
you know typical male attitude you know women no help at all
and after a while you know it was without the women we would've been you know nothing
what was the sort of erm help what did er did you observe was given from the support group
i think just the fact that my wife knew what was going on and knew the problems exactly you know they had their own meetings and the food parcels that they could organize you know i wouldn't have a clue how to go about it the fact that various shops refused to have collection points inside and they wrote off to the management of these shops and got that changed
no they just seemed to know how to go about things a hell of a lot better than we did
as soon as we realized oh hang on a minute you know they're not all bad these women erm no really we couldn't do without them
the it's been put to me to er interview various people or listen to other people if they can tell me about
mm
the strike that the old men
oh yeah
if he had been in charge things would have been very different
do you think that erm a n true statement
i think it's hard for me to say because i didn't work for him for long
you know his son took over shortly after i joined the company
certainly from what i've heard things would never have happened the way they did and i think from the sort of very short dealings i had with him things wouldn't have happened they way they did
whether they you know financially we'd be better off or worse off i really couldn't say
i don't think we would've been standing outside the gates
w what would be the essence of the difference then between him and his son
i think possibly respect for the workforce
you know his father had started the company and the men the older men in the quarry had been there from day one with him you know from when they were producing next to nothing to being quite a profitable concern and he realized the value of these men and that you couldn't just say oh because they disagree with you just well down the road pal
he realized that experience in the UNK industry is certainly something that you don't get rid of
you know fair enough some of the older men can't move as fast as a eighteen year old but on the other hand it's what they got in their head that counts
i don't know just generally respect for the workforce
but this er w this feeling of erm not being respected w do you think in that was in any sense a an important motivation for just sticking it out amongst the older men
erm i think they knew that if we went back under his conditions their days would be numbered certainly
you know he'd far prefer to have two or three youngsters earning considerably less who absolutely nothing about the industry than one slightly older certainly vastly more experienced man and you know paying him more
you know he'd far prefer to have the cheap workforce that you could tell exactly and appear to know what he's talking about whereas the older men knew that he knew absolutely nothing
was there any sense of surprise really that as the UNK was were UNK and most of the workforce were UNK that in fact things would come to some sort of agreement that there wouldn't be this kind of
as an UNK probably being the only UNK in the quarries you know i think they were surprised the fact that it was a local family i think that's what really rubbed them up the wrong way
er they'd been to chapel with them been to school with them worked in other places with them and it ended like it did
you know that did surprise a lot of them
but i don't know quite how the welsh UNK works you know as regards you know loyalty to one's nation or whatever but er no l looking from the outside you know i thought it was a bit strange that sort of next door neighbours could end up you know completely opposed to each other
do you think it w in any sense has damaged the community
oh yeah it certainly has
without a question
no erm er even now and the UNK been finished i can't remember four months or something three months you know the community i think it'll take a hell of a long time to heal the UNK and mend the UNK
possibly caused by people returning to work i think those are the ones that really opened up the community and dropped people on either side of the fence as opposed to sitting on top of it
do you think y er you and your mates who were out do you think you learnt anything from the strike
erm well yeah i've learnt that my wife is more use than just in the kitchen
no i think all of a sudden you l you realize why you're in a trade union and why you need the press and the media to help you know you can't just ignore them
and also why you've got to talk to people you know get your problems out in the open rather than let them build up and all of a sudden just say right that's it out the gates or down tools
and i think you know the management ought to learn hopefully they will learn a bit by that as well
you i UNK from that you er s you saying that if the same thing this is this is that if the same thing were to occur again your approach would be and you'd be more of a UNK in the handling of it
oh yeah
i mean second time around you know what's gonna go on
mm
and i know full well now what it's like to be standing on a picket line for seven months
and it's not something that i enjoy so that you'll try every which way to try and avoid it
but if a matter came to a head that UNK my labour was the only way to resolve it that i thought was the only way to resolve it i'd go out and do it again
in those early days was there a feeling that withdrawal of labour would in fact bring about the effect that you wanted
oh yeah
just chatting with some of my mates you know oh it'll be over in a couple of weeks
that was always the way we thought
but that was not to be
was there any sp special way in which you contributed to the in the strike any particular skills you were called upon to
well everyone seemed to think that i knew what i was doing with a computer so the shifts the picket shifts were left up to me any facts and figures needed databases addresses were left up to me
any UNK and things
but no i think er they thought i could speak english better than some of them themselves so they sent me off to english universities or wherever to put across our problems
right good morning has everybody got two handouts one called can you all hear me okay
oh it's the first time i've used one of these so you should have two handouts one called advocacy guide one called advocacy criteria guide
has everybody got t those two handouts
okay a couple of before we start
if you haven't picked up these two UNK that are on the table outside can you do so some time today okay
so by the end of today make sure you've got those
also just a reminder next week you won't have a lecture at this time
your lecture will be at eleven o'clock that's for next monday
right some of you know me some of you don't
for those who don't my name is
erm and i'm going to be talking to you this morning about advocacy
now you may not realize it but you've been in civil litigation and criminal litigation you've been doing advocacy all term
because what is advocacy
presentation collection of information preparation of information
it's not just standing in court
advocacy is the skill of good presentation and information and that starts on the day that you first interview a client
it goes on when you're actually preparing statements UNK pleadings all those things which will eventually be used in court
it's not just the end result of standing up in court and representing a client
but this part of the course that we're specifically calling advocacy will concentrate on that part of the skill of advocacy of the actual standing up and presenting information
why do you need to know advocacy skills
one of the reasons is because the law society says you've got to have advocacy skills and you'll find in your manual the actual amount or degree of advocacy skills you will eventually have to learn
this is what you might call phase one within the l p c
phases two and three you will have during your training contracts
some of you might be thinking well i'm never going to advocate i never intend to go anywhere near a court
even if you don't the skill of advocacy the skill of thinking UNK presenting clearly is a useful skill even if you never actually use it in the UNK
in meetings in presentations of all kinds the skill is useful
those of you going into large practices may think well i'll never advocate counsel will do it but times are changing
large practices are more and more expecting their solicitors to do their own advocacy and not instruct counsel
some large practices are beginning to put themselves forward as specialist UNK for smaller firms who can't UNK in that way
so whichever sort of practice you're going into you may at some point be required to advocate in some sort of court setting
as i mentioned you've been getting some advocacy experience although you might not have realized it in litigation already
when it comes to the summer in your options that you take there you will to a lesser or greater extent get some more advocacy experience during the summer
but we're concentrating this week and next week on the advocacy skill of standing up before a court
what's advocacy about
is it just the contents
is it the presentation of information
or are there lots of other things that you need to be aware of
this is the impact that a speaker has when they stand up and speak to a group of people
only seven percent of the words that they speak of their impact based on the words they speak thirty eight percent is based on their voice and the way that they present that information
fifty five percent are all the other messages that you're giving out by the way you stand the way you dress etcetera
so when you think about when you're preparing for your advocacy exercises the actual content that you prepare although important is not going to have the maximum impact
the maximum impact is going to come from the way you stand lots of other things the way you speak that's based on various studies that were done
they weren't on court UNK so i would imagine in a court situation perhaps the impact of words is slightly higher you might expect but it's still going to be a low percentage in respect of the overall UNK image that's put over
so when you are preparing you need to think about the words you use
they need to be clear they need to be simple words they don't need to be complex ones because you've got to put over what you're saying very clearly
to be effective you've got to structure the information that you give
you will be getting UNK and you won't be expected to put all that information over in one block you're expected to structure your information
you also need to develop a persuasive line of argument and we'll come back to those things later on
so let's consider for a moment what are the UNK the other UNK that an advocate needs
i'm just going to put the video on for a moment thank you
i'm sorry it stops before the jokes start
i'm afraid no matter how good your advocacy performance is you're never going to get an UNK like that and we won't expect you to do it in front of that size of audience either
so the reason i put UNK up here is just to think for a moment here's somebody who's obviously a really effective and great UNK
but could you send UNK out to court
okay then you would all agree you've got to put him through the old p c course
why can't you
why can't you send him down to court
what have you got to change about him
his coat yes
so the way he's isn't it the way he's dressed for that is fine but you can't send him down to court like that
the er facial expressions are perhaps over the top for court
sorry the UNK version right so what have you got what have you got to change about him
what have we got to change about ourselves
we've got to think about the way we dress
dress is not going to be compulsory
well dear i suppose you really would make an impact then wouldn't you
erm but we won't well we're not going to be descriptive we're not going to ask say that you must wear suits or you must whatever
but our experience is that this sort of ad this sort of presentation interviewing those sorts of things they're very different forms of presentation
but this form of presentation which needs to be quite formal what other students have found is that if you dress formally actually it helps you to act formally because this sort of presentation is going to be very different
right so what are we going to ch we're going to change the way he dresses we're going to change the UNK various things like that
one of the things you you've got to do is get used to actually talking standing up and the first thing you do you find when you s talk standing up is you discover that you've got hands
i talk with my hands
many people talking with their hands
and you've got feet and you move around
and you've got hair that falls in your face and you sort of and all those things you've got to learn to cope with because if you're worried about what you're doing with your hands or your feet or your hair then you can't then concentrate on putting over your information effectively
so when you're practising bail application and i'll talk about that in a moment think about what you're going to do how you're going to stand
those of you who saw today will know that he calls this position the adam and eve position
and then there's the prince philip position
or there's holding anything that keeps your hands under control
if you know you tend to talk with your hands how're you gonna keep them under control
the other thing that tends to throw people the first time they every do ad advocacy is that you're going to talk to somebody who will not talk to you who will not s possibly even smile at you who won't give you the usual feedback that we're u that we're used to when we're talking to someone
so be prepared for that be prepared that the person you're going to talk to is not gonna give you that usual to and fro feedback and don't be thrown by that
preparing try not to use scripts
when you're preparing what you're going to say use notes and i've given you some guidance in the handout on using notes
why not use a script
because if you're speaking from a script you're going to be speaking like this
you can't make eye contact if you're speaking to a piece of paper
you can't be persuasive if you're speaking to a piece of paper if you're reading from a script
also what you generally find is that if somebody is reading as opposed to UNK their memory from looking at a piece of paper and then letting it flow if they're reading from it it's dull it lacks UNK
the words may be brilliant the sentences may be perfectly constructed but it hasn't got that life in it that the more spontaneous talking will have and it's less persuasive
those of you who've done some advocacy before may have used UNK
you will not be getting UNK this time around
the reason we've elected not to give you UNK is you'll never get UNK in real life
if you go into a real court there aren't UNK
so you've got to get used to advocating with just an ordinary table and how do you do that
how do you cope with that
again if you're going to be using notes you don't want to be talking down to a table so think about whether you're s you're going to in your practising are you going to let your eyes flick down to your notes that're on the paper on the table or are you gonna pick them up
are you going to just have them in front of you so you can flick your eyes up and down to remind yourself what you're next going to say
don't hold them too far up
remember in your content that you're representing a client
the court isn't really concerned about your views it's concerned about your client and the argument you can UNK for the client that you're representing
be realistic about your client's position
don't try to paint a picture of your client being the perfect citizen if he's not the perfect citizen
the other thing to remember you're trying to persuade the court to your views or the view that you're putting forward for your client you're not telling the court what they must think
you're putting over information on the basis that the only thing that a t an intelligent person think i'm saying to you now what's going to be the effect of that on the UNK
if somebody says you must think this the only way of doing it is that's not going to be persuasive
so you've got to think in terms of persuasion
right what are we going to expect you to do
the first exercise you're doing is a bail application
and the timetable for that will be going out on the UNK some time this afternoon
now some of you will be doing your bail application on wednesday and some on friday
because and you'll be given the instructions for those in your small group sessions today
because the we can't put all of you into that're doing advocacy into one small group session you may find yourselves with a different tutor or at a different time to when you would normally have your small group session
so be careful to make sure you find your number on the timetable and know where you're going and who you're going to be with
also you're going to be doing it in fours so four will you four of you will arrive at the beginning of the session and four of you will arrive half way through
and those of you who ar who arrive half way through will need to wait outside
all the times that you need to arrive at you will find on the timetable
the first session is designed to be one that gives y gets you UNK to advocacy to be non threatening and to be one where you can simply literally find your feet and get used to advocating in that way
you won't be given a great deal of feedback in that session just enough to get you going
the majority of the feedback you're going to get to help you find your advocacy skills will be after the UNK litigation that you'll do next week
i think you were all given a timetable last monday which showed where the various advocacy things are going to be
so this week you'll do a three minute application you'll see the way in which th that's going to be done from the instructions in the small group session that you'll get today
non threatening try and relax just try and get used to standing on your feet
it will be UNK to se you'll make two applications within that small group session and a second will be UNK but only for you to see so that you can take it away and try and learn from er seeing yourself on video
the second advocacy exercise is on that first er timetable called UNK
you'll be given a ro a pair of you will be given a room on your own and a video camera and asked to practise advocacy skills plea in UNK
and the second ad the third advocacy will be the UNK when you'll do it with a tutor and then have separate individual feedback given to you
when you come to the small group session this week you'll need to bring with you your video tape
make sure it's at a point on the video tape where it can be recorded immediately because there won't be time to find the right point and also make sure you bring with you a watch because you're going to need to be very tight on times so try and remember to bring a watch with you
all the pieces of advocacy that we're going to ask you to do are short
three or four minutes is all that we're going to ask you to do each time
one of the reasons for that is that one of the skills of the advocate is to learn to be concise and to get over the message very quickly and that's one of the reasons for giving you a short period of time
the other thing that's available to you in making your preparation is a video of local UNK
it will be available from tomorrow morning
you'll be able to borrow it from the office downstairs and view it in the library
on that video you'll find three local UNK
they on that video are bill er bail applications for plea in UNK applications and three examples of how not to make an application before the court
all three are very experienced UNK before the courts but all three of them have deliberately done one application wrong so you can see the typical things that UNK do that should not be done
and i think if you look at that video it will actually perhaps encourage you because it sh yes those are experienced UNK i'm not expecting you to UNK your skills to that level but i think if you see the erm the level of which experienced UNK advocate at it will actually perhaps make you relax a little if you see the stand realize that the standard we're expecting you to go to is not anywhere near quite as high as that
i'm going to show you an UNK now from that video
the full video will be available tomorrow morning
please your worship this is a most unfortunate case
my client's a young man of thirty six years of age
he appears before the court for the first time for what is essentially a domestic assault on his girlfriend
perhaps i can give you some of the background to this particular matter
my client and his girlfriend have been together for some six year they have three children aged six five and four
they originally lived in the home counties but came up to this area two years ago
er my client has been in business at the u his own firm supplying computer software in a specialized market that is stock control systems for clubs pubs and UNK
you can imagine this has meant him working very long hours one of the other problems he has is he suffers from UNK
working long hours also means that er he also gets very tired and as he now UNK when he's tired he tends to be short UNK
that then is the background to this particular incident
because of his working hours he is not giving as much time as he ought perhaps to his family although he's always tried to ensure that weekends are devoted to his children
when this incident occurred he'd been working on a project in harlow in essex setting up another system
this had UNK him working long hours
on the friday before the incident occurred he had not got home until three o'clock in the morning
he'd then had to drive back down to harlow again the following morning to sort out further problems with the system
returning about tea time he'd then gone out once more to deliver some computer disks for another project he was running in UNK
he returned home about eight o'clock in the evening feeling absolutely exhausted and as he said all he wanted to do was go to sleep
there had been problems in his relationship with his girlfriend and indeed he'd come to see my firm about six months ago because of the UNK in that relationship and had general advice then about his legal position should there be a separation
he had not come back after he had been given general advice and he had what he describes as an UNK peace in the relationship with his girlfriend
she was UNK in case there should be a separation that he should make some form of proper financial arrangement for them a legally binding agreement
when he returned home very tired on the saturday evening she turned on him and began UNK him again about the possibility of a separation and that he should make proper commitment to her
unfortunately in the course of that discussion he lost his temper with her there was a struggle and she suffered some minor UNK and UNK
the police were called my client was arrested and was UNK at the police station from about midnight on the saturday until eventually he appeared before the court about four o'clock on the monday afternoon
he'd been in custody there for nearly thirty six hours altogether
he was then released on bail and as is the custom the police required conditions of his bail that he should not go back to his UNK address to prevent any possibility of any further UNK
he therefore has been living with friends sleeping on their floors for the last few weeks because he's UNK explicitly with the conditions of his bail
he's therefore not been able to contact his girlfriend he's not been able to see his children er although he has missed them very much
he now says that he does love his girlfriend he does want to make that relationship work and he's very hopeful of making a reconciliation
madam may feel that having spent so much time in custody for the first offence that he has already suffered sufficient punishment he's been kept away from his girlfriend and children and under those circumstances i would urge you madam to take a UNK course of action to make him the subject of a UNK discharge
apart from anything else that'll ensure the court that he is not tempted to be involved in any similar incident in the future with is girlfriend
and madam i'd also ask you to say that to him to pay compensation for the minor injuries she's UNK she's suffered and of course you have to consider that's a point in a case involving assault would be to add insult to injury and would not assist the parties in coming to terms with their relationship and hopefully attempting a reconciliation
right so is a very experienced advocate
if you can get it as good as that your first time up you must be a natural
cos if you notice hardly any moving around if you think about had a go and think about the dress is different the manner is different the voice is different very little facial expression even certainly very little movement but good eye contact
the whole of the way through that he was looking at the person he was trying to im not UNK at them but good eye contact so if you're trying to influence somebody there's no point in looking somewhere else
you look at that person
let's have a look at how deliberately did this one wrong
please your worships i appear on behalf of mr smith this morning
he's a man of er of previous good character
he's er he's er twenty er no thirty six years of age thirty six years of age madam
he appears before the court for the first time he's of previous good character and erm and er has never been in trouble with the courts before and er madam i'm going to suggest to you that this incident was brought about not by any fault of his own but by his girlfriend and her behaviour towards him
i ask you to deal him UNK in that because of that
madam my client's thirty six years of age and lives with his girlfriend
he has been working very long hours setting up in business here in er in this area er he gets home late at night and i'm afraid to say that over the last few months he's been UNK continuously by his girlfriend who wants him to try and sort out financial arrangements because the relationship between the two of them's not been very good
he comes home late night one saturday night having been working long hours not having enough sleep she UNK him and madam he loses his temper with her and madam i am sure that you and i in our relationships same sort of stress in a different situation where we've been UNK by our partners and lost our temper and pushed them about or whatever and we'd be very surprised i think to find ourselves in my client's situation had that happened because what happened here madam was that erm the girlfriend suffered some minor injuries nothing to worry about really
i think madam yeah she UNK madam of er UNK to her arms and UNK to her upper arms where he allegedly grabbed hold of her erm and that really is it nothing to worry about at all
sort this out sensibly the police UNK they arrest him at midnight in the clothes he stands up in they take him down to the police station he's held in the police station for about thirty six hours or so something like that er instead of being brought before the court straight away and released on bail straight away they keep him in custody where he's never been before er and madam he's then released on bail but court UNK silly conditions on him conditions that he shouldn't go back to his home address he can't go and see his girlfriend he can't go and see his children er and madam it seems to be an abuse of the process really of the court to behave in this way
he's therefore been stuck living on er UNK floors for the last few weeks not being able to go back to his girlfriend and not being able to see his children er and madam that's had an effect on his on his business as well
so madam i'm asking you to say that these circumstances this is the sort of case that should never have come before the court it should've been sorted out between the parties themselves with the aid of their solicitors and that it's only the UNK of the police in this particular circumstance that brings him before the court here
he's got no previous convictions
madam i'm gonna ask you to say in those circumstances that we should give him the maximum discharge
you appreciate that means he has no effectively no record at all and that seems to me to balance up what's happened here against er against the fact that he's got no previous convictions madam
i think to impose any other penalty upon him would merely be to UNK the situation
he's suffered enough
he's been in custody for two or three days thirty six hours or something like that already and not been able to see his family and er got into all sorts of mess because of that madam
er and it seems to me that the court shouldn't be UNK up with cases like this
so i'd ask you madam to go along with what i'm suggesting and make him the subject of an absolute discharge so that he doesn't have any previous court er any convictions or anything like that on his record
and madam i'd ask you not to make any award for compensation to his girlfriend cos that's just gonna add insult to injury really isn't it
so madam i'd ask you to go along with what i'm suggesting that's an absolute discharge and er
about the only thing he got right was what he called the magistrate he called her a madam because when you're appearing before a UNK magistrate one magistrate on their own it's sir or madam
yeah the hands no structure did you notice he hardly ever looked at the magistrate although yeah his voice projection was still good because he's an experienced advocate but he was talking to the table nearly the whole time
now if you if he as i hope you will do have a look at the full versions you can have a look at the shorter UNK in a moment
if you have a look at the four versions of the videos i hope what you'll do is have in front of you er the advocacy criteria guide which we'll speak a bit more about in a moment and actually look and see well how is it that these people meet those things they don't necessarily but how are they persuasive UNK
okay let's look at a slightly different style
again another very experienced advocate
this first one is only an UNK because i'm then going to contrast it with how not to do it
sorry i think it's worth noting some of the circumstances giving rise to mrs brown er committing the offences which bring her before the court today
so you're dealing with a fifty one year old lady she's never been in trouble has no previous convictions a lady sir who divorced in nineteen seventy six she brought three children up single UNK and so she has done all she can er often at great personal sacrifice to ensure the best financial stability and the best emotional support for her children
she's perhaps done what most working mothers do she's put the children first
she had a good working record
er sir she was working in the care sector as a residential home manager
she held a position of trust and responsibility
that was until about two years ago when unfortunately the home where she worked was closed down and she was made redundant
it was at that stage sir that mrs brown made a claim for benefit to support herself and her eleven year old son and so that claim for benefit was a perfectly legitimate one
sir in june nineteen ninety two mrs brown er successfully obtained temporary work working for the nottingham community UNK as a nursing UNK and the work was initially intended to be for a period of about three months
it was on a temporary basis
she wasn't sure as to whether er it would work out
it was er at that stage in her life her two eldest children returned home her daughter because she'd fallen pregnant and her son because his marriage had unfortunately broken down
very different style and you've got to find your own style because it's got to be one that suits you
if you noticed UNK with his hands by pushing them behind his back UNK with them by having her papers in her hand
but again she's making good eye contact both of them only let their eyes flick down to their notes to remind themselves of the next point they want to make
now their notes
people's notes to how full they are
what i would advise you to do is not use whole sentences in your notes because then you'll be tempted to read from the notes
so notes that're in true note form
write down enough that you feel confident that if your mind UNK you've got enough there to remind you what you want to say
but then use some method of highlighting key words or UNK or sub heading that pe you can just flick your eyes to and remind you very quickly of what you're going to say
gave a brief history brief outline of the case
she did then did go on and develop her argument more
but let's contrast that with when did it deliberately wrong
sir very serious charge and i'm sure that you'll be thinking about sending her er to prison today
i mean she's told you about her three children but er i suppose she should've thought of that shouldn't she before she signed on
still her children are quite young and erm and i think she's sorry for what she's done
erm i have got a note of their ages somewhere
er it doesn't matter about that but there are three young children
er it is an awful lot of money of course
how much is it two thousand pounds well she's offered to pay it back at two pounds a week and er it's gonna take a long time isn't it sir for her to pay it back
but er she does want to pay it back she does want to pay it back and er well she wants to pay it back erm if you could start it this time next year she'd be er she would be grateful for that
er she is sorry she's sorry that she's committed er she committed the offence
er and i don't think she's been in trouble before
mrs white have you been in trouble before
no the UNK has not been er in trouble before
erm yeah sh i know you'll be thinking about sending her to prison today but if you could think of anything else that erm i don't know a suspended sentence or something like that then obviously she'd be really grateful for that wouldn't you mrs yeah erm er mrs white is there anything else you want me to say
er well i think that's it for mrs white then
okay so when you come to look at these videos okay slightly exaggerated but if you go down to court and you might like to go down to the hall or somewhere locally you'll actually find that there are UNK who do what did deliberately wrong and what did deliberately wrong
perhaps not quite as exaggerated but v very similar
and wh because one of the things that they were deliberately doing as if they were UNK
sorry if some of you are still a bit cold but i thought the heater had been turned on but it doesn't seem to be doing anything
erm if you're prepared you haven't got to UNK with your notes the UNK and UNK are less the facts flow you call your client the right name and you can concentrate on the presentation
the one that when y if you look at those look at don't just concentrate on the ones which are right concentrate on the ones that were wrong too and say why are they wrong
yeah they're amusing and those sort of things and obviously they're deliberately wrong but have a look and see why what is it because they do contain errors that are commonly made day after day in courts
right if you could have a look for a moment at your criteria guide
let's just look at what we're expected to do
this is what we'll use at every stage of the advocacy exercises
it'll be used for the bail it'll be used for the UNK and it will be used for your assessment
dirty word assessment but we'll come back to that in a minute
right
a few typing errors please ignore those
i UNK i haven't developed a new word at number six that is overall presents her argument in a confident and persuasive manner
right let's just think about these
UNK relevant facts
so you select from the information you're given the facts that are relevant to the application you're making that day whether it be bail or whether it be a plea in UNK
what's relevant to your application
what are you asking the court to do
what are you trying to persuade them to do
if it's bail you're trying to get your client released possibly with conditions
if it's plea in UNK you're tr remember your client has been convicted at that point
