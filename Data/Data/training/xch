for the benefit of these two there's only a couple of sentences
yes
in trying to answer these questions and psychological UNK and the whole appropriate to the age of the and i quote we must not forget that but is also a law UNK and UNK egyptian UNK egyptian in origin
in the bible cannot provide and abandoned him
he was rescued by an egyptian princess
in the normal UNK they represent what is known as a family UNK
this the special almost sacred being
development continued egyptian UNK and as an adult true parents
however and come to the conclusion that by a name egyptian children of israel
compared to what really happened that they were liberated
there and not from below
to maintain that moses was an egyptian they never
in short moses revealed to that like the UNK each generation of jews that gave them their character in general which is that today
well done andrea excellent
a difficult book in some ways did you find it difficult
yeah i
yeah
yes
absolutely
well i thought you gave a very clear and er convincing account of it despite that so congratulations well done that was excellent
erm well what does everyone else think
moses and UNK is not one of those books of freud as i expect you to read for this course i mean i expect you to read things like UNK and so on because they're kind of central and they're not very large books they're clearly er focused on our subject but erm it would be i think a little bit unreasonable for me to expect you to read this one although er i'd quite like you to i mean some ways erm it's a fascinating book erm my guess is if it if you don't hate it you'd probably quite like it
there's a number of students who said they started to read it and couldn't put it down
bit like a detective story in some ways
but erm what er what are you to make of it
erm i'd like to say
mm
mm
well could you could you expand on that cos you're not saying that they it's actually passed from people's d n a
no i'm not saying that
no so explain how it works mike
er well it seemed as though it
and er ideology of change rather than industrial relations erm revolution
and so the relevance of that to what andrea was telling us about is what
erm
yes
yes
well that's it that that's a very good starting point because one point that freud er makes in the book and andrea er UNK to but is very important in fact he calls it there's a little sub section of the book called the analogy and this is the erm analogy that freud is gonna use for his study of UNK the analogy he gives er can you remember it andrea
recall exactly what it is
well let me tell you i don't want to put you on the spot the analogy is of er the typical pattern of development of a UNK which freud says is a trauma that happens often in UNK
this is then forgotten or repressed when it seems to have UNK altogether and there's a third period what freud calls the return of the repressed when the initial trauma comes back in the form of symptoms and er ideally in the form of an analysis that finally brings it to the surface of consciousness and dissolves it and this is a typical pattern
er it's certainly what happened to me i must admit in fact it's certainly been the pattern of my life and er i'm not surprised what thought freud thought was a kind of typical er typical pattern
now what mike is talking about is the kind of historical parallel to this and freud mentions a number of examples
mike has given us one which is i think an excellent one
the examples that freud talks about are for example er the UNK war in early greek history
we know that the UNK war you know erm what's described in the UNK and the UNK to the UNK and er all these greek and greek UNK we know that war actually happened but it happened an awful long time before these poems were written and er freud's view is that what happens in a culture is there's some initial traumatic event like the french revolution or UNK war there's a period of UNK during which it seems to be forgotten about and nothing very much happens anyway and then at a later stage it comes back again there's a return of a repressed and er freud erm freud quotes one or two other examples er of the same kind of thing and UNK example is a very good one albeit er perhaps it's good because it's so recent so the point you're making mike is that are you saying that freud's analogy is UNK where french history and even industrial relations is concerned that there was a trauma the revolution of seventeen eighty nine there were UNK periods and then this kept coming back from the repressed time and time again
yeah
yeah
right
apparently they even put the UNK in the same place
oh did they
right
is er is freud saying is he just looking at this and saying i see a pattern here
yes
or is he saying you know is he saying this is how i found religions to UNK you know or
he's certainly saying i find a pattern here because he's using it as his pattern to understand and i only just said at the beginning what the makes the jews jewish what gave them their national character and their ethnic identity
he's certainly saying there's a pattern there er what was the second
well is he saying that these are the these are the things that our religion needs in order to be a strong religion i mean it she said you know something that i found interesting was what UNK has said about erm the ability of the minority to sort of overcome repression
yes
erm i read a book this summer er by UNK called UNK and in the book erm there's this there's this er country and the country has UNK this certain religion
mm
erm called UNK and it turns out find out later in the book that the reason they UNK this is because of the guy UNK who was who UNK the religion had made a deal with the head of the state of the country that he would UNK it so that's how the religion UNK because it was UNK
yes i see yeah
see and he started up that way and the religion was the most popular thing in the country but all the people were UNK
i see
and er that's how the religion UNK
right
because they were all repressed but they were fighting against this repression and it was coming out you know
yes
erm and er i was wondering if freud did that or if that's what freud was saying that religion by nature must be repressed or that a minority as the nature of minority is er it works harder when it's repressed or it can become stronger
no he's not saying that he's not going that far because he's not talking about all religions
we saw earlier didn't we when we talked about future who did that
sorry you did that right well think back to what you said about future what freud said the future
right now there are plenty of religions that don't show this er pattern of trauma repression and UNK of return of the repressed they just kind of go on from er from time UNK erm and there are plenty of examples of that
i think freud would say though however that these are more like the th the was talking about religion now clearly if something is a UNK it isn't gonna make much difference to it or if anything it's just gonna make it er make it more difficult but there are certain types of religion and UNK is one of them where th this very pattern you're talking about did occur and here freud is er probably standing on firm ground for reasons which i'll explain in my lectures i don't wanna take up too much time but i have done a bit of research on this myself and as you will see erm there's there are good reasons for thinking that freud was certainly right about some of those and we certainly know that a UNK and an absolutely UNK religion appeared in ancient egypt as erm andrea said just before erm the er UNK of this UNK er UNK one of whose er near UNK i forget how he was related now erm was originally called UNK and then was forced to change his name to UNK and he was dug up by howard UNK in nineteen twenty two or something er and er the UNK is called UNK and not UNK is that there was a religious
the UNK is interesting because he was the first UNK of history as far as we know
he started the
of religious UNK that still lives on today and causes UNK to live in fear of his life
erm the idea
god UNK was his prophet and in fact claimed to be the son of god his son and er all other religions were UNK and er so what in ancient egypt was that the traditional UNK which was UNK was UNK by there was only one god and as andrea says even UNK the word gods in the plural you know the you know the er feminist thought police would try and rule out certain words you're not allowed to use like chairman which has become UNK or something like that
well UNK took it even further and it was an offence UNK by death to even say the word gods and if you visit ancient egypt and walk around the ruins you will occasionally know they were fond of putting these UNK erm er UNK over everything
and here and there you will see UNK have been UNK if somebody's got a UNK and there's a just a raise a whole block of UNK er just there and then and almost always that is UNK did it and the UNK they were UNK was the plural er gods
you could use the word god but not the word they had to be UNK
so UNK founded this UNK er religion as with kind of UNK and er UNK the th the traditional UNK
we now know this is a matter of historical fact there was a counter revolution
UNK either died or was murdered we're not we don't know we don't know how er he was a very peculiar man as i'll explain in the lectures er physically very strange probably as a result of UNK and erm the old religion re established itself there was never a return to UNK sun worship but er all its hypothesis is that since we know the UNK occurred round about this time and since we know that UNK too is a religion of a single minded UNK you know i'm the law by god i shall have no other gods before me it says in the bible full stop
erm freud's hypothesis is that this religion left egypt because of the UNK moses was one of UNK followers who went out into the desert erm here as i'll explain in the lectures er some of my own research opens up a new angle on this that freud didn't know about and why they went out into the desert why they picked up these er UNK erm er UNK who were living on the UNK of the egyptian empire
i'll explain that in the lecture
but anyway the idea is that er the religion was UNK in ancient egypt and because it was UNK there the people UNK went to the promised land when they found the promised land there they stopped and founded a new a new religious state which of course is still with us
i mean now we're still you know we're still er if freud did write about this we're still living with the consequences of this
in the in the current middle east erm so this pattern certainly applies to UNK not to all religions he's not saying that all religions have to UNK in order to as it were UNK but some religions do and perhaps the characteristic UNK or at least this kind of UNK is these kind of religions tend to be UNK and single UNK tend to say that we know the truth everybody else is wrong and consequently they tend to UNK others and get UNK and this leads to these periods of UNK but there's a tendency for this kind of return of UNK just as mike was saying his very brilliant analogy he suggested the french revolution when the students put the UNK up in the same place or so the erm freud's idea is that the things that happened in that first traumatic period back in ancient egypt and for example erm he said this is why the modern erm jews insist on UNK because the ancient UNK did and this is this is correct
we know that the ancient UNK er did insist on UNK er they were UNK very erm er very UNK the ancient UNK cos they were living at the peak of cultural time and regarded all other races as inferior to them and one of the main er UNK in UNK was erm not being UNK and ancient UNK regarded people who weren't UNK as UNK and erm they er they had this tremendous er racial pride in themselves as the UNK people and this of course has passed on into UNK and even to UNK faith
UNK er UNK this er strange habit of UNK the UNK of little boys
i don't think they can get away with it with little girls but they get away with it with little boys
well it is UNK isn't it
would but i mean i'm quite in favour of people having their UNK as adults once they're over eighteen they go to hospital and sign a consent form and have it done as long as they pay for it themselves but to do it to UNK children strikes me as UNK
i this is just the voice of reason
you can draw your own conclusions about me
er mike
do you do you think there's a valid parallel here then with say UNK
a valid parallel w would you say using your UNK your analogy with the french revolution
erm well
i mean how does it how does it work UNK
if you're right about this could you explain the psychological mechanism that makes these kinds of returns of the repressed happen i mean why did the UNK why did the french students feel they had to UNK the revolution
it was UNK
why should they want to be heard in a traditional way you'd think students having a revolution will want everything make a kind of clean break wouldn't they
i mean why do people have to kind of if we accept for a minute that there's something in this analogy this model that freud is talking about why do people have this UNK need to repeat like this why do they have to repeat history
mm but mike that it wasn't new how do you explain that UNK
well i can't tell you but i'm sure that er
mm right
rather than it actually
yes
that that's a sensible kind of conclusion to draw and perhaps this would meet UNK point as well because the what you might be tempted to say is look erm in our cultures we have we have absorbed from our cultures ways of seeing the world bits about history and things UNK our thoughts and even when we try and do something new i'd say let's have a revolution everybody put up your UNK you know actually we had some great fun in the sixties with that erm the when this happens there's a tendency to nevertheless do it in the traditional way in other words although obviously the sixty eight revolution was about a completely different issue than the seventeen ninety eight revolution it was very much later in history
nevertheless the form of it was the same there was a would you buy that one UNK that there was a
yes
a kind of cultural tradition in the
yes i mean UNK they will happen
yes
erm but are shown that
yes
yes so would you accept that mary jane that people may consciously er think for example oh no we're students we're having a revolution and this is new but UNK they might be following some deep historical precedent
yes
aware that
i'm sure they were aware
well
another revolution i mean that the fight that none of these things have really come to a full success yeah so nobody looks at them and says well we need no more UNK because they'll all work
so everyone thinks that being the is being one that's really gonna change the world yeah and i think that the pattern he's talking about it's just UNK and UNK and UNK
i mean to take another example er and this UNK mary jane's point about it can be conscious is isn't there a tendency wouldn't you say john for clinton to see himself as kennedy returned
yeah
yeah i think that what clinton did was to play on that to get elected and you know he wanted people to see him as that but
yeah
i think that now he's in office and this is why i've started to dislike him a little more since he's been you know UNK even
i think he thinks he's better i really do
yeah
i think he thinks
yeah
okay now i'm here and i am not only gonna be i mean now people
yeah
i am kennedy
much better than kennedy
right he probably does think that but isn't it interesting er doesn't this illustrate the point we've been making that he felt he needed to have a play that UNK that historical cord as it were
mm
i definitely i definitely think that's a pattern you know leading up i think this is a continuing thing but that in the end these people always think that they're gonna take one step further
mm
and that's what keeps that's what keeps it going
mm
yeah
so perhaps in some ways er we would UNK from this that the motive of the UNK in sixty eight was in perhaps to some extent to complete what had been started in seventeen eighty nine but not finished and somebody would clinton presumably he would say i'm gonna complete the programme that john f kennedy started but was unable to finish because the tragic way in which his career was ended
erm so the that seems to be getting towards something that freud is saying another UNK aspect of this which is the UNK aspect the feeling that you gotta keep doing it
presumably one reason why people doing something is they didn't do it enough the first time or they didn't do it properly or they didn't do it successfully and therefore they've gotta keep doing it
is that possible
this father figure
mm
i mean it's like the father is UNK what they're doing
yes and sometimes of course this is this becomes a conscious UNK for what people are doing aren't they
i mean presumably erm when erm er you know when er when people fight religious UNK very often they see themselves as er justified by a religious UNK of the past by the great UNK of the past or great leaders who did similar things and er they consciously justify what they're doing don't they by saying well you know we're er we're doing fighting this UNK or carrying out this policy er and these are the historical UNK
and they quote those UNK as a justification for what they're doing and of course that then the whole kind of UNK repetition thing becomes very conscious because now people are saying you know we're doing this er because of historical UNK because of erm and tradition
so i think that that's that that's absolutely true
of course to go back to something i think UNK or somebody said erm this could also happen un UNK couldn't it
i mean i was interested a another very interesting point you made mike at the beginning you said that is there had there been studies that show the standards of french industrial relations did you say that this has kind of become a pattern for industrial relations conflict in france
no i made
yeah right
say that this has everybody out
because that implies that this kind of thing then UNK to other areas of life i mean it after all the revolution of seventeen ninety eight didn't have anything to do with erm industrial relations as such i mean it was er it was really about the monarchy the state and er people starving and all that stuff but the this introduces the interesting idea that once you've got a kind of pattern in the culture to something it can then UNK in other areas
erm it what it struck me as is a parallel with freud's idea of transference you know that once something happens in the in the traumatic period in a in a childhood there's then a tendency to transference to occur later in life we UNK later in relationships to er the model of the early one and er it struck me that what you said about french industrial relations sounded a bit like transference in erm in the psychoanalysis the idea that i it UNK out as it were from the initial which might have been saved er within the family to other relationships i in later life that people have with their UNK at work or something i mean you can see this actually sometimes you know that people have relationships with their UNK which are clearly erm based on erm their relationships with their parents and they see the th their boss as a parental figure and the employee sees themselves as er as a kind of erm child and it shows itself sometimes in quite er quite UNK ways
UNK
yeah
yes
i told my husband that he had this problem
oh really
yes absolutely
yeah
never is good enough and he expects too much
yes it it's not UNK
but can i ask something else erm
yes
obviously this erm theory of freud's er is not acceptable jews
i would like to find out how a jewish
yes i mean they haven't been
once in one of these classes one year i had a jewish student got up and got very upset during such a class as this and UNK out and then UNK the door er which i was rather sorry about because erm i think he was being a little bit erm too sensitive because the person who was giving the paper said anything anyway erm but warrant that but he was just offended of the idea that anybody could suggest that moses wasn't jewish and of course
well he was a young
oh they did yes
this another one of the black books along with woodrow wilson
this was one of the er this th this is one of the black books and one of the problems with this has been i think that a lot of UNK er have been jewish of course and i think they regard as kind of UNK or some kind of UNK to suggest that moses erm wasn't jewish
i don't understand how that though
i mean you know ho how does that relate to his pattern that he's talking about
well it doesn't relate to a pattern erm to be an analogy
what it relates to is the specific historical UNK it
you see you could say that this of freud's operates on two levels
on one level there's this analogy this pattern about history that we've been talking about but er is freud's attempt to explain jewish er culture in terms of a of a general pattern of history of course there are many other examples and mike has suggested a brilliant one here
on another level on a completely different level the book is about freud's attempt in my erm in the second edition of i used the analogy of a detective story like UNK or something or something er i it it's an attempt by freud to UNK specific historical events that may or may not have happened using a kind of UNK method because freud picks up tiny little clues like UNK name the fact that he doesn't appear to be able to speak the language in the bible he always speaks through an UNK and in the bible this is explained away by saying
freud's he just couldn't speak UNK he could only speak in egyptian and so on and so on
so it's an attempt on the second level to UNK historical the lost the UNK but what really happened and in that on that level it's important for freud to establish that moses was not jewish but egyptian because this gives him the link with egyptian UNK and the events of the UNK and explains it as well
it also explains erm his view why the jews then murdered moses UNK against them he wasn't one of them anyway
he imposed this religion on them which they didn't want and freud thinks this explains a lot of things like the story of the golden carving how moses comes down
down from the mountain and er and so on
so that level it it's really it's the detail level it's not a part of a fundamental pattern
moses being a different UNK isn't a part of the it's a it's a historical detail
but it still seems like i mean in the in the story he was raised as a as an egyptian
yeah
and so he
as an egyptian
right
you know so the UNK against him could just as easily have been because he was raised as an egyptian or that the you know the between UNK from the past could also have been
i'm not arguing
no
but i don't see the real relevance and i think one of the reasons that erm i mean i hear it and i know that freud was very critical of religion and i think for some very good reasons
mm
erm but i also think i also find him to be UNK critical of the figures that he looks at just like he was very critical of woodrow wilson
yes
because he almost has this personal sort of he sort of a personal UNK against them in some ways
mm
you know and not only goes without the UNK at least this is the sense i get not only about UNK but also to sort of knocked out and er maybe that's maybe that's trying to do and that was the point i also haven't read the book so i don't know
no
well i don't yes i don't think in the book erm i mean did you get that impression andrea
get some kind of personal UNK against moses
no it's more sort of
yes
how it really occurred
yes i yes i think UNK put her finger on it
the impression you get in the book is not that freud had erm some UNK against moses the way he had against woodrow wilson he was quite open about it in the woodrow wilson book but that freud is an intelligent erm believer in science who nevertheless takes religion very seriously because of its psychological truth
freud freud's you know freud said that everything that religion says is true but it's UNK true it's not UNK true it's not you know true at the reality true psychological
so he took religion terribly seriously but he believed in science and he looked at the bible and said well what does this really mean
what do these UNK about moses who is the key figure in UNK what do these UNK really tell us
and so what he's trying to do is to as andrea says erm UNK the truth get to the get to what really happened as it were under the layers of myth and UNK could have been introduced in the bible story and as i said if you read the book erm and it is quite fascinating in many ways it is a bit like a detective story because what freud does is he tries to get to the truth by analyzing the actual UNK and the UNK contains UNK and anybody who's ever tried to erm edit a book UNK this to their cost actually but er you find no matter how carefully you change things there's usually things you miss little UNK that give away how it was the first time and er freud's view is this has happened very much to the bible it's been so heavily UNK and re written and later the various UNK show and if you read it very critically you can begin to see perhaps the underlying pattern er coming through and erm just as you can tell for instance by reading genesis that it's a of two accounts because there are two stories the first story is chapter one of genesis then in chapter three or something there's a second story UNK it with variations
so from that UNK scores have concluded the book that we know as genesis was originally two accounts that were pushed together but not very expert actually because you can still see the join an and freud's view about the moses there are numerous UNK and numerous joins and if you take it all apart and say what is it what does it make up his conclusion is that erm moses was not egyptian sorry moses was not er erm no not a UNK but egyptian
erm i would have thought this was welcome news in the modern world actually when you know all these people in the middle east have got to live together
i would have thought this was rather an UNK view to take but UNK erm but there we are
a as you and various other people likely said erm a lot of people regarded it as a kind of act of erm racial er UNK i'm not bothered about what race i am i'm just bothered about the truth and the truth is that i think erm moses was not jewish well who's to know who's to know erm as i said it's a fascinating book and if you like that kind of detective story approach to history you might you might enjoy reading it erm there are i it raises a lot of other issues many of which i'll talk about in the in the lectures so i won't waste time say repeating it all here
who er who haven't we heard from
emma you've been sitting there very quietly and UNK
have you got any comments to make about this
yeah that's right
but you see what freud what freud UNK on there and is something that only a UNK could do is that there's a discrepancy in the story
well what's the discrepancy
discrepancy
the
the UNK to this was set by another UNK called UNK rank one of freud's er early followers who had published a book called the myth of the birth of the hero and in this book what rank did was to UNK through world UNK and literature from UNK of UNK and of course there are a lot of those books and dozens and dozens of them and what he does in the book is he UNK all these dozens and dozens of UNK and he finds that there's a common pattern UNK and it's pretty UNK actually and the common pattern is the hero is born of royal or divine parents the hero for some reason or other that loses his parents or is cast out by them or is er exposed in some way erm the hero is often threatened by some outside force and then rescued by er humble people
the humble people bring up the hero as their own child eventually the hero realizes through a dream through a UNK a UNK or something that he is not the child of his humble parents but the find out who his real parents were and then returns and UNK and eventually gains his UNK place
there are many examples attached to jesus
okay jesus is the son of god poor old joseph is just a kind of UNK father erm you know like a test tube baby father actually test tube er is er is like you know er a complete UNK father er for god erm they're threatened by UNK so they have to UNK to egypt and er then they come back and eventually jesus realizes who he is and after a long struggle with good and evil temptation at the desert UNK and god knows what erm off he goes back to you know sitting up there on the right hand of god saying you know i'm the son of god which he is so UNK is UNK by his parents there's a UNK he will murder his father and marry his mother so they get rid of him but he doesn't die he gets found by a shepherd brought up by a shepherd
you all know what happens later
er there are lots and lots and lots of stories
an indian myth made dozens of them
it's very
so concluded that this was a common pattern however there is one exception
the only exception is moses and in moses as UNK says the story seems the wrong way round
is it moses
the parents are humble jewish erm UNK in egypt the UNK parents of the egyptian royal families emma reminds us the daughter of UNK finds moses floating in the UNK
now freud says if this myth this can't be the original myth because the original myth has as andrea pointed out to us very clearly in her paper is the family UNK bit that a lot of people or most people have
many people can remember it that in their youth they saw their when they're their early childhood they saw their parents were very special people the parents
later of course as up this early UNK attitude where you UNK your parents becomes replaced by a more rational and so on but freud's finding was that this early attitude in childhood doesn't get er abolished it just gets repressed it's forced out of conscious because you true and of course things that are not true have to be removed consciousness but they cannot be UNK so they're forced into the unconscious and they live in the unconscious and they feed UNK like the myth of the birth of the hero and all of us in our er erm in our er conscious see the hero as a as a parental figure that reflects the family UNK the idea that once we were we were a special child with very special parents
so the point of conclusion is if the myth is different in the bible then the likely explanation is that it was UNK with but that the UNK and the people who wrote the bible altered the and they changed it round why should they change this myth
of course the answer is changing the myth would have made moses UNK and not egyptian because if moses had been the daughter of UNK he would had to been egyptian and that the UNK couldn't tolerate because at a later stage their religion became strongly ethnic and UNK divided you really got to be born jewish to be jewish so they couldn't tolerate their founding fathers of not being anything but jewish so they altered it they changed the records and they UNK the myth but they left this UNK in it so the myth is no longer it's er UNK and this is one of the little bits of evidence and now of course erm if you don't take UNK into the family UNK seriously that may not cut much ice for you but if you erm appreciate the force of these unconscious UNK in creating this like this it's UNK it's a quite UNK piece of evidence because you think well why should the bible change the myth why can't it just put up with the normal myth
it's just one of those many UNK pieces of evidence you know so that the freud you know like the great detective you know uses all these little UNK facts and finally puts them all together and draws everybody together you know in the drawing room and says i will now reveal the UNK you know moses was not an egyptian sorry moses was not a UNK he was an egyptian
well
well yes i mean he says yes he does say about that he says that he has no doubt that there was a historical and said there were two moses
apparently as you know i mean UNK criticism is a very and well people have devoted their whole lives to it but apparently there is a school o of quite a large school i think o of UNK critical that claims that there are actually two moses and not one
the two figures have been kind of UNK together just as in UNK there are two sorry in erm in er genesis there are two er garden of UNK stories so they claim there are two moses figures who have been erm as it were UNK together but both of them says freud were powerful religious leaders and they probably did give their followers moral principles perhaps not exactly as we have but something very like it and so freud is not sceptical about that
he believes there was a man moses he believes he did exist though actually probably two of them
he does believe they were powerful leaders and that to some extent the bible erm shows a true like for example freud says that there are some in the like UNK temper and he loses his temper he UNK an egyptian freud
that could well be a bit of UNK it may well be the original man moses was a powerful man with a powerful temper and perhaps this was come down to us er as a bit of historical truth but erm nevertheless the whole figure of moses and his laws by later generations and this th what freud is trying to do is to erm undo this UNK the process again truth
you can still see it going on today and it still happens doesn't it like the good news bible if you look at that i mean this a version of the bible UNK presumably to tell people good news i don't know i've never read it but i presume that that's what the good news bible does and we now have UNK where god is god is female erm my guess is supposing that were the only bible we had a feminist bible were no other bible and everybody for hundreds of years believed it my guess is that in the future UNK critics and bible critics could study that very carefully and i bet you somewhere there you'll find internal evidence to show that once god had been male and had his UNK changed i'm quite sure of it because edit a whole book like the bible and completely eliminate all the evidence that god was once male would be a very difficult here and there you need little bits of evidence and again there's lots of others i'll mention in the lecture like god's name
in the bible god has two names er UNK and er freud says that UNK could be a UNK of
and er there is some evidence that the two words are the same and that the original name of god was and that god was the sun and again there is evidence of sun worship er in the bible
again the UNK didn't the son of righteousness
when christians hear that they usually think it's spelt s o n but it isn't it's s u n and the sun of righteousness er with healing in his wings so freud says and i believe it's actually this seen it it's very common on egyptian UNK it's a picture of a sun er with wings with rays shining out of it
that's the sun of righteousness with healing in its wings
actually the healing is not usually in the wings it's in the hands that come out from the sun and the healing is the of ancient egypt which meant life spirit and er and health
so the sun of righteousness with healing in its wings is probably an egyptian symbol so freud
again there's a lot of other evidence that freud doesn't mention and he could have done like the UNK
er if you read the accounts of the UNK it looks very like an egyptian UNK
there are four angels at the corners with UNK wings
this is a typical pattern of an egyptian UNK
i personally think the UNK was UNK and they carried it erm to the promised land probably with the UNK body of moses in it
that's what harrison ford should have discovered
and when they opened the UNK they should have discovered moses in it but they didn't because it was and there we are
that'll teach you
sorry UNK spirits
the point
yeah
that in fact
right oh yes it's got a lot of UNK but the point is that the UNK it has are UNK in terms of what the UNK were trying to hide and correct and to that extent it's a bit like UNK an individual patient
when you analyze their conscious you discover that all the changes and the UNK level after a UNK purpose to hide certain things and to keep certain things in the repressed and the same is true o of the bible in other words all these UNK and were not just random they were often motivated by a desire to hide or change certain things
in other words they show a definite pattern and you can determine what that pattern was
well yes
well for example one of the things one of the consistent kinds of changes that seems to have occurred is an attempt to deny UNK but there are lots of places in the bible where it hasn't been consistent and where god on occasions speaks in the bible erm as if other gods could exist like i i'm the lord i'm a UNK god
why should he be UNK if there are no gods to be UNK of
there are lots of bits of evidence that suggest that the bible has been consistently UNK to make it more UNK than it really was in the beginning
in the beginning okay believed in and or whatever you wanna call it but it also believed in other gods as well except he was the chief god he was number one god as it were and he's the one you got to follow
these other gods exist but they're the wrong gods
there was a tendency says freud to eliminate all the wrong gods and say there is only one god but the whole point
that of course is exactly what UNK tried to do at the beginning another example the return of the repressed its original religious UNK
well it's an interesting UNK
as i said i'll be having quite a lot to say about in the lectures so we'll just regard this class as a kind of UNK to that
er andrea er it's gone eleven i mustn't UNK you any longer
congratulations on excellent paper first class er well done
next week are hearing from UNK who isn't here
now folks if you see UNK remind her
anybody know UNK
okay
yes
yeah let me tell you actually yeah the following week
oh okay
two weeks today okay
great opportunity to pass on genes UNK though the female has a limited number of eggs which has specific requirements for survival and therefore UNK temporarily stalls her reproductive success
so from the moment of UNK conception because females are UNK out of gear now have a much higher potentially accepted success
even if relative initial differences in UNK productive success they have the UNK for different male and female UNK strategies
now first the UNK strategy for males
for males the characteristic meaning of strategy is the continuous pattern of low or no
because of high potential reproductive success and their effort to earn the parental care for seeking additional mates
internal behaviour in most species
another reason for low in males is the
in species where UNK is internal they are also much less pertinent with genetic relationship of offspring because investing in UNK one's
furthermore males minimize UNK investment in attempt to their potential for UNK for a high reproductive success
this takes a great deal of effort because simply having the potential for a greater reproductive success in females does not necessarily mean that they actual have ha actually have greater reproductive success
this is because males vary greatly among themselves in success
such males have large numbers of offspring while others might have none at all
erm so we still that in general erm males have potential for greater UNK reproductive success than females but erm this doesn't actually they don't always er UNK their potential because erm some do there's a great difference among males and erm just some of them will have great er large numbers of offspring whereas other males might not have any at all
erm for the females the variance in reproductive success is of the differences in the female condition such as the ability to invest in offspring erm or food producing but among the males the variation in reproductive success are a function of male competition and female shortage
males compete with each other for females and for ever more are subject to females for particular members are not the reproductive strategy for females
for females mating strategy UNK due to and reproductive success of biological UNK and parental care such as the UNK
consequently females are expected to select mates most capable of investing resources in their offspring
possible strategies include the domestic strategy where the female recognizes domestic qualities in males in advance and therefore benefits herself by choosing a male with qualities
an alternative strategy is the where the female is resigned to getting no help from the mate and concentrating rather on selecting a mate with the best genes and in this case
so as a result of combining both of these strategies the UNK male and female strategies
come in
hi how you doing
erm you end up with four different er types of er reproductive strategies which are of UNK and UNK and the first one UNK is when you have one male and female and er this UNK the differences in reproductive success and the way it does that is because erm it UNK the difference between the sexes because UNK takes the limitations of the male erm to UNK only with the one female so the male to female ratio of reproductive success the same in UNK and er what happens to that is this little in er more equal towards their parental investment
er the second UNK where you have one male and then females and here reproductive success erm meaning that there's a large again you'll have the males who'll have the large reproductive success than males who have none at all and erm of course often differences between male and female because the male has and the male has opportunities to erm try to control success rate the female biological and er consequently with this kind of system from female choice and male competition and er are about eighty percent and er UNK is when you have many males and many females and er is also and er i would assume it's kind of like males have opportunities
but again the result of that system the main difference with that would be you know if they had different erm partners whereas other one partner
erm UNK the last type of example he has one erm many males and one female and with this system the differences between the sexes is the first and er males that do their larger parental investment females and it's a very rare
now on the other side of parental investment is UNK
the other alternatives of parental investment is UNK
when investing offspring when investing offspring results in increased males stay together but if it is possible to reach by UNK a partner then the individual is likely to be erm you can't decide on based on potential opportunities made parental investment
because of the those offspring can survive without further parental investment and if parental investment is therefore
the decision based on a number of current offspring larger numbers can be greater benefited with and therefore it's more likely that if the parent had a lot of er offspring then he would continue with the investment and erm the conclusion from now is that males have a greater reproductive success therefore they are more likely to desert because they can erm and erm this and erm the basic argument of this is one parent can get away with investing less share of erm resources they're likely to spend more er then they're to do it so in other words erm if one of the of the two is being to get away with having the other they can go out to er pursue their own and therefore erm each partner force the other to invest more
okay that's basically erm i have to say
i have a few questions of my own erm in doing it and erm was er when you say that males had males parental investment erm i was wondering how they how can a male when the male decides to desert how can they be certain if the female is going to take care of the offspring because i was wondering if erm if probability like the based by their genes it doesn't matter if one female doesn't take care of the offspring because they produce more offspring
i think that would depend on the species wouldn't it and the and the local conditions for example in that erm case i mentioned in yesterday's lecture UNK birds with long breeding groups where you get UNK
what seems to happen there is the bird that's UNK has to stay with the existing family because if he or she erm UNK those UNK will die so er it's what is sometimes called the UNK that if you put a lot of resources into something you've gotta see it through because if you pull out just before the end you can lose everything whereas i if you stay on even if you know it's a failure erm at least you may get something out of it so the in that case wi with UNK birds the parent that's UNK the one that's left may have to stay because if they desert then they can have no reproductive success whatsoever whereas at least if they stay they get something
erm in fact a similar effect happens i'll be mentioning this in the lecture but let me just mention it now
a similar thing can happen with so called UNK in fish
erm one of the problems fish have on this is that they lay their eggs in UNK or something like that and where males have their own nest sometimes another male comes along and er takes it over UNK it UNK and interestingly enough what happens in those situations a UNK male will come in UNK the existing male from his nest and UNK a few eggs and then buzz off
the resident male who was UNK then comes back and looks after all the eggs including those of the UNK and the reason he does it presumably in the first place he can't distinguish which eggs he's UNK and those UNK by the UNK and secondly he knows he's UNK some of the eggs and therefore it pays him to stay and look after all of them
so erm in other words i it wou would depend on the circumstances on how much has already been invested
in the case of human beings of course you have to notice that men seem to have an advantage because as i think i mention i in the lectures it's perfectly possible you see this happening in our own society which is supposed to be UNK perfectly possible for a man to get married raise a family and then in his forties to desert his wife and raise a second family
much more difficult for a woman because by the time a woman's got into her forties her child UNK erm career is usually rather short and even if she wants to continue it becomes much more UNK for her and for her offspring so er in the case of erm modern societies with erm UNK bu but divorce as we have you can't help thinking that to some extent the odds are loaded in the favour of men as it were in terms of their reproductive success
it's UNK because often divorce law reforms thought of as UNK women and in UNK that allows women to get away from an unreasonable husband and that kind of thing it's certainly true but at the same time you have to notice that in terms of reproductive success it may benefit more er men more
okay now so i think what one may have to say it depends on the species and the circumstance
does that answer your question
we can come back to this i mean have you got any others
yeah erm modern when in choosing a mate and er connection with that because with the assumption that males generally don't give any parental investment what really benefit them to you know UNK can support the offspring themselves short period of time why can't they then go you know to have their own i mean
right
yes i mean you put your finger on an important problem here that we need to discuss and that is that if you concentrate on human beings in general and this is true on our own society but i think it's true of just about all societies and it's UNK true of primal hunting adult societies then men do make a lot of parental investment don't they
i mean you think about primal hunting adults like the UNK or the australian UNK the men do the do the hunting for erm for meat and women do the do the gathering for and the point is that er meat is very UNK and it's an important part of their diet and men go hunting and they come back and they share food with their wives and their relatives or someone and male parental investment is terribly important so women for instance if you ask david UNK who's a world authority on the australian UNK and has spent many years living with them say what do women look for in the traditional society what do women look for in a husband
his answer is immediate and UNK a good hunter he says you know what a woman wants in a in a husband is a man who can you know bring home the bacon literally er it's not smoked of course but it's fresh
but you see the point so in our species and of course in most societies this is true men are UNK whether in an agricultural society or an industrial society erm you know one often feels that if you're the man in the family you earn all the money your wife spends it on most of the time erm it certainly happens to me er
i spend most of my time working while my wife spends most of the time shopping but erm
she certainly spends the money but erm but the
well i think you know you've gotta speak up for us poor husbands sometimes
erm the er
but you see the point i'm making in our species males do contribute
now this contribution is not direct it's indirect in the sense that males a male for example who is UNK a wife who is pregnant is not directly invent investing in the offspring clearly you can't do that she has to do that cos the UNK inside her body but UNK he may be feeding his wife protecting her and providing for her in a way that is absolutely critical to her reproductive success too
so it's important to notice that in many species and certainly in ours although males need not as you say make any contribution apart from their genes in principle in fact males are heavy investors in offspring albeit UNK so that must be important mustn't it and that must
but the thing is that it seems that we're a cultural the way the system is set up
yeah
i mean to begin with then obviously the female UNK they depend on that primal investment it's a situation the way that it's divided up
well presumably the reason why the men do the hunting is that they're they figure they're more aggressive and are not gonna be pregnant or UNK to children
well i in that sense it's logical that they're the ones that do er the hunting and i guess the way it's set up logical i think
mm
but i don't see i'm trying to make it like a genetic connection or something i mean or some kind of like you know i mean to me it's just set up
yes sorry UNK
erm i think well the which is erm which is directly UNK to like what happened now
mm
and there's this thing about i mean you know that there that we may be behaving there may be erm ways that we behave that aren't actually functional th the society we've got now might not actually be functional because of the technology we've got
yeah
well that's the problem
yeah
i mean
yeah
then but when that becomes
no oh no certainly not but i mean before we get to the UNK level which is quite er a long way down the road at the UNK level i think i think anne UNK point is she's trying to understand erm just what the UNK of these difference in parental investment are
er the point i was making to her was erm in her paper which er was excellent by the way i forgot to say and i think you put it all very clearly and very nicely y you very nicely set out the basic idea that the consequence and that in principle a male need contribute nothing more than his UNK
th the point that erm we were then discussing was that in practice of course males may m ma may contribute a lot more an and the question was is this er something to do with the UNK of our species or is it just the this was the question you asked me wasn't it
and UNK point was what the system today of course is quite different than what and that is of course completely true
erm the question remains however
i mean er you this is this is your point really to what extent other characteristics er may erm may be part of the same erm of the same thing for example if look at sexual UNK
human beings as we know are sexually UNK and tha that figure seems to fit the er the pattern but erm women have a lot of characteristics that are peculiar to them like for example erm more UNK looks women will retain more UNK looks longer than men do and it is normally regarded as important and a lot of women spend an awful lot of money in the modern society on trying to remain erm looking er looking UNK
now why is that
could that be for example because males with resources would want normally to acquire UNK wives or perhaps it might in other words it could be couldn't it that if males provide resources to females that they can use for primal investment this would then have selective effects on females who will want certain things in order to get erm the investment and one of the things they might want to do is to look UNK
i dunno it kind of figures doesn't it or not
alex looks very sceptical
no i don't i'm still thinking about what you said yesterday about premature UNK
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
and younger men
th it all fitted together did it oh i oh i see
i was sort of like more light UNK sort of er like er got plenty of money but it's UNK pay
oh yes i like the joke you know er where one women says to another how could x possibly marry him you know
yeah
he he's
got a nasty cough providing disorders
you know he's short and ugly an and the other lady says to her but er you should see how tall he is when he stands on his wallet
i mean
yeah and he starts premature UNK
erm
i mean it could be or it could be the reason why er why younger not
yes i mean it's generally true isn't it i think of all societies i can't think of any o of any exceptions that it normally is older males who have more resources
i think in all societies i can't
it can older males that
well
gonna say you know
yeah
there's an interesting study in the book printed by UNK and so on all those you know there's four thing and thing erm human reproductive whatever it is it's on the reading list of UNK payments now that's has anybody read that
well that's interesting the UNK are er traditional people who live in kenya and if they have in other words er men have to pay a certain amount to the erm you know woman if they're gonna marry her and what they did was they study the and related it to the to the girl that was actually getting married and what they found of course was that it fits the predictions of our theory er just as you'd expect given that the cultural things you have to allow for like for example in that most traditional cultures they like er women to be UNK as we'll see in the in the actually fat is critical to female UNK and er so they might not have been UNK so what they did was they simply weighed the girls and they compared their weights with the with the and sure enough strong correlation the UNK the girl the bigger the
in a way they were
and they had two they had two disabled girls there are two girls who were erm you know physically er disabled i forget what was wrong with them i think one had a UNK or something an and they were almost free they weren't completely free but they were nearly free because of their disabilities and
yeah exactly so if you look at it in terms of the UNK you know system you can clearly see that what they showed was youth and UNK were the critical UNK an and UNK if the girl was young UNK and attractive she got a high and if the girl was older erm if she had something wrong with her or she was skinny then the less and that's so it's quite interesting
did they find that the older men
well yes now in fact we know they have not in that study
now that doesn't the UNK was just the study of the erm you know it's a good statistical it's good hard hat social science you know with distribution and everything it's all good stuff erm they don't say that where we do know this is something i have UNK myself very carefully the australian UNK erm we have rich data on this and i've read an awful lot of it and i compared notes with world authorities like david UNK and erm what's his name erm UNK authority on this and they agree that er that's definitely what happens
in australian UNK the young the young girls go to the er the older powerful men
of course if you think about it the consequences of that is these guys die and when they die those wives that they married as young girls are now middle aged women or possibly younger anyway past their youth but th they may not be
certainly they're re UNK and these are societies where every woman is married but no UNK so they're UNK
very often they have a bit of a say in it because you know that the young girl hasn't got but erm interestingly enough they tend to get recycled to young men and it's the older men that get the young girls from their older male and it's younger men who get
you can sometimes get a situation that occurs where a man is married to a woman who is in fact his grandmother this can happen
this leads to UNK
you think that if you work if you if you think about it in other words he has married a woman who is the mother of a wife of his father who he calls mother
i happen to think this is the key to australian UNK society very stressful
what is really going on is they are UNK a system to hide that kind of it's clearly anonymous to marry a woman who's your grandmother
yes in the sense that
y i it can happen and apparently sometimes does that the young man will receive a recycled wife who is in fact the mother of a daughter who has married his father and so he calls her the daughter mother her actual mother is his wife
i see
absolutely and this is why i think they get round this they've solved this problem by saying okay folks we will adopt a purely erm UNK or in other words UNK system of UNK and we won't call there and that's what they do
what effectively i think i mean i've never actually sat down because it would be an enormous mistake and nobody would thank me for it but my guess is that those enormously complex UNK can be understood as a method by which old men rig the system for their own benefit and hide this kinds of ridiculous anonymous and the UNK basically is the young men end up with old wives
when they get older
right that's what happens you see
when they get
could it be also that erm children i mean i dunno how they the children are UNK and what sort of situation
could it be that er evolution in sort of UNK societies are more UNK than that allowed for a more experienced man to teach a young child how to live as opposed to it it's beneficial for
yes
experience
that's right
again that is very clear and it's representing UNK
because what happens you see in these societies and australian UNK are with no exceptions is that if you want a wife if you're a young man and you want a wife you first of all gotta get initiated
there's no way you will get a wife until you are initiated
in fact you won't get any sexually mature erm er woman to have er any relationship with men UNK or otherwise if you're not initiated because they'll just say you're a boy and er and er an adult woman would feel it was UNK you know to sleep with a mere boy she'd insist you've got to be a man and to be a man you normally got to be initiated and that normally means being UNK
now the UNK are controlled by the elder men who have all the wives and if you don't behave and join the club and conform to what th the crown UNK expect you won't get initiated and i if you don't unless you say you won't get any wives and the guys who are doing the UNK the initiated are the very same guys who have all the daughters
so a young man really has to get initiated and conform to what the UNK expect if he's going to have any reproductive success at all and that's exactly what happens
so these guys UNK these UNK to prove you know that they want to join the club band and i if they pass the UNK test then they're joined in and then they're given a wife
in many societies david UNK tells me the man who does the UNK who actually chops off the UNK as it were UNK you a wife for it and he says in many of them if you give a man your UNK then you've got a right to demand a wife
he says he knows cases where wives weren't given and there were then very serious er conflicts broken up because the man who didn't get the wife then thought he'd been UNK and apparently his complaint was you know er wife i give you my UNK
apparently they talk like this
david UNK says this is the language they use you know
australian UNK are very direct about this so they so they do expect something back for the UNK an and it's a kind of UNK thing where okay you UNK me and i'll put up with all this crap from you but you know you give me a wife you've got daughters i want a wife and er if i don't get it there's gonna be real trouble and this is how the system works
so you're quite right the elder men have a tremendous control not over on the over supply of women but also over the younger men
how can that be beneficial i know what you're saying but
well i think the answer to that is you've got to remember this kind of hunting is cooperative and cooperative hunting does rely first of all on having other men to go hunting with you which is which is important and also or so i'm told by people like david UNK and UNK an awful lot depends on information we want to know where the game is who saw what where what did they catch you know was there UNK over the so and so ranges and so on and you need to know that information if you're gonna be an effective hunter and you need good communication with other men
er very often australian UNK societies you meet men the UNK at these ritual UNK and if you're one of the club then in the ritual they'll tell you they'll say hey you know you know you know you say where did you get all these UNK you know oh we got them over at the so and so ranges or down at the so and so water hole that's where they all are this week and this is very important information for man
if you're not a member of the club and you're not accepted the UNK and people don't like you they won't tell you and as a result you won't be an effective hunter you won't be able to support many wives even if you wanted them and if you have wives what they needed because if a man doesn't feed his wives they all eventually get up and go they'll say two fingers you know you can't feed us
this is one of the things i want you to se see today and this wonderful film i was gonna show today and i hope i'll show next week third time lucky they actually interview the wives the UNK wives of some erm guy in africa some african erm and they to them they actually ask the wives why do you know why are you married to this man and they say well he UNK us you know th that's why we're married to him he gives us food and he's apparently got five this particular man they interviewed three of them were active and two of them were elderly and the three active wives are quite open about the fact that this man's a good provider and therefore they stay with him but they wouldn't in the case of australian UNK they wouldn't stay if they didn't get fed and they only get fed because he's a good hunter and to be a good hunter you need to go on good terms of men and that's how it works
but of course it's a very tough deal for women i mean women in erm in a way really get the raw end of it because that to some extent they're at the mercy of the whole system even though they can if they absolutely have to
it's not easy and where's she gonna go
you know she's gotta find someone else to go an and live with because by and large you can't survive on your own in the australian UNK certainly not if you're a woman hardly if you're a man
so it it's as you say it's a very tough hard life and in order to survive people really do need the help of other people and that's why you've really got to conform to a large extent in the society and you haven't got a lot of choice about erm you know wh what you'd like to especially if you're if you're young and female and not much men not if you want to get any wives that is
so the erm but as but as UNK reminds us i mean if that's the kind of life our emotional parameters are my guess is that is that that's probably the truth certainly a persuasive argument
then when you look at the other range of human societies then you have to say well you know how is it how is it working out in other in other types of societies where all the basic erm conditions of life may be different and that of course is one of these big erm big and small problems that we still we're still really at the at the starting point fact
i mean does anybody think that parental investment theory is relevant at all to modern industrial society or is it completely irrelevant
matthew you're a you're a UNK and a and a and a and an independent UNK what do you think
i don't know i'm not very sort of convinced one way nor the other
that sounds UNK
dean
well i'm a supporter of it which you know erm it strikes me being far more effective than other forms er of er explanation
how much ice does it cut in the modern industrial society
i think i think it think it must cut quite a lot because i mean there's certain i don't these biological constraints
how would they show themselves i mean
what people to look you know in the modern society women don't have to rely on men or don't have to have traditional sex roles this is a point of view isn't it
well i think er i think well i think you have to have i mean i don't really parental investment and stuff like that UNK period
i think i think that in any i mean in if you wanna if you wanna look at it in terms i mean i think labour it it's always gonna have to be there and i think the biological constraints put the you know UNK device
well there are ways aren't there i mean even in traditionally i mean what of wet nursing i mean that's an example isn't it where a woman gets another woman to do the job for her
darren is that what point were you gonna make
well i think like i said two ways one is erm
mm
or if you look at it another way that is men and women are equal and we haven't yet got round that they are very different but they are equal
i dunno er you know you can put woman staying at home having the child for instance when there aren't enough children to fill the schools realize that having children is a very important in economic values what with nations increasing staying at home
yes i must say i personally sympathy with that i mean i think that erm women's er role is er very much UNK and UNK it should be because if you think about it they're having the children and bringing them up well this is one of the most worthwhile things to do
society you can't going to survive unless you have a woman back in the having the kids and we might see that as a you know you laugh when i say that you know
well he doesn't survive he might survive
alright this is what i mean
yeah
but you know it's really difficult discussing this topic without people UNK and getting all upset
it's that they have equal decisions really so you can't say
it's only how we of behaviour
well
but they are really equal because without one another they're not gonna
i don't think i don't think it will i think erm certainly from a cultural point of view the questions that comes up of erm in that type of society they think sod this i'm going hunting but the fact of the matter is the men
i mean time of physiological difference and strength needs of their strength that they could just about fire a and he couldn't even pull them back and so they you know fine if you wanna go hunting use the boat
yeah
the arrows but the
yeah
and it's but then it's a question of where a woman a woman could but you know is it that easy to jump out cultural you know cultural investment provided by that and er you know y you
and if a man is slightly stronger other way round so he can collect more food
and another argument which is that
yeah it's the it's the with the word natural isn't it that er you know people often use the word natural to mean good and right and therefore something you should do but of course no not always i mean if i said to you death is natural nobody here would think i was advocating suicide or that er we shouldn't have hospitals to try and save people's lives i mean er when you say death is natural what you mean is death is one of those things that we just have to put up with we'd rather we didn't but we're all gonna have to face it in the end some of us sooner than others er but erm but there we are
however if you say erm oh well you know erm boys will be boys that's natural tha that sounds as if you're kind of making excuses for them and UNK them so i think you've got to be very careful about how you use the word natural and clearly it raises the whole question of how far you can you can push erm cultural ideals against natural constraints an and what really is the issue
you see it may be that UNK right i must admit i think i agree with dean i think he is right that the real problem is that natural selection may have fitted us by as it were UNK our emotional system
it may be at a at a truly rational level we can all perfectly well do all kinds of other things UNK on a truly rational level because there we have this er high degree of that comes with UNK but at a deeper kind of gut level the emotional feelings we find that it's much more difficult and at that point if you don't try and change things and do things that are unnatural you find you're kind of going against the emotional grain and er perhaps some people find it easier than others but perhaps everybody will feel a certain erm tug as it were certain erm UNK or a certain emotional UNK from themselves which er perhaps is because we're trying to do something more basic we just weren't designed for
i don't know i mean this would you UNK with that dean
yeah question so we're saying that the difference between male and female roles in this UNK selection
sorry remind us what you mean by UNK selection again
where well where er UNK selection i is very huge differences between men male and female and this was then UNK over a period of time
oh i see what you mean yes fine okay
okay so are so it's just tha that along with this a psychological context so you got a biological and psychological going hand in hand UNK
yes i mean this is the point i'll be developing later in the lectures i'm currently spending a lot of time kind of UNK and thinking about this but i it's ultimately the question of genes affect behaviour and more and more i come to the to the view that they probably do so erm through what we call our emotions that our genes kind of erm guide us to do so and things through various subjective feelings like when we're hungry we know we're hungry and it's a subjective feeling of UNK
what is actually happening of course we know in that case what is actually happening because nerves erm er UNK in the base of the brain are actually UNK the blood flow as it goes through with sugar level and when the sugar level drops to a critical point some of those UNK start to fire and as they fire gradually the message is passed on up to the higher brain centres and eventually you get the feeling you're hungry
now you you're that's a subjective feeling you don't actually know that there are UNK in your blood sugar level but you certainly know when you need something to eat and it it's a kind of subjective feeling and it's not UNK in the least to claim that our genes have UNK our brain in that way to do that because obviously we'd like to have more reproductive success if you know when you're hungry than when you don't and it may be that a lot of in a lot of other ways genes affect our behaviour through similar erm effects that is subjective feelings we have often of an emotional nature to make us want to do certain things and an and dislike doing others and it may be that we we're really kind of UNK with that
why is it in the genes why is it people are able to adjust their UNK
well oh yes i'm sure i'm not saying that's the only thing that controls people's food intake i mean clearly there are things cultural some cultures the japanese seem to love eating raw fish i mean how they can bring themselves to do it i do now know i mean the raw is i don't think i'd want to eat again but er erm not always if they were cooked either but erm the er and certainly if you look at the australian UNK even though we take the australian UNK as our kind of UNK people they have astonishing food UNK i mean their attitudes to food are very UNK er effective to a quite extraordinary extent some so that somebody discovered that eating a UNK food by accident they'll get very ill a kind of UNK illness
so i'm not saying th that there aren't these th the important other inputs but what i am saying is that if you ask yourself where the kind of gene behaviour interface really exists is clearly in the human er in the human mind and it may be that the basic kind of parameters erm have been set for our emotions and i really don't see how we can change those
i was thinking for instance when you have generation of young men how do you what's the time left to something extreme can be done UNK and people can be sort of you know convinced that they're right and that they go out there and get machine guns can be done UNK whereas
well it may be of course that kind of thing has always tended to happen gather of society UNK goes on and young men are expected to go and find very often
yeah more immediately but i mean when they're sort of it has
well then i agree then i then i think you do need a fairly sophisticated psychological theory to try and explain er how that could come about
that's one of the reasons why i'm why i'm also interested in er in freud because i think freud provides that i happen to think that freud's studies of crowd group psychology actually explain that although it takes time to you know certainly not at five minutes to four it takes time to explain but i think there is an explanation there and i think you c y you can claim that there are certain emotions to do with identification and UNK th that our genes have a UNK which things like erm UNK erm er kind of UNK can exploit in a modern culture which in primal cultures would have primal cultures people identify with their with their local UNK and their local culture and that's that might ultimately promote their reproductive success but that in modern cultures this identification occurs with erm on a completely different level and with lots of people will not merely because you need so many more people modern cultures you have much more erm much bigger groups and you just meet many more people that than you were ever th there is some interesting research recently published for instance which shows erm organizations seem to have a critical size and that people are not really able to track more than about two hundred and fifty other people in other words you can have face to face relationships with up to about two hundred and fifty others but once it gets beyond two hundred and fifty it's too much and you start forgetting somebody as if the brain was UNK to an UNK group size and once you get above that you just can't keep
have you read about that
that's right i would say so
yeah
that's right yeah
yeah
that's right yeah
is there also something to do what's happening in eastern europe
they say you know UNK
well you see the great soviet experiment is a good example isn't it of a whole civilization was based on a o on a kind of great social experiment was based on ultimately on erm UNK principles and then a part of the scenes
er and i suppose the great you know lesson of social sciences in some ways if it's if it's for anything it ought to be to try and avoid that kind of disaster because erm if we understood ourselves better we might you know in the future try and avoid that thing because we just wouldn't attempt if that wasn't an attempt to be
so erm i mean the justification for this kind of course i would claim is ultimately to try and make people more realistic about what is possible and er the because th the advantage of knowing what's possible is you can avoid impossible experiments that ultimately result in disaster for everyone
well sceptical silence but that's what i'd like to think that we were doing
well yes
drug anti drug legislation may be another thing
of course drugs is one of the wonderful examples that the very thing that UNK was talking about something that wasn't there in the beginning and that has been produced by modern technology and is now a big problem but is not a problem to australian UNK because they don't have any drugs er to speak of course now they do and alcohol is a terrible problem with australian UNK i talked to david UNK about it
absolutely awful
well the UNK are at least trying to didn't have much success apparently
really
and they went UNK
folks it's four o'clock erm just a second erm just before you go let me remind you next week it's UNK
okay
and darren we gotta i'll see you in just a sec
hello
ah really
erm who gave you the message
oh er i don't think i ra i don't think i rang you actually er i wonder if the message was from someone else
erm i do need to see you some time erm let me just see erm but i've got your erm your last UNK report here that we need to meet to discuss
er could we make a date
erm as i said it wasn't me that phoned originally my guess is that there may be somebody else at the school who is trying to contact you but while you're on the line let's just make a little let's just make a little date
erm what about when would be convenient for a quick tutorial
what about thursday
right
what about next week what about monday
right y your day off well that means you don't want to come into the school
okay next monday what time would suit you
right
right
could we make it at erm two p m
right that's two p m next monday the first february okay
see you then
as i said i didn't phone i dunno who it was
erm it might be an idea to try and get hold of him whoever took the message cos it might be something important but anyway i'm glad you phoned
thanks bye
right now sorry to keep you waiting for a minute
erm now did we did we do your reports
no
right let's do that first cos that's important
erm i'll have to sign the form
there we are right
right i got all four here of course i didn't bother to write a comment cos i'm delighted
i've given you an a for participation b plus for written work and that gives you an average of b which is good or excellent
so that's alright there's no problems there
now mr 's philosophy
aha
has given you a for participation which is good c for written work which is satisfactory and b minus for assessment so it actively UNK er gave a paper for the class but no second essay
does that mean you owe him an essay or something
no essays you got both you've got two essays
well right he's this was probably written before he got the second one because they would have done this last term
they were handed in on time handed in on time
well perhaps you ought to bring that
he marked them both
i should raise that with him
he's marked them both
has he
yeah
right
i mean i got pretty bad marks i find it difficult find it very difficult
really
well it's frustrating the hell out of me you know
why's that
i've never done any
order
er just a couple of announcements colleagues if er those delegates who actually smoke if you've got any UNK cigarette UNK could you pass them to any members of the northern region
they're used by the south tyneside local authority branch to help buy a UNK for the UNK member who's recently UNK surgery to remove a tumour from his brain
so don't throw them away colleagues hand them to any delegate from the northern region
colleagues just to try and let you know what er i've got in my mind concerning the business that's fell off the agenda yesterday and today so far
you'll recall that the er regional reports in the regional in the general secretary's er report fell off the agenda yesterday and there are a number of resolutions which have fell off at this morning
what i'm planning to do is to put them back in the order colleagues could you settle down please i'm planning to put them back on the agenda in the order that they fell off and er hopefully the first opportunity in that connection may be wednesday afternoon but i need to have a discussion with colleagues about that but i'll certainly let you know at the first available opportunity

president i move
thanks very much indeed
conference accepts standing orders commission report number two
thanks very much that's being circulated colleagues
colleagues i now call er motion three rule six appeals procedure for members that's for the south western region to move
president congress and our inclusive visitors as well because nobody's mentioned them yet
denise from the UNK region
i'm here to talk about the rule which applies to appeals procedures for members
i don't suppose many have read it in depth cos to be honest when do we read a rule when we don't have to unless we absolutely need it
i understand the c e c asked us to withdraw this motion because they say it is not necessary
well my region didn't agree with that we feel it is very necessary
for those not familiar what happens is a member puts their case to their branch
if they're UNK he or she can then appeal to the regional committee
if UNK there they can appeal to the central executive committee and if UNK there there's the appeals tribunal
the UNK states that a member has the right to appeal but it doesn't say that they have the right to be told why they've lost
what this meal means in real terms is a member doesn't necessarily know for sure why they have lost
they would obviously have some idea from the appeal hearing it itself but since they have to put all of their reasons for their request in writing the very least i believe they should be able to have is a UNK reply
i'd like to demonstrate this by reading a little bit from a letter that was sent to one of our members in this position
it's from the regional secretary i write with reference to your appeal to the regional committee of today's date and i have to inform you that your appeal was unsuccessful
that's easy enough to understand
i would therefore advise you that you have the right to appeal to c e c within one month against this decision
again that's easy enough to understand it's in the UNK
the final paragraph if this is the course of action you wish to take in the first instance you should write to me requesting that your appeal be heard by the central executive committee
i will then forward your request to the general secretary
again that's fine but the member had no idea as to exactly why he'd lost the appeal
it doesn't tell you a great deal in that letter
as trade unionists representing our members in the workplace this is something we would be unhappy with to go through a procedure with one of our members and know that member has lost but not exactly know why
i don't think it is something that we would accept
when our member then UNK to the regional secretary and said well i think i do wanna appeal and go further than this because i feel i'm right what letter did we then get in reply
again this is another one from our region
i quote word for word on the question of wanting details as to why the appeal was UNK it is not a practice of the organization to give the reasons for such decisions and i would add that i've spoken to the national executive officer on this matter and he's confirmed that we are not required to do so
well i'm sorry if i was in my workplace i wouldn't be happy representing a member and then be told by the employer i'm not required to tell you why you've lost your appeal and i don't think this is something we should do within our own organization on our own members
the c e c i believe are gonna say this isn't necessary
what we need is for every single appeal stage for the member to at least have the right to know why he or she has lost
please support this motion
thank you
is there a seconder
is there a seconder for the motion
formally seconded thank you
motion six rule amendment to be moved by south western motion six
sorry i was UNK off over there
again this is about the procedure that we're following but we're talking now about rules procedures for branches and i have to say that i'm up here without the support of my region on this one
i understand again the c e c is asking you to oppose it because they say it's not necessary
i would like to ask a question that if this particular rule isn't necessary then how does a branch go about appealing a decision made elsewhere in the union's hierarchy
i've just talked about what happens when a branch member wants to appeal but this is a branch as a whole that's made a decision at a meeting that it doesn't agree with something that's happened
again i've got a letter to quote from cos we're good at keeping correspondence in my branch
it's a letter from the executive services officer that states rule six which is the one i've just been talking about on the previous motion is quite clear in saying that only individual members can pursue appeals and not a branch
this is the basis on which my branch believes that we need a new rule which covers branches
because we need that new rule what is happening at the moment
if a branch doesn't like something what does it get the chance to do
well it has to borrow rule six that we were talking about just now
you might say to yourself well is this a very rare UNK so that really this branch is making a fuss about nothing branches don't have to go through appeals procedures cos it never happens
that isn't the case
i've got another letter here from the general secretary
you may appeal under rule six my branch was told this is the appeal procedures that refers to members not branches but it will be well understood you are making the appeal on behalf of the branch which obviously means we've gotta borrow one to do something else
it's not a rare UNK because the general secretary himself says we've followed this procedure on many occasions in the past
if it's happening so often then should we not be having our own procedure for that to happen
if we look at rule six and we've all been given UNK if people have brought them with us what we have to do is bend that rule so that it applies to branches not members
what i'll do is i'll read you the first paragraph of rule six and actually bend the rule and put those words in and it really doesn't make any sense at all so listen carefully on this one and don't be surprised if you don't understand me
should any branch have any complaint to make they must do so to their branch secretary who must submit the matter to the branch it's talking to yourself
if any branch is not satisfied with the decision of the branch they may appeal to the regional committee
obviously you need to appeal to the regional committee if as a branch you're not happy but this rule shouldn't need to be bent we should have one that is ours to be used for branches the general secretary himself says that it's happened on several occasions so let's be a real trade union not one that UNK from peter to pay paul let's have a proper rule for branches
thank you
is that seconded
formally seconded
thanks very much
i call frank to put the c e c position
president congress frank UNK on behalf of the c e c
er as the last speaker said everybody has received a copy of the rules in their wallet and i would them to take a lo take that copy out and have a look at it
take it out a have a look at it
have a look at rule six
you've all got it i hope
page ten
we're all comrades here so the UNK should go out the window for starters
the first speaker who was here at this rostrum made the point about er the right of individuals and it's not in the UNK
have a look at the rule the right of individuals is there
have a look at it
i'll tell you what there's not a lot of unions with that type of rule in their UNK
the g m b is one of the only unions in my opinion unless somebody can UNK me who use that type of rule
you can take it to your branch you can take it to your regional committee you can take it as far as the c e c and that costs a lot of money
for one individual but we're not complaining about that we accept that
what they're asking for is already in the rule already in the rule what the speaker spoke about er motion number three on rule amendment and have a look at it what the motion states is not what she spoke about not what she spoke about
because if you read the motion she is just looking for the rights of an individual and rule six in the rule book applies the laws of natural justice which we're all for the c e c agree we're all for it
so we are asking the bristol and branch to withdraw the motion
we're doing UNK a favour our lads speaks plain to you we're doing UNK a favour
we asking you withdraw the motion
and if you don't withdraw it the c e c is completely and totally opposed to it because we already have what it's asking for in the rule
have a look at it read it for yourselves
look i don't want to insult your intelligence i'm an UNK right we don't have a pile of that according to everybody like ya know
but have a look at the rule and you'll find that it bloody well states exactly what they're asking for in that motion
i'll move onto the next one
we're totally opposed to the next one
totally
now i was gonna tell you a story but i'll not
you see the next one right the reason we're totally opposed to it as UNK have been bloody debating it all morning with the labour party and i can't even bloody join it cos i live in northern ireland
now if lived in the republic of ireland i could join the labour party but i can't join it because i live in northern ireland right but have a look at that motion what you're talking about
frank could you wind up please
er sorry president worthy president and all the rest of it what i'm saying is that we're totally opposed to it because what you're going to have here is you're gonna have a situation where branches you gonna have them fighting between branches and the c e c
thanks frank
and we don't need that
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you back again
we're not going to withdraw either of these
thank you
as has just been suggested and i also mentioned in my speech yes please read the rule it doesn't say at every stage and that is all we're asking for that at every stage in the procedure a member knows why he or she hasn't won the appeal
i really don't think that's an awful lot to ask for
he mentioned cost well one UNK ever so expensive isn't it just to let someone know where they stand
i'm sorry if that's causing people a problem but that is basic human right
he talked of natural justice
well i consider that letting someone know why they've lost is natural justice
in terms of the rule that we need for branches i've already said the general secretary agrees with me that this happens often
what it's got to do with the UNK ability to join the labour party i'm not absolutely sure perhaps someone can tell me afterwards
but branches need a facility it's not about in fighting it's about something that actually happened within my branch i'd like to add that we won the appeal when the branch went through it raised two questions we won one we lost one
but we actually needed a procedure that procedure was followed as best we could by borrowing another rule and it was achieved at the end of the day
there's no UNK within my region on the fact that one person felt one thing and one felt another and as democratic trade unionists there shouldn't be any in fighting or UNK just because we need to discuss something on which we disagree
the whole purpose of a conference is about UNK with each other and then agreeing a statement as a compromise for whatever is reached at the end of the day
it's not in fighting and i urge you to support both of these please
colleagues as conference will have heard from the mover of motion three motion six not prepared to withdraw and the c e c is therefore asking you to oppose both
put motion three to the vote
all those in favour
against
that's lost
ooh
motion six yes it was yes it was
no need for a card vote clearly lost put motion six to the vote
all those in favour
against
that's lost
oh yes
clearly lost colleagues i can assure you
colleagues can i just make a point as well while we're progressing
erm obviously the right of reply er is not an automatic right
it's where the mover chooses to exercise that particular right but in so doing the mover cannot or should not introduce new material and make another speech
he or she should respond to the er the points that are being made on behalf of the c e c
i mean that's the rules of debate but i thought i'd make that particular point because it has a little bit of UNK licence er in that
colleagues
sections special report section and industrial conferences
can i advise your planning to take this particular debate
we'll ask for the general secretary to move the c e c special report that will be seconded by robert member of the central executive council
we'll then take motion one a one a er motion one o motion one five three motion one five six motion one six three
those will be moved and seconded
we'll then come back and i will invite speakers from all the regions in respect of the special report
call the general secretary to move the special report section and industrial conferences
john general secretary
moving the special report section and industrial conferences and also president if i may at the same time moving motion one a on behalf of the c e c rather than returning to the rostrum a second time
first of all the report
colleagues last year as you know er the c e c put a report before you called wider democracy
you'll also remember it was quite a lively debate history lessons buckets and UNK presented to the platform and a good deal of passion
er but that of course was all about the most controversial aspect of the report which was the frequency of congress
the rest of the report which was the role of section conferences and industrial conferences which have been the subject of fairly detailed consultations throughout regions over the previous two years and appeared to be widely accepted was hardly debated at all
but of course when the whole report went down when wider democracy was defeated we also lost the guidelines for section and industrial conferences
and that's left us in some er difficulties frankly because one of the things that er the c e c was recommending that work of a strategic nature which at the moment is undertaken by industrial conferences should be moved over to be dealt with by section conferences and that meant that a number of industrial conferences need not meet any longer so we would avoid the UNK the overlap and the waste
the solution of course is obvious this year the c e c no doubt suitably UNK by the vote last year is UNK the section and industrial conference proposals on their own without any other issues attached
the logic is obvious we have seven sections now seven sectional conferences these conferences must have proper terms of reference proper guidelines for debate and clear rules as to who can attend who can speak and who can vote and that's the most important part of our report
to fill this obvious gap in our constitutional arrangements
the report goes on to recommend changes in industrial conferences and i've already mentioned that to ensure that there is no UNK overlap between the two and robert in seconding the motion will go into some of the details of the er way the new conferences will operate erm following me
i now if i may president turn to motion one a which UNK er UNK rule a five
this is a more difficult issue
the UNK and the special report spell out the nature and function of the sections
they are industrial sections concerned with what is happening in a particular industry or a group of industries
that's of course why section conferences cannot debate matters reserved to congress and why national committees cannot cons consider issues within the remit of the c e c
they are concerned with the industry and the section of industry alone but of course the issue that we then have to deal with is we must make sure that those section committees those national section committees carry credibility with the members working in that section
they must been seen their decisions must be seen to reflect the interest and wishes of members currently employed in the section and as we have always believed industrial and negotiating policy is best made by members at work in the sector who feel the day to day pressures know what is going on motion one a seeks to ensure that this will happen
so this with some restrictions UNK the membership of the committee to people who are at work
but then of course the difficulty arises because these are difficult times there is a recession people are losing their jobs day by day and we didn't think it was appropriate to start applying some UNK on people's election rights and their membership of the committee
so of course we've stretched things a bit
the amendment will of course not remove anyone during their period of office if they lose their job
of course not they've been elected for a period they serve to the end of that period whether they're made redundant or not so they go on for the four year term
and also of course we've so worded the er amendment to rule to ensure that anybody who does any work in the sector in the eighteen months before the election period even of a temporary nature will be eligible to stand as a member of the section committee
now of course when you put restrictions on that seem to deny any group of members any rights you must be very careful
so UNK any UNK arrive that this is some thin end of some wedge i should also add that the restriction we're proposing only applies to national committees doesn't apply to any other office anywhere in the union and to reinforce that point the c e c will be recommending support for a general motion UNK the rights of people who are unemployed or retired to hold office throughout the g m b
colleagues er the defeat of wider democracy last year left us with a bit of a hole in our constitution
i hope you will accept this report you'll pass the amendment and complete the constitutional framework of our sections
i move
could i have motion one a formally seconded
thank you mary
robert to second the special report
president congress
i have been introduced but there is only one small point and
i am from the scottish region and a member of the technical UNK section
president congress
on behalf of the central executive council i second the special report on sectional and industrial conferences
we need a coherent guideline for the relationship between congress sectional national conferences and what up until now we have called national and regional conferences
this is provided in the report
the aim of the guidelines is to set out a clear role for each conference within a coherent sensible framework
the sectional conferences will decide strategic issues affecting industrial groups within the section
they will be responsible for the overall strategy of the section
the newly named national negotiating conferences will decide bargaining issues affecting members covered by the particular national negotiating councils
but if there is no national negotiating councils then there is no delegates national UNK conference
regional UNK conference will be held where the regional UNK the regional negotiating councils or where there is a need for a regional sounding board for the effective operation of the national negotiating council
they will feed the national negotiating council
so we have a coherent democratic system for developing industrial and policies within the union
the UNK of that congress should pull back excuse me the UNK means that congress should pull back from UNK industrial strategies and negotiating deals but should be left to the members concerned
indeed congress will concentrate on debating and deciding issues of a wide spread and common concern to all our members such as finance the UNK including the structure and organization of the union our political economical economic and social policies
our relations with the t u c and the labour party
nevertheless you'll have a great deal to talk about within congress and you'll have a lot more time to do so
the c e c believe that the report will provide a UNK democratic and sensible system for policy making of our union
it will involve more members with decision making taken by those who are responsible for reporting back to the members and for carrying out the effects of such responsibilities
it will enhance the accountability within the g m b and UNK improve the quality of the decisions we make
i therefore second the motion and hope you will support
motion one o midland region to move
on one a okay
sit there colleague would ya
and whilst alan's coming to the rostrum colleagues can the UNK from london of motion one five three one five six er london again one six three birmingham if they would come down to the front and also it would be very helpful colleagues if regions if regions have indicated a speaker on the special report if those colleagues could come down as well it would be helpful
alan
thanks mr chairman
colleagues alan lancashire region opposing motion one a on behalf of lancashire region
colleagues i must oppose this rule amendment
if passed anyone not in employment for eighteen months prior to nomination will not be eligible to attend any sectional conference
colleagues i have members in my branches who are unemployed but still pay full contributions not because they have to cos they want to
they show their commitment to this union where is this commitment union's commitment to them
i'll tell you what it is colleagues it's a case of no pay no play
colleagues it's a good job this rule was not out when will UNK was about eh
he wouldn't have had enough members to attend a meeting never mind form a trade union
for this union to say only employed members can represent them is disgraceful
utterly disgraceful
the c e c should be ashamed of theirselves
in our branches we believe the best person for the job should represent the members not the best employed person
oppose motion one a
barbara are you on one a
yes
i had feeling you might be
er barbara birmingham region speaking against one a the amendment to rule a five with the support of the birmingham region
congress rule a five seeks to UNK the unemployed from taking an active role in this organization
there are calls to retain members they wanna keep you they want your money but if you're unemployed you take can't take an active part in the g m b
they say this to the very people who have been the UNK of this organization the very people that built the organization
they who have kept the membership going under the tory regime and they that have suffered the effects of recession and job losses and brought about by the tories
and now president colleagues this organization seeks to UNK those very people
rule a five was brought to us by the amalgamation of the UNK who themselves have tried to get rid of this bloody rule
g m b UNK g m d b members are sick of having rules imposed on them brought about by amalgamation
it's high time we kept some of the old g m w rules
colleagues i would say and if you'll excuse the expression i don't think this c e c knows its UNK from its elbow
barbara the lights
for
barbara the lights are very strong in here
pardon
for in supporting rule a five at the c e c by a very slim majority they also supported resolution one five three by an overwhelming majority which says exactly the opposite to rule a five
colleagues the birmingham region says reject this amendment and support resolution one five three
er billy are you on one a as well
opposing
you're opposing
is are there any other colleagues alan please don't come down any more please
what you waving at me for john
right you're there
are you any of you colleagues on one a
no right
last two
okay bill
billy northern region opposing the c e c rule what we've just heard about
congress as a life long trade unionist and i might add it's me golden wedding next year
because my good lady's always said you married that bloody union the day you started work
as a life long trade unionist colleagues i have held one firm principle
that principle colleagues is equality
if this rule change is agreed we accept that one member has more rights than another
it places member against member it causes division it UNK our solidarity and it UNK our movement
congress it's against this background against a lifetime of commitment to equality that i firmly oppose the change
it stands against it stands against every principle of trade unionism
to hold that one g m b member should have more rights than another to say that one member can stand for an election but not another
congress our principles have stood for a hundred and three years
by working together we have built a strong and powerful organization
by holding equality as a central principle of our union we have UNK solidarity between our members
that regardless of background education race sex occupation or age every single trade unionist is an individual member with the same rights and responsibilities as his or her colleagues
now let's take the young activist who starts off in the trade union movement
he starts off in his factory in his workplace or what have ya
he UNK the place he recruits members he's run off his feet and the employer turns round and says we cannot have this here this UNK too good get him out sack him
aye they do
they do sack 'em because it happened when there was full employment never mind about three million on the dole
and let's face it brothers sisters some of our members have more chance of seeing lord UNK riding as they have of finding a job
colleagues
i am not going to insult your intelligence and beg you to vote or oppose this vote
i'm not going to insult your intelligence
but what i'll do if i may applaud your UNK when it comes to the vote
thank you
mr president congress brothers and sisters and i hope you're comrades and all after this
one lady speaker was right the sister the UNK brought this rule in
i wasn't at the conference what a pity
it wouldn't have been on the books if i ever seen UNK at its worst it's in that bloody motion
here were people through no fault of their own government policy UNK and lo and behold our union kick us in the bloody face because you're unemployed
well i'll tell you this you oppose this motion with all your might and don't let 'em get away with it
president congress
UNK midland and east coast region moving amendment to rule a three
the rule as it now stands is a contradiction
it provides for an annual apex conference it UNK that the conference shall be advisory to the c e c and all decisions shall be subject to c e c congress policy
it then lays down that no matter shall be discussed that is within the remit of congress
but all matters are in the remit of congress
this effectively UNK any subject being discussed at an apex conference
my branch submitted a motion to the apex conference two years ago that sought to draw attention to unemployment amongst the white collar workers
it was ruled out of order by the standing orders committee as it fell foul of rule a three the subject was within the remit of congress
last year manchester central apex branch submitted a motion highlighting the dangers of UNK related shock syndrome arising out of the death of an apex member
the standing orders committee ruled it out of order under rule a three within the remit of congress
i'm pleased to see it on this year's congress agenda
why are the c e c fearful of matters being discussed at the apex conference
they are the final UNK as to where the motions passed at the apex conference are acceptable under the advisory element of the rule my branch are only too aware of this
four years ago the apex conference carried a motion from my branch seeking the continuation of the old apex rule providing for gold UNK at retirement for members with twenty five years continuous membership
what happened the c e c refused to accept the decision
the apex conference is finding itself severely restricted on matters it can discuss by this rule
it needs to be laid down what can and what cannot be discussed by an apex conference my branch wish to remove the present restriction and ask for your support
i move
is there a seconder for one o
president congress visitors
UNK midlands and east coast region seconding motion one o
what this motion quite clearly seeks to do is to widen debate at our apex section conference
it's my firm belief that if we continue to UNK debate on general issues at our section conferences then we also restrict the flow of knowledge within the union
at present there's no denying that sectional conferences need some guidelines i mean you only need one experience like last year's apex conference to realize that
admittedly the confusion wasn't entirely the fault of the UNK the mood of the delegates didn't particularly help but the situation was something like this
we were allowed to debate a motion on homelessness but a motion as a previous speaker has said on toxic shock syndrome was ruled out of order as it fell within the remit of congress
confused
so was i
was i therefore to assume that homelessness was an issue peculiar only to apex members within the g m b or was i to reach the alternative and i might say equally ridiculous conclusion that despite its majority of women membership toxic UNK shock syndrome was not of particular interest to apex members
of course not well let's look a little further into the issue
section conferences are composed of delegates who in the main will never get to congress
if we limit the forum for debate on important issues such as t s or for instance racist attacks to congress then many section delegates may never be exposed to those debates
so as i've already said we need some guidelines but are the existing ones the right ones
i would suggest not
i personally would prefer us to be looking at some way of allowing greater scope for debate at section conferences and where necessary to have decisions on general issues deferred to congress for UNK or withdrawal
remember wider democracy
well if we're really into wider democracy we ought to be promoting wider debate please support
one five three london region to move
john london regional committee
moving motion one five three unemployed members qualification for office
now there shouldn't be any terrible complexity about these series of motions that we're considering now
the motion that we are proposing is fundamentally straightforward
it simply recognizes the importance of retaining the experience of g m b activists in a situation like now where thousands upon thousands are being made redundant and in many cases UNK for trade union activity
so what are we saying
that as they've been made redundant as they've been UNK for trade union activity possibly we then as a union decide that they cannot stand for office
that is what the section report says in certain aspects of it
rule amendment treble one a which the general secretary also took the opportunity to move does not fully address that situation
it makes it far more complex than it should be
it introduces as has been pointed out by numerous speakers the famous eighteen month rule
so it effectively UNK unemployed long term unemployed people from being active in that section
it's clear to me and i think it's clear to the vast majority in congress that it's a matter for branches to decide who represents them in the various UNK of the union
it's not a matter for ruling people out because they've become unemployed through no fault of their own absolutely not
so i've gotta say that in terms of credibility it's and the regional sec er the general secretary made the point about credibility within those sections and within that those elections it's for the branches to actually decide who represents them UNK or not and for this for any attempt to change rule in this particular way
we therefore have got to oppose rule amendment one a as well as oppose the sectional and industrial conference report for the same reason
both of them in their own separate ways seek to UNK unemployed members
it's very simple congress if you support motion one five three this probably will never happen again and we won't have the situation where there's an attempt to UNK unemployed members
i move
is there a seconder for one five three
one five three seconded
formally seconded
one five six london region to move
president congress
dave london region
public services section moving motion one five six section conferences
congress as we are all aware since nineteen eighty eight this union has moved to UNK of its membership according to their trade
for example local authority workers like myself to the public services section to the UNK and utilities section
a very good concept and is probably working
the difficulty seems to arise within the membership in knowing exactly what areas of responsibility each section has what are the rules of debate for sectional conferences are decisions taken at sectional conferences binding on the union UNK relating to that section and within all of this UNK what role does the apex conference now play as those members like myself are presumably within one of the other sections too
therefore congress we must call on the c e c to answer the confusion in plain english so that i and i'm sure many other of our members can understand in the form of a document circulated to the branches so that we can go forward into the future at least understanding where we fit into our own union
and then with that understanding i am sure many more members will want to become delegates to sectional conferences armed with a clear and concise guidelines
congress i move
seconder for one five six
thank you
motion one six three birmingham region to move
rose birmingham region
president congress
motion one six three seeks to ensure that no pre conference UNK meetings are held prior to sections regional and national conferences
i believe the c e c are accepting this motion and therefore the principle that's contained UNK
in view of this and after many years of being in the movement and being active in the movement i know when to UNK when i'm winning so i move motion one six three
thank you rose
is one six three seconded
formally seconded
thanks very much indeed
colleagues i now invite er delegates from the regions who may wish to make a contribution on the special report
birmingham region first of all do you wish to put a speaker in
it would be helpful again colleagues if er potential speakers er will come down to the front
sorry are you speaking on this colleague
yes well you'd need to come oh you're going round that way
okay
er jim birmingham west er midlands er supporting er the UNK of the union because erm we were told a few months ago it was passed for nineteen ninety one
now i heard john speaking about sections a minute ago and he said we need guidelines
the reasons that we need guidelines now is we hadn't time to study them at the time and up to the present moment as far as i'm aware there's one section that's just been formed a couple of months ago
so we didn't have time to study them to see exactly where they are to see what relationship between congress the c e c and the sections
now up to now we've met it's probably a step forward but it will need careful monitoring because there is utter confusion as far as i'm concerned with i don't know whether apex is a sister union with us or a section and i don't think apex know the difference themselves
the other problem we've got and i will call it a problem is the relationship to beat with the sections and elections to regional councils in the union where there's not enough people or just barely enough people to stand for a section and they're automatically elected
now that can create problems between one person who's elected and a person who is not elected
now that would need looking at otherwise birmingham and west midlands er accept the UNK
thanks very much indeed lancashire region
john lancashire region
president congress
my experience of the new sections are working doesn't fill me with any enthusiasm
i accept that they are a new concept and they may be an improvement in time
nevertheless i am concerned in three areas
the first and the most important is accountability of this congress
all the national officers are held to account they have to give a report of their activities and delegates can challenge them
motions can be put forward and ones carried become the mandate for those officers
the section conferences are a merely advisory body
motions debated even if they are carried do not become a mandate
the officers just take their advice this is not accountability
if a motion about a particular industry cannot be placed on the agenda that of our congress then we lose the accountability
it is essential that this right is not lost
the second is the expense
as the number of sections grow another one is planned with the then the cost of having these section conferences will i believe become UNK
we've had the debate over whether or not we want our annual conference and that argument was won
despite the cost we voted for our annual conference and i have a feeling the argument will be back again some time in the future based on the fact of having sectional conferences and an annual congress the cost is too high
the general secretary and the c e c have to be quite clear the cost will have to met by other means than altering our annual congress
the third is the condition imposed on who can attend as a full voting delegate
the present rule denies any delegate who's been out of the industry for eighteen months is UNK
what right has anybody other than the members in that section deciding for themselves who represents them
we may have members who been unemployed longer than eighteen months
what right has the c e c to say they can't
if the members of a section want to vote for a full time branch secretary there was a member of that section who's been a full time branch secretary for longer than eighteen months what right has anyone got to say they can't
it's disgraceful
the next thing is that when the vote comes to the general secretary for the union anyone who's been out of the particular industry for longer than eighteen months won't be able to vote
we wouldn't accept that and why should we accept this for this section
if the general secretary and the c e c are prepared to take the UNK concerns into account and adjust or alter the way the new sections are organized then we will support
if he can't give that assurance in his summing up then we will be opposing
thank you
thank you john UNK region
chair conference
sheila UNK region
as john has already told you i'm sure you will all remember the debate last year the wider democracy and i s i'm sure you remember you UNK it
well colleagues i hope that the guidelines for section document this year is supported
colleagues this document is surely the way forward for a progressive union which represents so many members spread over all aspects of industry
and in the scope and authority section of the document it gives the right for section conferences to have the authority to discuss and decide strategic issues affecting their industries
surely this must be the way forward for the g m b and a much UNK and democratic way for our grass root members who after all are the UNK of this industry it's their we discuss at our section conferences it's their wages it's their terms
they have a right they have an import
the UNK region supports the document
yorkshire region
ron yorkshire north derbyshire region speaking in support of the special report on sections and industrial conferences
president congress
yorkshire and UNK north derbyshire region UNK this report which will UNK the structures of all the sections of the union
it will also ensure that decisions which affect our members are made by the activists employed by within the appropriate sections and industries
this will lead to greater accountability which i am sure will be welcomed by congress
sections are the best way forward for the union
following the UNK the establishment of the public services section i was lucky enough to be a delegate at the conference held in april
at that conference the number of delegates allowed for more lay activists to be involved
we achieved a better profile and there was more positive debate about recruitment and retention
all delegates were in attendance at all times throughout the conference
structures that increase participation encourage debate and UNK representation and gives responsibility to activists to develop policies that affect the future of their industries will strengthen the sections of the union
yorkshire north derbyshire region commend the report to congress
northern region
president congress
peter northern region supporting the special report
congress last year the northern region voted against the special report UNK wider democracy which is very similar to this report
similar colleagues but not the same
the wider democracy as we all remember had one important difference
it called for an end to our tradition of holding an annual conference
well congress on two separate occasions the northern region informed the c e c that without the attack on an annual conference we will be pleased to support UNK
well colleagues eventually two years on finally the c e c has listened
they have removed the attack on our conference and at last we can now get on together to build a better union
congress on that basis the northern region supports the report
conference i move
southern region
UNK southern region speaking in support of the special reports
president congress
there is a need for consistent approach in regard to sectional conferences
to avoid to sectional conferences to avoid the current confusion as a result of the changes within the union
the UNK provides the opportunity for conferences to deal with the industrial and political issues in a more rational way
regional and national conferences will deal with industrial based issues leaving the sectional conferences to decide
this structure will also show that our members' contributions are spent in an UNK and efficient manner
this UNK will give the sections credibility and UNK the g m b as an amalgamation friendly union
southern region supports the report and UNK congress to do likewise
support
thank you very much UNK
scotland
g m b scotland no scotland g m b scotland
i need it this time
conference chair
mary g m b scotland
congress scotland supports the report for industrial conferences
it's the way forward to attract and meet the needs of other unions and possible UNK and UNK
i am speaking from my own personal situation
we came to the g m b from the workers
many in our branch recognize the need for the strength the UNK the experience the equal rights health and safety training opportunities within a large union but they were also very worried about losing our own identity
within a union as large as UNK as it is the sectional conference has in our case helped UNK many of these fears and concerns and our own clothing and textile industry is still as active as ever
i support
midland region i say you aye
you're not from the midland region
transfer you if you want
er steve midlands and east coast
er colleagues congress ninety two defeated the special report on wider democracy as is mentioned in this report and as john has previously mentioned
er and it was plainly obvious why
but as with most documents that come as packages er we either have to accept the good with the bad or say no and UNK enough
now last year in UNK wider democracy we did leave ourselves er in UNK somewhat with regard to the sectional industrial conferences
er i'm personally glad to see the appearance of this document so that we can clarify the situation with regards to these conferences
the recently formed energy and utility section held its conferences regional and national earlier this year and from the report backs i received er they were a great success
the conferences were held actually shall we say according to these guidelines that you have before you erm and it was felt that the remit of these conferences has already and will in the future erm increase democracy accountability and the efficiency in decision making processes in our union
the midland and east coast are supporting the document based on our UNK successful experience of our sectional conferences and the need for these guidelines to be adopted along with the rule amendment so as to enable future sectional conferences and delegate conferences to know exactly where they stand
now we did have a very heated discussion and concern was expressed regarding the rules governing UNK section and conferences for delegates which UNK those who have not worked in the industry or craft or trade for eighteen months prior to their nomination
now we could be denying a lot of very experienced noble colleagues the opportunity to contribute to debates quite probably through no fault of their own as we all realize
but it was felt though that it was necessary to support the document in order to clear up a rather unsatisfactory situation er where we're holding sectional and delegate conferences that don't have UNK and guidelines er which can clarify their position
i've been asked to ask er a question also on appendix three procedures for regional delegate conferences where it states that copies of the reports of regional delegate conferences shall be UNK to the regional secretary
erm the appropriate national industrial officers branch secretaries and the main workplaces in the industry
we would ask because it's not actually clear erm what that means that the report from regional delegate conferences could be UNK to all the g m b representatives at the main workplaces so as to keep all our members fully informed of the proceedings er say again the er midland and east coast are supporting the document
thanks very much colleagues
well i lasted
right london region
speaking on a proposed section conferences guidelines and of course rule a five
president congress
i'll speak on behalf of the london region against the sectional conferences report and also of course rule a five
and our main concern is that it is UNK the unemployed in some cases it will also UNK the sick and the disabled
hang on where am i
that no member of the union should be prevented from holding office or be active in any part of this union simply because they are unemployed sick or disabled
but most of all it's an attack
but most of it's an attack by our own union against what has been in the past the most active members of this union
it's important that when a member is made redundant that he keep in contact with his industry so that he's in a position to be able to regain employment and also regain employment for his for his or her fellow unemployed
and what a better place to achieve this industrial conferences in our own union
come on john think again
and what is long term unemployment in this day and age
i can assure you it's nearer to five years than eighteen months
the eighteen months out of trade rule made some sense when this great nation of ours had something UNK full time employment
and that was twenty five to thirty five forty years ago
but today with highest unemployment levels for many years it's not the highest ever in some of our own regions it's a lot of nonsense
john all this will do is make is make re is make it hang on i lost it
hang on john all this will do is make at least a quarter of our own members in this union to be UNK in their own industries
i say it's a vicious attack that's been set upon them by this vicious tory government over the last fourteen years is not enough
john two years ago we invited you to and introduced you to the chamber of commons among other places as a modern trade union leader
but this UNK against some members of this union is not an act it's not an act of a modern trade union leader
it is an act of UNK
congress both i and the london region urge you to oppose this new rule a five and all the UNK as well
we know that in this day and age it's UNK
congress please careful on how you vote
mould this lot of nonsense down because me as a UNK had to live forty four years and there ain't enough people are still working to be able to run the sections
thank you
liverpool region
ian liverpool north wales and irish region
our UNK got a free vote on this document so in that sense i'm not necessarily expressing the views of the region
UNK have to come to their own conclusions
in relation to the special document whilst i support the document er as far as it goes with one exception and that's in relation to the unemployed members but whilst i support it as far as it goes i don't believe it goes far enough
i don't believed it has addressed a number of issues
it does not address the question of the establishments of regional committees of sections
it does not address the question of establishing regional conferences within the section in order that delegates can be elected to the national conferences
and also it doesn't address the problems of the UNK which exist between the various sections
i am a member of the largest section of this union that's the public services section yet we are only entitled to a hundred and fifty delegates when we have two hundred and twenty thousand members nationally
those UNK need to be addressed with the er establishment of another section when UNK with our trade union
no doubt they will have their own terms
one of the ideas of the c e c setting out guidelines is in order to bring some consistency to proceedings
well we've not got consistency when you've got different rules for apex different rules for cat different rules for different rules for the public services
i think the c e c need to carefully think out er the way they wanna go forward
last year the document was defeated
i think the reason for the defeat was mainly due to the UNK conference issue
the c e c have had twelve months the sections have been up and running they should have learnt from the experiences over the last twelve months because all that they've done is presented us with the same document with the exclusion of the one issue of the two year conference
the final point i wanna make we in liverpool more than anywhere else understand the consequences of unemployment
but we also understand the consequences of political unemployment
we've seen activists sacked we've seen activists been unable to get a job
they go on a list and they cannot get work simply because they've been activists
let not our union discriminate against the activists like the bosses do
colleagues i call upon the general secretary to respond to the debate
well colleagues john er general secretary speaking on behalf of the c e c
first of all the section guidelines
there was i'm glad to er note widespread support for the section guidelines as one colleague says we were left in something of a UNK and we've gotta fill that gap
taking some of the questions that were raised i think we can deal with them quite easily
it's certainly the case that we need more publicity for the sectional structure and you have a UNK which is being circulated which starts the process of UNK the structure of the union how the regional and industrial structure works together
accountability was raised by john
well the national secretary's national officers are of course accountable to the c e c they are accountable to congress the introduction of section conferences means that they have another an additional level of accountability which doesn't replace the accountability to the c e c or to congress but UNK it and subjects them of course to a closer scrutiny and a closer contact with the major activists in a whole sector of employment
that seems to me to be a major step forward and a number of delegates accepted that
the cost there is no doubt the section conferences will cost money
that was a point made very strongly last year
the intention however as is clear from the document is to cut back on the number of industrial conferences as that work is being UNK up by the section conferences and as robert in seconding the report made perfectly clear industrial conferences now called delegate conferences will only be held if there is a negotiating body for which the delegate conference has to frame policy or in a number of other very limited situations
the role of the whole time branch secretary was raised and we what we've done here is to continue the practice that operated in respect of national industrial conferences and it says on page four as is currently the case for national industrial conferences full time officials and branch secretaries not working in the industry may attend by arrangement between the region and the section secretary with the right to speak but not to vote
we've just rolled over exactly the same rule exactly the same provision
er ian made the point about some UNK and there is some UNK between the section conferences
this is an attempt to bring a greater level of UNK than we have achieved so far but we are bound by agreements made at the time of amalgamation and we cannot undermine or UNK those particular decisions and that's why in a few cases particularly in relation to the size of conference there is some slight UNK
that's not something we can address immediately while the ink on the amalgamation document is still wet
regional delegate conferences
well we're going to try to provide the first steps towards UNK
we may have to follow up with other arrangements in the future
but we need to fill the gap and by the way colleagues i think it is appropriate just to end this particular section of my reply with the comment that at the public services section conference from our count forty percent of the delegates there had never been to a g m b conference before
the argument about the establishment of sections was about industrial identity and it was also about widening the democracy within the organization bringing in more activists giving them a say in their own conditions of service and in the strategic issues affecting their industry
forty percent additional delegates brought into the decision making structure seems to me to be a fine tribute to the establishment of the sectional structure
motion one o colleagues we have asked you to oppose
this is the motion that says that the apex conference would be able to debate issues of a general nature which are appropriate for this congress the decision making body of the union and for no other conference in the union
there's no point in trying to UNK this you can only have one governing body and this is it
if you try and UNK it and set up three or four say they can all discuss the same thing you are building in the ability for major conflicts
if people want to discuss matters of general concern they must get themselves elected to this congress
if they want to establish questions of industrial concern they should get themselves elected to the section conferences
i know there's some UNK in the apex conference about the way things went in the past i give this small amount of advice
the apex conference must come to terms with the nature of that amalgamation and that said that the apex conference would concern itself with matters of interest to white collar workers
matters of general interest have always been reserved here
we can't compromise on that principle we have to ask you to oppose motion one o
and now we come to the difficult issue of the amendment to a five one a
many of the points that were made in fact i think all of them were made in the discussion within the c e c
is it unfair to ex er isn't it unfair to exclude unemployed members from any part of the union structure isn't this a kick in the teeth isn't this a way of UNK the position of unemployed workers
all of those points were made
on the other just wait a moment and we'll come to the other side of the argument because the argument is carefully and UNK balanced
the other side of the argument is this
from time to time national committees will have to take hard decisions about the strategy for that particular sector that's what they're there for
and from time to time because they will take those hard decisions those decisions may not be popular
and they will then be asked to demonstrate their credibility
and if and this is not a theoretical point it's happened in another union if the majority or a large number of people in that sector on that committee are not working or have not recently worked in the sector then UNK will begin to arise concerning those members who are working at the moment and say hey hold on a minute perhaps people working in the industry should make these hard decisions
the question doesn't apply in respect of the conferences
we've said people can go to the conferences with the right to speak not the right to vote because that principle applies but the right to speak
they can go there as they did with the industrial conferences but we have to make this careful balance between parts of our membership
we're not making the thin end of the wedge we're going to support the motion from london region
the general statement of commitment for unemployed workers the unemployed people the general statement of commitment to ensure that they are not excluded from parts of the union
but this is the industrial decision making body of the union
that's what the section committee is there for and the c e c after balancing these arguments decided that with all of the limitations with all of the stretching of points and so on that basis we should come down and recommend to you that only people who work in the section should be eligible for election
that's my reply to the debate on that point and colleagues thank you
i move one a reply to the debate on the other issues
right colleagues i propose to take the vote now

that's lost
it's going to be terribly UNK this for the c e c colleagues
don't make a habit of it please

colleagues i now call mick to deliver his report on public services section
that will be followed by er a very lengthy debate on the public services
mick colleagues
mick just before you start
colleagues i know that people are starting to move out and i'm sure that it's got nothing to do with UNK appearance at the rostrum but colleagues seriously for the last couple of days we've had a great deal of disciplines so please try and be as quiet as possible
mick
i wouldn't bank on it
thank you president
congress mick national office
it's now fifteen months since the tories were elected for a fourth term and what've we seen since that election
more of the same
more attacks on public services more attacks on workers rights more privatization
attacks affecting the old the sick the young the homeless
those members of our society most needing and most UNK of our quality public services
in local government alone between now and april nineteen ninety four it's been estimated that anything between thirty three thousand and a hundred thousand jobs will be lost
our own jointly commissioned with the t g ke community showed a loss of seventy thousand jobs and a deficit of seventy one million pounds
since nineteen eighty eight again local government alone has shed over five percent of its workforce
the new round of compulsory the reorganization of local government will threaten many more jobs
many of those jobs will be white collar workers
the figures for the health service are no different
our union congress cannot stand back and witness thousands of public servants many of them our members become yet another statistic in the unemployment figures
as a union we need to build a broad UNK with the providers and the users of public services and if necessary with the employers
we have got to protect not only our members' rights but our public services and from this conference today we've got to make it quite clear to central government that we demand investment in our public services
we demand investment in the infrastructure
we must demand investment in training in education in order that we can provide those quality services
at a time when across europe governments have been UNK power downwards in britain we now have a system of central control UNK outside of the former soviet union
but we should not be surprised by the UNK attack on public services
we all know their attitude public is bad private is good
as long ago as nineteen eighty six the treasury stated in a supposed confidential document and i quote most of the savings from contracting out are because contractors can offer poorer conditions of employment contractors can eliminate costly bonus schemes overtime pay and provide little if any sick pay and also avoid national insurance contributions by means of part time work
all of those that we have fought to build up through national and local bargaining over many years
and we've got an example here today colleagues of the tory UNK on public services
within the UNK we've got representatives from UNK at crawley representatives of twenty three of our colleagues who have been on strike for twenty weeks in defence of jobs in defence of pay and equally important in defence of safety standards
and i applaud our colleagues from crawley
we've gotta expand upon the magnificent work that the southern region and our colleagues have done and if necessary we've gotta take our campaign against UNK to national level
our ongoing successes with and the acquired rights directive will eventually put a halt to the attacks on public workers' rights
however colleagues let's be quite clear that is not the end of competitive tendering
it is not the UNK to all our UNK and also we've gotta make it quite clear to the labour party that they cannot use and the acquired rights directive to include UNK in competitive tendering
competition yes UNK no
but the attacks upon services is not the full story
in addition to the attacks on jobs public sector workers many of them who are poorly paid part time many of them women workers now face an effective cut as the government attempts to restrict pay increases this year to less than one point five percent
even by the tories own this pay policy will remove some one point five billion pounds from the pay packets of over eight point six million public sector workers
i would suggest to this conference and more importantly to this government that is no way to lift this country out of the recession and it's no way for us to run an economy
and now we hear UNK that UNK is now actually talking about extending that pay restraint into nineteen ninety four
the message from our congress must be quite clear
you're not on we will not be made the UNK with public sector workers will not pay for the UNK of the economy
i've spoken about jobs i've spoken about services i've spoken about pay
but the other evil part of the government's attack on public services is that it is an attack upon democracy
in the past the electorate had their say by holding accountable either centrally elected or locally elected officials
we had UNK elected representatives on our health authorities on our schools and on our planning authorities
that's not the case now colleagues
government UNK over forty thousand a lot of them tory UNK or supporters of the tory party now UNK which control many of our public services
our commitment to quality public services they're efficiently run publicly accountable and operated without UNK workers must be and will be our main goal
quality public services provided by public sector workers funded by public money responsible and responsive to the public
our union with its long and its proud history in the public sector does not seek UNK
we seek cooperation
but the message must be quite clear
we will fight to protect our members our services and our democracy
i commend my report
colleagues we are gonna deal with that section of UNK report that deals with the public services and that UNK on page thirty four thirty five yes
er east london region
where is it oh yeah
it sounded good mick i mean it's your first year and i wasn't gonna come up here but i thought i might as well start as i mean to go on
when i read your page i felt like i was listening to a party political UNK of the labour party
you know telling us everything about the tories what they've done wrong and to go on from that not telling us anything about how you're gonna put it right
well you know donald came up here year after year and took a real tongue UNK and you didn't really put anything down there that could be criticized this year but you said we're gonna fight
are we gonna fight how we gonna fight because the local authority people are fed up with doing all the giving
local UNK like me take a lot of stick and i'm just gonna pass that stick straight on to you because my members tell me all the time i pay one thirty five a week well so do i
so i want a service and i want the service from you
and i'm looking for you to satisfy me because i haven't found a man to do it yet
er thirty five
follow that
er liz midlands and east coast region
mick you your report rightly identifies community care as a services our members' job security and working conditions
i will be grateful for any information you may have on private home care cooperative
with the systems from the local authority and the cooperative development agency a pilot scheme has been set up in my area
is this peculiar to leicestershire or is it the shape of things to come because my members are concerned
they really believe and i also believe that this is a back door entry to privatization
thirty six thirty seven thirty eight
yes
dave london region
erm under compulsory competitive tendering mick
i'd like to know why it's taken so long for this union to work again er with the regulations in public services
at a recent training course that i've been on apparently public services could have been protected since nineteen eighty one
why is it only recently that we have started taking cases up
it's all very well earning compensation for our members but what we want in public services is our jobs not compensation
to UNK one branch london region
mick what i'd like to know is and this links in with our other discussions this morning and also something that mary er mentioned yesterday
jack wrote an article in UNK saying that c t was a good thing in some respects
now i know that many people out there are absolutely UNK by this
now i'd like to know mick does jack talk to you does he talk to your UNK in the t g
if s if he doesn't why not and would you please tell us what UNK him to come out with such a remarkable statement and i think this goes to the what we're talking about this morning
people like jack are supposed to represent us in parliament and he comes out with nonsense like that
thirty nine yes duncan
duncan lancashire region
i wanted to base some comments about the UNK er section of the report because er i think it's
what i want to do today
i got some pens today which is great
ah that's wonderful ah of course they don't work
ah that's just okay got one that works
i meant to bring my own but i forgot and somebody's used the wrong kind of pen on here so you can't rub that off
that was probably in UNK
thank you
erm i have a pause UNK you know in comedy shows they UNK well i have a pause UNK
makes me think the things i'm saying are very clever
okay
erm right what i want to do this week is to go on to the next er work of freud's that follows after erm group psychology or rather to the next two because i'm gonna back these two books together for hi there erm gonna back these two books together because as we'll see they really deal with the same subject
or at least they start both books really start with the same issue and the issue in question is in many ways well you could argue that it was in many ways fundamental to the social sciences
and the issue is question is what is often called a problem of social order
the problem of order
what this means is it's the question of how is society possible
why do people cooperate
why isn't there total chaos why doesn't everybody pursue their own self interest at the expense of everybody else reducing life to a state of UNK erm er conflict of individuals against each other
this is what is normally called the problem of social order and of course it's been around in philosophy and social sciences really since the beginning and er some of the greatest and earliest works of er social philosophy like UNK republic are really in part about this er question
how do you how do you er create er social order
it often leads on to more UNK ideas about what would the ideal society be like
but erm at the initial stage the problem of order really goes no further than asking a factual question
how is society possible
how in existing societies does order emerge because clearly it does
now as i said there'd been various answers er to this throughout history one of the most interesting and significant as far as we're concerned in studying freud and the social sciences was er that of the english UNK thomas UNK
thomas UNK whose dates are fifteen eighty eight to sixteen seventy nine can you read that
thomas UNK was an english UNK who er wrote a famous book called UNK in which he explored this er fundamental question of social order
UNK conceived of what he called a state of nature
this was in fact the state in which he thought er animals er existed and it was the condition to which he believed humans beings would be reduced were it not for the mechanisms that maintain social order
the state of nature ac according to the most UNK phrase in the book er made life nasty UNK and short
because in UNK view the state of nature was one of UNK in which every individual fought against every other individual in to quote another well known phrase from the book a war of all against all
UNK chaos
so this was UNK view of the state of nature
of course society isn't like that
or at least not all the time
it may at times become UNK and UNK but that that's not the normal state of affairs and UNK analysis of social order leads him to conclude that social order only becomes possible when individuals give up some of their freedom to UNK authority
in which in UNK view should be a UNK but in principle be any UNK erm UNK of er of force
and by doing this by giving up their or at least part of their individual freedom everybody benefits because law and order can be imposed by the er UNK authority what whatever it may be
nowadays one of the explicit UNK which er real kind of hobbesian view is er debate about gun law for example
the there's a widespread idea that if you let people have guns the result will be more crimes of violence and more UNK and therefore people conclude er at least they do in this country that only the state should have a UNK of firearms so only the police and the army should be allowed to have firearms
this allegedly erm UNK the protects the citizen and the logic of this argument is really the hobbesian argument that if you let ordinary individuals have firearms they'll go round killing each other or so it is alleged
i don't believe it for one minute personally but this is the this is the theory and i'll explain why i don't believe it later
the importance of this is that freud is often said to have been a hobbesian UNK in the sense that er without necessarily being directly influenced by UNK he took a similar a similar kind of view or at least so it is said
you could say that er a hobbesian view of human nature that people are basically anti social UNK and er aggressive and that if left to themselves life would be a war against all is what we might call a pessimistic view of human nature
pessimistic in the sense that is says people are basically nasty and if society is to be possible then UNK has to be controlled in some way or other and since human nature is anti social order comes about against the grain of human nature as a rule has to be imposed on human nature
this is why i call it a pessimistic theory
you'll see why in a minute
and i think you can see why i call it pessimistic because basically it says in the UNK prayer book there is no good in us what's in us is bad in the sense of anti social UNK and if people are going to cooperate and if there's gonna be social order then as it were it has to be imposed on them
the good has to be imposed from outside it's not it's not in human nature
so this is what i call a pessimistic er view of human nature this hobbesian one
well the first book in which freud explicitly takes up this question in the opening pages is his book of nineteen twenty seven er the future of an illusion and his begins by UNK the hobbesian question although it doesn't mention UNK but it's the fundamental point he makes that civilization goes against the grain of human nature and the question he asks himself is how does er order morality
civilization come about and in this book he gives part of the answer and UNK on that and part of the answer he gives is that it comes about through the institutions of religion
religion acts as a UNK force on human nature and er raises people as it were to a higher to a higher level by for example giving them more UNK like the ten UNK
so i think it's easy to see that religion UNK this UNK socially controlling role but of course this has been a popular theme in UNK writing in the course of the twentieth century indeed you could go so far as to say this it is has become a UNK in twentieth century social science
it wasn't quite so much a UNK in nineteen twenty seven but erm nevertheless this is the starting point of freud's er freud's analysis
freud UNK that religion does indeed have this UNK role
well having agreed with that freud then faces a problem because the problem he faces is that in the previous book of his that we looked at er that he had published erm what fourteen or so years earlier totem and taboo where he had talked about the origin of religion
he had given a picture of religion which represented it as primarily concerned with guilt with UNK against incest and as er representing the origins of civilization in UNK societies like those of the australian UNK and freud erm remarks in the opening pages of civilization and UNK that totem and taboo was never meant to be a complete theory of religion
he says all i was doing in totem and taboo was trying to explain UNK a very specific form of religion
i wasn't trying to advance a theory about religion in general says freud but now i am and in future of an illusion he turns to the question of religion in general not just er UNK religion as in totem and taboo but religion in general
so the question he goes on to is given its UNK role how did what er explanation can we give for religion in general
and his answer to that is that psychoanalysis can give us a very interesting and unique insight into religion and this was an insight which had emerged in the course of the nineteen twenties following the developments of psychoanalysis that occurred after the first world war which we've already looked at and is essentially the concept of transference
i don't think freud ever uses the word transference in the book i may be wrong but er it may be mentioned i'm pretty sure it isn't it certainly isn't in any UNK
you recall that transference is a concept that freud introduced into psychoanalysis to explain the way in which the patient in an analysis tended to cast the UNK in different roles of different people usually from their past and usually from their childhood so the UNK would play the role of father mother brother sister or whatever by turns very often in the typical analysis
and i think you can see that the word transference here is in the sense that transference erm UNK to transferring something from one place to another as if the feeling which were originally experienced for example in the family were being transferred to the to the UNK situation to the to the analysis
so this is how freud originally discovered transference as an observation made in the course of analysis and as we saw erm a couple of weeks ago whenever it was i was talking about group psychology transference was a fundamental concept in freud's theory of groups
because basically what freud was saying was the group we create semi unconscious the family
the leader creates the parental role the followers play the role of the children and er as i pointed out in the in the lecture when i talked about that often this is erm explicitly indicated by UNK terms in groups such as UNK erm whi which gives you the word UNK
erm er class brothers sisters in a struggle these kinds of phrases er refer to this
well what freud does in this book is to effectively say religion is a transference phenomenon
he explains the appeal of religion in general to people by saying religion is a transference
what happens in religion is that the UNK or UNK play the UNK role and the UNK and the er people here below as it were play the role of the of the child
and this makes sense to freud because he believes that people believe in religion because of the UNK it gives them
for example if you believe in religion you believe that the world and life has some kind of order and meaning
if you don't believe in religion you might think that er the world was just kind of here for no particular reason and er that human existence was just a kind of accident or something happen happened and er has no has no greater significance
but if you're UNK inclined then clearly the universe looks a bit different because the universe has a UNK and having a UNK gives it some kind of meaning
it implies for example it was created for some kind of purpose
so freud says religion UNK gives people a sense of meaning
it explains the UNK
where do we come you know it's it answers the life the universe and everything questions you know
why are we here
you know where do we come from
the kind of thing you ask yourself when you've got a bad UNK
you know wake up on a monday morning with a bad UNK and you think oh my god you know what is life about is it really worth going on
er this is the kind of life universe and everything question
however religion can do a lot more than that
for example many religions er give people reassurance in the sense that for example not only do they say there is a god or gods or whatever there may be but these er UNK play a UNK role
they provide for people
many religions certainly UNK christianity in the religions of that tradition which of course includes UNK and UNK are some of the UNK most important religions
er these religions certainly and many others for that matter too UNK the UNK as UNK as providing the world for human beings and as being concerned with human welfare
well this is very UNK says freud
it's nice to think you know there's someone up there sitting in the cloud watching over us and providing as it were
this is er this is a great reassurance
again the UNK in many religions is regarded as er UNK morality and justice if not in the here below then very often in the UNK
so many religions such as the religion of ancient egypt for instance whi which made a great UNK of this has a belief in a judgment after death followed by eternal UNK er heaven effectively for the just and er UNK effectively for the UNK and some religions like UNK stick in an intermediate state UNK where you can work off a sentence as it were for a few for a few thousand years
kind of a UNK system
and if you work off your sentence of UNK you get UNK to heaven at the end of it which is very nice
erm but you see the point i am making the idea is that er religion appeals to people because they see the in UNK of the world erm you know if er injustice is an is an inevitable erm experience erm some of us erm might be inclined to think especially if you live under the british system of er criminal justice and so if you can't get justice here perhaps you can after death because god is ultimately just and no mistakes will be made in heaven as it were
er there er the er sinners will be published erm the sinners will be published er sorry that's a that's a good point see if i can remember that
sinners will be published er punished the sinners will be punished and er the just will be erm just wi will er will er will be UNK
so that's another great UNK thought the great UNK
particularly if you have a sense of injustice in life
again religion appeals to people erm merely in the idea of an UNK
after all er the idea of death being the end of everything isn't particularly UNK to people but er the idea of an UNK is very much more appealing because it means death isn't the end it's just a kind of transition from one state to another and it's nice to think that er there could be an UNK particularly if you can look forward to it erm in a in a better place than here
so in all these kinds of different ways religion provides UNK erm UNK and er is the fulfilment of people's wishes particularly th their UNK their erm feelings of er being the victims as it were of the world can be satisfied to some extent by religious belief which holds out some prospect of and hope at least in the UNK if not if not in this life
so said freud it's no wonder that people believe in religion because religion can provide you with a lot with a lot of UNK but the fundamental psychological explanation for this says freud is that these feelings that religion UNK in adult life are UNK of feelings that we all had in UNK
in other words these things i've been talking about map if i may use that concept again from UNK they map to earlier feelings
feelings in early childhood where we were indeed UNK where the world was in fact meaningless where we were er subject as it were to erm the arbitrary erm to arbitrary fate and felt it because we were young children but in which there really was a power that looked after us
there was a power that was UNK would provide for us
we did have er judges and UNK who would judge us and reward us if we d did good and punish us if we did evil
we did live in a state where there were others knew more about the world than we did and could make sense of it for us
those were our parents
so the parents says s says freud play the role in th the reality of UNK that the UNK or UNK play in the fantasy or illusion of religion
religion creates the illusion that those parental forces which were indeed watching over us and guarding us while we were young still do so in adult life
and freud is careful here to use the word illusion
he UNK in the book between an error an illusion and a UNK
an error he says is just a factual UNK but er you know you could say er the capital of australia is vienna
well that would be an error because it's actually UNK but you could be you yo that's a mistake er that anybody could make
however erm thinking that er one day er you might marry erm a prince or princess freud says is an is an illusion in the sense that er people do sometimes marry UNK and UNK it could happen it's not very likely to happen to any particular individual who might have that wish but it could happen
erm as we know does happen
not for long actually but it does happen
erm so that's an illusion a UNK in other words an illusion is something that could happen but the difference between an illusion and an error is an error is just a cognitive mistake an illusion is a cognitive mistake that is kept going by a wish
an illusion erm UNK that there is some kind of er of wish er under underlying it
and the wish keeps the illusion going as it were
a UNK on the other hand is a is a much more serious kind of factual error in which the element of wish UNK becomes so strong that it won't UNK any evidence against it
so a UNK is something that people insist on believing erm no matter what
for example erm in erm UNK of UNK where people believe that is plotting against them and no matter what you do erm you know if you said well look we can prove to you we are not plotting against you the UNK says to you why do you want to prove this to me if it's not true you know
you can't win
not against a UNK
so freud is not saying religion is a UNK or an error he's saying it's an illusion and it's an illusion because it's a factual mistake maintained by wish fulfilment
it's a factual mistake of course because er there aren't in fact UNK looking after us in the way there were parents in childhood
our parents after all were real people
they actually existed
whereas erm UNK exist only in people's er hopes or UNK
they don't er you can't see them in the same way you could go and see your parents
and er this illusion is maintained according to freud because of the wishes that people have
these wishes go straight back to childhood and so religion represents a transference from childhood and a kind of emotional UNK in which people try and make out that they're still children as it were even though they even though they really aren't
and then of course the other characteristics that go with religion and that he had UNK in other books on totem and taboo like guilt the feeling that you ought to obey the moral commands of the parents because after all the parents weren't just UNK who looked after you and UNK you and UNK you but they were your judges and UNK as well
they punished you when you did the wrong thing and they UNK you when they did when you did the right thing
so the believing in religion with moral codes particularly in those religions which have rather strict moral codes and demand quite a lot from the believer in terms of UNK to the er to the moral law even those religions can be explained in terms of freud's transference theory because that too comes from childhood
the thing that you have to obey if you don't obey you will be punished
that too is a transference from the childhood situation where the child is under the authority of the parent
in adult life the authority of religion UNK from this from this transference effect
now here of course and by now we've reached the closing pages of the book though it's actually quite a short book erm it doesn't take very long to read
here freud in terms of paradox because on the one hand he started out asking the problem of order
how is order possible and answered it in part by saying well religion is a UNK order creating force
in the next step of the argument he then said well religion is a transference and therefore a form of UNK so now he seems to be UNK religion but if he's UNK religion by saying it's an illusion surely he's UNK civilization because the danger as he points out in the book if you take religion away from people you say look this is just an illusion god doesn't exist
the ten UNK are just a myth it carries no more force whatsoever
might the consequence of that be that people then go out and murder and steal and rape and fight wars and do all do all these kinds anti social things
in other words if you say religion is an illusion are you UNK and destroying social order
this is a this is a paradox that freud has to face up to
and in the closing pages of the book he answers this er problem by saying well look er you don't have to base morality civilization and social order on an illusion
on the contrary freud says UNK it on an illusion is very dangerous
because you see the thing with UNK is it's okay as long as people believe
for example you know you could frighten a child into i mean this is not an analogy freud uses this is one i thought of but it's in the same spirit as his argument
you could for example frighten a child into conformity with your wishes by saying that erm you know if the child doesn't go to bed at the right time the UNK man will come and eat them up or something
you might say something like that
and i can remember being frightened of the UNK man when i was a little er child
my elder brother used to UNK me with it
erm okay the UNK man would come and eat me up
erm well as long as the child is young enough to believe in the UNK man everything is fine and that child may well go to bed on time and er and er UNK its eyes and goes straight to sleep er in fear
but what happens if the child UNK a bit and realizes that the UNK man is just er just er an UNK created to set fear in it
in the first place says freud the child won't obey any longer necessarily because now he's got nothing to fear and secondly a child might resent the lie that has been told to him
you know i was told about the UNK man but the UNK man i now know didn't exist
so freud says trying to build morality on the basis of religion is like trying to build a house on sand because the foundations won't hold
the foundations are UNK
what we need says freud is a sure foundation for social order and the only foundation that will do is reality
the trouble with religion is that transference is based on an illusion and it serves the pleasure principle ultimately because it's a tremendous wish fulfilment
wish UNK as we know and what we saw about dreams and so on so the pleasure principle that UNK in the unconscious
and as we saw the unconscious is out of contact wi with reality and so need take no account of it
however says freud ideally morality and social order should be based not on the pleasure principle but on the reality principle and he ends up with this book UNK the idea that science should replace erm religion in this respect
in other words that science should establish UNK into reality which make social order erm both possible and well founded
now in this particular book freud doesn't say very much about what these UNK er are
and er as you'll see probably next week's i'm not going to get to this now er next week or possible the week after even depending on how long it takes me to get there i will suggest to you that the revolution now taking place in UNK science does suggest wh what they are and that there are in fact some deeply UNK intuitive UNK erm into this whole issue which have only emerged in the last few years
but er this is just by way of an UNK the general conclusion comes for instance in this rather UNK book and relatively short book is that we ought to base variety and social order on science and its UNK and certainly not on religion and there he there he leaves the question
however he takes it up again at much greater length in his next book of nineteen thirty civilization and its UNK
this book erm begins once again with the hobbesian problem
the wi with the with the question of social order
only in this book it comes out even more clearly
civilization says freud is based on the UNK repression and UNK and frustration of the id
people's individual er drives especially their sexual and aggressive drives which are deeply UNK by having to live erm in a UNK er society
so er in so far as human nature can be UNK with the id it seems to me perfectly correct to say that UNK erm UNK i was going to say freud was a hobbesian UNK
UNK was a freudian UNK no
freud was a hobbesian UNK erm in the sense that the id certainly was UNK anti social and everything that thomas UNK said about human nature er could apply to the id that's perfectly true and most people see this and it's er it it's a UNK particularly in the social science writing on freud
and a lot of the book is concerned with developing this theme and that i thought came out quite well in the classes so i won't bother to repeat all that because i thought we did that fairly thoroughly in the class
i don't want to waste your time
what people don't notice however and is so important is that the id is not the only institution of a personality
as we saw there is a second area of a personality which psychoanalysis during the nineteen twenties and thirties was exploring actively and this is the ego
if we now look at the ego as opposed to the id then immediately we see that it is it is UNK not true to claim that freud was a hobbesian social UNK
because the ego was not anti social but pro social and we've already seen er two ways in which that is true
when we looked at group psychology and analysis of the ego we saw that it was processes that occur in the ego such as identification and projection that make social groups possible that bring about the social order of psychological groups
so that makes the ego pro social and in future of an illusion we saw freud arguing that there were fundamental pro social currents of feeling in the ego in terms of the UNK wish fulfilment for example a UNK god a divine justice and things like this
these are wishes of the ego and they're UNK in the illusion of religion but as we've also seen freud erm notices even though he doesn't comment that the illusion of religion is pro social in the sense that it UNK social order systems and morality and so on
so it seems to me that those UNK and there've been a lot of them who have taken the view that freud like some other social UNK like any of their kind for example was a was simply a hobbesian UNK hadn't really read their freud or at least they hadn't read their freud after about world war one
you could certainly take that view of freud and it would have been true perhaps if freud had died er before er nineteen eighteen shall we say or in fourteen
then i think people would be justified in saying well freud was essentially a hobbesian social UNK
that was the time when freud was exploring just the id
after world war one as we've been seeing he was exploring the ego and his writing about the ego in particular group psychology and future of an illusion show quite clearly that he saw the ego as a pro social fact in the personality
something that UNK the individual towards identifying with other people performing groups to accepting UNK and values for these super ego which UNK during this time and so on
so i think the statement freud was a hobbesian social UNK is just wrong
it's UNK wrong or at least it's UNK wrong if you were taking note of freud's writings after world war one
if you look at all freud's writings i think what you have to say is if you want to say that you must make the qualification that the id is a hobbesian erm thing as it were but the ego is a pro social erm part of the personality
now here it's useful to contrast the hobbesian approach which i call the pessimistic view of human nature with one that i would call optimistic
now the optimistic view of nature is the exact opposite
a good example of this if we wanted to er have somebody as it were to UNK er the english UNK would be the french UNK jean UNK writing a little bit later not much actually seventeen twelve to seventeen seventy eight erm about a century later
jean UNK famous french UNK whose view of human nature was what i would call optimistic in the sense that by contrast to thomas UNK john UNK believed that human beings were basically good
he believed that human beings were born UNK cooperative UNK nice UNK and that if in later life they showed anti social selfish criminal erm UNK it was because of what happened to them after they were born
it was because of the effects of other people and society on them that they were UNK as it were
i once met a social worker this was years ago i was gonna say this couldn't happen today but it probably could erm one hopes it couldn't happen today but it probably would happen today too
a social worker who said to me inside every what she say so inside er every juvenile UNK there's a little UNK da UNK trying to get out
well if you believe that i think you'll believe anything
but erm that's the idea you see that these kids er well you know they may be UNK and do lots of nasty things but it's only the way they've been treated by society
basically human nature is good
this was this is what i call an optimistic view and this was UNK view of human nature that basically people were good and er cooperative and it was the bad things in human nature that had to be explained not the good
the good was natural
but the bad things and of course UNK solution to the problem of order was quite different from UNK
UNK solution was order must be imposed on a UNK human nature to make society possible UNK theory was if only people could be liberated from the things that makes them selfish and anti social they would come together in a natural social contract where individuals would UNK give up their freedom in order to gain the benefits of social cooperation and UNK view was if only people were fully rational and could free themselves from the unfortunate effects of er civilization they would enter into a state of erm perfect society in which they could er associate er without the necessity of things like the state or whatever
very optimistic view of human nature
later erm this was developed by people like marx who UNK the UNK economic role erm the e economic aspect of erm of er the ill effects of civilization
but basically the idea erm is i think well represented by er by UNK and it's a view that has been very influential for instance in modern education and some people would say it explains the disaster that erm th that some people think er modern education is
now the these two views of human nature the pessimistic as i'm calling it and the optimistic lead to two different views of the child as i've already implied
the UNK view of the child is one where children are basically er noble UNK
are born free but everywhere in the chain as to quote a famous phrase from UNK the kind of noble savage view of the child
this regards the child as not in need of socialization or control but basically er good in its own right
in the best example in modern education is that er progressive school what's the school summer hill or the school where the kids are allowed to do absolutely everything they like
erm very UNK
erm er if you if you know anything about the kind of thing that actually goes on er it's nothing like the it's supposed to be
but that was the that was the theory that it was founded on
that you know if you give children complete freedom they will they will know as it were wh what's best for them you don't need any rules or anything
or at least er not any rules they don't impose on themselves
so that's the that's the there's an optimistic view of the child
the UNK the hobbesian UNK have a pessimistic view of the child
they see the child as basically a little animal a wild animal who has to be UNK and er UNK and controlled by er various means and er this is the i think the view of the child that was more popular in british education at least traditional education which erm for the public schools of UNK which in this country was based on er on er UNK i think there's the only word you can call it
certainly i'd never erm forgiven er people for UNK i got at school
i mean there's UNK and deserved to be called nothing else
but anyway the idea that the UNK is er justified and you have to beat the hell out of little kids because er if you don't you won't UNK them
this goes i think you can see with the pessimistic view the hobbesian view that for civilization order has to be has to be imposed
well where does freud stand in all this
you seems to me that if you think about it the freudian view is what i would like to call a realistic one
because just as i was saying that freud's view was that okay there's the id and that may be hobbesian but there's also the ego which if you like is more kind of UNK it's pro social and therefore i would say freud is not a pessimistic or an optimistic social UNK but something in between
what i would call a realistic social UNK namely somebody who saw there is good and bad in human nature
freud didn't go to one extreme or the other he didn't go to the UNK extreme and say there is no good in us you know we're just anti social UNK although he did know that was true of the id
nor did he go to the UNK extreme saying that we're basically noble UNK
but he did recognize that there was strong pro social currents in the in the ego and the resulting view i think is what i would call a realistic view of human nature
which i think any sensible person ought to come to which is that human beings are neither basically bad evil and anti social no more are they basically good UNK and cooperative
they're a mixture of both
sometimes people can be evil UNK destructive and aggressive and think only of themselves as we know to our cost and as we see all around us in the world from time to time
but at other times as we also know people can be remarkably UNK and committed to others
you've only got to think of the career of erm UNK who died today or yesterday whenever it was
well she's a shining example of that
the UNK in this world may not be as numerous unfortunately as the people running around in bosnia or er UNK but they do exist and you have to see that there are both of these sides of human nature
people can be very good they can also be very bad
it seems to me the freudian view takes both into account
furthermore it doesn't just take both into account in terms of some vague philosophical UNK you know that anybody could come to sitting on a bar stool after they've had enough er dry UNK you know as people sometimes good people sometimes bad
i mean that this kind of that that's a UNK
i mean the freudian insight is a much deeper one
it says the personality is structured in such a way that there is an UNK anti social area the id
that there is another pro social erm constituent the ego and furthermore these are different and different things occur in each and different processes occur
for example the pro social erm factors mobilize projection and identification and the anti social ones are to do with the UNK drives and so on
so it it's a it goes much beyond merely a kind of er UNK of saying all people can be sometimes good or people can be sometimes bad and it tells you about the specific way in which this th this comes about
an example er of what i'm talking about which i think shows this very nicely and is something i wanted to mention because it's important in itself is the shifts in freud's views on anxiety
as we saw in the early phase of psychoanalysis before world war one when it was dominated by the view of freud and in the eighteen nineties and when psychoanalysis was mainly id analysis and concerned with the unconscious freud took the view of anxiety as a UNK transformation of the libido
the libido was then regarded as a kind of emotional UNK that if it was frustrated UNK a UNK transformation into anxiety
er i think i mentioned this i hope i did pretty sure i did
after world war one in the second phase of the psychoanalysis when he was concerned with the analysis of ego anxiety became a sense of danger in the ego and the ego felt anxiety when it was threatened and as a result there was three sorts of anxiety UNK anxiety when the ego was threatened by the drives of the id moral anxiety when it was threatened by punishment from the super ego and realistic anxiety when it was threatened by dangers from the outside world
some early analysts though not freud
i emphasize but some of his followers took the view that anxiety for example in children was UNK and they that generation of analysts tried to bring up their children to be free of anxiety and then you still get this in a lot of popular child psychology today the idea that anxiety is always bad and always wrong
anna freud writing many years later in her classic book erm UNK of UNK in childhood erm UNK that er the first generation of analysts was wrong about this and she UNK says that the UNK profession changed its view although freud never did
freud always regarded anxiety as normal but the erm many of his colleagues didn't and anna freud erm UNK that er experience proved that er her father's original view turned out to be turned out to be the right one
and she says that attempts to free children of anxiety proved to be UNK
the reason is that erm if the child UNK to be afraid for example of the parents or of outside of outside discipline or control it instead becomes anxious and terrified of its own UNK drives which it can't control
an anxiety appears to be a permanent UNK in human mental life it's not one that you can you can live without
of course if you take the freudian view of anxiety as a danger signal in the in the ego that makes sense
and anna freud's conclusion is that all children will experience anxiety but what they experience anxiety about will vary and clearly the best thing is that they experience anxiety about things that are important and are real rather than anxiety about things that are UNK and UNK
but in general she UNK that there was there proved to be no way of UNK the child from anxiety
so anxiety would be you see would be something that points out what i'm calling this realistic view of human nature
that the other point to be made about the pessimistic and optimistic theories is they because they're extremely UNK they can easily suggest the idea of UNK and you get two different sorts of UNK
the pessimistic thing was the UNK always looked back to the past some golden age of order in the past you know when people knew what to do and er and er things were right as it were and th they tend to want to restore some ideal state of order and authority that existed in the past which was much better than now because civilization has gone to the dogs and been UNK and so on
and they look back and er these pessimistic views are usually UNK
politically they're usually UNK
the UNK want to go back
i mean effectively i always wanted to go back to the middle ages er with the history books of english society
english society of course didn't work out that way
the UNK the opt optimistic theories on the other hand also had their UNK but they look forward
for the for the UNK the UNK is always in the in the future and these people er tend to be UNK
they tend to say we must UNK the existing social order and establish a new just social order when human beings will be liberated from the UNK erm UNK er forces that er make them bad and everything will be everything will be okay
the freudian realistic view it seems to me couldn't allow you to draw either conclusion you couldn't neither conclude that things were better in the past and therefore we ou ought to go back to the golden age nor could you conclude that things will ever be any better in the future
anxiety for example is something that human beings will always experience and to think that you can free them from anxiety in some future UNK or go back to some ordered erm ideal state in the past where everyone was so secure that they would never feel anxiety is just a myth according to freud
freud's view is a realistic one of human nature which says that people will experience anxiety and frustration and er all kinds of erm feelings that they may not want to have
but they will experience those feelings because human nature is not at either of these extreme points it's neither erm perfectly good nor perfectly bad it's a it's a mixture of both and consequently although you can improve the world for it doesn't deny you can improve the world or make it worse of course
to think that you could bring about a UNK and perfect human nature in one way or another is really a UNK er optimistic and er is in itself er some kind of illusion
well at that point i will end what i have to say for today and er carry on with this next week
thank you very much
yes you can catch me now
hobbesian theory being
yes that's right
yes well UNK
er no it's a bit tough i suppose
you could bring some UNK insight to it
oh yes oh yes that's right
oh yeah
are you keeping that sort of thing that in some ways could be considered to be a system
if i let it run away with me it might you know
tie it up
i mean if you like me to leave your paper to write to one i'll be quite pleased to look at it
okay alright
if you want to discuss it with me
okay
i mean if you want do a paper for this group on you know on the UNK periods of evolution and how they look from our perspective
you could substitute it perhaps for that one
yeah okay well look
have a think about it
yeah okay
if you want to do a version of it first i think we we'll appreciate it very much
okay fine okay yes
in order to get because i hesitate to give you more work to do you got enough work
fine
but think about it could be interesting
yeah okay sure fine
we'll have words about it
thank you
come on in
now i have some good news for you and you could do with some good news couldn't you
yes
least i hope it's good news from what you said last night i think it would be good news
i have got you a computer one of these would you like one of those
i'd love one of those
right we can get you one
i'll tell you what's happened
the thing is the school has just launched a new programme to lend portable computers to graduate students okay
now we've got one in this department like this and er one of our graduate students was very interested in it and since she was just finishing her p h d the in some of the ways some of the most erm UNK erm persons for this but i'm certainly not alone
there's a growing body now of people who are thinking along similar lines and er so it's it it's i think you'd be UNK to wipe this off just as my UNK
i mean it may be that
look we're gonna have to stop
we can carry on with this next week as you see we've touched on a big topic so we'll leave it to you to introduce next week's discussion whatever way you think fit erm that raises other issues which you want to talk about
okay
thanks very much
and well done that was an excellent
a little UNK
erm i read another erm book on believing this
yeah fine
er i have an example of
right
could be certainly quite old erm and a socialist of course
yeah
you ought to point out
right
not completely true
ah let me just say what leaders of peacetime margaret was after early life was that a cold mother who was erm full of personality people of london UNK of the leader of the conservative because at least half the book is about
that's where it belongs
erm
at least not fully in command of ourselves let alone the social and political world around us
it's certainly wrong though i think erm there was erm the question
mm
er but i do believe that made very important the reason er the first question is and people weren't reading about that
erm
well
well done that was absolutely first rate i mean erm it was a difficult er task you had especially as the book wasn't in the library of which i am deeply UNK because i thought it was and er i thought you er you coped with a very difficult assignment extremely well and i think you can have an extra and i'm sure everyone else thinks so too
er as i have said i haven't done woodrow wilson before in the past so it was an experiment and erm i must admit yo you rose to the occasion UNK
the choice of literature as you realize was meant to be UNK and i put book down as an example of what i thought was the worst possible er use of use of psychoanalysis kind of UNK erm and which you didn't look at and it's no criticism of you erm because er you had your work cut out with what you did do but the reason i put down UNK truth if anybody's ever read that have they
this is the exact opposite from because it's erm it UNK
it kind of builds UNK up into a great er figure as it were ignoring his feet of clay erm which he definitely had
so erm book on which is kind of a character association by a pop cycle analysis and UNK erm book on UNK which is using cycle analysis of tremendous contrast
and er the question is of course where does freud's book on woodrow wilson belong
does it belong in the kind of erm camp or not
well erm what do other people think
but isn't that the quote at the beginning of your book er UNK quote erm doesn't that say something about how you know long UNK radio UNK of someone is very political or sort of er UNK all of the important things they really done and i don't know i don't know if it's er pertinent erm but obviously in freud wanted to set out to criticize wilson erm so he you know he went in with it
i mean he was
yes
obviously going to UNK out of the
he was
UNK which made him look bad
yes
erm and er on other hand he got everything got his own book out UNK
of course i think if freud were here he would defend himself by saying i was quite open about my prejudice against wilson at the beginning of the book as reminds us freud says quite clearly how he felt about all this
but i think freud would have also gone on to say that he had very good reason for UNK wilson because he blamed wilson personally for the UNK peace after er UNK but er was UNK many people would argue going to lead to the second world war and er so freud's defence i think would be this man really was responsible
because after all the situation in my i don't know i mean i don't know how well you know your modern history
i'm not certain i'm not a great expert on it but erm the situation seems to be that after the first world war the central power was germany and austria were defeated
er france er was er battle UNK and its economy in ruins
this country was bankrupt and had to borrow money from the united states of america to keep going and er russia had just had a revolution and was still in chaos
so the united states was really the only world power erm as were able to do anything
in some ways the situation you know was a bit like what it is now since the collapse of the soviet union only more so i would say because the other powers were more were even more UNK than is the situation today
so for a while the president of the united states effectively had world power there was no other power in the world who could stand up to the u s er after world war one for one argument anyway and i think freud's er defence UNK would be woodrow wilson was the man who came to europe saying he would bring a just peace for all and went away leaving a total mess and freud's er argument in his book is told us was well the mess er was really UNK own doing and if it was his doing what was it in his character that allowed him to er si to on some lloyd george who bullied him into getting most of what they wanted
so that would be freud's defence now i suppose you would have to know a lot more about modern history to know if this was really true or not but erm the er question that freud was really asking himself really was why did wilson let us down because freud UNK that he regarded wilson when he came to europe as a saviour
you know here was somebody coming from outside europe who would bring you know peace and justice for all
let's hope i quoted the american constitution correctly did i
erm you know perhaps the kind of way people look on president today
you know which is only day one of his UNK
we'll see what happens to him president
but erm that would be for its for its er defence i suppose
is it UNK i mean how do how do modern america let's ask er and erm er and
how do modern americans see woodrow wilson
erm
what's your image of him
er i don't know i think he forgot you know
yeah
i don't i don't
i remembered him having in my school library
mm
he was regarded as a very smart man
mm
and er one of our most intellectual presidents
yeah
and i don't think i don't think most people considered him vulnerable very vulnerable
i mean they know that working
yeah
but i don't think most people er would necessarily consider it than now on the european side they might consider
erm but you know but i think they did
i think it marks the beginning of the united states their first real world power
so i think that's how he was
i see
mm
so people don't blame him for the consequences of UNK
i don't think so
no
to answer my own question i did
i mean i think
yeah
no that's true that's true
what about er european history who's studied this period in modern history at school
have you
yes
what question do you go to woodrow wilson
frankly he was a
i see
no
everything he wants
but the things is he wanted to a lot of things about came up like in the middle
mm
ages before the war you more you think about it
mm
yes
i see yes
anyone else got a view on this
he was a very odd man though
mm
as freud said that at fourteen adult life
good one doc yes
and erm i mean er the last eighteen months of his presidency he erm settled with mrs wilson because he would be incapable
yeah the of course er freud had one advantage here and that was UNK
erm as we know UNK was a member of the delegation and an UNK of wilson so the book is er co UNK so in a sense we should know as we're paying for all of it because er obviously he relied on UNK to give him all this UNK information and er consequently what you see freud doing in this in this book is er UNK through as it were the things that UNK told him that UNK had found out to erm draw a kind of UNK psychoanalytic portrait of woodrow wilson that erm tried to explain his problem why did he not deliver the goods as it were
and the if you put the character of woodrow wilson aside the central theme which comes out of this book which is i think why it's important worth reading certainly the introduction is worth reading
there is a three or four page brief introduction er to the book which is presumably by freud himself because it's about psychoanalysis and i don't think UNK could have written it
erm what's worth reading about that and it comes out strongly in the introduction is that this is a kind of case UNK study of a particular kind of person
er a man who grows up under the shadow of his father as it were
so it's quite an interesting whatever you think about woodrow wilson in the first world war is quite a interesting book in drawing a character study of the kind of person who freud must have seen many times in his practice
the man who grows up UNK his father and whose relationship with his father is a largely passive one
so he tends to regard his father as a kind of ideal he can never equal and tends if anything to identify with er with his own mother and play a kind of passive role to his to his father
