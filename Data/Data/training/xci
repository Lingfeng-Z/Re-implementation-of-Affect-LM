and this is how freud explains UNK to stand up to the other men like woodrow like UNK or lloyd george who were rather aggressive and er were kind of pushing all the time what they could out of the out of the peace settlement and what er the book shows is that woodrow wilson would have UNK with them and say a lot of fine words and then the next day he would he would give it all away as it were he would he would be ill or he'll UNK or when the actual agreements came to be signed he wouldn't do what he said he would er wh what he did
so freud has to explain this weakness of wilson in the face of erm these much more dominant aggressive men he was up against in these very hard er hitting negotiations about what to do about the world after world war one
so freud's view is that he was this passive erm nature of retiring er nature of woodrow wilson which explains his UNK as says erm wilson was a very intellectual man
he had a great UNK for speeches and UNK
apparently in his childhood he'd give speeches to an empty barn er had would stand in the in the family barn erm giving lectures to the hay you know and he loved this and he was he had a great erm sense of UNK language and freud and UNK interpretation is that woodrow wilson in a sense was a typical politician
very good at words not so good at actions and actually delivering the goods as it were
so why do you
well er i asked this because erm when i was having my house it came up and i and i pointed out to her th the astonishing UNK i said look erm everybody knows about UNK and his UNK of freud mentions it and says he read it and reports rather well of it actually was really quite impressed with it
i said knew about it erm you must have known about it erm that standard edition of the complete psychological works of freud that's its title and you're one of the UNK one of the UNK i said there's no evidence that you ever intended to include this book in it even though you know i understand that it couldn't be published as long as woodrow UNK family was still alive but erm you know why wasn't it published in the standard edition
and said i don't know
now she could have been lying
i don't think she would have told me a lie
when i asked her things like that she didn't want to tell me on other occasions she said i know that i can't tell you
er she was an honest person
i think that's what she would have said
if that had been the case she'd say oh i do know but i'm afraid i can't tell you
when she said i don't know i think she was telling me the truth she didn't know
erm the fact is she didn't play a dominant part in the standard tradition although she was one of the UNK of course
er she was mainly one of the UNK because she was erm her father's you know she even inherited her father's estate
so that was in her share of the management
i don't think she'd taken erm prominent role in the day to day planning of the standard edition this was done by erm UNK spreadsheet
so erm i think when she said she didn't know er she was telling the truth and when asked her if she could explain to me the very point that just asked me again she said she couldn't explain she had she she'd agreed it was a paradox that she didn't really know erm why the book had never been published or until nineteen sixty seven erm note that it that it had been taken
erm my only view is that er the reason is that by the time it saw the light of day because remember the UNK was in the UNK was physically in the possession of the UNK family not the freud family
erm when the UNK family sought it to published it was published but by that time the kind of changes that i talked about at the beginning of my lectures had already occurred in psychoanalysis
psychoanalysis had evolved into a highly UNK undertaking which was very and UNK for therapy and the black books had already been UNK as it were
people were already tending to ignore these very works we're looking at UNK we'll be looking at next week gonna tell us about that aren't you
yes
another very black book er civilization UNK these kind of books were er generally er at er best ignored at worst UNK by the psychoanalytic establishment
so when this book on woodrow wilson appeared i mean it gets even UNK
er particularly since it was only half right or you couldn't exactly tell which half not very clearly so if it's half by freud and er it was a book erm on erm a controversial figure arguing over very controversial pieces and i think the psychoanalytic study didn't want to have anything to do with it and er one of the reviews of the psychoanalytic journal that said that this is the kind of book that gets psychoanalysis a bad name
and er on the other side the people interested in it in the social sciences erm didn't particularly like it because at that time they were heavily dominated by er marxist and people on the left
i mean i myself for instance after i'd published my first book on psychoanalysis in nineteen eighty was UNK to the house of commons by and given a dinner in the house of commons restaurant which isn't very good actually least it wasn't then and effectively i was told by this great man was noticed had a very high opinion of his own ego that erm you know the left was in charge of psychoanalysis in this country and had better conform or shut up
my views were not politically correct
and would i please stop publishing on psychoanalysis and leave it to my UNK and UNK
like
so i er i UNK told him what he could do with that well i was eating his dinner and i couldn't be too rude to him but erm you know when er when confronted i don't give ground over that kind of thing
i said you know i'd every right to resume my own research erm if the labour party thought it owned psychoanalysis i'm afraid i have to differ
so we UNK on that note
but erm the people like and the left didn't like the book either because it didn't tell their particular interpretation as kind of left marxist er interpretation as someone has it was so popular at the time
and so the book was just kind of ignored i think and left standing and now it's out of print and we've discovered this week it's not even in the university library
erm it must have UNK there was a copy there
er so it's it it's one of these UNK works it it's it has UNK i must admit some very unfortunate literature and i think 's own book is the worst example but it's not the only one
there's a whole area of psycho history
has anybody read about psycho history
there's a whole school of psycho history mainly in the united states not many followers here and er i must admit i used to have er a class on psycho history on this course and i dropped it and the reason was i think students didn't find it very satisfactory and the literature was of such poor quality
it really was er of the sort you know if UNK nose had been half an inch longer history would have all been different you know that kind of UNK
erm i think you can see that the problem with this kind of UNK approach to history is it can UNK into UNK
of the kind that himself wrote of
which i think is er is one of the worst examples of trivial
because clearly you can see that in the social sciences there is a big problem
if you think that individual people have a big role in history like and woodrow wilson i doubt if he did i mean everybody would admit that these were important figures obviously but the question is how important were they compared with social political and economic factors possibly beyond their control
i mean this is the big issue isn't it
i thought like i mean isn't the basic idea of psychoanalysis is that you know that these people are UNK something and that's studying and the question is how well can you arrive at what they were UNK by just sort of UNK you know i mean
mm
wouldn't you i mean not as so best way to figure out what they were UNK but just i mean wouldn't you need to really have the whole life in front of you
you would
to figure out
i mean we urgently certainly we can UNK a group you know the group UNK the group psychology because we all understand how groups act and we can say oh yes groups act like that you do act like that makes sense and that can prove it you know
but with a man i mean you really need to have every single incident in his life to really know what
that is absolutely true
yes this is another big problem i think you put that very well that people forget of course that in clinical UNK analysis the UNK has a vast amount of data because the patient is going five times a week or in freud's case six times a week for fifty minutes every day six days a week nine months of the year often for several years and er the sheer amount of data that the UNK gets is absolutely immense
i mean i can well recall in my own analysis with of course for the first six months she said nothing and i used to get very frustrated and say look what do you think of this
what's your interpretation she would say oh we don't know enough yet
she said i'm not sure
we'll have to wait and see
and for about six months i didn't get anything
when interpretations were offered to me she said so and so and i said why and then she was ready
she said there was this female that the other thing and there was a whole long list of things that pointed to this interpretation and it was all part of a as you say a great mass of data that erm is quite mind UNK large if you actually erm see it in words
erm it's very difficult of course to er well it's impossible actually to turn that into er written accounts
because of course if you were to tape record UNK sessions it would change that nature of the of the analysis
and er one of the big scientific problems with psychoanalysis is that privacy and confidentiality are prominent as obviously in other areas of science you can er the demonstration has to be in public as it were
i mean other people can do the experiment or repeat it
trouble with an individual psychoanalysis it can never be
so one of the big problems with an historical figure is that erm you don't even have that much data to go on the data you have is gonna inevitably be selective and limited
again i think if freud and UNK were here today they'd say well look we did in fact have quite a lot of data because i UNK knew wilson UNK for several years and worked with him and er freud had rarely the stuff in erm in all papers of woodrow wilson in the library of congress or wherever they were and he had a great deal of data
but even so 's point is a good one that there isn't there's seldom if ever enough this is a small problem in psychoanalysis i myself hope to put right to some extent and some of you may live long enough to see this happen i hope you will
er that's why i'll tell you all i even tell young people
there's no point in telling old people because they'd be dead
but erm there are one or two interesting exceptions to this and one exception is myself because er i started analyzing myself through maybe to nineteen sixty nine and with one or two small exceptions like when i was being analyzed by and i didn't like it with any doubt my entire analysis was being written down
erm i guess now in fact erm er last few years is all er is all er entered in data on computer
and it's my intention to keep up this analysis er for as long as it takes probably to the end of my life
and that er on the centenary of my birth which will fall in two thousand and forty six my UNK and executors will be free to er release it to the world on condition however that it's published complete and UNK and UNK
in other words if you're gonna have personal you're gonna it you can't allow somebody to edit us out as it were
and er if and when it's published there will be millions of words i mean there are now and i don't how large it is now it's impossible to tell how large erm but just a couple of years for example amounts to over a quarter of a million words so if you run that back to nineteen sixty nine you see it is going to be one of the largest books ever written
and it maybe if it's ever published while we're still here in two thousand and forty six and my executors do as i hope they will erm you know it will be a book alongside samuel UNK and UNK and saint UNK it's that length
my guess it's as least long as samuel UNK diary or will be
and i hope that er you know this all this data will be published and people will be able to see just what the complete data is
and if that's the case then in the middle of the next century more will be known about me than has ever been known about any other human being
because i have UNK stuck to the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis
i have not held back anything
it's all true and it's all right
of course my own reputation will be the first victim of this
i will be UNK
but that's okay i mean i'm not particularly i'm not so impressed with the human race that i think much of their opinion of me anyway
but erm the great pity of course is that freud didn't do this
it's i mean freud we know did do a certain analysis
my guess is he must have written an account
it's a great pity he didn't preserve any detail and he looked er like all his other papers had been left in the library of congress until two thousand and twenty five and then they will all become public
erm that would have been er really worth knowing
but as i've said it will it will be preserved in my case
erm it's my great contribution to science unfortunately i shall be long dead and many of yo some of you may i don't know how many of you will still be alive in two thousand and forty six but if you are you may see this day
i won't of course
but it's a it's a problem that you've put your finger on and this is why i personally think that a lot of this literature is of such a poor quality
and certainly this stuff i mean when a person's still alive how can you possibly know enough
you see woodrow wilson was dead UNK had access to a lot of private material that er perhaps there's still i don't know whether it's ever been published
and of course UNK had directly observed the man and UNK with him during the critical time at the UNK conference
and the whole book is really about er the UNK conference in a way isn't it and about why he behaved the way he did at the time
so there's a kind of critical period here that we have got a lot of information about
and in a sense the book is very one UNK in that it follows just this one aspect of woodrow UNK character the critical one
now of course in a in a complete psychoanalysis if woodrow wilson had been going for analysis then all kinds of other aspects of his life and personality would have opened up
and you wouldn't get this concentration on one this one kind of character UNK which er admittedly is a is a problem with the book and can make it look as if it is a kind of character UNK
character UNK of wilson
erm yes perhaps
mm
yes but freud does er justify this er meaning that this is why to form a psychological
that's
because of his limitations
i was gonna further say that erm you know beside lack of information itself information of repression information into someone's life i mean repression necessarily i mean the thing that someone does in their lifetime might necessarily strange and UNK and the purpose of the thing
well yes that that's true but i think the er by the nineteen twenties when freud was writing this book was it nineteen twenty nine twenty eight twenty nine
er well certainly yes
they started it yes
right so they
sorry the early nineteen thirties when they started it
by that time freud certainly had moved on a bit from the earlier perhaps rather narrow concentration on the repression and he was moving into the second er era of psycho psychoanalysis when there was an emphasis more on the total personality on the ego and its mechanisms of defence to quote a title of a famous book by and i think this is more the kind of thing that freud is doing in this book where you see not just the UNK in the unconscious but the whole personality and you understand it in terms of its various defensive erm structures and the way which it carried out its repression
in other words you concentrate not just on what's repressed in id but on the structure of the ego as well and the superego and the course of nature part of it comes out in the book as told us that woodrow wilson had a tremendous superego in the form of his identification with his father who he further identified with god i mean if i come over very critical indeed and therefore his own ego was identified with jesus christ
and this for example i mean whether we believe this or not this freud says or thinks explains why wilson could come to europe as a saviour the saviour of UNK but then failed to deliver the goods because of the passive nature of his identification you know jesus got crucified
which was a pretty passive thing to do in some ways erm and similarly you could say woodrow wilson ended up crucified by the by the allies
a certain fourteen points for UNK everybody must have that
and erm so this it was in a sense it was not so much as what was repressed in his ears the structure of his ego that led to this unfortunate consequence
does that answer your
so it's part of this larger view of psychoanalysis that was emerging in the thirties
where you could have more of a character study rather than just the kind of erm capping the unconscious as it were
since like what you say psychoanalysis was now i mean is it mostly centred on the ego
i mean one since you can't go if you don't
mm
would you say that you know in modern psychoanalysis presumably just not the like the structure of the ego and then they know
wh what well i wouldn't say just looking similar i would say UNK looking but in the in the early days the erm and i'll be saying something about this in the in the lectures bu but just briefly that you could you could say there were phases in psychoanalysis the early days before both of us were born you were here the aim when the method was the aim was to release the unconscious bring it to the surface and that was regarded as more or less enough
UNK in those days were short by modern standards
there's an example in my book with one that only lasted six weeks for example which is astonishing by modern standards
after world war one and especially by the nineteen thirties the UNK of psychoanalysis as it were had UNK to include the ego as we saw and so what happened then was the structure of the ego was explored and not just the UNK
in other words it was the agencies that carried out the UNK that were analyzed as well as the UNK themselves
this is a much more like a kind of total UNK of the personality
it means that psychoanalysis takes a lot longer because you are looking at defences and ego as well as at the
you get a much more complete picture
analogy i used in my book was actually suggested to me by although this is a UNK a kind of UNK that her father was very fond of
erm was with archaeology
but in the nineteenth century archaeology was a kind of treasure UNK erm UNK a kind of raid on the very past to discover the treasure
that's what psychoanalysis was like in its first days
we UNK the unconscious as it were to UNK the repressed and understand what was in that
modern archaeology is much more scientific and it's it tends to UNK entire layers layer by layer and every little thing is relevant you know they the little pot UNK erm even bits of UNK apparently are very interesting to archaeologists because they're sure people were eating and things like this er you know UNK of fire was UNK everything
all of this is just good as well as bits of gold and er and you know metal objects that have always traditionally been interesting to archaeologists
and that's rather like modern analysis everything is interesting
it's not just what is repressed it's the structures of the ego that bring about these UNK the UNK and so on
so it's a more complete er picture of the personality and of course it UNK itself to this kind of historical UNK
because as says er the unconscious is as a sense is always hidden so how do you possibly find out about the unconscious of historical figures that are dead and gone
well the answer is with very great difficulty
but if you were looking at their UNK as well er their whole personality had its defence UNK then of course you may be able to see a bit more because you are now looking at areas which are co both conscious and manifest themselves in all kinds of different ways
does that answer your point
yeah i suppose i was thinking i always get mixed up when you say psychoanalysis
mm
i just want to you know modern days was just confusing me and er all this sort of thing
whereas i think it easy you know sometimes i get confused about what's what
right
so when i talk about psychoanalysis in this course i mean mainly freudian classical because it's freud's writings we're looking at
admittedly another aspect of the whole thing as you rightly say is that there's been a UNK and a lot of different schools and of course different schools give emphasis to different kinds of things
and that's a further UNK factor of course
well it's just coming up to eleven o'clock who haven't we heard from er right you've been very quiet there
there
have you got anything any comments you want to say about this
i mean i didn't read the book
no
no
er i must admit i point freud makes slightly arrogant erm i mean it he's a
yeah
mm
his father's you know there's peace conference in nineteen eighteen
yeah
did you think that their approach was arrogant and their the affect was UNK
well not really no
that weren't the impression that i got
the actual book arise that book anyhow mm
but it's certainly er certainly a valid question
yeah
woodrow wilson
well that's what freud
also subject on
but i know that such a UNK writer
you know i mean i was convinced that there was no such thing as religion after i'd read the book i mean anything i read about i immediately say oh yes of course that's true you know
so
well next week will be telling us about another one of these very controversial books won't you
yes
in which we shall be looking at er another famous figure but er an even more remote and one some people might say UNK one namely moses
so having done woodrow wilson this week we will do moses next week
we'll look forward to that
is anybody jewish by the way
right
well one year i must admit somebody in the class UNK out
the person started to read their paper on moses and i thought she was doing a good job of it this guy suddenly got up and said i'm jewish i'm not listening to any more of this and UNK out
oh i don't see that
erm what is the most
right
er that is in that is in er UNK
if you wanna get there
i'm just
the easiest way to do it is to take the underground to UNK road station
UNK road station
mhm
and when you come out of UNK road station it's in a place called
i may be able to give you a thing about it actually if i've still got one
you can visit it it's open it's best to phone up and find out when they're open because they're not open every day
and they interesting
well there's i mean it's interesting erm it's freud's you know collection of classical and antique
they give the impression that the house is the way it was when he lived there but it's not quite true actually it was earlier on
erm it's certainly a lot UNK than could remember when lived there
erm and now let's see i used to have a file on this but i might have passed it or given all the stuff away
is it
yeah it probably is
yes that's the kind of place you would find it
erm that is the kind of place you would
alright
well if you suddenly find it you know
er don't despair i haven't finished yet erm ah here we are freud i knew i had it i knew i had it
they used to write to me quite regularly here you are
great
thank you
as i said check the opening hours they've probably changed
okay
that tells you where it is and the phone numbers
great
thank you
erm
yes
to make an appointment
yeah the reason is we have to discuss your erm your reports and so on
erm what were we going to do today
a lot of
right
okay
well let's make an appointment then
when would be convenient
well i finish at about twelve on UNK and work on wednesday
right
won't be here next wednesday
what about next tuesday
could you what's on at twelve thirty
i'm showing a film at one
i mean you are in the afternoon on tuesday
i might yes
yeah the trouble with that i'll have to make you wait till four thirty is that too long
erm well what about thursday
thursday yes no next UNK easier
what about next thursday what time could you
erm between
you've got a lecture
erm i mean one and two
between one and two
or after three
or after three
erm yeah let's make it at three
can we make it at three next thursday after the lecture
right
so after next UNK lecture twenty eighth at three o'clock
right
okay
yeah
see you then
thanks very much
bye
okay come on come and sit down
well i was erm i just heard you wanted me to come in erm i'm doing a paper on monday
oh that's right
that's right
but erm
and you were going to
you wanted me er to give you a run through of it
well i su i suggested that this will be helpful which it will be will it
erm well the thing is that i still erm in the process of doing research and reading and gathering a
alright
i mean we did reports we did those yeah
lot of ideas about getting an idea about did you am i in the class just now
i went to erm the registration
yeah
it says i haven't been put on the list
am i on it
er well they hadn't notified me but they probably you told them anyway did you
yeah
because that's the important thing
erm yeah the important thing is that they know
i mean i know i've written it down myself
erm
okay you say you're still
right yeah
you're still doing this
i didn't think the question that erm the question culture was the same as our culture
right
and erm read about the book so far and i'm going through erm
okay
why
well there's no need now i mean i only suggested this erm to help you er and i wouldn't want to make you write it out er just for the sake of writing it out
it don't think it's a good use of your time
and i mean if you think that just presenting it in the in the class is er enough
send it down to use yourself but to be able to carry that through and to go on to be UNK and i respect that it's important to be UNK
if you know talk about people moral values and to be able to do that and just majority of anything you need to you need to have a that allows you to do that without
yes yeah
yes it's very important to remember that both in from this direct point of view and from freud's findings you shouldn't just assume that it was a UNK between two areas as it were
one conscious and un it's not like that
i mean in fact what er what freud found he says is sometimes you get erm this is in fact a kind of continuing from conscious and unconscious and there's a big UNK in between and very often erm things are erm unconscious not in the sense that they're totally lost and you are unaware of them but for example they're isolated
they exist erm UNK a very common finding in psychoanalysis is that things will exist as word representations with no feeling representation or they won't be connected to er they'd be completely isolated
you know a very good example of this that always sticks in my mind telling me erm that once she was analyzing a woman and er a lot of the analysis was concerned with erm conflicts erm relating to UNK in childhood and constantly felt that this was what the analysis seemed to have done because the woman consistently denied this had ever happened
absolutely denied she'd ever done that
then one day said she described something she often used to do in childhood UNK did
and she had a special name for it i can't remember what is was now but it was an UNK word like erm UNK or something like that something you do with your fingers
erm and said okay that's what you called it in childhood you called say UNK if that's what it was
she said now supposing you had to look up what you just described you know in a dictionary and find a word that everybody would associate with it
what word would you find
and she said the woman thought for a minute and suddenly she UNK when said that's UNK isn't it
and said yes
and she said but i've always known i did that
and you see she'd known it but it had been entered under another word in her mind
as she didn't connect it with what everyone else calls UNK
you know er that's a horrible thing that other people do
she had her own term for it and as long as it was purely associated with that term she never connected it
and that's quite a typical finding
that things remain unconscious not because you never knew about them but because they're never brought into the relevant connections with other things that make you conscious of the thing in the sense of seeing what's in it for mrs you know reports
so we're not saying it's a question of conscious unconscious or rigid UNK where we are actually talking about subtle UNK of consciousness from complete self conscious awareness at one end to total loss of all memory of the thing at the other
and everything in the between and most stuff is in between as a matter of fact
so i think you're right it's a very important erm and often in life you can find people switch from one to the other with astonishing speeds
i mean some people have kind of UNK minds with UNK behaviour and they switch from being one type of person or another type of person almost minute by minute
you just can't keep up with them
i mean what does this you know what is this
i mean do to have this astonishing capacity of switch all the time
you just don't know where you are with them
well that was interesting it was interesting discussion er thanks to an excellent paper we're delighted and that was first rate
who did i say was next week
right
we look forward to hearing from you next week
sorry i've got to throw you out on time but i've got another appointment at four
er did you see him about that
erm yes i did the only problem
yeah
you don't have a
ah well keep our fingers crossed
tell me if there's anything i can do
okay
yeah
well what did you think of the film
had you seen it before
i hated it
it is a bit is er is er is a bit odd
i suppose you liked it
well i must say i liked it er i mean i showed it because er suggested it
i thought it filled in the kind of some of the UNK kind of things we don't have time to do in the course
was interesting
i mean the general i mean
yeah
you think i should show it in the future years
perhaps not
er it depends
yeah
fine
the sexual UNK
yeah it did
er
yeah have a look hold on
thanks for the book
alright
oh you sure you can spare it
yeah i've no more lectures until your one on thursday
well can i give it to you back on thursday
yeah that's wonderful
you sure you won't need it till then
i'll keep it under lock and key many thanks
ah right so how are you
oh i'm fine thank you
put that save
make sure i don't lose that
okay
right so and you're going to the what's the seminar at five is it or
that's right oh yes i received this letter
yeah
i don't know if you've heard about it
no
erm well i was
yeah
and i mean i considered myself to have been like er frequent or erm whatever
so er on the last seminar they all talked about sending out letters to all the students who weren't there the attendance was very low and i received one but
right
enough
and er i was also asked why i had offered to and i'd already spoken to the UNK secretary about it
yeah
so i wrote back to and
mm
yeah
i'm not giving the paper for health reasons
i have been
right
i will i will mention i didn't know they were sending out such a letter otherwise i would have er told them in advance
but i will
i'm on the street for the moment
i absolutely i'll speak to everyone don't worry
i mean don't worry
so are you are you be going to seminar
yes
yeah
yeah i have to
thing is i just i can't work
no
i go sick
no
somehow i haven't been able to work
no okay
because i'm really worried
mm
when i think about it i think i just can't work it's like i've lost interest whenever i find some i feel i'm able to keep up
mm
which is something i
mm
i mean want to i have considered going back to er training and cancel this
right i see what dropping this altogether
er no i'd like to come in
mm
i mean i don't particularly like
mm
yeah
and perhaps after that come back to
right
i really
well the i mean the thing about the end fill is
we people who must vote for the party if we are ever to win power again
so adopt this report give the UNK down to those who want to break the links and support a wider form of democracy where the trade union is paying the levy is not only a valuable member of the party but is valued as well
we've heard the voice of the party professionals we've heard the voice of the labour leadership now let's all speak on behalf of the ordinary trade unionists and say with all the force that is necessary on behalf of those millions men and women young and old we support the party we pay for the party we have a right to democracy in the party because never forget it is our party too i move
hear
UNK region speaking on behalf of the c e c
president congress i am very pleased to second this c e c statement on how we can strengthen and UNK the links between the labour party and trade unions
some people in the labour party seem to believe that labour will be better off without the unions
they don't seem to feel that the democratic organizations of working people are relevant to the new model labour party
the truth is that union members are the UNK of the labour party
we provide the party with its broad base we keep it on its feet and when necessary we keep those feet firmly on the ground
labour needs members more than ever to help form policies relevant to ordinary people and to get those policies across
most labour supporters in unions played an active part in the last general election and county elections
we put up posters we persuaded work colleagues to vote labour and we made financial contributions
instead of closing the door o to its union supporters labour should be opening up new ways in
it's not good enough to say that union members can only participate if they become full members of the party
i'm a labour party member and i would urge as many people as possible to join in but i also recognize that many people feel membership demands the time and commitment that they haven't got
they fear endless meetings and worry that they don't know enough to join in
these barriers are especially strong for women and younger people
but the same union members who don't want full membership are particularly keen on other forms of involvement like voting for labour's leaders and helping to select parliamentary candidates
we should listen to how people actually want to make a contribution and base our structures on their views instead of rather male structures which demand substantial commitment
the proposals in this statement do just that
they will ensure that we all continue to have a say in labour's decisions and i urge you to support them
thanks very much indeed UNK
composite twenty nine labour party trade union and links midland region to move london region to second
president congress
les midlands and east coast region moving composite twenty nine
one member one vote sounds very democratic doesn't it
why is it that some general secretaries of certain unions are pushing us down the path of UNK our links
maybe it is because they don't want to fulfil their financial commitments
well if that's the reason they should at least be honest about it
at a recent meeting with members of the shadow cabinet and trade union leaders one high profile shadow cabinet member argued for one member one vote
when asked how he would fund the labour party he said oh we would still expect you to pay
it seems to me that the trade unions are welcomed with open arms whenever money is needed and yet some don't want us to participate
comrades instead of UNK our links we should be UNK them
remember why the labour party was formed
don't let us do the UNK work for them by UNK ourselves apart
i'll tell you what comrades i'm sick to death of some people in the party UNK away from association with us
they seem to be ashamed of their roots
don't they realize we're a part of the same movement
let me tell you i don't want anyone making excuses for me i'm proud to be a trade unionist and i'm proud to be a socialist
you know comrades it's time we stopped pretending to be something we're not
this is what we believe in and we are proud of it and maybe just maybe we would start winning elections instead of losing them
we are going through a crucial period
what this tory government UNK to do is see total destruction of the trade union movements
we have to make sure in this trade union and labour movement that because there will be UNK ahead this has to be one that is foremost in our minds
this conference has to give a message to jo john smith to maintain union links to strengthen them not destroy them
our party is about UNK morality and justice and truth and it's about representing our class that's what we have got to get back to win the next election
congress i move
morning dave london region second in the composite twenty nine
they say a week in politics is a long time and i now know what they mean
i came to congress with my contribution to this debate firmly fixed in my own mind but unsure of the view of the leadership of our union given the views quoted to them in the press as their own
my own view is that the fate of working people the trade unions and the labour party are one and the same and that any attempt to UNK links between us UNK us all to the same failure
the trade unions depend on effectively representing working people in industrial field for their survival and the labour party has to represent the trade unions for their survival in the political field
i do not feel therefore there is any crime for the trade union role in the constitutional procedure of the party whether it be selecting candidates or voting at conference indeed i feel it is the strength of the movement
which do the so called UNK of the party prefer a party of two hundred thousand UNK with division and on minority issues or a stable party with the input of four million working people
you tell me which is more democratic
like many i have supported this union's policy my c l p but also like many i have been hurt and UNK by the attempts of some of the party both nationally and locally to UNK and UNK the unions as a thing of the past and not relevant to the party's new media image and that working class issues were not worth presenting at elections because they are unpopular with the tabloids
the UNK have had their chance
this union has been more than UNK with them
we offered them on the basis of them creating a mass membership party
this they have plainly not been able to do and yet they still try and UNK us along the same old route through their friends in the media
for many of us even the options of support registers and levy plus are schemes whether they are dubious starters
we feel it is now right and proper that the debate is to be had and that our roots our heritage and our future are UNK on our terms and in our UNK and not in the UNK of sunday newspapers and as for les people's letters to the newspapers and UNK and co saying to people individual members why should the labour party not trust you with the choice of your candidate it is you who do the work to get them elected who are they kidding
what did we do at the election did we sit on our UNK
no it was our members out there and this letter is typical of the UNK with which they seem to hold our members
we are not just here to be leaflet and voting UNK for professional politicians we are here to take a part in our party and we will defend that right
i second the composite
well said that
motion three nine six lancashire region g m b parliamentary panel
duncan lancashire region moving motion three nine six
congress the erm nineteen eighty three the gang of four ten years on nineteen ninety three
perhaps what we're seeing is the emergence of a gang of five
we saved the party in nineteen eighty three the g m b saved the party in that er a crisis time th with the formation of the s d p and today the tory government on its knees UNK along and we have some people in the leadership of the party and including we can name them now somebody's written UNK written to all the constituencies neil UNK who have given up the ghost of labour ever winning again and that's what's the base and the root of what's going on that's why they want these proposals going through they want to separate the trade unions from the party so they can do a deal with the liberals because they've given up
tha that's the reality of the situation as i see it and people in my constituency
UNK duncan you are on three nine six by the way are ya
yep
oh
you told me three nine six
yes no i was just wondering that's all
yep i'm gonna get there
ti the clock is running very fast duncan
right okay so the situation we're in today is that we're actually got to defend our party the party is the whole labour movement from that political direction in which the leadership or ex leadership and some people in the parliamentary party seem to want to take us
i'm very active in the party in manchester and er would support the union and the region er as a constituency er constituency member and i you know spend hours every week trying to ke keep this keep the party in manchester going and i think that what we've actually got what we're seeing inside the parliamentary party are a number of people who seem to have forgotten who they're supposed to be representing
i think what we actually want is more people who are more in tune with working people and their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations and tha in parliament in the house of commons than we've got at the moment and so the motion i'm putting forward which is to propose that we actually look at the parliamentary panel and make sure we get a few decent shop stewards in the house of commons a few people who got experience of actually being on the shop floor a few people who got experience in the last fourteen years that the last four conservative governments have actually tried and defend and fight for the interests of working people right down the grass root those are the people that we actually need in the house of commons and we shall be looking at our parliamentary panel and we shall be looking at it very seriously to ensure that we get those sort of people onto that parliamentary panel and those sort of people into the house of commons that's the best way to represent working people in britain today and that's the sort of contribution the g m b should be making
i move
i'm here again dick
dave lancashire region
last time today
we're talking about three nine six g m b parliamentary panel dick and i'll just have to follow duncan he had his little rhetoric on the labour party that he's he believes in so much
well i also believe as i said earlier that we should have p mps who represent the g m b about mps who represent theirselves for what they can get out of it what UNK they can get out of it but leave the activists to do all the work for 'em to do all the work
therefore if we have activists who are put on the panel UNK fi safe seats UNK or UNK seats and we've been in some areas where it's been UNK haven't we dick we've still UNK we've got the votes up p places like UNK where they got nicholas UNK where they got that racist UNK
we've still been there
but eventually we're gonna get people in if the c e c take up our recommendations from UNK one five branch that we're gonna get people who represent the members of the g m b the working class the people that we want to be represented
with the parliamentary panel now as it says on the motion there's a lot up for retirement
there'll be a lot of people UNK for those places as well
i also have seen in UNK near where i live where an mp was imposed on that was held by UNK for twenty two years lived in aberdeen i think it was came to UNK once a week to do his surgery and they put somebody in from the t n g
don't know how it happened but he got there and he lives in london now
UNK about must be the only place where the l mps have never seen the town
why not get people that is activists and UNK might well the branch for UNK you've got dave from stockport they've got a mp retiring they're getting on now you've had we've had your time now for god's sake go you've been there long enough let's get the activists in let's get g m b members and let's get this parliament back to what it should be and not the tories
thank you
right colleagues i now propose to go round the regions and invite regional speakers on the labour party trade union links er document liverpool do you wish to put a speaker in
and if it is the intention of regions to put speakers on especially those regions that are situated at back of congress if the speakers could come to the front it would save a great deal of time
alan liverpool north wales and irish region
president congress
liverpool and north wales support this document
unfortunately colleagues from london from northern ireland sorry have no say
sorry about that lads
mind you there's a lot of northern ireland lads in london anyway erm we think that when our members voted to return the political levy they also voted to continue to have a say in the running of the labour party
the labour party was set up by the trade unions and is still funded by the trade unions
the labour party front bench must realize that the ordinary trade union members voted as i said before for a say in the party
we'll need to go back to them again shortly
will they vote in the same way if their right to have a say is taken away from them
as i said before two thirds of our regions support the document
midland region
peggy midland east coast region speaking to the c e c statement
the labour party was founded in the nineteen hundreds
after a decision of the trade union congress which brought together trade unions and socialist societies
the financial strength that the trade union link has brought to the labour part party is vital
to the functions of the party itself therefore trade unions provide the labour party with resources in money and UNK support
britain is virtually the only country in western europe where there is not now substantial state finance for our UNK a UNK political parties
the trade unions are directly linked to more than eight million people
the union membership leads to a ten percent h higher like likelihood of voting labour
the misleading public image of the unions and the role within the labour party is encouraged by the tories and the liberal UNK democrats and their friends the mass media
there can be no justification for the comments we have heard from certain leaders of right wing er trade unions who wish to take away the very principle of what we're talking about the block vote especially one when one of 'em allegedly who haven't even bothered to pay their contributions to the general election fund
and i'm certainly not prepared to take any advice from them when they can't even pay their way in the labour party
so why should we UNK to the media and the right UNK of the party
the labour party cannot and will not survive without the affiliation of the trade union movement
what the right UNK are saying is that we will have the trade UNK money but we will not give 'em the right to vote
well i say to them they can go to hell
i'm a socialist i but it's a swear word now well i am proud to be a socialist so i will stand up and be counted
we support the views arrived at by the c e c we should be proud of our title the labour party and shout from the hi highest UNK where we live and work
the media campaign mentioned yesterday should be put in into operation immediately
UNK our principles will not get us elected to power
midland and east coast regions support the document
congress we ask you to do likewise
thank you
whilst the london region speakers come into the UNK i'll just make the point peggy in fact is only the third women that's spoken this morning
i know that we've a long way today er to go today but would you just bear that in mind colleagues
right ed
congress president
ed westminster trade union political UNK branch london region
speaking against one member one vote but also speaking against the half UNK document that has been put out by the c e c
before starting comrades i think it's time that we UNK a couple of lies that are being put about this union and other trade unions
the first is that we're two UNK organizations the labour party and the g m b
well i'm gonna prove that's not the case
could all labour party members in the audience in the UNK put their hands in the air please
labour party members
there you go comrades every nearly every single delegate is a labour party member
we are the labour party
eh that was clever
that was very clever
the spin doctors around the lad labour leadership have claimed that the links need to be changed
well like most of you i spent four weeks during the general election out on the doorstep
i was in UNK more than a marginal which sadly the tories retained and my own seat in UNK which also is a safe tory seat
not once was it mentioned not once the links between labour and the unions nobody was interested
they were though interested in some of our policies which they weren't very happy with but that seems to be ignored at the moment
what i would like to see colleagues is a slight change
stop listening to people such as mr UNK who has now written out to c l ps telling them that they should be changing the way that the unions are linked to this labour party not at all
it's time that they looked at themselves
they've lost four times and they should be asking themselves why
it's not the union movement that's lost the elections
what i would like to see now is a turn sorry turning to the document what i would like to see is actually a change of direction
what we are looking to do here is to water down what we have at the moment
i don't think that's necessary
the register of supporters wouldn't work
can you imagine it comrades you would have a position in which we attempt to put into place a bureaucratic list of people who are meant to be labour supporters they aren't labour members
i can see the problems now people come up to you and UNK in your ear how comes he's on the list i saw him going into the liberal club or the tory club the other day he's not a labour supporter
no it's not a good idea at all we should stick with what we have at the moment the representation of people who opt to pay the political levy
that is the sensible way forward
moving on another suggestion is that we should ballot our members about who we vote for as m for mps and also for the leader of the party
well that's fine but why should it be down to thirty percent
we represent over four million levy paying members the trade unions that is and it's only right that they should have a proper say in the election of the lad labour leader not just the thirty percent as is being suggested here
comrades it's time that this union along with other trade unions made it absolutely clear to the labour leadership we are the labour party it is us that gives resources our time our money everything to try and get them elected and it's time they stopped kicking us in the teeth at times such as this
i move that we reject this report and that we have proper links with the labour party
thank you
g m b scotland
president comrades
ian g m b scotland
if what gerald said in his address to congress yesterday that he knows of no labour mp who wants to break the links between the party and the unions were absolutely true then there would be no need for this debate today
but the harsh reality is that is not the case
for the last fourteen years the trade union movement has UNK the blame for the labour party's UNK showing in the general elections
the press blamed us for labour's defeat the tories blamed us for labour's defeat and now it looks as thought the labour party is blaming us for labour's defeat
what an appalling state of affairs
the labour party and the trade union movement are UNK together because we share the same objectives
we both fight for social justice we both UNK for a better quality of life for our people and most importantly we both demand equality
the trade union movement can't succeed on its own the labour party would most definitely fail without us
president the movement has taken a luckily approach in the political er arena for a number of years now
we've been made to feel ashamed of our actions of the past
we've been accused of UNK employers into the ground by our demands
UNK i'll tell ya what's UNK
the actions of UNK and its attempts to undermine the wages and conditions of union members
the disgraceful way ordinary moderate men and women have been sacked at UNK and the way this government UNK the working man and woman in this country by rejecting the social charter and by UNK britain as a low wage economy
that's what's UNK in our society and it's only the labour party in unison with our movement that can right the UNK of the past fourteen years
comrades what we are asking of the party is quite simple the extension of democracy
what everybody must realize is this the trade union movement is the meat on the labour party's bones and without us the party would be a skeleton lost in a political wilderness
president i'd like to finish with a mo much UNK phrase from a political skeleton and the labour party should take UNK we are we are thick we are well we are here and we are staying
i support
hear
UNK region
twenty years ago i joined the labour party when i was eighteen years old which gives an idea of how old i am now
that was before i was working before i was a trade union member
for eight years i was a county councillor having won a seat from the conservative party
throughout that period i've UNK for the labour party i've UNK for the labour party i've argued for the labour party and one of the items that made me join the labour party and one of the items i got other people to join the labour party was that labour was a mass party because it UNK of hundreds of thousands of individual members and it UNK of millions of trade unionists
that was the pe appeal to me that it represented the labour movement it represented the working class at large
i've argued that for twenty years now suddenly overnight it's become UNK and let's make it clear why it's become UNK
it's become UNK because the media is now looking at an alternative UNK for the problems the conservative party that's why it's a reason and what is arising from the labour leadership at the moment is purely an attempt to UNK the media
congress i joined the labour party and i became a socialist i remain a member of the labour party i remain a socialist i'm a trade unionist i won't give up my labour party membership and i won't give up my involvement to my trade union and my UNK between the trade union movement and the labour party without a fight
i support this ma er motion
southern region
southern region wanna put a speaker in
okay
UNK southern region
president congress
supporting in the c e c statement and labour party trade union links
what is there to say er what's not been said already yesterday today last year's meetings and in the last ten years
we are here UNK passing motions not to tell the UNK or the employers what went wrong what's wrong
no we're telling the government we're telling them they've got it wrong excuse me
every working person every unemployed person every pensioner knows only too well they've got it wrong
it's not the fat cats we gotta take notice of who steal the cream and leave us with the UNK milk even
president we don't need on our door
let's tell the world they've got it wrong
don't they know that
poverty low pay UNK crimes UNK
you're staying in portsmouth spending a lot of cash or generally we do
how much of that goes back into tory funds through the businesses shops the places you're staying
they don't ask your permission if you wish that money to go into tory funds
they want to stop our political levy and only half of the tory funds is UNK for from where they get it
if i can go onto the local theme a little chair
crime in the first six months of portsmouth in the residential areas on the UNK not in the town centre five hundred and eighty break ins into houses eighty seven break ins into houses
a hundred and thirty one of those were people who were out to work or UNK
thirty seven of those were through doors what were left open or windows what were left open
UNK opportunity to just get a few bob
car crime nine hundred and sixty cars so far this year have been broke into in the portsmouth bearing in mind yours are around the town
three hundred and seven of 'em are stolen ninety one still not been UNK
twenty percent twenty five percent of the crime committed em nationally is by people under the age of sixteen
twenty five percent again of sixteen to twenty five years old
not much hope of a job not much chance of a million young people who are trying to find cash or work a waste of skills a whole generation
nearly one out of three sixteen year olds are without work not much for the tory law and order
now you hear more cuts in the d s medical UNK v a t on heating light more crime for cash
our national income per head is lower than the french it's falling below that on UNK kong
every month twenty thousand manufacturing jobs go
john to get to the point we've had a bus in portsmouth UNK with g m b UNK a talking point of portsmouth for the last fortnight
what a good talking point people didn't know what the g m b was didn't know what they actually truly stood for with all the publicity what we do all the good work we do lately locally
let's get the message over let's go without one congress and i know that's near to john's heart and request the other unions a e u c a t n g request the t n t u c to do the same and then plaster over every bus in britain the g m b's policy
let's get labour in let's get our motion starting to work let's keep the labour party trade union link it's our only friend we've got in parliament
for better conditions less crime a better britain and the way ahead southern support
northern region
here's billy
alright billy
billy northern region
president colleagues
i have over the years many times come to the rostrum but for the first time it gives me no pleasure at all in saying what has to be said
not so long ago the labour was singing the UNK of the trade union movement especially the g m b yet only last night on t v a shadow minister david said the g m b were wrong in what they were doing they should be behind john smith
i thought only tories done u turns
because we have all heard john smith in the past say i would rather lose an arm than lose the support of the g m b
colleagues in the words of chief sitting bull man with pale face speaks with UNK tongue
remember colleagues it was our union under the leadership of will UNK that pushed for and formed the labour party
we should not allow john smith and his UNK to take it from us
for fourteen years we have been UNK by the tories we have been led by a pound of UNK t u c and as now it's time to stand up and be counted
if the labour party if the labour party want our money then we want some influence and we don't and we and if they don't want to represent the views of our members they can do without our money
the link with labour has got to be more than just signing a cheque
you might ask what does it cost the g m b with affiliation fees etcetera around three million a year
over the last fourteen years forty two million pounds and if they go on the way their going on and the way they're talking it's all gonna be for UNK nowt
just think colleagues what we could have done with forty two million pounds we could have had a conference twice a year not the UNK conference they're on about
our minimum demand colleagues must be one a UNK if electoral college for a selection of leader and for candidates to a continual role for trade unions at conference
it makes me wonder colleagues why this issue has been promoted lately
do some politicians deliberately wish to UNK conflict amongst us and it's not just about money many g m b members volunteer
we've had the speakers up here saying that they're going out they're knocking on doors so you know it's not just about money but i tell you what if they go on in the way they're going on there's no way joe UNK is going out quite tonight on a vote night saying come out and give us your vote
that's all gonna be finished UNK man
and there'll be plenty like me
this morning this morning you know i'm right up with the news isn't i
this morning john smith says he is UNK by john 's remarks he thinks it will give some material to john major i've got news for him many times i've been UNK when he's said nowt to john major when all the UNK he's dropped
so they don't want us to have a say in the labour party
there's nobody can tell me that the big national companies who pour money into the tory fund that they don't have a say in their policy
who do they think they're kidding
i'll tell you another thing whatever the UNK images say about john he pays his money he doesn't grab his UNK and a UNK and fly off to the sunny islands
colleagues let me remind you once more they need us more than we need them
g m b members should be always full members no influence no UNK for our members no way
it's our party and we should not give up without a fight
thank you
well done billy
er
lancashire
follow that duncan
yeah i can't
i'm not going to attempt to
duncan lancashire region supporting the er t the c e c statement
i mean it's quite clear isn't it what we wa we want a party of labour we're organized we're organized mass organization that speaks for almost a million people in this union i don't but er almost a million people
we're speaking for working people in this country and we are a reliable indicator of the feelings the dreams the hopes of working people right across the country and any party that attempts to divorce itself from an organization such as ours that attempts to speak for working people will lose its way
at the same time d the tories are on their knees some people as i said earlier i think it's just as relevant in this debate seem to have lost their way and when you took look at what they're proposing in terms of say the er the fifty percent the er m ps fifty percent of the votes for er the parliamentary leader which of course is very consistent with right fifty percent of the vote you take that along with proportional representation and what i believe you're seeing is the number of people who have given up the ghost and are preparing to UNK the party around UNK politics and that's where they're heading and they're heading completely in the wrong direction because we're more in tune with what's going on in this country the po opinion polls are saying fifty nine percent of the people actually i think believe that er the labour government is possible and will be voting for a labour government the alternative road is to UNK and it's not about UNK the people who're proposing this UNK politics aren't UNK they're victorian politics that's what they're about they're about taking us back before we created the party before we learnt the lesson that we needed to represent ourselves politically they're going back to let's UNK see what we get out of the liberals the free trade liberals in the nineteenth century that's where they're going back that's not about UNK real UNK is about making sure that the labour party speaks for the working people up and down this country and that's our contribution to make to that party and therefore we should have a role in decision making and influencing the party that enables us as an organization to express that feeling and that understanding of what people actually want in this country and that's why we're supporting the c e c proposals
now there's an there's an alternative being put forward as a compromise but a compromise isn't a compromise the compromise as it looks er involving us and we're all party members as already indicated as individuals and saying top up let's top up we're already paying aren't we the political levy let's pay a bit more right is actually one that reduces our input as an organization
now i supported UNK i must say i voted for him for the er for deputy leader right but i think he's wrong right on this particular issue this compromise that he's floating and i think it should be dropped
i think we should be going with the c e c proposals and we should maintain our influence and our role in the party as a collective organization a mass organization of over eight hundred thousand members and will be UNK rising in the UNK future
i support on behalf of lancashire region
thanks duncan
yorkshire region
president congress
dave yorkshire and north derbyshire region speaking in support of the c e c sta statement
colleagues one hundred years ago in bradford trade unionists and UNK got together to form the independent labour party which was the UNK of the labour party as we know it today
in those days although there were some independent groups of UNK and others of no UNK the two main parties in parliament were the UNK and the tories
very few mps were interested in the wor working people's demand
trade unionists knew that they could only achieve a limited level of their ambitions through industrial means and they realized that they needed working class mps to support them in parliament
they knew that they needed to form a political party that have three main aims the need for working class m ps the need for an independent party to represent working people the need for a to UNK new socialist ideals
the party was formed for those reasons
since then by working together we have achieved many of our aims
unfortunately most of them bo achievements are now under threat
old age pensions compensation for accidents and injuries at work free education for all children the national health service legislation regarding unfair dismissal and the nationwide public transport
after fourteen years of tory rule all these and many other achievements are seriously threatened
we have already experienced the abolition of free eye and dental checks we are suffering from the creeping privatization of the health service the selling off of our water our UNK schools and yet we have to concentrate on the issue of trade union labour party links
trade unionists did not lose labour the last election
quite the opposite
once again the trade unions working individually and through the trade unions for labour pulled out all the stops to try and secure a labour victory
i am not convinced that this issue should be on the political agenda at all not at this time not at any time in fact i am pretty convinced that this is a tory agenda a media agenda why they do they not want to talk about UNK and UNK that support them that donate thousands of pounds into their UNK
they want to set our agenda
they want to create a division in our ranks
it is the oldest trick in the book divide and UNK
we accept UNK we understand that the card or the block vote is one of the most misunderstood aspects of labour party procedure
it is criticized by the tories and the media and of course they never explain how it works so it is not surprising that the general public is suspicious of it
the g m b is a progressive union we can support constructive change but we cannot support any changes that will UNK ourselves from our party
remember the labour party was formed for working people because we had an UNK tory government
all the top jobs were taken by people from privileged UNK
there was an enormous gap between the rich and the poor nothing has changed
interestingly enough UNK the general secretary of the labour party said at last year's labour party conference that if it had not been for the UNK steady influence of the unions during the eighties when the party was UNK itself in two we would not have a labour party today
a recent g m b poll showed that sixty nine percent of people thought the unions should support labour to balance big UNK big business and what a major balancing act that is
the shipping and construction group p o gave a hundred thousand pounds to the tory election fund
public relations company UNK gave the same
defence contractors rolls UNK gave sixty thousand pounds while united newspapers owners of the express and the star UNK their donation last year
these people have the UNK to question our links our legitimate links with our party
colleagues we must ensure that the links are UNK and not UNK
too many people the old the young and the unemployed working people in all UNK do not maintain our bond
remember why the labour party was formed remember who formed it nothing has changed
thank you

rose birmingham region and i make it very clear on the UNK that our region is having a free vote on this because we haven't had the opportunity to discuss the document and therefore what i'm saying is purely my own views
the statement before us on the labour party and the trade union links sets aside various recommendations on how we are going to cast our block vote at this year's labour party conference on this issue the options open to us are listed in this paper and i'd like to make the following observations
we as a trade union have been in the forefront of campaigning and supporting the labour party not just as in its election battle but in attempting to UNK the party's thinking the party administration be it on the issue of UNK for women on policy making on finances and on the block vote
the g m b should be proud of this role however politics and negotiations are all about compromise and not about head on UNK and we try and avoid these as much as possible
therefore i believe we can still arrive at a compromise on the options in the statement
let's look at the recommendation of the c e c on the selection of parliamentary candidates
they suggest we support a UNK electoral college for the next round of selection every transition towards the use of the register of labour supporters for subsequent selection
i think we should say here and now that we support option one b registered supporters as a compromise
i say this because i believe that those constitutional issues have to be decided once and for all at this year's party conference
we shouldn't adopt stands that we try this now and try something else next time round which i believe is what the c e c is recommending
turning now to the c e c recommendation on the election of the labour party leader and deputy leader
i support the recommendation of five b but the vote by trade unions and socialist societies should be a ballot of registered labour supporters
president congress the introduction in the c e c statement is a UNK one and part of it states and i quote the g m b and others have UNK that reform means UNK and UNK the links by giving direct votes to individual union members
we as activists hold very special the important role trade unions have played in the labour party and feel that we have a continued role to play
however in the need to arrive at a compromise and not to have full blown UNK a register of labour supporters is the answer
at least that way i shall feel more confident that it's labour party members and supporters who are selecting candidates and UNK the leader and deputy leader of the labour party and not a liberal or tory trade unionist who happens to be paying the political levy
thanks very much indeed rose
i am now gonna call the general secretary to respond briefly to the debate colleagues
well colleagues there are couple of points that were raised that i think need a response
the last was UNK comment about the register
yeah well the trouble with the register was that er when it was put forward and it was put forward by tom UNK and tom UNK of er and they worked very hard no one harder than tom UNK to try to establish this possibility as a compromise to avoid the sort of conflicts that we're talking about at the moment
it wasn't our best position but the supporters of o m o v wouldn't listen wouldn't consider and you've heard UNK record of those sad events and of course then we were told that the party leader says it would be UNK impossible to put the register in place this year in any event
so that's why we went back to the UNK electoral college
ed i think argued a very strong case for a greater level of influence of trade unionists in the party than is suggested in this reform and i can see the force of those remarks but the c e c adopted the position that we did not want to take a position of dominance to the party conference
we wanted levy payers to have a say but a say within the broad sweep of labour party opinions
we deliberately went for a position of responsibility and UNK in this argument where if i may say so some other people haven't put the same constraints on themselves
two further points dave expressed it best i think
the supporters of o m o v have put their arguments in what can only be said to be a ham UNK and UNK way
they may have been intending to talk about reform of the labour party constitution but what ordinary trade unionists heard was senior members of the party talking as if they were ashamed of the trade union connection
that was what came through and that's what we all UNK
people are gonna have to work very hard to repair that damage
secondly and a slightly personal comment one front UNK was asked er about my comments in opposition to o m o v and in favour of trade union participation and he said john UNK is expressing his views they are not the views of g m b members
well are you listening gordon now you know
so colleagues support the report support composite twenty nine support the motion because never forget it's our party too
thank you colleagues
colleagues we'll take the vote now
all the in favour of the c e c statement would you please indicate
against
that's carried
all those in favour of composite twenty nine
against
that's carried
all those in favour of motion three nine six
against
that's carried
thanks very much indeed colleagues and can i congratulate congress for that particular debate
there is no other organization within the movement that could provide such a level of debate on this particular matter
thank you very much and congratulations colleagues
we now turn to four motions in respect of the labour party motion three nine four three nine motion four o two and motion four o three
so n can i now call motion three nine four representation at labour and t u c conferences g m b scotland to move
would the other speakers please come down to the front
president comrades er ian g m b scotland moving motion three nine four
er president i'm going to say the time factor and i'll try to be as brief as possible
when apologize
colleague just one second i do apologize for cutting in but colleagues if you're if it's your intention to leave congress for a few moments please do it as quietly as possible
colleague
er thanks president
er let me apologize if the motion appears a little vague
what is being asked is this
when elected delegate for region to the t u c in the labour party conferences is not enough
the representation at labour and t u c conferences does not reflect a lay representative organization which we are supposed to be
i was a constituency delegate till last year's labour party conference and i was absolutely astonished to see so many people from head office floating around the conference floor
national officers national secretaries research officers other personnel from head office were a large part of the delegation not always around when important votes were being taken
president having UNK in seats has never been more important well attended conferences
to ensure a wider democratic representation at conferences urge the c e c to look seriously at the situation and report back next year
i move
motion three nine four seconded
is it seconded formally seconded
thanks very much
motion three nine
labour local authorities london region to move
john london region moving motion three nine labour local authorities
the debate we've just had on labour party links raises questions er we believe about our attitude our attitude the union's attitude to the party the labour party when it does hold power which of course it does er locally in some areas of this country
this motion is about labour party accountability to our own union members and not about our accountability to a handful of m ps so whatever the result of the er particular er labour party links debate we've just had it's still important to consider the practical er effects of the link we have with the labour party locally
i'm happy to see that the attitude of the c e c and of the general secretary has changed UNK i would say since last year when it and they opposed the liverpool motion which also called for accountability of labour councillors and m ps
and it's now the c e c is now and the general secretary is now rightly so calling UNK for proper accountability from all levels er of the party organization
whether we get it or UNK another matter
this motion seeks at least to obtain some of that accountability
liverpool city council last year sacked hundreds of g m b members
industrial UNK as we heard yesterday from ian have decided they were wrongly dismissed and that indicates the standard of the union locally but UNK the question of why it was impossible for our officials from the general secretary downwards to effect any influence whatsoever on the attitude of liverpool city council
the same question that lack of influence on labour authorities who are behaving like the worst tory employers has to be posed in relation to a number of situations throughout the country
for example and the general secretary was giving examples yesterday so i'm entitled to do one as well for example UNK council where a direct labour organization that had successfully survived and grown through the worst of the thatcher years and the worst of the thatcher attack on public services has now fallen victim to a combination of a weak and UNK labour council and an incompetent senior management
hundreds of workers have been sacked the UNK and deputy UNK while millions of pounds went out to private contractors
now there's nothing new for people who work for labour authorities and local authorities in general in that story new at all
what's different about it is that we possess the g m b london region possess UNK statements from managers and ex chief officers that UNK demonstrate that what the trade union has been saying all along what the g m b's been saying all along about UNK financial UNK and UNK have in ta in fact taken place
that's what those UNK statements say
even with this kind of evidence even with that kind of evidence almost UNK good evidence in my experience the council leadership which is in has been in possession of it for the best part of a month has made no move to UNK any chief officer on charges of gross UNK which of course if it had been any of our members accused of something like that they'd have been down the road instantly nor has it UNK any worker wrongly sacked
so it'll be another liverpool
industrial UNK may make that decision but the UNK council certainly isn't going to
furthermore jack UNK terry the secretary of the greater london labour party have also been in possession of this evidence and before and after receiving that evidence have apparently completely failed over a period of eight months to get UNK labour council to behave in a responsible fashion just like liverpool and i'm sure just like a number of other labour councils
the question for us whatever the situation about labour party links is how long we can continue to argue for our members to support the labour party locally and nationally to pay the political levy to a party that treats this union and treats union members with utter and absolute UNK
whatever the form of the link that is chosen at labour party conference that ought to be top of our agenda
what is the party gonna do for us not what are we gonna do for the party
i move
seconder for three nine
thanks very much
call the mover of motion four o two
labour party subscription contributions
midland region
midland east coast region
president congress
labour party contribution subscriptions
congress as a strong labour party supporter and member for many years and my father before me i've always believed it to be the working man's party created and born from the sweat and blood of our UNK and throughout many years supported and financed by the unions with our subscriptions and the political levy and i see it's supported by the trade unions
that does not mean that the labour party are run or ruled by the trade unions
we do have and will maintain the links and influence within the labour party or it would not even survive without us
us meaning we meaning our members who voted to pay the political levy
us meaning we our members paying the eighteen pound to join the labour party
us meaning we our member attending a local party c l ps labour groups etcetera
us our members campaigning to secure councillors mps getting elected
without any of us there would be no labour party
a party without influence a party with opposition to even talk about
we must not let them forget where the party came from
to encourage recruitment is not to price out existing members not to prevent a possible mass membership and although we encourage our members to join we encourage family and friends also
when we're given the price tag eighteen pounds that's a different matter
so this congress must pursue on our behalf a serious approach to the labour party to reduce the price tag
how do we encourage membership when you openly deny them the right to vote
how can you survive without the political levy
how you can survive without those trade union subscriptions
the labour party is a party of the working class people
who are the people who do the campaigning the UNK in every election in every national election
we the union are the back up system as been said by previous speakers
i say to john smith neil UNK gordon brown and the rest the ones who put signature to paper on one member one vote remember all the elections in the past remember sheffield
where does it come from all the costs of those campaigns
whom does it come from
you want my money you want my support you want me to campaign for the future you want me to recruit then to get all of this reduce the cost of the subscriptions thus encouraging mass trade union membership
do not encourage people to stop paying the political levy that is damaging itself
do not by taking away their right to vote or participate in their policies and UNK you need the back up teams of the trade unions in all its elections
you need the finances of the UNK and the subscriptions
to survive price it right re look at the priorities
you are damaging the labour party you are UNK any opposition to this present government you're UNK the future survival of the labour party
i have pleasure in moving motion four o two
john midland and east coast region
president congress
increasing the contribution rate is not the answer to gaining mass membership to the party
with party membership on the decline could one of the reasons for this be because of the cost
i haven't the answer to what an acceptable level of membership fee is but i'm certain an ever increasing rate will never generate a party of mass membership
the party is dependent upon its activists no more so than at elections
can we afford for the activists to be priced out of the party
we all are aware that funds have to be generated but it causes a lot of membership
that other means of raising revenue will have to be looked for i second
motion four o three midland to move
john midland and east coast region
president congress
does the labour party recognize its members of UNK
the answer is no
there is no automatic award given to its
a UNK in my local labour party branch joined the party more than sixty two years ago
we wanted to give him a gift to mark his membership
it was agreed that the secretary of the party would ask the party to inform us of any awards UNK etcetera that could be presented to recognize his length of membership
now it's started to get confused
a letter that relating to awards was received from the party
it stated there is no reason why your long serving member should not be nominated for a merit award
unfortunately we do not have any reason merit awards as such
with a reply like that it would have been a waste of time and effort to pursue the issue
we had to change direction
john UNK mp for hull east was approached
john did the business for us
at a ceremony he presented a signed certificate recognizing the contribution and support to the party the member had given
i don't believe that anyone joins the party thinking that one day they will receive some token or award
most of us would be happy with a membership card
i move
ken midland and east coast region
president congress
seconding motion four o three
congress this simply calls for the labour party like the g m b and its experience yesterday in UNK like the gold badge to show and acknowledge long serving members with award of some sort of recognition
you can imagine the response a member would feel actually receiving such a gesture
ask peggy ask eric we saw it we heard it
how they felt yesterday receiving the gold the gold badge
the length of service is on record at UNK road and it would not be of a great cost if you look at retaining membership who are real UNK of the party
i don't like it when people take monies from people and forget or pretend that we are the UNK people
just a thank you or the bill for next year's contribution
many of us put hours of our spare time attending labour party meetings UNK city party labour groups and many more fringe meetings all outside our normal days of work
those of us who are fortunate to be in work
so in recognition of loyal service and commitment an award would not come UNK
i second motion
thank you
colleagues the c e c are recommending acceptance and er certainly in respect of several and reference on one motion and i call robert to put their view
thanks president
robert g m b scotland speaking on behalf of the c e c UNK to motions three nine four three nine and four o two and four o three
on three nine four er the c e c is seeking reference back er three nine four deals with g m b UNK to labour party and t u c
as the speaker indicated er the c e c will not declare exactly what the intentions of the motions were but it's now er now it's clear from the remarks of the speaker
the motion seeks to limit the number of full time officials in favour of the members
the proportion of full time officials er is already ro already low for example at last year's labour party conference of seventy four delegates sixty three were either c e c delegates or lay members elected from the regions
the remaining er eleven erm on the delegation were made up of general secretary deputy general secretary elected national officers and a few senior staff
these people were needed to give advice on policy and industrial matters
the c e c has no difficulty with the principle to restrict numbers of full time officials er that are required however erm i think we also want to take into account er the developments that are referred to in the motion with respect of the labour party and if these developments take place we will obviously have to examine that before we come to any decision on the matter
er motion three nine
the c e c support with er this qualification
er accountability of local representatives is obviously supported but we should not limit that demand only to g m b er councillors or councillors who have g m b connections
it is the view of the c e c that all labour councillors and all labour councils should be demanded to consult on reorganization redundancy and UNK and improving of services and i know that the national section secretary
mick is already UNK a list of g m b councillors which will no doubt help in trying to er ensure that particular motion meets its objectives in the coming year
motion four o two the c e c accepts the basic aim of four o two that is of increasing labour party membership
er i would ask delegates to bear in mind that trade union members can already join er on the youth rates er obviously an extension of that scheme would be welcome and is welcomed by the c e c
however and it is a view of the c e c that although the current level of contributions is high it is not the only barrier to mass membership i don't intend to go into a list of other reasons why some people choose not to join the labour party but i'm quite sure that many delegates here can give some examples at a local level
also some political levy paying members may not join as individuals although they remain UNK supporters of labour and come out and work and vote for labour at both national and local elections
it's already been said this morning they are entitled to a voice and therefore we need to retain er a separate trade union membership
on motion four o three the c e c supports obviously supports awards for long serving labour party members
these already exist as obviously the speakers to the motion is are aware they already exist at a national level erm if we support this motion obviously what we're talking about here is introducing er awards at local or regional level
to summarize er delegates the c e c therefore is asking referral on motion three nine four support with UNK with the qualifications already mentioned for motions three nine four o two and four o three
thank you very much
thanks very much robert
colleagues motion three nine four reference is being sought with the g m b scotland agree thanks very much
conference agree thanks very much
motion three nine is being accepted all those in favour
against
that's carried
motion four o two we're asking for your support all those in favour
against
that's carried
mo motion four o three being recommended to accept all those in favour
against
that's carried
colleagues it's about by my watch which is probably wrong anyway but however it's the one we're working to about twenty six minutes past twelve
now what i'd like to do i mean it's only sun shining out there so you'd only be wasting your time anyway i'd like to consult you about moving on and getting in the next four motions on union organization
i think with your assistance we could probably get through it in about fifteen twenty minutes
it would help us er in terms of the end of the week
would you agree to that
thanks very much indeed colleagues
so there's motions one seven five one seven six one seven and one seven eight in this particular section
frank will be asked to respond on behalf of the c e c because there are various different UNK the c e c are taking on these particular motions
so i now call motion one seven five southern region to move again colleagues it would be helpful if UNK and UNK would come down to the front
pauline UNK apex five southern region
members the retention of membership is a very UNK problem
when you're recruiting it's a bit like UNK
when you first have eye to eye contact everything is new splendid you want to do the very best for each other you want to look your best you want to tell them all the good things and eventually you get married
and once you're married a little bit of UNK in and your membership is not quite so well served but what you've got to remember is that whilst you're busy losing interest somebody else is always interested in your partner or your member so when i'll UNK that i'll UNK that
your party your other never mind and when that happens you get UNK and i've always said if you treat your membership properly they'll stay with you but you've also got to remember that the union is in dire financial UNK or so it tells us
but if you UNK your officers to the bone if you cut them any longer you will not get a decent service from them you will just have people in boxes with UNK firmly placed on them and then where will the union be
if you don't give a man or a woman time to do a single job properly then it's not worth doing
it's no use doing a little bit of this and a little bit of that and getting absolutely nowhere because you'll get the two finger job
go away we'll go somewhere else where we can be looked after properly
so all the while you're retaining members it's great don't get UNK
john don't screw your officers down into a box because you're stretching them further and further
i know you've got financial problems who hasn't just remember you've got to speculate to accumulate
i move
ann southern region seconding motion one seven five
president congress
the retention of members should be high on our priority list
it is obviously important to get people to join the g m b and it's just as important to keep them as members once they have joined
in the southern region we have introduced a retention system which is producing positive results as you will see in our regional report
with the way jobs are going it's harder to keep members as they move from job to job
our members need to know that the services and benefits that the union provide are available to them regardless of where they work
the members are the UNK of this union and we cannot afford to lose any more
by making our benefits and services as attractive as possible it will encourage our members to stay with the g m b regardless of where they work
also we could recruit new members in other workplaces who will be aware of what the g m b provides
colleagues we must not forget the low paid and the part time workers the majority of whom are women
to these people we not only have to offer an attractive package but to be more visible especially during these UNK times
president congress once again working people face another political attack
it is more important than ever to develop methods and policies to retain members
congress i urge you to support this motion
ken midlands and east coast region moving motion one seven six branch administration officers
conference we are all well aware of the terrific financial burden that this union has been under over the last few years
with that burden around us we have seen a reduction in the number of full time officers being appointed by the union and which in turn has without any doubt had a detrimental effect upon the members who we serve
it is for that very reason that i am moving this motion today as it gives us the opportunity to implement the rules of the union and at the same time would enable us to put into position people who would be able to do all those things that are necessary to achieve what we require recruitment organization paperwork back up service to full time officials
that back up service would also allow our full time officers to concentrate on the recruitment and servicing of our members which must and must only be and remain our highest priority
as time goes on our membership and our finances will decide when we can take on full time officials
this motion also creates an opportunity for the union our union the members' union to encourage young members and branch activists to take on the role of branch administration officers within the regions we represent here today and gain experience in an area of trade union work that they thought might never have existed
conference i believe that this existing rule nineteen gives the g m b an opportunity to expand into branch administration officers across all the regions and use them to do any job that is needed and expected by the members
conference i believe that we can succeed if you are prepared to support this motion and i will leave you with this point
the only way forward for this great union is for all of us to recruit new members so all of us must take this responsibility seriously
branch administration officers are as i i've already said we'll be able to recruit and support full time officials
conference i want to help that and solve that position
i hope we all want to help together as a team and support our already stretched full time officials
rule nineteen gives us that opportunity
so congress please don't let's waste the opportunity before us today
i therefore ask for your support
thank you i move
linda midland and east coast region seconding motion one seven six branch administration officers
president congress
the mover has covered the motion extensively but i'd like to add a couple of more points
we are not UNK this position out of the air it's already there
in these difficult times it makes sense to look again at this post
it's self financing
we could promote computer training for the d a os enabling a move to computer as branch records making branch administration efficient and UNK
very importantly just maybe these prospective highly motivated branch admin officers would inject new life into non active branches and from a personal point of view i would see this as an opportunity to gain experience which would encourage them to apply for regional UNK jobs when they come available and don't we need more women officers
please support
motion one seven london
president
president congress
keith london region moving motion one seven
congress i understand the c e c are accepting this resolution for the qualifications so i will be brief
past practice will to use such private although they should have now by now all but disappeared
if we are to retain a level of even UNK when dealing with employers ourselves we should at least make sure our own house is in order
if jobs or vacancies exist our people g m b people should fill those vacancies
we have enough unemployed activists who with a little training could cover those vacancies
congress i move
would the seconder for one seven formally seconded thank you very much
one seven eight liverpool region to move
formally moved is it formally seconded
is it formally carried
oh we can't we referred in it
oh sorry about that frank
i do everything possible to help regional secretaries
thank you president
frank UNK on behalf of the c e c to one seven five one seven six one seven and one seven eight
congress the c e c is asking you to support one seven five
we seek withdrawal of motion one seven six in favour of one seven eight we ask you to accept motion one seven where the certain qualifications and we seek referral of motion one seven eight
colleagues motion one seven five is in line with the union's general approach therefore the c e c has accepted this motion
the c e c seeks withdrawal of one seven six
in nineteen eighty four the c e c and this congress favoured moving away from full time officers to labour and secretaries and indeed we have implemented that policy
even you at later conferences have protected those people when we have adjusted branch commission and we feel it would be a UNK step to try and go back and turn those years away
bearing those points in mind one seven eight offers a better way forward to use the skills and experience of our lay officials and members
motion one seven of course we accept in principle that where we have vacancies permanent vacancies we should employ direct staff and if possible our members which we do try to do
however we do have some occasional vacancies maternity leave building maintenance work long term sick where we have to make sure our labour force is protected where we do involve temporary labour and even on those occasions we attempt to employ people direct as some regions know
so on that basis we then accept that motion with those reservations
the contents of motion one seven eight appear to be sound conference we have been tried and we have been tried by some regions in a very limited way with some success
however the c e c feels it needs to consult with regions it needs more closely to examine the point in question and we would ask for reference of that resolution
i move
thanks frank
thank you president
er congress
i hear what the c e c are saying and yes i'm concerned about the union's finances
but the UNK provision identifies branch administration officers which i called for in the motion
why do we continue to identify positions in our union rules if we're not gonna use them and another point is the if rule nineteen was part of an employer's agreement we would be first to challenge that agreement and ask why it was not implemented
i've been trained on union education courses the same as you people have out there today this union spends a UNK tremendous amount of money on training shop stewards to challenge such agreements
so congress i wish to challenge it
thank you
okay ken thank you
colleagues motion one seven five is being accepted i put it to the vote all those in favour
against
that's carried
and you've heard from ken in respect of one seven six he's not prepared to withdraw so therefore the c e c are recommending opposition
all those in favour of the motion
against
that's lost
motion one seven is being accepted all those in favour
against
that's carried
motion one seven eight reference is being sought and i understand that liverpool have agreed
conference agree thanks very much indeed
colleagues just before we adjourn for lunch could i ask you to try and take the opportunity to visit the labour party and trade unions for labour stand where there is a live link to the national membership system

he was a bell UNK for years
my father was
and my great grandfather he was a UNK

yes
i went to school in till i was fourteen
did you enjoy school

how long did that take you
the training
it took two years
because i took midwifery and i took a little bit of erm school nursing and general you know so that i was capable take a district on anglesey
i wanted to be on anglesey because my son was at school by then you see in
he was only four and a half when his father died
after your training did you come straight back to anglesey
yes i came to back to UNK to rhos y bol
well i did a little a bit round er like UNK not UNK
UNK and that area
because my superintendent from anglesey she was superintendent from as well you see
and then she was short of a nursing there and then i went there for a bit
there was a gap in anglesey
what was it like in rhos y bol
er quiet
people were very kind
very kind indeed
they'd share anything with you
and erm er they relied on you they depended on you
always worrying you if there was something for the least
i think really they wanted just to get to the house something to talk about those days you see
the men were kind very kind
UNK let me wheel my bike or carry my bag
if they were about
there wasn't UNK people anywhere than rhos y bol
the er the older generation
they're going now you see
was it a lot smaller then
lot smaller then
oh yes they've built oh dear they've built houses and houses i don't know rhos y bol today
although i only live three miles away you see
and i left rhos y bol when i retired because i felt i they'd have to have another nurse there and you see the other nurse would never be able to enjoy the they would always be running to me a and it wouldn't be fair to another nurse
erm they wouldn't she'd be alright for the first time you see but they would get tired and then they'd be they'd be on to me
i mean it wouldn't be fair to anybody to start UNK there
so i left and came here
i bought this plot of land and built this bungalow on it
how big an area did you have when you in rhos y bol
it was quite four and half miles round the area you see
five miles in some places
you see the area and i did on a bicycle you know
not like today
you went twice a day in those days to the mothers and babies
and you visit them for there was one time we visit them for fourteen day daily but i don't think they do it now
and then it UNK com cut down to ten days
but by the time you see i had the st david's hospital opened by then in bangor
see when i came to rhos y bol in nineteen thirty three there was no st david's hospital then all the babies were born at home
and er there was only the UNK at that they could go
and i oh i fought hard i never wanted a baby to be born in the UNK house cos the word UNK to me in the old it was a terrible name
and i wouldn't like a child of mine and i managed just two i had to send to the UNK and a mother and baby died there it was a bad case you see
and the other little boy was born there but i used to visit him i see him on the district and it always came back to me fancy UNK the only one shouldn't mention name really
was born in you know
it's a great thing to keep them from and to me in those days
cos i used to remember w er liverpool erm i can't think something hill in UNK hill UNK
oh everybody UNK going there
things have changed things have improved you see
what did anglesey people think about the UNK
well in those days everybody was afraid and erm oh it was a blow if anybody had to go to the valley
valley was the name those days
oh dear it was worse than i c anything i can think of
but today you see the valley hospital is lovely
it's a different view altogether
i've been there and i find how happy people are there
it's really a treat to go there and see how things have changed isn't it
people are so kind today
did you use a bike all the time you were at rhos y bol
i used the bicycle from nineteen thirty five until nineteen fifty
and i tried to save up for a car cos my son was in the army
yeah he was taken to the army from the grammar school in holyhead and i did want a car when he came home
i thought i'd like him to think that i'd improved a little bit
and erm managed to buy a car and i paid four hundred and ten for it
just think of it
what sort of car was it
it was a lovely little standard
and then i m i exchanged in twelve months cos i was lucky i had put my name in two places to get a car
you couldn't get in those days d during the war you see
and erm i managed to get one twelve months after and that was an austin ten
that was a great car we thought you see
the austin ten and i had that when my son came home from the army
so he taught me to drive see and it was much easier then you see with a car
then th they added to my district then again
the rhos y bol practically finished
cos you went to some much bigger area you see
so i did a little bit of here and there in rhos y bol UNK different places after retired really for a couple of years
how many districts were there
well when i started i'm sure there was about twenty
and we see we'd only have these small areas see
see there'd be UNK rhos y bol well now it's one area see the lot of it
and then there's UNK bridge and nearly one there's UNK bridge was one was one
then the area that's right there's three or four areas that way again you see
what was your most common sort of problem
common problem
getting about i think
see the weather you see was bad if you had it bad but i kept well in health considering you know
and you know people were very good
see people didn't have cars and if it was now they could only help me by bringing a horse to meet me or erm or a tractor if they half way
and then perhaps we could then perhaps they could somebody would shovel the snow and it was very hard in the winter you know some places
perhaps you could c come from you see but you wouldn't be able to come near UNK or you could get to UNK and you couldn't get to
they were h hard times you know
and there were no telephones you see when i first came
didn't get a telephone till nineteen well i couldn't tell you really
i was years without a telephone in rhos y bol
how did people get in touch with you
well they had to fetch me
they had to come see
in their own way
with a bike mostly then i'd go with them on the bike see
but the t we did have a telephone to the post office when it first came
and then people were making use of that
but the post office people didn't like it again
they had to come give me my messages you see
people left messages but that wasn't right again
so they didn't like telephones
then er the county then had to give us telephones
but really it was it years without
what was the UNK case you had to treat
was it usually just UNK
well it was erm i don't think i can remember
bleeding you know what do you call
what do you call it now
it was the babies you see that they were well you had to have the doctor to you
i only had to call mr once
to a case
and he was the superintendent of angle started you see st david's hospital
and he came once to me on the district to me i don't know he went to others
and called him
it was a case of right in the face
post UNK
and anyway he'd survived
and we took the mother to bangor next day in the ambulance
oh it was a terrible place to get the ambulance into
it was in the fields outside in the UNK there
and people just come here
and there was an old lady there and she fell down and broke her arm we had a terrible night of it
but she survived and she lived and brought her children and they left to be in england again
they were english people
what was your most unusual case
unusual case
oh what shall i tell you now
well i've had cases in the bus you know
babies in the bus has been born
i've had them born in the car on the way the mother have come to see me the father has brought her to see me thinking that if she could just see me she'd be alright
but anyway the baby's been born in the car before he got home
yeah
it's a scream isn't it
they're happy days you know
happy days and the money was small but still don't worry
did that did that get better as time went on
oh yes
yes
yes when it first came it was only two pound a week
and i had to pay my rooms out of that
five shillings
out of that you see and my insurance and all that isn't it
and it wasn't a lot you see
but erm i was lucky mind
people were comfortable and i could always go and get something i wanted
and pe people were very g farmers those days
they were farmers those days they were you know people with feeling
you see today it's the men servants of the old farms that are farmers today
see the old farmers they were very generous
what they had was yours
potatoes car any anything they had butter and milk you never came from a farm in the old days without something in your hand
when you were the district nurse
and the minister used to get the same
the minister was well looked after those days to
we were the we were the poor ones weren't we
when did that change
was there a sort of point when it all changed
yes well it changed see when the war came
when the er when the war came this last war it would be wouldn't it
erm and people had been paying insurance i it changed then cos some of the farmers could go on their pension they'd been paying this new scheme you see
and then the younger generation took the farms on
that's when it changed
the farming changed all together
and our money was better by then
i think i was getting nearly five pound a week by then
well er today see it's my pension is three times as that
more
when you think
so i was paying my UNK you see
i always paid that it's a good thing i've done it you know
otherwise you see that helps on my pension today
in one way it's a great help
but i suppose if i hadn't got anything i'd get it from somewhere
i find those that haven't got anything are just as well off today
did you have a union
well i suppose you would call it a union wouldn't you
erm the UNK the midwife had erm now what did you call it
it was like a union for the UNK you see
er the nurses had but we didn't we more district UNK on the district you see
the things changed and after that
when you first arrived at rhos y bol were you taking over from another nurse
pardon
did you take over from another nurse
at rhos y bol or were you the first there
yes i did yes
the nurse had just got married
the district was only twelve months old
she'd only been there twelve months
did you find it hard to get accepted
pardon
did you find it hard to get accepted
no i didn't
they were ve no they were very good they were
they were pleased to have a nurse you see cos they hadn't had a nurse
the f the nurse before me was the first one
only they didn't know how to treat a nurse
er it was all new to them you see
they thought seemed to think you were on duty morning noon and night
UNK come to the door any all time you see
but it didn't matter as long as you could help isn't it
you got used to it
get bad UNK sometimes but then
were there any UNK around
did people still use folk UNK
no i don't think so
and i don't think so really
can't remember anything like that
what was anglesey like during the war
did the war affect
oh yes it did
cos we had UNK here you see er during the war
there was plenty to eat here you know
you see they came from liverpool a lot of them
but they used to get very lonely
when they came that was the trouble
but they used to i had my house packed to the wall
friends from liverpool i opened my house to
they would come see perhaps for two or three weekends you know
then UNK go back to liverpool
when it starts in liverpool again they'd come back again
i le let my an open house to my friends from liverpool
friends that had been kind to me
then they got very in er after two years after the was had started erm south of england got it badly you see
so my in laws were south of england people and i opened my house to them
they came for the first lot for nine months then they went back
they came back again they were here nearly two years
my in laws
from UNK that was you see
so i was i had my house full all through the war
did the UNK mean a lot more work
well i didn't work i opened the house for them and they looked after themselves
i never fed them or they were to look after themselves
there was a bed for them you see
and a room to eat
and er liverpool people were very good very kind they always had a meal for me things if they could
and i used to get vegetables you see in from the farmers
and very often if anybody was killing a pig or anything i'd always get a piece of erm pork something like that
not the people were very kind in rhos y bol
the old rhos y bol people
did that change after the war
changed after the war yes
it was the new lots growing up then you see
they've been brought up different way haven't they
more
you see there was milk cheap and different things after the war for them you see
to babies had this dried milk and some of them got it cheap and i suppose there was no work and then they were poor weren't they
they used to pay me fifteen shillings a week
if i had my case at home without a doctor
and they thought that fifteen pound was an awful lot of money
but if they had a doctor you see they'd have to pay a pound
so i used to try and manage
and i did too managed very well
considering
were most of your patients welsh
all welsh those days
after the t after the war you see
but when the war came you see they came as UNK a lot of them and then they never went back
and it got on from that you see
and then er people left the towns and their relations
i suppose rhos y bol is all english today
i don't know who lives there
see all those houses they built
in your time as a district nurse what were the greatest changes you noticed
see it's the war that changed everything didn't it
the war changed everything
and then went
and then the land you see they worked more on the land didn't they
the men did farming took er more men didn't it
and then the camps you see during the war you see people were out of work during the war e before the war in rhos y bol
be sitting on the wall by my a lot of the men
but you see the camp when the war came opened somewhere in er near valley and everybody got a job
and a lot of them went away after
w so er things changed completely didn't it
everything changed after
what about on the medical side
oh the medical side was wonderful
we've had wonderful doctors in UNK
sir thomas oh he was a UNK
he was a dear father and he had two sons doctors
marvellous sons he had again
and then dr he was a UNK and he was a born in and i knew h my family and his family knew one another
and you know i UNK dr he was a wonderful man
he was kind didn't say much and worked hard
he died young in about sixty
a man that understood the people
we were very fortunate and we're still fortunate
we've got lovely young doctors here now
a dr from he was sir UNK son you know lovely
so kind you know nothing was too much for him
is there still a district nurse as such
pardon
is there still a district nurse as such
or is it now just er surgeries
oh no they have district nurses now
cos dr offered me the other day a nurse to do my leg
we're awfully fortunate here
you've got a team of young doctors again to see me
i think they're marvellous
we're most fortunate i think
i think the young people today they're very kind you know
it's only an odd one i think
but mind you people can be awkward too can't they
erm it isn't the doctors you see that are awkward
but people can be very awkward
i only found about one say a couple of awkward people all the twenty years i was in rhos y bol
but they were the same family the same people all through the years
the awkward ones
why were they awkward
just for the sake of being awkward
i don't know they demanded more you see
er they wouldn't look for you when you were there but if you'd gone out somewhere oh they'd be looking for you
they wanted to cause trouble
for there were always something you see with them
er only one or two of them
and i think they're still there in rhos y bol
i don't think they'll get rid of them
they'll grow up and a little UNK come from somewhere over there
mm
nothing gives me more pleasure now and if i go to the to the libraries and a young lad i say a young man like you will come to me and say hello nurse how are you
i's very well UNK
how are you
he said you remember me don't you
well not quite i said
but oh yes
and er you know it's lovely really to see them and to think they remember you still isn't it
mm
i used to shout at them you know
mm
my son used to don't shout at them mother he said
well i said they are naughty
they were running round my house they were
so this night my son said to me mother he said when those boys have grown up men do you know what they'll be saying
i said no
they'll be saying do you remember a big fat woman living in that their house with a white apron running after us
they'll remember you like that you know he said
it don't worry me how they remember me
mm
do you still stay in touch with the other district nurses
oh yes but there's very few of them you'd be su i'm eighty four you see
and erm you see most of them have k very few of them
i nurse hers was lovely to work with
and nurse williams into the clinic to see her they're much younger than me you see
and they're lovely young people they were to work with really
it's only those two now i think
because you know a lot of that had died you know
they were a lovely little nurse we had in me and nurse williams from
she was very
without picking serious note of freud it's a bit like you know discussing space high on UNK without mentioning UNK i mean you know th that's wh what people seem to do and it strikes me as ridiculous
er but you know freud discovered so much about consciousness and UNK that erm you ignore it strikes me as just silly
well i think a lot of what happens in the academic world is and my guess is the fundamental reason they get away with it is that young people won't buy much spending their own money on it and i think if they were you couldn't serve up a lot of the crap that passes for higher education today
consumers would want something better
most people end up neither of them are prepared
no well that's true
but erm and it's a big book that book isn't it
oh yes
a hundred and fifty thousand words at least
you'll notice that i gave that one a miss because i had erm so much more pressing things to do
but erm perhaps i'll get round to it
anyway he's coming to the conference so i dare say i'll sit and hear what he has to say
so wh what kind of writing are you doing anyway
well i'm writing a popular science book at present
yeah
called psycho darwin cos you know there's a big boom in popular science publishing and erm i got a new york agent called who's very good at selling people books and he's sold he's sold mine
and so now i've just got to write it
that's coming on quite nice
and i'm trying to present the kind of things i do in this course and my other course
erm in oth in a way you know that any erm interested reader could understand
mm
and for me it represents an opportunity to complete the kind of freud darwin UNK i've been working on really for the last ten years and it kind of represents the completion of the UNK as it were now completely UNK in my mind into a single the single kind of entity that i know call psychoanalytic
so that's basically what the book is about
it's primarily put over as a kind of erm power line to the future
well i mean would you would you have said to begin with or
not yes it's based on what erm on the kind of stuff we've done in this course
the idea that human beings are a species whose social UNK are very critical as we know social UNK are also very important to reproductive success and so i bring in inside this UNK cooperation the idea about UNK and the evolution of the unconscious that press UNK don't know that UNK
did you do that paper
did that paper
you did you did
fine
erm well what you did when you talked about that and then erm linked it up with freudian UNK into the unconscious
ye yes so you aren't happy with to begin with
no not problem UNK
so you're saying naturally arises because of its complexity of how it UNK
yeah i'm talking about how it arises from the evolution point of view as an not i don't go in at all to the whole UNK question or how the brain is produced consciously
i honestly don't think we know enough well anyway i'm not qualified erm
well even if i were qualified i would be very sceptical because i think we just don't know enough about that yet
about having brain cells
but then it does go into that side because it goes into
yeah that's
well
i mean what does he call himself a UNK scientist or some other thing
i think so yes
that's his area and UNK science is supposed philosophy psychology and
computer science
and computer science i mean that's where the answers all come i'm quite sure i'm just sceptical that we know how much about it
and what about the role of language does he cos my theory an and freud's for that matter original but erm does he give a role of importance to language
at the end i gathered
cos my thing is that language is critical
i can't see how you could be conscious without it matters but it's interesting you know the hearing tests we were talking about
i mean you were
i know you said something about that in the past
that really is trying to erm discover whether the person on the other terminal is human by means of language and really you can't think of any other way of doing it
well it's five past according to my watch
and i'll do i don't know about the other they seem to be all over the place today
right let me find my evolution folder which is here
okay and here
bits of it are here
erm er who's performing today
you are and what are you telling us about
right
so you are
can i just ask
mm today
i won't be able to your lectures cos
oh how UNK
erm well i'm sorry about that
that kind of thing shouldn't happen
could you change your class if it were really
yeah the other one's at the printer form now by the way
oh i see i see
that's the summary i handed out the last week you wouldn't have got
thank you
and that's the summary of today's lecture you would get next week
thank you
well i'm sorry about that i mean that that's really very naughty of them
wh what er answers that
mm i suppose they have to do it because of the computing erm departments has some equipment they want
oh dear i'm sorry about this
anyway it's only for a few weeks you said
okay well er complex
tell us all about it
well done excellent erm as you can see in some ways quite a complex er issue and it's one of those things really i think to fully understand this you got to sit down with a pencil and paper and work it through yourself
i'll go through it erm fairly carefully in the lecture
erm let's start with the simpler issues though that mentioned at the beginning
erm and that is the whole question of conflict about parental investment in general and er she put it very well and very clearly and i'm sure she understood it but let's make sure that everyone else does
why should there be conflict over parental investment because after all children are the link product of success of their parents so shortly child and parent have got exactly the same self interest haven't they
yes and that's a good erm starting point
the point as says one has to bear in mind is that okay in general UNK are the successful parents but the parents probably have more than one offspring
so erm how many people here have got brothers and sisters you do well everyone's got brothers and sisters
well erm you've all heard of sibling UNK and sibling conflict
thank you
erm does anybody not believe in sibling UNK and sibling conflict
it is something that everybody is with you yeah
right well now how does that relate to what just said
wh what's the what's our theoretical insight into it given what we've done about natural selection parental investment
how could we explain that
that's what our peer would lead us to expect
it is true is that right
what do you think
erm certainly when you're very young i mean that when you're driving for attention
mm
could you give us an example or
erm
you got an example
you got attention
attention
yes
yeah
yes just for instance my brother pulling my hair in the back of the car and annoying me
you know really screaming and getting UNK really UNK and then you know back knows ultimately you're wanting parents to side with us
yes
so it's sort of you know we want to be favoured because we want all the reward we want to be given a sweet we want
that's the basic idea isn't it
that's an excellent is your brother older than you
no younger
oh younger i see
pulling big sister's hair
yeah i still got the blame for it
oh yes life is never just
erm does everybody else go along with that
is that everyone else's experience would y does this happen in japan
are er little brothers just as naughty
erm yeah
my brother is much younger than i
i don't know
so you're expected to give your sweets to your older brother dear oh dear
you were younger was he younger or older
yeah
i older
so he was younger
yeah
i see
so even though he was younger erm and did you resent that
were you angry about that
how did you feel about
sad you were sad
mm
erm the why should a parent looking at this pretty critically why should a parent want an older child like to give up something to a younger one
is there any biological action can you see any
right
right the rationale is that the degree of parental investment and its effect on the offspring vary with the UNK age and as says one of the fundamental erm principles of this is that the by and large the younger the offspring the more valuable any unit of parental is to it and the more UNK it is and the most obvious example of that would be food
obviously if you're a very tiny UNK baby the amount of food you need to er put on extra pound weight is not going to be the same as if you are a much larger child and you want to put on UNK the same amount of x pounds whatever it would be it would be same the same proportion of your weight
er it could be one pound possibly with a child
you'd have to eat a lot more
so the idea is that erm a parent may have an interest in UNK the sources from older offspring to younger ones because younger ones might benefit more from the same unit of resource
because they're so much smaller and perhaps this is what was happening in your case sounds very unfair to me but er but there we are
perhaps it did
the erm perhaps the best example of this to bear in mind and again that mentioned er erm and explained very clearly but i think we to mind is weaning complex
now did everybody understand that do you understand about the weaning complex
well mentioned it
perhaps we ought to lo well what is weaning
everybody knows what weaning is mm
what's weaning for
i'll explain what weaning is
ya
it means erm specifically UNK the breast so that the child accepts solid food or that's what in general means erm getting a child off baby food as it went on to adult food
erm okay
why should there be a conflict about weaning
again surely both child and mother have the same approach on it erm where does the conflict come in over weaning
it shows more child whereas
that's absolutely right well done
yeah the i don't think erm mentioned this in her paper but er it's a it's a point worth mentioning in passing because it er it er UNK what er you've just said
but in UNK as a whole i think there are few exceptions and certainly including human beings
the er UNK of the offspring UNK the mother's cycles and it is the UNK it's not the actual of UNK it's the UNK of part of the mother's UNK
this UNK her sexual cycles for varying periods of time depending on the species it's about two years
now you can see that in the ma UNK where this happens there could be a very clear contrary as says between the mother's desire to start another offspring towards the end of the period of breast feeding and the UNK interest in having some more milk and UNK the birth of the sibling
so we can expect conflict and did make this point but we need to underline it because it's very important
when we talk about UNK conflict we can expect the conflict at the margins we in other if we made er if we made er kind of diagram of the parents' self interest in providing parental investment and the UNK self interest in demanding parental investment we find that there are large areas of overlap
for example erm in the case of UNK or young or a very young offspring and a maybe a mother has already put a tremendous investment into that offspring as you've already seen
so her self interest and the UNK self interest are the same as father's intended
she has a self interest in giving her milk to er grow to a point where it can survive on its own
she's already invested so much that and the offspring has got a self interest for getting as much as it can so their self interest UNK
where their self interest comes into conflict is at the margin and the margin can be in any dimension
one dimension might be in this time as we have seen the mother might reach a stage where she it's in her productive self interest to start another offspring and she may want to UNK the existing one so she can do that
switch resources as it were
but the existing offspring may benefit more may need a little bit of extra milk so the existing offspring may try to erm demand more milk or at least milk for longer than the mother to supply
right
that's right
the same thing will apply in the terms of quantity
the offspring will probably be selected to want a greater quantity of parental investment than the parent because again a little bit extra for the offspring probably means more than what to its reproductive success than it er would mean to the reproductive erm success of the mother as far as the UNK are concerned
and the example that gave following which was a good one is crying
now erm why do you think why do kids cry so much
and so in UNK
cos half the adults don't do they or if they do it's normally taken as a sign of severe erm upset isn't it
erm if erm if one of them UNK me in the class i burst into tears i think you'd think something was seriously wrong with me wouldn't you
whereas if i was a kid and you took my sweet away and i'll UNK my you wouldn't do it would you
you wouldn't be so concerned why is that
well that's the way we UNK it don't we but supposing we were UNK you know weren't used to it
it's all i want is attention
well that's true that's true as well of course
but the reason why that's true maybe mightn't it that if you look at it from the child's point of view the crying is a is a signal it's sending to its parent
basically to say er look after me or give me what i want or er do what i want you to do or whatever it may be
in some counts a signal of distress but is attempting to UNK something but is usually what we would UNK in our abstract concept of parental investment
now if a child sends a distress call to a certain level of UNK it may get a certain amount back but it may have a sibling who sends the distress call a slightly higher level of UNK and might get some more back
so the idea is idea is that a kind of arms race will develop between the siblings to UNK the signal to get as much back as they can from the parent
so the result will be that the young children will cry an awful lot over about very small things because what they're doing is they're UNK the signal to a maximum level
the parent on the other hand will tend to get erm a little bit erm a little bit sceptical about this
the parent will tend to UNK their response as you have said parents will come to expect children to make a lot of fuss about nothing and consequently won't pay so much attention to a child's distress as they would to an UNK because we regard it as natural children to cry or make a fuss about the treatment we contribute but the reason for that could be that we have as it were UNK our sensitivity to distress and we really have a double standard
we have a standard for children which assumes they can either send very strongly UNK the distress and therefore we are not going to taken them terribly seriously or at least they can actual reach much higher UNK before we do take them seriously whereas for adults we have a different standard which assumes that even slight expressions of distress in adult could be serious
so erm basic idea about crying is this kind of arms race situation which offspring have been selected to UNK the signal because it UNK their reproductive success to get every little bit of extra parental investment we can for themselves
parents have been selected to become erm relatively UNK to signs of distress in the offspring because erm as where they cry UNK all the time and as a result erm parents don't take crying as seriously in children as they do in adults
there are other examples of this and one interesting experiment that we've just done with birds was with the UNK response in birds
you know that when birds are UNK in nest they UNK their little mouths open wide like this and they whenever the parents come back to the nest wi with a UNK or something you see the little UNK their little mouths wide open they kind of reach out of the nest and try to their feeding
well in this particular experiment what the UNK did was when the parental birds left the nest they UNK the erm the UNK as full with UNK as they could possibly stuff it
their UNK were completely erm full of UNK and they couldn't get any more UNK into those UNK so they knew these UNK were totally full as full could be
when the parents came back the erm UNK behaviour was exactly the same
there was no difference between a UNK that was totally full of UNK and couldn't have handled any more UNK but still as it were behaved as if it was on the point of UNK and a UNK that was really hungry had in fact observation shows that what parents do when they come back with the food is very often they probe the UNK of the UNK with their UNK to see which one's got much most room before they actually put the food in
so you often see on nature programmes for example when a bird comes back to a nest with several UNK in you see the parental bird kind of UNK its UNK in the in the UNK of all the UNK
not because it's feeding everyone if you look closely what it's probably doing is checking how much food is in their UNK
it's got a UNK and it finds one that's relatively empty it sticks the UNK into that one
so the parents are being UNK but the UNK are being very demanding as it were
have got totally UNK and they grow but the parents are being UNK because it pays the parent to discriminate and feed the ones who really need it but pays the offspring to demand as much food as is possible
so everybody with me so far
UNK you know in erm how intervals affect the survival of offspring
so could you say this was in the modern society effect
you know to keep
oh yes you could you certainly could and as i said for long periods parental an and offspring self interest will overlap
it's at the margin where they're probably UNK
in other words there will always be a tendency for probably for the offspring to want the mother to go on breast feeding for that little bit longer tha the mother may
so that th the weaning conflict will occur towards the end of the period of parental investment
an interesting example of this i read about recently in the press
last week's new scientist i think it was or the one before was a study of one particular type of bird with i can't remember wh what kind of bird
it was kind of dark and apparently what happened to this towards the end of the period of parental investment when the parents come back to feed the UNK they insist on the UNK following them
they run away from the UNK and the UNK have to follow them and chase them as it were and the one that catches them is the one they feed
and it looks as if this behaviour is all about encouraging the UNK to erm go off on their own as it were an and to start to run off and look for food
so what the parents are doing is they're UNK the UNK that runs the UNK and the UNK to erm they're trying to reinforce that behaviour because what they're are trying to do is get the UNK away from the nest and start looking for food for themselves presumably
so here here's a case where this conflict of interest leads the parents to actually kind of encourage their young to leave the nest and wander off
the UNK being that it's always easier for the offspring just to sit on the nest and wait for the parent
erm th that's easy it doesn't UNK any energy and er from the UNK point of view that's worth facing
but not necessarily from the parent
okay
so is everybody with us so far because this is when it starts to get difficult
because now let me try and confuse you on that
i hope i will erm
are you UNK
i'll go out i'll go get the windows that shouldn't be open north
perhaps the central UNK going down one minute
if i can turn on
erm let me try and confuse you first and then UNK you later
because you know it's a common trick in education
erm let me give you the confusing bit
surely human altruism shouldn't mean that there shouldn't be sibling conflict because human altruism shouldn't mean that since all siblings are equally related to their parents given you that they're called siblings
there should be harmony not conflict shouldn't there
no
you've still got your own brother
right
can everybody see that
you see you could say surely there shouldn't be a weaning conflict because an offspring should say to itself okay my mother wants to UNK me to have more offspring but those offspring she's gonna have are my siblings i'm very closely related to them
in fact i'm as closely related to them as my mother is if you think about it because i share half my genes with my four siblings and my mother shares half her genes with my four siblings
therefore our degree of UNK is the same
therefore my self interest in having siblings and my mother's self interest in having children are the same
but that argument is UNK why
oh yes i've only just said it
right
this is the important point you have to know it
that's the best way
but this is the way er puts it and i think it is a very good way of putting it as both and say the point is that every individual offspring is twice as closely related to itself as it is to its to its siblings
so it's quite true of course that the individual offspring wo may be affected by UNK
in other words erm UNK the r is greater than c do you remember our formula for UNK benefit of an UNK act UNK the cost discounted by the degree of that's between a half normally
the offspring ought to be so put to that's perfectly true
however the point you have to erm recall is that if it's a conflict between parental investment in a sibling and parental investment in myself i am twice as closely related to myself as i am to my sibling
so when my parent is handing out the parental investment i will be selected to want the parent to give the investment to my sibling if the benefit is twice as great as it would be to myself
but if it's less than twice as great i'll want it for myself
does everybody see that
right now comes the next step
how does the parent see it
we've described it from the UNK point of view
how does the parent see it
because the parent doesn't see it the same way
how does the parent see it you you're a parent you've got a unit of reproductive success
erm what you mean if one UNK about it
mm
bear in mind that see it but it's more likely to pass on energy units because it's the stronger you know
it's more likely to UNK it in itself
yes
yes it might it might but now you're getting a little bit you're getting a bit too sophisticated now we're going to come on to that later
erm we're looking at all other things being equal
let's assume that all the offspring are the same in quality
even let's even make them all the age
let's say they're all the same in quality they're all the same in age
there's still a difference as far as the parents are concerned
can anybody see what it is
well alright i mean
let's deal with the first bit first
why should they treat them all equally
why does the parent regard its offspring equally
in what sense
why
this is the important one
from the parents' point of view it is equally related to all its offspring
now this is this is the counter intuitive bit
supposing i'm a parent
in fact let let's do this in terms of a little diagram
let's put this on the board
i'll do this in the lecture
but let's just do it
it's easier if you do it on the board and you can see it
let's supposing that i am the parent
okay
i'm the parent p
here am i parent p okay
i have two offspring a and b which are smaller little er a and b offspring a and offspring b and they are exactly equal in eve every point of view size quality and animal okay
now erm supposing that er i have ten units of parental investment and i invest ten in a and ten in b because i'm equally related to both of them
okay
now supposing that i want a to do something for b like in 's case a to give up a food item for b okay
now as far as i'm concerned if the benefit to b is greater supposing for example they're not the same age sorry i shouldn't have said that about being the same age
er supposing they're not the same age
but supposing i invested equal amounts of parental investment in both and supposing that if offspring a gives two units of parental investment to offspring b the benefit to b's reproductive success will be three minutes which it could be if b was younger
okay a gives up two units of reproductive success a food item to b this benefits b by three units of reproductive success whereas it would only benefit a by only two units of reproductive success
in arbitrary units okay
now clearly i will favour that because now b has a total of thirteen units of reproductive success and a has er a total of eight units of reproductive success because it's lost some
so totals here are thirteen and eight
thirteen and eight is twenty one
in other words the total reproductive success that my parental investment has produced is now greater than it was before i started
so since i'm equally related to both in other words i have an equal number of genes in both offspring th this transfer has promoted my overall reproductive success
therefore i as a parent will be selected to want that kind of thing to happen
okay
you with me
now let's go back to what and say and look at it from offspring a's point of view
offspring a looks at it differently because offspring a says my sibling b has only got half my genes therefore i will make UNK for b wherever b r and greater than c as we saw
now in this case the sacrifice is er two units of reproductive success they benefit er b by adding er one unit of reproductive success to it
so the cost to me is two er the benefit to my sibling is one and the degree of UNK er is a half
so the sum has to be one times a half is greater than two which it clearly isn't cos one times a half is a half and that is less than two
in other words i as the offspring are not gonna want to transfer those two units of reproductive success
so when my parent says to me give those two units of parental investment that i just gave you to offspring b i don't want to because the benefit to offspring b or rather the genes i share with offspring b doesn't compensate UNK me for the for the sacrifice
i'm losing two units of reproductive success
my offspring is gaining one unit that it wouldn't have had otherwise
erm and that is that is not a good deal as far as my shared genes are concerned
so the
oh sorry three yes
okay
yes you're right sorry
cos it two
three times half
sorry three times a half
so it's three units that i'm giving my siblings
right three
the total benefit is three units of reproductive success three times a half again is one and a half it's not erm it's not the of two
if you think about it er there are numbers that will that will make it work
larger numbers
if erm what would it have to be
it would have to be at least erm what would it have to be it would have to be at least the benefit yes the benefit would have to be at least four on the on the b's side in order for that to work
anyway the these erm numbers don't matter this is just an arbitrary example
the fundamental point that you have to grasp is that parents want any transfers between their siblings that will result in a net gain for the a sorry parents want any transfers between their offspring that result in a net gain for reproductive success
it doesn't really matter to the parent which offspring has gained as long as there is a net gain
all other things being equal
the offspring however don't take the same view
for them all other things being equal they will only be selected to make a sacrifice where the benefit is twice the cost
if you work it out for other relatives the discrepancy gets even bigger
as mentioned if you work it out for UNK erm for UNK cousins for example the benefit turns out has to be at least eight times
so the principle the fundamental principle is that conflict between parents and offspring over a we over a altruism over self sacrifice or UNK which is the other side of it
because this works just as well for UNK because if you think of it UNK is negative altruism
it's the opposite altruism
parents will always want twice as much altruism or half as much UNK as the offspring our certainty to
that's the whole thing in a UNK
in other words the conflict between parents and offspring over offspring behaviour is not UNK in culture and nature as we often think it is
it's UNK in evolution
it's UNK in biology
fo for example says that he about his first erm experience was as a field observer of UNK in er kenya or somewhere
and this is one of the first on the first day he was astonished to see an older male UNK intervene in a fight between two younger ones and stop it
and this astonished him because he'd seen this kind of thing at home
he'd seen human parents intervene in conflicts between pa er between er offspring
you know like er parents did when her brother was pulling her hair and she wanted to UNK him
i UNK they intervened to stop the fight
well what observed exactly the same thing with UNK and said to himself why are these animals doing this
there has to be a reason why all the male UNK who have got no particular self interest in well there's no obvious sign in a fight between two youngsters nevertheless he intervened to stop it and he had realized that the reason well he ultimately realized development of parental investment the reason they intervened to stop it is that parents do not have the same self interest as their offspring do when it comes to behaviour of offspring
there's a fundamental UNK conflict of interest because the parents will want any gain to their UNK net reproductive success
in other words they favour any act of altruism
but the offspring will only favour acts of altruism where the benefit UNK the cost discounted by the figure we agreed
how do you erm
well what i mean is my genes for altruism are present in my body one hundred percent okay
any gene i had for making a sacrifice on behalf of a sibling are one hundred percent in my own body
however because of the way it relates in this work they are only fifty percent present in my sibling so any sacrifice of gene me er it's not my actual UNK for your finding of the problems the reason is this is something we did last term in UNK theory so the others have got an advantage over you they've already done it this time
i'm not surprised that erm you're erm you you're having problems with it
but it ba it's basically the UNK idea that for example supposing i sacrifice my life saving three of my siblings okay
yeah
i lose my life so a hundred percent of my genes for altruism are wiped out
yeah
but i've saved three siblings
now each of my siblings has fifty percent of my genes
so a hundred and fifty percent of my genes for altruism are saved in three siblings compared to one hundred percent lost in me
that's a net gain for gene for altruism
therefore it would be selected cos that's what natural selection is
more copies of original
so the point i'm making is that offspring will be prepared to make UNK under those conditions where erm the r is greater than c but parents will want offspring to make UNK wherever b is greater than c and the parent is not concerned with the discount parameter r but agreed on UNK because parents are equally related through their offspring
so any sacrifice by an offspring that results in a net gain in reproductive success is good news for the parent
because obviously the parents' got genes in all its offspring
can you see that
yes
it's counter see you the reason the reason that this seems difficult to understand at first is we're not used to thinking of it that way
and the reason is normally we look at human relationships from one point of view or another or assume that UNK are the same but clearly they're not the same the perspective of an offspring is not the same as the perspective of the parent
that was 's basic insight and it's a very important one
as i have said i'll go over it in the in the lecture in more detail but this is key insight
so does everybody see it now
or at least got hold of the basic as i have said the best way to do this is to sit down with a piece of pencil and paper and work it out yourself
try and do the sums as it were and think it through and if you do that i think you'll see that er it does work out this way and of course it gets er even worse if you consider questions like UNK through parents because clearly i may be related to my mother's sister's children my cousins er no it's actually UNK because my mother and her sister share genes but i'm not er necessarily related erm in the same way erm through er my father's er relatives for example because although erm because my er my relationship between mother's UNK and my father's UNK is purely through marriage so they have no joint genetic UNK
so although i am UNK related to my mother's brother's or my mother's UNK children or my father's UNK children the fact is the siblings of both groups are UNK related to each other
and that produces further conflict because the parents now take a different view
the parents now who they're related to
but their UNK is not the same as the child
for example my father is not related to my mother's er sister's children
normally if we assume you know completely non erm non UNK of marriage
so my father doesn't have a UNK interest in me being grouped to my mother's sister's children
but my mother takes a very different view
she is related to her sister's children so she has a genetic self interest in me doing things for my for her er female er for her relatives and my father doesn't
so my parents er aren't gonna ag agree about my altruism
my mother will want me to be more UNK to hers than my father will
my father will want me to be more UNK to his relatives than my mother will
and this again will be a cause conflict
sometimes is and here of course is conflict between and married partners
how do we judge who's gonna be greater than we can't say that erm how do we
in practice you mean
how do we do it in practice
well i suppose the simple the short answer is we don't know exactly how we do it
the longer and more and less precise answer would be presumably human psychology has evolved in such a way as to allow us to make those kind of judgments that would normally be reliable
er i mean for example erm if we if you made us well let's go back to th your example
giving up your sweets for your brother
presumably if you felt sad about that what you're saying is you weren't as happy about that as your mother was
your mother presumably who forced you to do that was happier than you were about it happening and that's what made you sad
the in other words your emotions were reflecting these kinds of calculations
you seem to have an emotion that made you resent making a sacrifice to your brother and presumably would have stopped you making it if you'd been free to choose
whereas your mother presumably had a different emotion which made her think this was right and proper or er if it pleased her issuing up this sacrifice
so it looks as if you people's emotions have been UNK in such a way that mothers look on these situations from their point of view and feel happy about it and offspring like you look at it from their point of view and feel unhappy about it and your emotions are the way the evolution has equipped you to deal with these problems
so if you'd been given a free choice you wouldn't have given your sweets to your brother would you
no
however ho how what was the age UNK between you and your brother
four
four
my guess is though that if the age difference had been something like erm seven or eight years by the time your mother was asking you to give up sweets for your very much younger brother you would probably have UNK sufficiently and perhaps identified enough with your mother to see yourself playing a more kind of UNK role as you know the grown up sister
you might not have minded giving up your sweets because you you'd have got a different kind of UNK
you would have felt oh i'm being like UNK
and i think that kind of thing happens in fact you notice it happening in families
where there's a big age gap between the children the older child often will go along with the parental wishes much more merely because it's much more mature
it won't be competing for the same resources
for example it may not want the same sweets as the little kid you know little kids like little kids' sweets and grown up kids like more grown up sweets they may like UNK and things you wouldn't give to a little baby
so the very fact that the offspring are more mature would reduce conflict because the degree of value of the sources is going to be much greater in other words you could give up the sweet
the relative cost to you would be trivial but the relative benefit to a much younger erm sibling of yours might be much greater
and because you are so much older you wouldn't see yourself as competing for the same resources and you would probably have UNK in ways emotionally that would make you accept and identify with the parental values rather than feel sad or UNK because you felt you were more like your brother as it were and you were being UNK against
does that answer your question
i mean it's not a very good answer because frankly we don't know th the full reasons for this but
obviously some variations in
oh absolutely it would
and of course i mean we have to remember that when we talk about UNK altruism this is just an UNK
i mean we're not erm we're just UNK a very complex situation and in fact probably large numbers of genes are involved and they're there are probably complex UNK between different sorts of altruism UNK altruism will certainly function within families for reasons that we've just been looking at but this will also be a UNK and erm encouraging er framework for sibling altruism
so it may be that elements of the sibling altruism will develop in families too
for example you might have been a mere much more happy about making a sacrifice for your brother giving him a sweet if you knew that on other occasions he would give one to you and because you are related to each other
in other words you met each other a lot and w we know you had the kind of situations that
ah
can you er can you tell me wh where you were born mr
yes in a little street it's not there now down here called street
there were seven houses there
and only yards and horses stables and things round there you know in them days
then we come in here it was a repaired house this was
this street here in nineteen what wa nineteen eight i think
aye
yes it was
aye
h how h how many were in your family then
well in this house
yeah
well my mother had six children but the first baby died and we UNK there was another five
i think there's only two of us alive now
i've got a sister in er UNK bay somewhere she'd living yes
aye and last time i seen her was about five years ago
and the children's coming here aye
ah all these there was no UNK houses across the road there
there were yards of slate here to there
that's on the other side of
yes
of street here
yes
what did your what did your father did he do then
he worked in but he used to go and relieve the sailors and firemen in the steam boats he used to go you know
when they were needed one
you know the man in charge of them was they called him always used to go and fetch him to go if they needed er or somebody lost their passes and
er and i went there as a boy after engines and things you know in then do you remember them
no steam engines UNK
they were coming down from the quarry bigger engines
they were a little bigger than this the ones they had UNK here
there was two of them and they used to go all day at the quarry for to get bring the slates down to
h how old were you wh when you started
fourteen
mm
yeah
well yes
i'm supposed just to answer you that's all isn't it
well no you no you say anything that you want to add that will you know fill in
all the gaps
aye fourteen i was
i think i'd been yes a few weeks couple of three weeks perhaps in the slate yard behind there they used to make slates for schools there
oh there was about two dozen boys and a lot of men there was about a hundred working in that place then
yeah
and then before that boys used to go and gather UNK in the sand outside er not here other side of you know
and bloody things here the whole time these UNK were everywhere they were we liked them the boys did aye
ah
and there's only me living you know
i got er a UNK living in leicester
arnold his name is
and he comes here sometimes
and then i just go about myself all day
perhaps to the beach here or passing the time
cos i had you see
wh when you started working as a lad erm what did you have to do
when i went to you mean
yes
before that other place
that p oh i was doing nothing there only UNK up round there
if a ship had been there loading well there was a couple of us boys used to tidy up after er after the and things on there see
and we used to tidy up things like that
er we didn't do much
cos there were we were only getting about five bob a week aye
aye
and then er like that
and er i joined this UNK they come and then i joined them and we went to camp UNK for a fortnight
we were we hadn't been home a couple of two or three weeks then the big war started nineteen fourteen
fourth of august so we had to go see
we were belonging to the UNK then
and then we had to go straight away there and we went different places UNK s you know different places in the country like in england
and in wales yeah we forget where we were there
but we went to had a lot of UNK then UNK men
and we had to go to france then
er belgium and france where i was in we were in
and we had n old naval guns
old naval guns
their UNK was a long as from here to that door there
about
yes
from here to that door
about eight feet long
yes
the UNK were they had nothing else you see
they wouldn't give us
i was a UNK with them
there was two of us on horses then there was no UNK then you know
no only horses dragging these big guns
about six horses on them
in each gun four of them
yeah and then the horses used to go down out to the line see
well the germans was UNK and these b things but we had sixty UNK guns then
they were very short UNK things but them old things there like that they were jumping when you were firing them you know
they were yeah
what w what was it like when you first w went over there i mean having been here in and then all of sudden finding yourself in france
ah we feel oh we were we enjoyed ourselves there
that's all i can remember ever
yeah
but i come home well in the end
lots more lads were killed do you see lots of them eh
well there was thousands killed see the UNK was and there were loads more all round you see
yeah
and all the country there then well france we were first then we shifted to belgium
nothing only and mud and dirt and everything else
and walking about up to here some of the times in mud
and we had on these shoes you know
boots i mean t you know
yes
and the first UNK we went in the communication UNK was
was it
aye we was shifted about then different places yeah
and er i had a touch of a there was a gas UNK dropped somewhere quite not far from me
and i had a snuff of that then i wasn't right for a while
i went down to UNK to an hospital there
got better they sent me back
aye
course my best friends were killed there
a m a man named harold from and while i was in that hospital with that bit of a gas shell he er he g fellow came and told me there to UNK that he was dead killed
aye never they never seen him after
a lot of them getting killed there
but i was lucky
i remember when after it finished i went back to for a while i went with ports and things like
to different ships aye
belonging to liverpool and them places like that
and travelling round ireland travelling round ireland all round it UNK all round with slates from here
yes
the a good life you know
and sometimes used to get a bit of a bad storm ahead so we used to especially if you went from here to er north of scotland round UNK
in bad weather we used to go into what was it they called long hope or something and anchor there
er well there'd be a lot of us ships there then
about a dozen there
but we couldn't go ashore until it got better ad then we went round the UNK after and down into aberdeen see
that's what we used to do with these ships
aye
aye got to bangor there and my father's UNK on that
is he
aye
have you got them here
no i they're in the UNK
aye my father's leaning on the bridge like that
i have to i h i when i get to the office i'll h i'll h i'll have a look a bit closer
yes you can see him
the like that
yeah
on a bridge it's like this wasn't it
bangor her name was
there was another ship the same as her called the and another one called the UNK
they had a few ships
they you heard of her
i've heard of her
UNK ship she was
yes
well my brother was with went with that one once a boy as a boy
but i took him first to UNK quay to join a sh erm ship there
i forget her name
well anyhow when we went there i told er the captain like
well what do you want he says to me
well i've been sent from bangor
there was a sailing er what do they call it a here and it was him that he asked would could you send a boy there
so i took my brother who was younger than me about four or five years see
the first ship he went in he was for about two years
and then he left her and he went with this three UNK top UNK she was very fine ship
aye
and then i don't know where he went after of course
i went different places
i landed in the end me on the railway
bangor here
did you
aye
yes well we i i'd been working on the UNK suspension bridge UNK you know when they were rep doing the repairing like
i went there and asked the fella for a job and he says how are you on heights he says
oh i'm alright i says to him i've been in ships and
alright you can start he says to me
and i were i was doing the job there th that's how i started on working on shore
and er of course that job finished then
and er i had a brother in law on the railway there
so he told me to go and ask for a job there
i went i forget er no i don't forget the name of the foreman
jack his name was anyhow
a bit of a rough chap you know nice but very rough
what have you been doing before he says to me
i told him i worked on the UNK suspension bridge
oh you're on yes go on start tomorrow morning he says to me with fighting UNK
there was a fella called fighting UNK there
you start with fighting UNK in the tube there tomorrow
and that's how i worked there
er and then i think oh i was there for about two years after
you so s so you worked in
i worked there two years after my time
after er sixty five you know
yeah
and then i'd er UNK finished then and miserable around here aye and in the town i used to get a job here and there
th then you know from someone or other
well now anyhow i there's only me here and i er was ninety three last birthday
last september
yeah i was born in eighteen ninety two see
i think i'm the oldest one round here
yes i think you are
yeah i think so too
i think so
aye cos i remember a lot of old people here
a lot of old sailors you know er in them days when i was a kid aye
w were there w was there a great UNK
ships sailing ships there were haven't you seen the picture of them sailing ships
i've seen photographs but it's to have people who were actually there is quite rare really
well the ships were there was no UNK in them days you know
w er only sailing boats and they used to be UNK here years ago down on the beach there
and they used to call on when they were giving the turns to go there and load
my father was working loading there
er
were a lot of people employed o on them er fo from
pardon
oh yes you know five and six in some small UNK yes
but in the was ten i think
they she belonged to she was iron ship she was to
yes
and she used to run from here to UNK and london
with slates and about nine crew on her
nice ship she was too
my brother was with her for a long while
oh he was a proper UNK different to me you see
what's the difference
well er he started right
started as a boy he did
i and i took to UNK quay as a sailing ship and i and then of course i hadn't been much in sailing ships
i used to work as a boy i did on
and then when i got er old enough i used to go in the gang like the men and er get the same and piece work we were working loading the ships
loading the barrels
and UNK them to the ship you know then after you'd been there a long time well my father was a down below and i went to his shop then you see
that's how we learnt
so in the ship was a nice thing you know
cos slates you know going and rolling round and jumping
because they w they weren't shifting do you see
but there's a funny thing i was lucky in there
i was with UNK she come up new ship you know then
and i was with her till i left her somewhere in southampton i'd been in her a good while too
somebody pinched something off me so bugger all this i said i left her there
and come home here
well i went to in oh about twelve months after that or less say and er she wanted a man there i went down there and asked could i have a job back you know
well he was just too late he says there's a fellow from oh never mind maybe a chance again
she was lost all hands aboard
in about a fortnight after it
aye
good
and she was a new ship too aye
she had a bad cargo see they hadn't er some stuff and they hadn't stored her properly and she turned over and they all got UNK
there was one chap with her he'd been in oh for years
and his ship was called
he was from and he'd been out of work a long time
willy his name was i remember him well
he got lost and UNK with her
he was from
and
aye i'm lucky you see
yes
well i'm not to UNK too much i i've been lucky haven't i
very lucky
aye
yes aye
and er this is what i do well i used to do jobs round here for a while or i've chucked it up now aye
i don't get nothing
cos i worked two years all the time i had a few bob for that extra that's all
cos i can't get to what you call this a thing now social security
the guy can't get that cos i had a few shillings more after working two years
oh i see
aye
that's not fair r really is it
no well that's the way the country's doing now isn't it
i don't think anybody works overtime now do they over their age
very rarely
aye i should think so unless they're working for themselves right
there is some fella he's working in his back yard and he's UNK all day i wish he'd give it up
but he's not out there today either he started this morning i can't hear him now
ah
you said that erm or you implied that it was important to stow the c the erm slates v very carefully
oh yes
you had to store them
there was what they called gangs you see you know they had UNK didn't they
have you ever seen them
i've seen photographs
and they used to two men on the shore loading course there was men counting the slates do you see
there was thousands and thousands
and er then th one man used to load the barrel and the other man was to put them down the plank
and of course there was people from the town then getting a job like holding like this and fella on the stage you see they weren't regular men but they were getting a job and so much for doing it yes just the same
but the regular men were getting more money than but er and then there used to be men down there storing the slate regular men on the outside my father was one of them
say if there was eight gangs there would be eight of them there and eight of them here
aye
storing them
packing them up nice you know and UNK them tight so as they wouldn't shift you see when the ship was rolling
when er w each gang would they negotiate the er the bargain individually or would they be paid would every gang be paid a f a flat rate
a flat piece rate
the regular men were er mates sharing together you see
i see
but the others that was getting a job from the town
mhm
were getting the money what it was worth
sometimes be more or less
used to be about few p er shillings more do you see er a tonne yes
aye
were erm only certain men allowed or er say were trusted with the job of UNK
oh they were regular men
oh yes they were regular men
yes the others were only UNK they called them
UNK
aye you know holding them on the plank and th passing them to the but the men that were UNK them they were regular men on the they knew how to do it see
and they used to pack them up so nice and tight till they were full up inside
and then they didn't shift at all see
no
when you started on that gang wh what did you start as then
did you start as
oh i started as a boy
yeah
er on the doing small jobs on the quay there like you know cleaning up and things like that
after a ship
but when i got older well i was getting the same pay as the regular men then
piece work you know
but the war come and
and i was six years or something away
er

course all young w women used to go and UNK as they called them didn't they
used to go UNK er cleaning and that's where they used to work but now they go to shops don't they
aye
there was seven shops in this little place here
there's none here now
only that now that's what they sell things there th they've started there
on the beach there there's a shop there now
but there were seven in all these streets here and we never used they never used to go to town
we never used to go here we used to be and on the beach there
what did they sell these er shops
oh er everything you know meat and there was one shop down the bottom of the street here my mother come here one morning she used to get meat there
and er oh she says to m she couldn't didn't speak welsh but she told what the old man told her in that shop there
he says there's er that i e i haven't got a chicken for you today a kitchen for you today
instead of saying chicken he says i haven't got a kitchen for you
aye
and that old man i'm telling you the god's truth i watched him when i was coming school many a time used to go to anglesey with a rope in his pocket here
and buy a sheep and come home with it and that over the bridge with it all along and along er that road there and th and when we used to come from that school in he used to be coming with a sheep on the string like this and the poor thing i used to look at the old sheep and he often used to be tired you see
and he'd go like this with his knee you know that's how she was shifted
to here
and he UNK he was killing them in the back yard there
yes
but he was a proper butcher
he was cutting it proper shapes you know like they are today
but he was a proper but it was in his back yard he was killing it and hanging it up in the window there
in the bottom of the street there
yeah
the old houses them aye
yeah
er that i remember come in laughing saying that he had no kitchen for him for her
i laughed we used to have a laugh about that very often
aye
it was
apart from the b UNK shop
er wh what other shops were there
oh they was er selling everything potatoes and er UNK and things like that you know
about seven of them but they were in different places
but there was one shop up the road there er it was n the welsh names they were or most you see
and there'd been like a half door going to the shop like there you know
but behind that t the bottom half i still remember it though and when we opened that
and then the old man might be in the back yard somewhere and he could here that the bell going
it was a big as this
ah
what almost a foot
yes
a big bell like that
good heavens
aye
enough to make anyone jump isn't it
oh yeah
well he was selling UNK everything potatoes UNK and things like that
i my day tell you i don't thing there was many shops with a tin in the sh in the window
they were all in but the UNK stuff everywhere now isn't it
but it wasn't then
no
all in er at the counter or in er boxes or in UNK like this
everything like that then
but now er in tins
and people were saying in them days won't live long now
will tins
so the old people are saying and we were wondering as children like yes why oh it's all UNK stuff now
aye it's no good
cos they used to have and a big handled my mother had sa UNK and as big as this
like that
yes
and a big handle sticking up here
full of UNK
ah UNK
UNK
yeah
everything in it you know
ah lovely stuff eh

i makes them myself in the back yard there i do it
do you
aye
how
sorry

we er UNK they call the other isn't it
UNK and meat and good stuff and then they used to put a little flour to UNK it like this do you see with a big UNK like that
and pulled this out like that
well they say it'll come out like that see
mm
everybody w looking but when my father and all was there was nine then so there was more so we had to go in th in that big room there and eat off the table there then
cos
all of you
yes
aye
aye
oh my mother was a strong woman yes and good cook too
but she'd learnt a job in that's what she was doing you see in the
w she came from erm
she come from london here a young girl
she'd lost her parents
yeah
and er her father and mother died but she lived till she was eighty
and she come here with these people from london she had a good place with them plenty of good food and everything
in that there where that job centre is now
and then across the road she went afterwards to that there she had a lovely time there
cos working men didn't go in there th in them days you know into that small
all er p er people in big high jobs
aye
right
but now every dick tom and harry goes in that little there now
yes
well they didn't in them days
they didn't hardly go when i was going
i was started to go there
yeah
only i went away to work then aye and er wasn't coming home very often
w what w what did your mother think of here
having sort of c come into an area which was welsh speaking
well she come with the people english from london and then with them in that there
mm
that's where she was
mm
it must have been a bit of a shock to her
she was young
mm
ten years of age she was
only ten
ten yes
but she never spoke welsh
but i think she understood us and acquired talking to ourselves in welsh you know
yeah
oh yes she knew what cos we could see it by her face
aye
aye
and i remember her father coming here from
young and he married some g young girl from here you know
aye
you remember that do you
yeah
oh yeah
when you came can i just sort of take you back again
when you came back
aye you ask me what you want to know
and then i well it's no use me telling me because they're no good to you are they them
no i don't no that puts flesh on the bones
oh aye yeah
yeah
when you came back from away after the war d did you notice any changes here
yes er the missing of the old friends you know to start with yes
mm
er and hardly nothing to do here
but er i was going back to my own job you see and then i went to see if the and then i don't know what happened
there was something er oh well i went away again somewhere
and then i went on the railway
a little the reason why i went there my brother was living two or three here
and he said says to me i can get you a job on the UNK railway he says to me
you see so i went there and that's how i got there
well i'd been on the UNK suspension bridge before
aye they were repairing it then
we had to go up heights then didn't we
aye
what did you used to do on the on the bridge then
oh well i say there was fitters i used to h er be handy with them
and lifting the heavy things and things yeah
oh it was heavy but i was used to heavy stuff on
cos er when you're loading a ship you're handling yourself about twenty tonnes before dinner
with your hands like this
loading the UNK with twenty tonnes
and UNK it so far like that
and then the other fella will take it to the plank
yeah
to put them down
and he'd have to put that i remember one man that was counting like this he used to count them by the three you know
there was two or three men that did like
of course they knew and they had a pin in o in their hand to stick every hundred like that see
counting three like that
thousands was in no time they'd count tonnes
and i put one morning s seven tonnes before dinner in
aye
who was responsible for calculating the number of slates then
oh there was a they had er th er counters they called them
but we called them in welsh do you see
they say there was oh half a dozen counters there you know
but there was one man m in er in you see them little red UNK that's on
he was there
he knew how much every ship carried you see and how much slate they wanted to get rid of there
aberdeen different slates going there
they were UNK and smaller you see
because the weather was bad there wasn't it
i see
but in ireland dublin and belfast the lovely best slates you know used to go there to ireland
best slates
ah b a scotland there was different place altogether for slate
aye
and they used to count it like that and every hundred they stick a pin in see
and they had a slate in their hand square slate like this
and they used to mark the hundred and then go there again take the other pin out and go like that you see
counting them all the time like that
yes they counted thousands of them
well they knew how to do it didn't they
they were used to it
they had a say there was two or three counters this man in that part had made the cargo already before they started see
one man er that had so many hundred UNK or so many UNK sizes say different sizes
and then they used to go with their slate and they knew it altogether and then the counter turns and turns like that
and they don't do it now
they made the rope
how the ships finished here
they belonged to they were ships you know but they had one sailing ship the herself they made a road into quarry you see
and instead of a ship going from here to aberdeen she might be a fortnight going there with bad weather
going to different places UNK we used to go
because we boys used to like the UNK lying and talking and in the UNK and UNK of the coming from the UNK all the UNK and things like that
you know
aye
aye well you see it we used to it doesn't matter how she jumped and rolled we were eating just the same
but if a young fella started you know he couldn't d eat you know for a while long time
he got sick do you see and lie down
yeah
and we used to say you're alright come one
we've been the same before when we started
aye
yes aye
how long did it take for your stomach to settle down then
oh a good while
yes
yeah
you were afraid to see her shifting
oh yeah all the time
we used to tell well the old men used to tell us you'd be alright used to it
but we used to tell these young when they c erm young ones come when we were going all
aye
i remember one fella she was rolling and i was in the UNK
and with a UNK pan full of some stuff there very nice though
and he come there and luckily he went on top of the table to lie down
he had to and sick he was UNK see
well we used to get a bucket and throw it over the v over like that
and the old men used to do it before us aye
you'd go you wouldn't feel it at all you'd be in your glory there after about a month
i used to be all the lads the same age as me there
yeah
and then down here was all s sailing ship there
well do you see the photos of them on that has she
i hope s
she has yes
i hope she's bringing them back aye
well she will up there
aye
they're not new houses there they're not very old are they
not relatively speaking no
no
oh th these are old but these are er second repair these are these two
th told you them two in the top started new but the war broke out see and er then they this up
this was a terrible place in them days aye
all kinds of more people living here very old you know then
yes
yes
yeah there were
of course i remember them eighties and nineties here
and they used to work
well they had nothing after like
there was no dole or nothing like this they had
there were only UNK and like that for some of them
how did the old ones
eh
how did they old ones survive then
well god knows to tell you the truth there
they were er well they were different to us they weren't going nowhere from here and er they had no best clothes only same clothes mostly for days and sundays isn't it same
er there were some like look here tell you what's made the difference
i remember well ten pubs in here round this quarter
ten
good heavens
and there's only two here now see
there in and er where's the other
on the beach there the
oh yes
and th that's bigger now
that's that used to be the part there that's gone big there was sailors

well i've been myself
going there big fire used to smoke pipes like that in there
there used to be used to UNK them out didn't they
and the lads were glad to go there
well i wasn't married but i used to go in there and i used to come home er say in winter if i come home for a w week or two i go in there and sit by the fire and have a yard
and they tell us which boat old men been and what th see that's how we learned didn't we
i see
yeah
w what happened when things began to go down as regards the ships then
oh everybody was going poor wasn't they
some well i myself i was lucky i had a job with my brother in law he was working there on the railway and he knew them well
but er well he was from that part of the town UNK that way you know

yeah
there is a bit of
right okay
well let's wait and hear wh what says he'll probably explain to you the history of why it is like this
but as i said i do apologize
there was a copy in the library at one stage although not listed under it was under but i now see that when the other day i looked erm according to er there isn't even anything under
did you look under too
yeah
right so i'm very sorry
i won't do it again next year
we won't have a class on that's just somebody that UNK the book
but erm anyway er tell us what you made of it and we'll take it from there i think
well the book was er published in the early nineteen well it was written in the early nineteen thirties but er it wasn't actually published until nineteen sixty seven
erm for instance UNK man primarily wilson president of the united states
so basically subject given account of er UNK life and his personality
in context the psychoanalysis in order to explain erm UNK actions and er attitudes in the UNK presidency of the united states during the first world war basically con UNK on erm
despite highlighting er UNK intellectual and physical achievements for instance he er wrote a very er well respected book called con UNK government in his earlier cabinet career and also he initiated domestic reforms the book is er generally quite UNK reporting character
especially the UNK he suffered from erm throughout his life on which the his presidential and political career
the main argument put forward by er was that er was that wilson suffered as an adult because of the over UNK rage he UNK rage he UNK which was directed towards his father
as a child wilson was er regularly subjected to the darkness father and criticized and UNK the young wilson
however instead of er UNK and dealing with his rage wilson er instead chose to strongly identify with his father erm argued er wilson never grew beyond his father identification because the situation whereby er wilson was full of the conviction that his er mission in life was somehow divided
in identifying with what he regarded as his father wilson thought that he would er emerge from the war as a saviour to the world so to speak
two went further in an effort to UNK his rage against his father and to avoid a highly threatening career situation
wilson identified with his father to the extent of wanting to have UNK contact with him since wilson saw his father as the author of all his skills his strength and all that he'd been grateful for
this was based on apparently wrote to obtain er or basically to obtain
this is UNK supported by the close contact of the relationship wilson had with his father and UNK deeply held religious conviction which he UNK in his presidency
however this UNK held conflict with his father in subsequent over identification with er led wilson to be somewhat UNK perhaps even UNK as a as you know as presidency of the united states which were often directed towards or often only minor details of his work but he wouldn't he wouldn't actually range them towards say any major
er UNK this UNK this frequently not himself which it occurred throughout his life through his childhood as well and his general
er sustained UNK which was highlighted by frequent illnesses especially in his er president of the university where wilson suffered UNK and conflicts and transfer of reform of UNK the university and also we see there er back part of his life a wilson of his own er seem to direct some of his rage against er a coloured colleague of his a
graham argued that all this is indicative of a person who hasn't grown fully grown out of his childhood worries problems especially the er he hasn't actually dealt with the true feelings that he had towards his father and who instead chose to UNK his rage on others and political career which resulted in wilson being er well losing some of his UNK which led to his poor performance in er negotiating and gaining acceptance of the treaty of after world war one
erm apparently that's what the trouble with the UNK in congress that led him erm some degree to another centre in UNK
erm and this also explains in part why he er UNK made by rules and all concerned what was into europe did not UNK
er i think if you're gonna try and erm explain you know try and assess the validity of the book
agree or ask yourselves why you agree
tell us about various reasons not just study of value of the great of the greatest value there
it seems freud and perhaps even wanted to er UNK their anger on wilson because of his failures concerning the war and its UNK
