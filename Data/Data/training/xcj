immediately after the war when bullett first approached freud er with the idea of writing the book freud was apparently feeling very depressed and er he was UNK critical of his own work and er because he had little access to patients during the war he generally felt quite down and also by presenting written for him all he would need to UNK all he would need to write and according to er other people perhaps he was eating he was receiving just sort of waiting to die
whether that's er i'm not too sure
erm anyway this was when bullett actually first approached freud UNK nineteen hundred and twenty
the disappointment with wilson felt like freud must have sort of UNK for quite a long time cos it was not for eight years that he actually UNK on
this was highlighting the fact that although er freud thought psychoanalytic should be used in a neutral nerve and not used for any active aggression an exception seemed to be made with woodrow wilson
although some may be quick to say that the vast majority of the book was actually written by bullett and not by freud no less than the actual intellectual framework of the book apparently seems to have been due to freud's input er freud certainly was UNK trained in any in any sense of the word
er perhaps the whole project could also be UNK mainly i think to freud's desire to try and keep open the er the er UNK publishing house which he founded in and which er basically was kept together financially from the er UNK er UNK which bullett sent from america
er the book has been very heavily attacked by contemporary writers even mentioned passing for the
complaints have been made for instance by erm er
the er book is based on an UNK and sometimes even UNK evidence due probably to the er rather UNK er UNK ambitious er bullett rather than the peaceful like of freud
nevertheless evidence er was dealt with by our UNK version parent
much due to the influence of freud cos of course bullett wasn't a
contemporary studies of wilson by for example or perhaps even are apparently based much more on UNK material than bullett and freud would allow
i can't really clarify that
erm for example it appears that freud and bullett er UNK wilson especially as regards to the nature of his father
for example argues that wilson did not have any sort of UNK for his father
but that wilson UNK for a UNK union with fantasy father
so that er woodrow could experience a full sense of self to actually relate back to his himself which er wilson er experienced only as a child
his childhood
er you have a UNK of such a long period wilson er didn't seem to have sort of being recorded to his sexual UNK of that nature
although there is er a general agreement that wo situations were re really more complicated in the wilson family er UNK erm wilson actually certainly loved his father his er his mother an and his er father
er wi wilson er did not seem to allow his father's wit and criticism to get him as much as freud had er suggested
er certainly evidence seems to suggest that a very genuine and close relationship developed with his father
for ex for instance they er often UNK in one another usually when they to see what they actually er share each other 's UNK thoughts and this continued throughout later life it could be argued bu but it continued throughout later life and what they often UNK by er by letter
it could be argued from this that er UNK father began to identify more of his son rather than the other way round
especially as UNK academic career UNK and he er and he wrote to his father less and less
so of er resulted in a rather er sad feeling in his father the thought that actually his son was starting you started to by his son
argues that er wilson suffered from strokes throughout his life not even emotionally recorded due his psychological condition
the reason why this occurred er erm the reason why this occurred was not due to some sort of er due to emotional problems that he suffered within these repressed relations with his son
erm and also the reason why wilson could not actually read until the age of eleven was not due to the emotional er problems of his father it was due to a sort of a form of UNK er th there's a hell of a lot of debate about this er all these things just what er UNK is er UNK
but er sad sadly there's er evidence that sh show that if there is a UNK
erm however it UNK that er freud could not have er known about this although it seems to UNK if they are correct
erm if the move on the was psychoanalytic issue er despite the book being generally regarded as an embarrassment to psychoanalytic is somewhat non
it er has initiated others to demonstrate how the use of a psychoanalytic science for the actions of UNK public historical figures
UNK studies can be found on a variety of historical people including various artists or politicians
but this simply UNK a point that psychoanalysis is by the very nature UNK thus historical point er historical methods to trace one's actions and reports in the presents present er relation to those who they've experienced in the past
if your psychoanalysis is reports and not just the actions of it can be a used as arguments to er allow this story to emphasise what the human ages evolved at specific suicide of men erm goes on to show examples of his erm he actually claimed to have used this as a sort of process of identification of even UNK in order to try and er demonstrate how er i think it was UNK wall was built try to identify with engineers and architects who built UNK wall in order to try and work out what the actual function of the wall was
it wasn't it wasn't regarded it was regarded by a UNK er as just being er a big wall to stop UNK er attacking
people have said he er they seem to think that he was more he was more the sort of UNK divide sheriff sort of er league of division between er the two lands and he was also a sort of UNK post
erm this er again try to be right be er try to understand the mind instead of just looking at the harsh facts the hard cold facts and trying from there
so in effect there's a subjective animal which can be very useful when trying to explain a UNK for example employed for example the total i e prime and er also in the psychological
these books also extend beyond a UNK of the history by examining the development of UNK in society like as in the future of civilian
and also the relationship between the leaders and the masses in history er between the different groups er and then comparing the relations between these masses and different groups and different parts of history
er and it can be also er also er course in UNK in history and trace in theory selection in society
er psychoanalysis is important because it acts as a UNK as a realistic er dimension to historical analysis
there is a tendency to try and lo er continually adjust the plain hard facts without recognizing that they are they are in fact socially constructed
that's the objective
it must be UNK with the subject
for allowing ourselves to look at the report and find the actions and not just the actions themselves
erm so in this so in times of the woodrow wilson or perhaps freud er took the subject too far
allow his own feelings and thoughts just to run away with him which later er in rather er a nasty very er made some very UNK remarks of the family
but despite the er rather UNK nature of the context used there's enough flexibility and UNK within the subject content to say
the psychoanalysis can be used to a limited extent despite more collective historical roles er within UNK over conflicts in people or perhaps you say that all the time
erm going back to the subjective erm psychoanalysis introduces erm no that's the subject erm psychoanalysis introduces
also UNK themselves UNK themselves can't actually completely stand outside the events they are actually studying
i mean th they're just moving away from the issue because it it's using a psychoanalytic stories
try to give a UNK psychoanalytic study issue
erm can you keep with me
the er the very important experiences of this story were never to be received into his work
or our work
and would be useless the er content and electrons
i suppose er suppose that suppose that er main department store other contents from other dimensions
psychological content but again in that content in that er particular content UNK context can be useful
well done w well done excellent i mean
although as i said it was perhaps a mistake erm both classes produced excellent papers that th it was a first class paper in the other class and so was yours
didn't read the book
where did you get all that material from then
erm books on psycho history publish yours
right
oh you went through all the psycho history books
yeah well done
erm well it's a great achievement
i think that given that you were er you couldn't find the basic book that you were expected to read i thought you gave an excellent account of it i mean if you hadn't told us that you hadn't got the book i don't think we would have guessed would we
you would've got away with that one
but erm no absolutely first rate
well done
i think you can you can really erm you can really be proud of yourself on that
and erm well what do other people think i mean what i suppose no one else began to look at it either
i will be giving a lecture on it so i'll have my say about it
erm has anybody looked at any of the other books like for example the one on
did you
i didn't have time
has anybody got the time
i'll tell you the reason why i did this
erm in a way this was a bit UNK
what i what i thought was well let's have erm woodrow wilson okay as you said at the beginning of the book freud UNK that he didn't like wilson and that he felt UNK by wilson like a lot of people in central europe did i suppose because you know wilson came over erm with fourteen points as the saviour of the world and went away leaving with a piece of
and freud and a lot of other german speaking people thought that he had let them down because he didn't have the political goodness
erm and so freud at the beginning says that he er he had a personal dislike of er wilson and UNK him for what he had done and held him responsible for the subsequent disasters
so freud makes no bones about it
erm the book by UNK who's er labour was a labour m p no longer er keen collection reports
erm on i put in because it was the worst example i could find of the abuse of psychoanalysis for destroying somebody's personality UNK by er a psychoanalysis
you could imagine what it's like
i mean erm if you didn't know it was meant to be serious you might think it was a great send off of psychoanalysis you know
kind of make you UNK with UNK half the time erm and the contrast with that is the point which i don't know whether any of you has looked at of course called UNK truth
well as you might tell from the title UNK truth is the exact opposite to book because it UNK it makes a kind of psychoanalytic UNK you know as if UNK was some er great kind of saint
despite the fact that UNK one would have thought provided rich material for UNK like going to bed with his erm UNK and his lady doctor erm and naked and claiming that this was a specific exercise erm
nice work if you can get it
erm and so on so this was the this was the er this is what i was trying to do try and contrast the use of psychoanalysis in UNK from character UNK on one hand to UNK at the other and with freud's woodrow wilson somewhere in between but perhaps nearer the character UNK end because erm neither of them er neither of the authors were really had much of a brief of woodrow wilson
and really it was just as experiment and erm the reason i put it in was i thought well you know this is this is an ignored book and as you as you found to your cost it's actually hard to come by harder to come by than i expected
it's out of print
yeah it's out of print and erm but i though it raised interesting issues anyway
i mean did other people think that
and what kind of issues did you think it does raise
it's not worth psychoanalysis
right now as mentioned there's a whole literature on this course ps psycho history isn't there
they've even got their own journal
have you have you read any of this stuff
erm this is this is what this school of thought tries to do
in the past i used to have a class on psycho history and i dropped it and one of the reasons why i dropped it was the lit a lot of the UNK was very poor quality for a start and erm people er students er got that too and i couldn't really blame them
and er the other problem with it is you really have to know quite a lot about history or UNK to really to really get into
i think you found that with wilson
there was one chapter in the book i read it in the
all the pages in UNK
five or six pages instant analysis and it hardly
no
absolutely so
two UNK
if yo i hope you i suppose you could have a whole course in psycho history if you really put into it enough but for just one class i thought it was too much to ask students to attend to try and have to get into psycho history so i haven't erm done very much of it and this my excuse here really was well freud did write a book called woodrow wilson
it is touching on the social sciences in the sense that woodrow wilson was an important political figure and there is an historical dimension
so that was my excuse for bringing it in
but as says i mean it raises er a fundamental issue which is psychoanalysis or psycho are psycho UNK applicable to for example history or biology and this is the issue isn't it
what do people think that
is it just is it is it is it just UNK to think to talk about for example woodrow UNK childhood
i mean does anybody think that's a trivial approach to history
i mean
do you think so
yeah
do everybody agree with that
you tell it
yes of course erm the point has to be made that bullett unlike contemporary erm UNK of er wilson those people you mentioned actually knew wilson and an you know being his administration on that man as it were and apparently bullett had a lot a first hand erm UNK data didn't he according to the book
also tended towards to make a judgment of him
mm
i think
right
right and the background to that of course is for those of you who may not know bullett was i suppose a more junior person in the state department when he went to europe with woodrow wilson in nineteen eighteen and nineteen whenever it was for a peace conference and bullett was the only one of the american delegation who resigned and confronted wilson and said look you've gone back on the fourteen points you're not doing what you said you would do
how can you go on with this and bullett was the only one of them who resigned and went home
and er later of course he became the american UNK of vienna so freud met him but so bullett had a personal stake in this but i must admit er my own view was rather to admire bullett for his stand because it's a rare politician who stands up and says look you know we've been there having made promises we've broken all of them and we ought to resign or you ought to resign
he told wilson
and he said you know if you aren't going to resign i certainly am
and he did
so erm it's quite true that bullett had a personal axe to grind i think it was a rather justified axe
but erm it er that fact remains he did nail wilson
he was at the conference and a lot of the book if you read the book is concerned with what actually happened at the conference and basically the basic problem with the book tries to look at and this is where we get back to question of the childhood days
why couldn't wilson stand up to the allies why couldn't had stand up to UNK or lloyd george in particular
they seem to have bullied him and made him er make concessions and the question that freud and bullett constantly ask is why did wilson make these concessions especially since his position was already defined before he came to europe you know he already laid down the fourteen points and sold it to the american people
and then he came to europe and really let it all go
and their answer of course is look here was erm there's no political or historical reason because wilson had all the cards in his hand
the admittedly the french and the british were on the right side they won the war but france er was er UNK in the war lost an awful lot of people it's a common and although this country although you know fighting in britain the er british economy was also badly damaged
we were borrowing money from the americans to keep going and er we certainly weren't in any shape to dictate the terms of the peace to the americans
and er so freud and bullett say look if wilson had all the power at the time and some ways the world in nineteen eighty to twenty was a bit like what it is today after the collapse of the soviet union really you really only got one UNK
if the americans had all the power why did woodrow wilson just sell out to the allies
so bullett and freud conclude well it has to be something to do with him personally
and their conclusion is he couldn't stand up to lloyd george in and the reason was these were strong erm male leaders and wilson when it came to being with men er was weak and the question asked is why was he weak in dealing with men
and the answer is well if you look at his relationship with his father er he was very UNK by his father he was very passive and UNK towards his father
and so there they claim that his childhood was relevant because of this character UNK in wilson his UNK to stand up to strong men
even though UNK he had all the strength on his side and if he'd only UNK insisted the allies would have had to accept the fourteen points because there was no way that they just didn't have any erm any UNK really when finally settled in peace
wilson could almost have dictated it to them and perhaps another man would have
so this is their justification for bringing in the childhood
what do you think of that remark
is that legitimate do you think or not
yeah i think it is erm you have when you see the UNK
well what about the view let me kind of play UNK advocate here against freud and bullett
what about the view
that in history the important things of economic er historical social forces which UNK any individual
what about that view that the individual person even a powerful one like the president of the united states doesn't really count compared with economic social UNK political forces what about that argument how does that
is that the kind of argument that carries any weight with you
erm i can tell you what the other to look at the personality things like that
right
it seems you know because freud didn't actually analyze just to make a UNK about things he knew about some of the people
yes
and that sort of thing counts for what
yes that's let me see who that is
hi
well that's his office there
he's not there now
i don't know
have a word with his secretary
erm the yes i mean this is a big problem isn't it
the question is as you rightly say in psychoanalysis the UNK usually has a vast amount much more than people normally realize i mean i recall from my own analysis and mean i was going between two and four times a week erm for an hour each time and it was a good six months before she would make any interpretations and i used to get very frustrated you know i used to say things like well what do you think of this miss you know
what do you think of that and she would say well it's too early or we don't know yet
you know and she would constantly say that and before six months there weren't any interpretations at all
then when interpretations did come particularly if i UNK them then it would be she would be ready with the information
she would say there there's the of that dream or those associations with this you did
there was all that and so on and she would be ready with it and there was a lot of material there
the problem as you rightly say with this kind of UNK that how do you know if you've got enough material and that it's right
also if you actually read the book there is quite a lot of material in the book it's quite a big book in some ways and er the material on UNK childhood and so on erm is pretty detailed
i mean there is quite a lot seems to be known about wilson and he himself erm wrote a lot in enormous correspondence and so on and many of the points they make are erm are fairly well UNK
why for example one of the points that freud's book makes is er when wilson was confronted with a conflict particularly with a stronger male like an elder brother or his father he would UNK into speech making and apparently he used to have a barn where he did it and he used to go and give speeches in the barn
he used to speak to the hay as it were and he would do this er rather UNK
this kind of speech making
and of course when he was a man he was famous for his speeches apparently he was a great was a great UNK you know it was the age of UNK i suppose
erm we heard a great he was a great erm UNK so when freud and bullett say look woodrow wilson was a great UNK and you can see him doing this in his childhood
there is actual evidence that he did do it in his childhood and th so they're not erm they're kind of building everything on a single sentence like UNK does you know UNK enough UNK 's book starts with entry of who's who in a single phrase where she calls herself daughter of her father
doesn't mention her mother and UNK 's whole UNK about was built on this single phrase in who's who
words some future UNK that the printer here missed that bit you know she should have said and her mother's name but her mother's got missed out on the UNK or something i don't this is the kind of thing that happens of course
UNK 's entire book will collapse er as perhaps it should
being a writer of course being the data problem er this is a big problem in psychoanalysis because whereas erm in an analysis the UNK has er hundreds or probably thousands of UNK data from the pre associations of the patient at the end
the er that kind of thing is never published and or even of course it can't be published normally and the result is that when analysts draw conclusions based on this very confidential data or who were talking vastly extent
it it's very difficult to UNK perhaps erm publicly
yeah
making explanations the other way round
they are
theory that you made a mistake and you've got to somehow explain that
they are
they are they're starting with the end result and of course in this particular book they're what they're starting with really wasn't a general psychological UNK of wilson so much has the problem why did wilson give everything away in the conference
that
they work backwards as you rightly say
the best defence you could make of that if you wanted to make a defence of it would be that in the nineteen twenties and thirties as we've been seeing in the lectures i'll be saying a bit more about that some UNK was developing
it's analysis of the UNK as we've been seeing in analysis was really all it could do at the beginning after the first world war shall we say
breaking point
after the first world war ego analysis was developing
now one of the consequences that ego analysis was analysts began to feel confident that they could analyze the defences of the ego as well as what the ego repressed as a result of its defences
as a result of that you could examine a defensive structure and work out why it existed
for example supposing you erm this was used principally in child analysis which didn't exist before the first world war it was developed afterwards
the problem with child analysis is children won't be associated that can be made to free associate
i mean don't ask me to explain it's technical and so it's a very technical matter of ego psychology that you must accept
they can't be UNK to do it
and anyway they don't have the motives
children are always for analysis usually by their parents they don't usually come of their
so the analysts found they couldn't use free association with children
what they could use was defence analysis
so for example if you saw a child who was UNK independent wouldn't form emotional UNK or UNK on other people of the way the child wanted it
the UNK might conclude well why is this defence structure excessive independence present in this child
a good suggestion might be in the past this child has suffered a loss of some figure it was dependent on and has UNK by becoming highly independent
this was a common finding and freud often found this in all children during the war
some of them UNK by becoming highly independent in the end
so what you could do you could see the defence and then from that you could work backwards to the motive of the defence
so perhaps the reason is the loss of a love object and then of course if you found there was a in fact a loss of a love object then you might to see in greater detail how this whole thing came about
particularly if you discover that child didn't have a bad characteristic in their in their ego before this event occurred and so on
so that kind of thing made analysts think that they could go on more than just free associations they could look at a person's character as it were
the structure of ego defences and then draw conclusions
and really you see that's what freud and bullett are doing in this book
they're looking at UNK character which was quite a peculiar one in both senses of the word and not just peculiar in the sense of you obviously need to him a peculiar sense of kind of funny peculiar
and they try to work backwards as you rightly say to his childhood to explain why and of course they felt that their explanation explained the favour of conflicts because the whole thing was here was a man with an almighty father
who saw himself as jesus really and although jesus came to save the world he saved the world in a rather UNK manner by getting crucified
well that's exactly what happened to woodrow wilson
he came to save the world in nineteen eighteen but he got crucified by UNK or lloyd george
they made UNK of fourteen points
and er so it's an attempt to work backwards but it has a certain justification in UNK technique
but of course as you and er rightly said in an analysis you would always be able to confirm these interpretations from the patient because in the end of course psychoanalysis is done by the patient the UNK doesn't do it
the UNK normally just helps
in the end the analysis is gonna occur it's the patient who really doesn't analyze their ego comes to grips with the unconscious
of course in a book you can't handle them and you can't handle them when the subject is dead
so that will UNK dimension of psychoanalysis what the patient does for himself and cannot possibly count and as you rightly say this leaves UNK erm in a in a kind of UNK
which is i really do unsatisfactory
and er one has to admit when you look at the literature of like you know UNK and this kind of thing and a lot of it's psycho history stuff
erm you can't help feeling that there has been a mistake
is that your impression of this
no one does that yes that's erm
well what why do you think
why
erm just having different it's different than what
yeah
it's different than what people normally think
yes it's interesting you see if you if you can compare freud with other writers who are in the same kind of area and league like
why do people put up with anything from
er we know that UNK a lot of his female patients
he forced his wife to put up with having his UNK living in the house with them
unfortunate woman erm er he as long as they were winning the war was open in his UNK of hitler and the UNK
his none of this is ever mentioned about you know mention to anybody and there's er you know er you know he's one of the good guys
but er if freud had done any of that you'd never hear the end of it
freud UNK you know freud UNK all this kind of stuff
people would go on about
erm and yet erm people like could get away with it
er you know great UNK local supporter of the UNK before world war two
all forgotten afterwards
somehow is an okay man
okay total crap about the aggression of something a book on aggression
totally wrong
nobody animal er behaviour accepts that nonsense any more
yeah you know is okay he's an okay name
but erm UNK freud as you rightly say a moment there's anything you can see wrong if certainly happens to darwin
you can have hardly few weeks or months go by when you see some you know er latest UNK of darwin you know appears in the press
everyone says oh i know darwin was wrong
it's almost always crap
the latest book was total crap
i mean it really was
it should never got any attention in the press yet there was all bits in the sunday times darwin UNK
the reason could be of course as you say that people like darwin and freud have made really important UNK and that's why nobody can leave them alone
basically UNK people UNK people
and do you know so what so what you just forget about that
there've been plenty of people like that all down history and plenty of them UNK who've had UNK and silly ideas that everyone's forgotten about
but
take the time just to study
oh surely
that that's one of the big that's one of the big problems
it could be of course that we're too near to them because if you think about it this has happened to most great UNK in science they were for the first erm certainly for the first century there's often a tremendous er UNK
i mean take erm people like UNK er UNK and UNK
if you look at their work for about the first hundred years after all of them their work was widely er UNK and rejected
then after about a hundred years suddenly people seemed to change their to change their minds about it
of course the hundred years is only just up for darwin and not yet up for freud depending on when you start the hundred years it makes a
erm the er there seems to be kind of UNK period when great UNK in human thought are followed by considerable UNK and upset and the figure responsible becomes a kind of er you know UNK person that people get perhaps that's certainly true of darwin though i think it's UNK now
but er it was certainly true of er even be true of people like UNK you know the tremendous anti UNK ruled particularly in germany which UNK it
it was jewish and so on and because UNK was jewish and therefore he had to be more jewish science and erm there was a book published called fifty against UNK
UNK comment was one would have been enough and as usual of course UNK was right
one would have been enough if they had any good arguments or data which er they didn't have
i erm i suppose this is this is a phenomenon of human history
the trouble with woodrow wilson of course is if you want to get some get freud well this book is very handy because as you've seen it does solve all your problems
my guess is that in about twenty or thirty years' time it would be UNK and people would start to re think oh well perhaps this is not so
true
but in writing historical erm analysis and UNK presumably people i mean people can't help er writing history and trying to answer questions like why did woodrow wilson erm not the fourteen points through and presumably one possible explanation is the kind of freud bullett approach and presumably if you can find erm relevant data and if you convince and if you can convince that that's UNK it's a legitimate thing to attempt to do
we are not saying that necessarily it's the right thing to do but it seems to me people are going to do it anyway aren't they
people are anyway going to try and look for lo look for explanations and it may be that you know in fifty or a hundred years' time peoples insight into freud's findings are different
and this is my personal view as you know i think that people see er freud completely differently in fifty or a hundred years' time
possibly because freud himself you now was misunderstood
to such a large extent some of the things were misunderstood that he discovered
and when people see psychoanalysis in a different content then they might look back to things freud and bullett studies and say well perhaps it wasn't so amusing after all
erm the sorry one thing i was going say before we finish because is our only american here and since woodrow wilson was a great american
what's the what kind of impression have you got from er you know from your education and er and trying to focus at home about woodrow wilson
how does he seem today by america
does he is he regarded as a great figure or
mm
erm he is erm regarded as in terms of erm he tried so hard and just
mm
yeah
right be with you in a sec
yeah
yes
yep
that's right
that must be the that must be the consensus
yeah
because i asked in the other classes three or four american students and i asked them the same question
it's very
and they gave the same answer
the history erm you know america history of very interesting and erm
oh really oh are you
er
between the wars and you didn't know this that erm loads of the history that i read here in britain very different from the history
yeah
so they so do you think there's a tendency for americans still to kind of UNK wilson but for europeans to be a bit more cynical
well i think not that they're afraid not to be but
well i think they have a lot to do quite a lot to do with it
obviously that erm i just think that i don't know it it's very different from
mm
whereas god is not always really always the truth reality
mm
yes
this is history that you really believe it
sure
yes
but at the same time you should go some place else
to get a different view
to get a different view and yet i it's been very interesting it's been very interesting
you know what i mean you know always
i nearly cost her a and she don't know
that's true that's true yes sure yes
not fair
it's on a personal level
yeah
well it it's just coming up to three er well done
congratulations and apologies
as i said i won't do this next year
not unless the book comes out again
can i remind who isn't here
right if you see tell her
yes
now if you see tell her how much we missed her
er next week we're gonna miss her even more because she's supposed to be doing the paper
as we'll see another if this was a black book of freud's and in some ways you would say this was one of the UNK
the other UNK other UNK book is on next week when we shall see freud erm UNK not woodrow wilson but moses
so don't miss it folks
and certainly make sure doesn't
thanks
erm i've managed to write an essay or two would you
this week our guest on sharing time is UNK who is one of the UNK of the piper alpha disaster and is one who has come back to orkney this last week staying with his family here in orkney
first of all looking back on those UNK times of the sixth of july what do you remember about the incident UNK
well it was at night and i mean i was lucky enough to be working which is a thing that's probably accounted for saving a lot of people
most of the UNK were ones who were working at the time
and i was working upstairs in er what's called the UNK module which was shut down at the time for repair work and things like that
and a call came over the radio that there was a problem with one of the pumps downstairs so seeing i had nothing better to do at that time i went downstairs to give them a hand
which again is a part of the luck which probably saved me and er when i got down to the pump which was directly below where the explosion occurred there was about three or four of us there and er as i said that the only indication that we got out it was a an enormous bang just directly overhead
and there was dust and everything went black all the lights went out so i mean from that w we could ascertain that it was fairly serious what had happened
and er we moved away to the side of the platform to get out from underneath whatever had happened and had a look around
there was nothing visible downstairs where we were so immediately went up the stairs at the side to the production level where the blast had come from and there we met a group of people who had just come out of the control room and they were cut and suffering from shock 'cos the blast had obviously well it d nearly blown the control room apart
i mean the doors were hanging on their hinges then things like that
and by the time we got there we could see a fire round at the back of the crane UNK which was in b module where most of the oil separation plant is
and er at that stage we tried the fire UNK but i mean there was no water in the pumps the electric pumps there was no UNK electric power 'cos the UNK electric er generator was blown to bits well they weren't working anyway
and er the diesel pumps weren't on and er there was a couple of guys putting on breathing apparatus and trying to get in to UNK them but i mean by this stage the smoke was so thick they couldn't even find where the pumps were
you can hardly see your hand in front of your face and er i mean there was no way to fight the fire so i mean all we could do was sort of stand back and look 'cos we were up there was about at that stage there was twenty or thirty of us standing in this north west corner of the platform
and er th the fire was getting that bad that i mean the smoke was blowing directly across the platform at that stage
and er take a couple of steps away from the corner you couldn't see your a thing so we were more or less stuck where we where
we could go downstairs to the sixty eight foot level was er fog horn and lighting system for in the fog it's a UNK system they call it
and er that was a platform down there
and off that there was a big UNK rope which c was thrown down
and er guys started to go down that to the twenty foot level where they were picked up by an UNK off the standby boat
but i mean it was about twenty to thirty guys as i said
and i mean as they went down we got the UNK so there was a few of them there
and er the ones out of the control room they managed to get down that stage we would be about half an hour after it after the initial blast
and be about five or six of us left then and we were just getting ready to get off when we got hit by the second big blast which caused most of the burns to all of us then
and at that stage it was too late to go down the rope so it was just UNK more than anything else that we just jumped over the side from where we were then
and er after that it was just well every man for himself i never really saw any of the guys except for the o one guy who was on the platform with me at the time
i saw him when we got picked up off the i mean it was half a lifeboat we were left sitting on
when we got picked up and he was on it with me then
but i mean being in the water i had no life jacket or anything like that so it was a matter of trying to keep UNK and er kicking off my boots and getting me UNK
and er i mean it was all luck everything that sort of happened to me that night anyway i mean it wasn't so lucky for other people but i suppose most UNK have their tale or so
fortune having smiled on them and i mean if it hadn't been for a lump of expanded UNK out of one of the life boats that had blown up at if it hadn't come floating past me i mean i would have been a UNK as well but i got hold of that
i managed to keep UNK then till as i said we found this half a lifeboat and there was couple of fellows and er i managed to swim over to that and pull myself up on it and for there the UNK off the standby boat came alongside picked us up and put us on then standby boat
at that stage then there was accounts of the sea almost being on fire with the oil and the mixture
what sort of experience how did you find that
well i never saw the sea on fire but f when we UNK went into the sea i mean we were directly beneath the platform and at that stage i mean the whole platform was on fire
and we couldn't you couldn't just swim on the surface because if you let any part of your body above the water for any length of time i mean it just burnt
so i mean you had to sort of come up and grab a breath and go under the water and try and swim away from it
which in the sea was pretty UNK really i mean you just had to go where the sea took you
and luckily it just took us round the side of the platform and away then
were there quite a few vessels around at that time that were giving assistance
well i can remember when i went was in the water at the start there was you could see a lot of boats coming in alongside the platform
but er it wasn't long after that there was another big bang on the platform and they all sort of turned tail and went away for their own safety
which was pretty UNK for us that were in the water at the time but
so at that point then did you almost give up hope that you would be rescued that you more or less were going to end in the sea at that point
aye well i mean that there's so many things that go through your mind that in a situation like that
i mean you've got to try and keep yourself UNK and then even that's not going to help you if nobody comes along and picks you up either so i mean that but i mean i didn't oh well i suppose i could say i gave up hope a few times but obviously if you s the struggle to survive comes through in the long run and i mean it's not easy to give up hope
at that stage when you were picked up then what happened the where were you taken to after that
well we were taken up to the standby boat which is i mean every UNK in the north sea every rig and installation has a boat that circles it non stop twenty four hours a day and i mean that the standby boat on piper i mean it was the two UNK boats off it that picked everybody up and most folk up and one of them was lost they lost two of the crew off that
i think that was hit by UNK off the platform
but i mean it was it that we were taken to first and i mean thee was a lot of people on it and i mean it had obviously saved a lot of lives
and er we were on that for about an hour or so and then they got rid of the badly injured were taken off then and put on the UNK it's support UNK that was just happened to be there at the time
and it and it's emergency hospital on it and i mean they'd flown doctors out from aberdeen and UNK off other platforms round about
so you were actually were you taken to UNK as well
for treatment
mhm
i was taken here but at the time i mean i wasn't one of the really seriously burnt i mean i was still conscious and i was still walking around
and it was just me arm and me hand and me face that were burnt and at that the time i mean i wasn't in any pain and i think there was more serious ones to be dealt with
at that point then you were UNK back to a hospital in aberdeen
aye
it were six five or six o'clock in the morning i think i arrived in aberdeen at six o'clock
to aberdeen royal UNK where i were treated
yeah
and there'd been quite a number there obviously in that burns unit who were suffering from the same type of er injury
well i mean it's considering the number of s UNK there wasn't that many that were burnt
i mean there were only been about at the most ten who were suffering from burns
maybe five or six that were quite serious one
i there was a couple that were really seriously badly burnt and one of them didn't survive
when actually did you sustain your burns and you said that was actually on the second blast
aye that was well that was on the platform when i got me face burnt and me left hand which i think was burnt trying to protect me head or face at the time
i don't know how me right hand survived it i mean it's quite good
and er after that i think my right UNK got badly burnt
but i think that was when i was in the sea holding on to the bit of UNK and more or less just let myself float under the water but me arm was round the top of the bit of UNK on the surface and i think it got burnt by the heat off the platform then
obviously you were in hospital for a number of weeks
what about the treatment that you were given in aberdeen
did you find that they were obviously sympathetic to what happened and the spirit in the hospital would have been quite UNK really
aye
well i mean i can't say enough for the people in the aberdeen royal UNK i mean they've got a great burns unit there and i mean er i think the plastic UNK and what knot are about they must be some of the best in the world
just looking at what they've done to me
and er they treated me there i mean i was about two weeks in a room on me own and taken out then into the main ward for another four weeks
and i mean the nurses and everybody the doctors were really great and they give us the best of treatment there and i don't think you'll speak to anybody that was in the hospital that'll say anything differently they were really great
obviously with that number of weeks that you were in hospital it must have given you plenty of time too to think about future prospects in a fairly dangerous industry in the north sea
what about your feelings now looking back on it
do you think that you would like to return to the platform work
aye well we've all spoken about it before and i mean yo when we were in hospital we spoke together about it and er obviously it's something you that won't really be able to tell unless you give it try
and i mean i would like to go offshore again just to prove to myself whether i could or could not do it
i mean whether i'll ever work offshore UNK another thing but i would like to try going offshore i mean then again i mean i reckon i could work offshore no problem at all but whether i could sleep on the platform is a completely different matter
there would always be that fear that it a similar incident might happen and er and that er it was those who were asleep at the time who were UNK enough not to survive
well they wasn't the most UNK
to put it like that
but er i mean we we've spoken about it before on the platform and things like that i mean everybody knows the score that if something happens if you're if you're sleeping you've not got a an excellent chance put it like that i mean you er i mean nobody ever expected anything like what happened on piper to happen any on that scale
i mean even wh when we saw it ourselves i mean you couldn't UNK the scale
i mean i can remember being underneath the platform being on fire and i mean i just kept saying to myself that this wasn't really happening
how about the safety er precautions that were taken on board piper or in fact on board any oil platform installation
it wouldn't have been able to cope with such an immediate UNK as happened on that night
no i mean i don't think what happened on piper can be put down to basic safety
i mean i don't think it was a gas UNK it wouldn't have caused an explosion to the extent of that
and at the time i mean it's half past nine all work had stopped mostly at that time of night anyway
so i mean there was no poor operating but this is going on i wouldn't have thought
so i mean it goes down to must be something like equipment failure which is something that nobody can really allow for
what sort of safety training had you had for an evacuation or in fact a slow evacuation from the platform while you were out there
well i mean everybody goes to robert does their off shore survival which takes you into helicopter survival and l launching UNK off the platform and life UNK ev and er that done i mean you get your certificates and what not for that and everybody is to get UNK courses every two or three years i'm not really sure which
and then on the platform every week there's a evacuation drill where it's usually on a sunday night or a saturday night it was changed to recently
but the platform general alarm goes off and everybody goes to their master stations by the lifeboat
and then they test the evacuation alarm then so that everybody knows the alarms and er where to be and then th every six eight weeks or something they take you for a helicopter evacuation where everybody's taken from the lifeboat master station
taken the whole way upstairs to the UNK where they go through their er helicopter evacuation drill then
but er all of that was UNK by the fact with the amount of fire and smoke that was on the platform nobody could get to the UNK
and plus the fact that with the control room had been taken out nobody could sound the general evacuation alarms either there was no alarms or anything or any warning for anybody on the platform either
and as you say at that stage it really was just a matter of erm every man for himself really
aye well that's it er i mean there was no as i said there was no alarms for anybody else or anybody who wasn't there really wouldn't have a much of an idea to how drastic it was and what was going on at the time
as i said you can't envisage or set up emergency procedures for anything as drastic as what happened there that night
i mean wh when your whole control UNK wiped out and er you can't really expect anything like that
i mean un unless you make the control room blast proof which is maybe a thing to be looked in to in the future and then again they're speaking about making the accommodation module separate from the platform itself which is another thing but i mean that's all to be looked at
but whether you scrap all the platforms that are at present built in the north UNK another thing all together
there has been some criticism of general safety precautions on board UNK and platforms out on the north sea
do you have any general feelings about that do you feel that things could be tightened up
i suppose there's always a room for safety procedures to be tightened up i mean it's like in any place you work
everybody's completely happy with the procedures that go on
but er it's difficult it's difficult at sea
i mean from rig to rig things work differently and i mean on piper i would say there were probably things that could have been tightened up but then again i don't think they were part and parcel of what happened and there on july the sixth
the government has now said that they're going to order oil companies to install shut off valves below platforms
do you feel that would have solved the situation on piper alpha altogether or how far would it have gone to perhaps UNK the blow of the occasion
it's hard to say how much that would have helped the situation out there i mean it definitely would have helped in some degree but i mean there was still all the oil that was present on the platform in the UNK except those which were left under pressure all that would have had to burn
and er as i've said before i haven't seen a barrel of oil burning and the heat and smoke that comes off that you consider the amount of oil that would have been in the UNK on the platform at the time i think it would have still have caused an awful lot of heat and an awful lot of smoke and fire and er just shutting off the oil coming back to the platform maybe wouldn't have helped that much
but i mean a any anything in a situation like that's going to help
again with the time that you were in hospital considering your future what did your family think about your possibility of you going back out
well i mean they've never really spoken about it one way or another encouraged me or UNK me which i think i'm grateful for
i mean if there's a decision to be made i hope they'll just leave it up to me
i think that and i mean you go with the sort of attitude that UNK will never strike twice in the same place but then again i mean who knows
clearly it was a time when so many people were lost and it was the world's worst oil rig disaster
looking back on that then you must have lost a great number of colleagues and UNK that it must give you sort of mixed feelings looking back on it
well it does i mean it's i mean i've been there about just over three years three and a half years
i mean when you're working for a week at a time with the same blokes week in week out i mean you get to know them really well
it is difficult to come to terms with the fact that i mean it's people that you've worked with for a week at a time and i mean for three and a half years every second week you're working with that guys in a confined space you get to know them really well
and i mean it is your sort of second home and the guys that you work with every week i mean sort of become i mean it's a bit of a UNK to say but i mean part of a family that you living out there that you live with out there and it is a real i mean when you think of the number that was lost i mean there were a lot of close friends involved in it
obviously having such a close brush with death is something that you you've obviously lived through and be something that er you must feel strongly about
do you feel that this particular incident has changed your attitude towards life
i can't honestly say that up to now i've thought that much about it
i mean i've only just come out of hospital and as it is i'm still fairly well UNK with it
and you think that you're lucky to be alive in that respect but i've never really thought that i was specially picked out for some reason to carry on living
but then again in the future it might sink in that there was a special reason for it i don't know
obviously with so many having lost their lives on the disaster you say that you don't feel it's maybe an act of god int hat sense that you were picked to be saved but erm you don't feel any guilt as such either o that you were one of the ones and er so many others had been lost
no i don't feel guilty i mean i would i would love to see everybody that was on the platform still alive
but then again i think i would i would be lying if i said that i wish it was me rather than anybody else
but no i mean i mean i've lost a lot of good friends on it and i would love to see them back alive but there's nothing much i can do about it
very shortly after the incident an appeal fund was set up and money poured in to that from various sources including the oil companies themselves
what's your reaction to that sort of appeal fund
don't you think that perhaps it might have been better for the oil companies to have perhaps done more at an earlier stage in the safety side of things
or how about the questions about an appeal for the victims and er relatives of the disaster
well i personally think with an appeal fund like that i mean the amount of money that's gone into it is ridiculous considering the amount of compensation that everybody's going to get or hopes to get after it
i mean the only thing that an appeal fund like that should do is to give the UNK and UNK of the dead of the platform it should give them immediate money to tide them over until they get their compensation which they need
and er the amount of money that's in the appeal fund whereas it shows a great feeling of warmth from the general public i think i don't i mean there's people dying all over the world even at home here in orkney there's people that dying they don't receive any great compensation for that
and i mean i think that if it was spread more i mean if people locally gave more to UNK in their own areas i mean it would go down a lot more good there
i said that the UNK are gonna they'll either UNK pay or they're going have to pay a lot of compensation to the UNK and er fund more or less just going to top up any money when it's probably not going to be necessary in the long run
at this stage then having spent so many weeks in hospital how long will you be required to continue further visits to you know up update the treatment
well i mean i think the UNK that they've done the major UNK anyway are finished and er they seemed to have taken really well so i mean it's just a matter of time really for them to settle
and i mean they say with skin UNK it takes two years before they're completely settled and accepted
and er i've got to go back next week for a sort of check up and i mean i suppose that'll continue for weeks to come
but er it's just a matter of time now for the UNK to UNK a bit and things like that that's mainly the worst that's left
so in sense then that er the extent of your injuries really would not UNK you from working offshore as far as you understand
i've never really asked the extent the limitations of the injuries that i've got
i mean i'm going on the on the opinion that full UNK come back and i'll be able to do any work that i was doing before and there'll be no change at all
the only problem is with er the skin UNK and that
they say that i mean any changes any in temperature are very UNK so w like it is working in the middle of winter offshore would be something i would have to come to terms with but no i mean i don't think there's any problems work wise
i would hope not anyway
clearly it has been a an extremely trying time for you
how have people UNK and responded to your treatment and really erm how they feel about things now
well in hospital i mean the number of cards and get well cards and well good wishes i received and offers of help from people
i mean there's people i hadn't even seen for years that were staying there in aberdeen came along and offered help
and everybody that sent cards i mean it was really great i mean get well cards are sort of things that you see in shops and you never really think about it but when you're lying flat on your back in hospital and you get cards for people i mean it really does give you a lift
and i mean i can't thank the people enough that sent them all
and i mean there are too many to name individually as well
but i mean it's it er it was great i mean the fact that i was i mean in aberdeen i was away from home i mean you didn't even notice it because of the number of UNK that UNK in by the hospital and as i said sent cards and letters it was great
well thank you very much UNK for sharing time with us this thursday lunchtime and we'll wish you a very speedy recovery and hope it won't be too long in fact before you're back at work
thank you
from my country UNK i can remember fields of UNK less common now but i do know of it still being grown in orkney
it was easier to grow in less UNK soil
its UNK straw is preferable for UNK as straw for the straw UNK was called now called orkney chairs
and there was UNK not grown in any great quantity but derived from the late UNK seed oats
perhaps to make use of the end UNK of a field where turnips had been UNK
still fresh and green at the back end it could provide a UNK supplement to the diet of a early UNK cow or for the UNK animals newly brought in to the UNK for the winter
UNK would be the UNK of UNK
to turn back the pages to my early memories of harvest time on the smaller farms is to have opened a book on UNK
for in the UNK eye the harvest field is UNK by busy farm folk from the neighbourhood i knew
i can see the horses and even the UNK harvest mice UNK through a forest of UNK
a sight that might have UNK professor
in fine weather it was pleasant to be in the harvest field but as the season wore on UNK of cold or bleak UNK of wind driven rain made it UNK to handle the wet sheaves
whether gathering after the UNK or the UNK or UNK the sheaves clothes could become UNK wet
long black shiny UNK could blow about and still the UNK rain got in
who said orkney had horizontal rain
in UNK standing for too long in wet weather the UNK of sheaves might become UNK as UNK set in
sharp corn UNK from the heads of UNK could creep UNK up the inside of a UNK as i well remember
green seeds of corn were termed corn ends
as some of the old orkney words and expressions fall in to UNK links in the valuable heritage that UNK us to our UNK are broken
they are much more than just UNK old fashioned words
a cold drying wind UNK called a UNK dried out stacks that were on the wet side
straw ropes called UNK from UNK were tied round about these stacks or UNK to protect the sheaves from the UNK
UNK would blow down and be set up to blow over again and wet heavy sheaves might have to be UNK over and over again
tea and UNK brought in a big orkney basket to the UNK and eaten while seated in the UNK of the UNK was a special treat
UNK lit up UNK pipes and soon the air was full of the UNK smoke of twist tobacco i think it was probably called x UNK roll and many a UNK was spoken while they were thus enjoying their break
just before m w when my father and mother when they were UNK before they got married to with yeah
yes fine okay
right
off you go then
well my father was a farmer working at home with his mother who was a widow in
and my mother she was a dress maker or an apprentice UNK if that is the correct term
and er they were UNK and er my grandmother she was UNK the park front they called it in UNK in where the agricultural college is now
er were the name of the gentry who were living in the place
and erm my father and another lad who was working out in the had to go called michael had to go down every evening to pump water for the animal
there was no running water in the fields only a shaft with a pump
then they had to go and pump water for the stock
and the ambition of all the farm lads then was to get on good terms with the UNK in the UNK because after the gentry they'd had their dinner the UNK could invite whoever they liked into the cellar and UNK for supper
and erm my father and michael had got to know the UNK in the UNK but michael had grabbed the good looking of the parlour maid and my father had to make do with the cook
and well it's not nice to say that a girl is fat these days but she was all ample UNK we'll put it like that
and she was called tiny
but it wasn't to be the for the friendship with tiny that my father got to have the UNK good supper that they provided in the servants room
and he'd be there once or twice and then on the wednesday evening as was his custom he went down to the village he had a date with my mother and there she was standing by the shop in the square and when she saw him coming down she turned and said she said and UNK her UNK round
go back to your tiny she said and off she went home
well my father wasn't giving in so easy
and then h instead of walking home from the chapel on sunday night with my mother he started walking home with her father
my grandfather thomas he was a carpenter
and the were they lived it was on a bit of a rise about the square in and he was a very keen gardener
his curtain could be seen from the square and it was something worth looking at
and that was his pride and joy
and then my father became a very keen gardener and asking thomas how do you do th this and how do you do that
well my boy said the old man it would be easier if you were to come over you see for me to show you than try to tell you here
so my father went over on the monday evening and after such a young man paid such interest in the garden and paying so much UNK well you can't go home without coming in for a cup of tea
and that is how he got on good terms with my mother again
in
and he went duly they got married and very fortunately there was a little of twelve acres just in the bottom of the field adjoining
called
and the that is where they started their married life
my father working at home with his mother and farming this l twelve acre holding and my grandmother erm sub UNK the park for him
he was doing a bit of dealing as well
we'll have a chat about the old dealers later
doing a bit of dealing and er keeping the stock he was buying and selling in this twelve acre park in
well it was quite a change for my mother from being a UNK to being a well a UNK wife
she had no idea about UNK or anything but she very soon got used to it
erm but the most unfortunate thing that old edward the old chap who owned the place he was living in part of the house and old jane his UNK my mother she could UNK bread and wash her mother had taught her that but it was making butter that was the problem
and old jane said don't you worry my girl er i'll make the butter for you
and my mother they were keeping six cows there after churning old jane made the butter and er taking it to erm mrs from who used to buy my UNK butter my mother took her stock as well on the thursday to market
but the following thursday mrs said well i'm very sorry my dear i can't accept your butter because last week's lot didn't keep
old jane hadn't take enough trouble to make it proper and wash all the UNK out
and it had gone bad
ah
my mother she cried oh she did she cried all night
after going to bed that night
she was so UNK you know
a young farmer's wife having her first batch of butter er rejected
and erm she was determined that she would have a go her own the following week
and the following wednesday she just didn't know how to tell the old lady but it's odd how fate takes a hand occasionally
the old lady was er opening the not a just what we call the chamber er the downstairs bedroom
opening the window and somehow or other the UNK it fell back caught both her hands and UNK her finger
and there she was crying and shouting in there
well my mother was very sorry that the old lady had hurt her fingers but th on the other hand she was very pleased that she couldn't make the butter
and from then on er there was never a UNK at all my mother was considered to be one of the best butter maker i in the vicinity
and as i had told you before on the previous er chat we had how my father took over er when i was two years old we moved up
his mother gave up farming and he took things over
and for the first five years of my life i just led a very lonely life with only the my grandmother and my parents and the farm men
and i was v the and my grandmother they had got me UNK on horses then
not realizing that they were pr preaching about the glory that been
and i would be always be with john in the stable and i got until i got into er some danger walking er underneath a horses legs and he'd send me out banned me from the stable and shut the door
then for a day or so i would be the cow man's mate
when i was with the cattle i always wore my the cap on the side of my head
that was way the co sign of a UNK wearing his cap right on the side of his over his ear
was it
but the cow man he wore his cap w with the peak over h er the back of his head
back to front cos he'd be carrying a lot of hay on his back and that was to stop the hay seed going down between it shirt and his skin
and then i'd be wearing my cap back to front for a day or so
working with the with the cow man but i very soon got tired i'd be begging to be allowed back into the stable because the horses were my first love
well when i was about five one morning my father fixed a UNK over the back bone of the bike
that was the way we travelled then
practically nobody had a car in at the time
and then er tie a UNK over the back bone of the bike and have me sitting er on this UNK on the f bike in front of him
he had we started out somewhere i had no idea where we were going until we arrived at this big building with a high UNK surrounding the yard and a crowd of children shouting and playing in the yard
it was then that i realized that he was going to leave me on my own
in this building
and i had never been away from home because er too far from the village
i had never had been playing with other children
and when i realized this i started kicking and crying
and he said well what would you prefer go to school quietly or come with me over the hedge to have a UNK
well both are awkward i said but i will stand a light UNK if i can come home with you after
but then miss the i learned later she was the UNK teacher one of the UNK er teachers UNK she came out
er never you mind the children she said you go home i'll take charge of him
and she got hold of me in her arms and carried me kicking and screaming into the school
and i was very upset for the first day then i started settling down
but then miss see couldn't move out of my sight she was the only friend i had amongst all these strangers
and i wouldn't leave her side
and one day she said now then john i want to go to the other school to mr the UNK to get a book
don't you move from your seat
and she got about half a dozen of the strongest boys from standard one to stand guard at the door
but as soon as she was out i UNK like a UNK through these other boys and UNK out into the bottom of the yard where there was a certain little building in the bottom of the yard and i opened the door and there was miss sitting on the UNK
i said to her ah i thought that you were going why did you lie to me saying that you were going to get a book
but eventually i settled down
erm to the work and i kept er going you know like i didn't UNK i didn't miss school
and i suppose i was an average sort of pupil
as we the time went on
and when i went over to standard two miss was the name of the teacher with the middle classes
and she had a custom she we had to have a book called observation book
none of us had any idea what observation meant but we had to write down a sentence or something we had noticed on our way to school
which was a very good thing and what children of today miss when they're being UNK on a bus to school
they have no chance to notice or see anything erm and make them UNK and looking out for things
in the spring when the f the UNK and the UNK started coming and then there'd be UNK and all the different flowers the farmers would start UNK mares would have UNK they had the harvest
there were any amount of things you could write about in summer
but in the depth of winter say er from november up to after christmas there were very few things you could notice and erm goodness knows how many times i fell back on he was one of the last persons to be churning with horsepower
you know a horse turning round and round in what they called a horse power
a long pole and it worked a lot of UNK wheels and the shaft going through to the dairy to turn the UNK
and er i had to fall back very often just write i saw mr follow the horse in that churning power
i had to fall back on that many time
and erm oh the games we used to have
whatever was going on in the village at the time when say the UNK machine was going round
we played at UNK and er shifting the UNK from farm to farm we had been w watching with horses then
and the way was to get the UNK boy he would the be the UNK machine
and the second boy would be the shaft horse and the other children catching hold of each other 's UNK pulling
and we had seen the horses er struggling and kicking strange horses
and then that would happen and very often i've seen the shaft horse having kicked the UNK in his leg had the two fighting
breaking the whole thing up
and then we used to be playing top we'd a top right round the village see how far we could go
and then playing a hook bowling a hook with a sort of a long hook to an iron UNK or hook it would about two foot six in UNK
and see how far you go with that
and then we'd be playing marbles
the yard then it wasn't UNK just a loose surface
then we're twist a hole with the heel of our boots and everybody t trying to get their marbles into this hole and then whatever if you could get your you whatever you won you could keep
and er there would be a an UNK a competitive meeting
in the village and then we used to have that at UNK
there were no school UNK then of course
all the children who were living far away they brought a sandwich and a UNK with them and eating in the desk in the classroom
and we'd have this competitive meeting and there would be a UNK ceremony erm and it's amazing the r the tidy little poems that er some of the children made then you know children under fourteen
some of them were a bit UNK wouldn't be very proper for me to repeat here
and they wouldn't sound the same er in english they were welsh poems of course
but it's amazing ho then we'd have a
where one lot would be the UNK he'd start about ten minutes before
this was during the dinner hour
and all the rest of use would be hounds chasing after him
and maybe we'd be oh a long distance away from the school when we heard the UNK blowing the whistle
and we'd be UNK away and arriving about five minutes past one and then we'd be in for trouble then
because we were late for the afternoon lessons
erm i don't know if i told you before i hated any sort of games
no ball games or what we called drill which was erm p t you call it now
but i had been er made a UNK i think i told you this before a monitor and i used to UNK all these sort of things and erm i used to go after i'd been putting the books out for the next lesson i could go to the library and i used to sit down and read
and i think that is why er i acquired my taste for it still i read a lot
and that was the way it went until i was eleven
and then there was a scholarship class then
you had to go sit scholarship to go to the county school we call they called it
and this was the school master had a special class and he used to keep us in after school to have extra lessons
but i just didn't want to go it was to my grandmother and old john they used to say oh no you don't want to school you're supposed to stay here at home
working w with your father
my mother was the only one was keen for me to have some sort of education
but on the morning saturday morning when the exam was being er sat in the county school in i was very ill too ill to get up until about eleven o'clock when it was too late
and then i missed my chance and then i had only had the little primary school in until i was fourteen
and well that's about the erm well a rough story of my school days i think
i was average with my lessons
and not the worst and not the best just about average
but the i offended the UNK very much not sitting this exam because erm his record depended upon how many pupils he could get to pass this exam
and if he wanted a promotion to go to a better school
erm the inspectors used to come round and it was the number of pupils he managed to get into the county school that added a lot of points to his record
and then he was very er well now i'm sorry after he'd put all the hard work with me he was very annoyed and disappointed that i had let him down so
but we got over it and i finished my school at fourteen and came back to work at home
at
how did you how your m mother er come to terms with the idea that you weren't going to go to the county school
she was very disappointed
but there was nothing she could do about it then and it was too late
but she made certain that my sister who was six years younger she made certain that she went to the county school
she became a teacher later on
and erm my mother my father was neutral about the whole thing
he didn't take side one way or another
he was neutral
but my mother was very keen and she was very disappointed because i had missed out
i suppose if i had gone to school my life would be completely changed
but i have no UNK
i left led i would say an UNK life but i've been very happy you know ups and downs
never very rich
and n no great heights and no great depths either
d depths either
just sort of a medium UNK life
i have no UNK really
nothing to worry about i was i was happy leading my own erm quiet little life you know
and that is how i have got along for the last sixty six years
when you became the
the yes at home
doing all the odd UNK helping a lot
and the women in the house UNK potatoes getting the coal carrying water
erm i used to carry a lot especially in summer
erm carry all the water from a shaft in the bottom of the field for all the animals as well in into the and all the pigs and the UNK
and er when i was well before i was fourteen and i believe that is why i UNK so much now
my s young bones they've been pulled down with carrying these er all these UNK of water
how far did you how far UNK w away
well down the bottom of the field you know it was a fairly big field
and there was a path which had been UNK back and forth down to this er shaft with a pump on it
we had to carry in winter we had the UNK off the roofs which filled two brick UNK for the UNK
but in summer those were dry we had to carry all the water then
when the men were out working in the field i was left in the yard erm i helped with feeding the UNK the cows feeding the UNK and the pigs
and helping the my mother
when i l left school my mother didn't have a maid in the house shortly after that
i was doing the most of the UNK potatoes and getting the coal and the UNK
and laying the table washing up the dishes
and churning and the carrying water for er for to for the household and needed a lot of water when you were churning to wash the butter properly
and when my mother was baking in a huge UNK then she'd have the erm the flour and the erm what do you call it that made it rise
UNK
the UNK yes that's the word
and then she put had some warm water and er she had to have it to the proper consistency and then she'd have a bucket of water w standing by her side with a jug
and once she'd had the her arms in the dough i had to stand by her side just to feed a drop of water gently
and i remember the first time i poured a whole UNK of water in
without realizing i was lucky that her hands were stuck in the dough she w she would have given me a thick ear you know for doing that
and er anyway later on i used to er go out into the fields with the men
oh another job that the
the men would be working out in the fields in the summer
then they used to have their which was a cup of tea at ten in the morning and then having their tea at four
out in the fields
and that was part of my work
a big erm UNK full of tea and then a basket tied on my back with the sandwiches and the cake of UNK my mother used to back more often
and another basket in my hand with the cups
and i used to carry out their meals to the men and they used to be eating out in the field then
and the dogs would be sitting UNK up in their faces
they used to throw an odd UNK to the dogs
and er that was the way
that was my life
until later on
i became a UNK myself
and we had another
w when did a person or when did you stop being stop being a
well when i was about sixteen say
and then w that was when i were big enough in the hay and the corn harvest to er be in charge of the carts
be able to make a load and strong enough to pitch it into the stack that was the problem
and making a load of hay especially you had to work it roll every UNK you had roll it and set it properly so that you knew as you now then you must have numbers on them so you know how to UNK that lot
every erm UNK must come out one you can't start fighting and pulling it against the grain otherwise you would be in trouble
so every UNK used to come out er one after another as if you had numbers on them you know
came out in layers
as it wasn't so heavy but that was an art making the load
so that's and you said if you erm don't er sweat a little in making the load you will sweat a tremendous amount when you were busy UNK it into the into the stack
s so was that was that considered to be particularly UNK then
oh it was it was yes some people were considered to be very good at building a load
they said it was like a box you know and they could up to tremendous heights putting i don't know how many layers
when we first started erm only a tiny amount just er sort of an UNK lump on the centre
er of the ca there were there was a frame which stretched out the carts
bigger on the bo you know the of course
and then y when you came into the UNK with a UNK li like a UNK saying it was just something like a UNK nest
just an UNK lump
that was how they used to insult someone who had a and UNK load you know
and er that hurt and that made you much more determined to improve and be able to make a proper load as quickly as possible
w at this time w would you be having help from other farms
yes and you used to do a lot of sharing er one f u farms helping each other
that was quite common in those days
er w well common
w would people go out of their way to seek to find someone who was particularly skilled and with building a load and did they take
well you couldn't er the men were hired on the farms for a term of six months you know
yeah
and some of those well like in every other trade were better than others
erm the erm the erm UNK men who used to come over harvest their job was to pitch it up in the field
er they didn't go out with the cart just with a regular who used to go out with the with the horses and carts
then you had a spare man what you sent over the harvest which you hired for a month of occasionally they only used to come by the day
there were some er farms say of fifteen or twenty acres which wasn't quite big enough to make a living
and then these other men they used to be sort of a UNK working a day here and a week there
they used to do what little UNK they had in the morning and then again after their wives did most of it
and then they did the heavy work erm in the in the morning and in the evening
and they UNK those were like er a UNK we called them UNK
and n not hired in one farm for six months
and mostly those were er married men who had a small place of their own which wasn't quite big enough to keep them full time
and it was er too big again for them to b become tied in one place for a whole six months
were they er were they would they be treated in any d different was say er people who had their own farms would they
no
no
but er if they were just working for a single day it was long day up till ten o'clock at night in a harvest you know
and erm their wages were a bit higher
th they demanded a higher wage er for erm just because er m a man wasn't too dear if it was a good er UNK day a man wasn't too dear at any price
cos without him you couldn't get your harvest in and tomorrow it might be raining
so nobody UNK at all about paying an extra er bit for these men
cos it was good to have them when you were pushed when you had a lot of work to do
of course the regular men they were kept on or when if it was a UNK day when they couldn't go out and just do some odd jobs in the building say when it was a UNK day
so it was a sort of a give and take
some days er they worked longer hours and harder work and there were other days which er which erm they couldn't do anything much just potter around in the buildings
and erm but with a man coming in over the harvest they were working hard and long hours every day and they demanded and they deserved a higher wage
was there any sort of understanding that part of the wages would be pain in food anything like that
oh the food was included
nobody er erm or it was nobody thought about it li that was taken for granted
n nowadays i hear erm or the lads who have been they go out they've been working with contractor and they say how different it is when your mother was alive everybody who came here they used to join us for their dinner
you know the odd men
but now we go around farms nobody ever ask us if we want a cup of tea that's gone out of out of practice now
and er very few men live in and er nobody er think of offering them a meal
they've got to carry their own food
you know UNK men
but in those days it was n nobody thought i you know it was the done thing
nobody thought of anything it was just everybody coming in for their meals
oh a great help to sandwiches and a sit down meal at dinner at table with the family it was far better than a dry sandwich eaten in the barn
er can you ever remember any what might be called failed UNK or d difficult UNK
oh yes
yes
erm remember the hay we would be turning it w with UNK you know and erm not a well UNK drying day but you had to risk turning it and hoping that it'd be dry but er it would be raining again the following day
yes i've seen hay spoilt but you had to make do with it
you couldn't do anything else
and i've seen the corn harvest again the sheaves growing green out it UNK
the grain UNK
and the sheaves getting stuck together er UNK and getting stuck yes
i've seen that happen too
and i remember hearing a story er erm it was just they'd got an old farmer he had a field of hay just ready to cart and just as they were getting the horses it came down to rain and they were all UNK in the barn and the said more rain more rest
what did you say said the old farmer
more rain more grass said the little fella
quick thinking
yes
yes
yes
and another job we had to do erm especially on a UNK day ready for the worst
er we had no hay barn then you had to UNK the stacks
and you had to make what we called straw
well er you could see the one erm wooden erm UNK on the winter there now
you see that n what n erm you see it out the window there
erm oh yes here it is
yeah that
then we used to have two of those
a clamp like a
y yes
used to have two and er had a bit of a rope round middle and two then there'd be two men sitting in one end of the cow shed
you'd ha you'd have it fixed two of them fixed like this on a bit of a erm er straw rope
yes
there were two of them
then be backing and turning it round like that
two of them like this
and then there'd be two men in one end of the of a long cow shed
they had the straw which had been er pulled out even previously
and then they would be feeding the straw making these straw ropes
two of them
and then i as the would be turning round and round and backing right down the cow shed and the calf pen which was oh about sixteen yards length in all
and then after they had reached the other end erm one of the men would go and stand in the middle of the two and the and the other sitting down
and we'd start i'd just turn with my right hand to join both ends of the rope and then we would be turning again
and the m th chap in sitting in the top he'd be turning round and the other one would be walking down slowly backwards er UNK a rope wi to join the two to make it into a double rope
to put over the stacks
ah
how would you start them off them straw
we jus ha a length of them put it around this thing like that and then when you started UNK it would have a they'd be feeding more that was a quite an art again feeding more and more straw into it you know as i backed along
and then UNK it round and round
it was an art to give just the right amount and that it wouldn't break
and i remember we had two men once one used to keep his hand very tight squeeze it hard and the other used to make a very big loose UNK sort of a rope
well to keep his rope tight i had to pull on the other and the other chap would UNK me back
don't pull he said
then i was going slower to suit his well the other fella his rope would be dragging on the ground then you know it was difficult to get the two to cooperate together
that was a job on a UNK day
and then i used to the to erm UNK them round
there'd be a big pile of them ready for erm for UNK the stacks
and then how would you do that then
well after you know the stack would be a bit UNK straight after and after it had UNK
it used to heat so then you had to give it time to cool and settle down
then you'd be UNK the sides to make it tidy and carrying it to make a round top sort of a roof on it
then you would have a thick layer of straw right along the UNK
and then my father would be standing on top and throwing one of these er straw ropes up then he'd let er an er end down on both sides
then we had a little wooden UNK the length of the head was a yard
then we used to measure with that between each rope and then one of use each side of the stack we'd pull hard and pull a handful of hay from the and twist it round and this handful of hay
and then when he was UNK you would start on one end and erm putting er f pushing the st the UNK into the stack
and then you'd have a length of erm either you made little thinner straw ropes or erm what we called er it was a sort of a UNK
erm that again had been rolled into balls and then he'd have erm about a dozen sticks which held these balls and stuck them in then after he'd erm er UNK one erm length one row he'd pull the string over and attach it to the thick s er rope that was er going over the stack
and that from one end to the other
and then there was these thick er straw ropes going over and then there were the other which were going sideways along the roof to hold the UNK down
and how long w would he take t to UNK on of those then
well it depended on the length
you know a fairly long stack could take a couple of days
and they did look really good when they had been finished
and erm not a drop of water would get in
no
no
it would be b because the straw the UNK had been pulled all straight it would flowing down and then they used to er they used to th throw it over it would be throwing the water away from the stack had been built like an egg you know
UNK out from the base UNK out and then coming back again
you know it was shaped just like an egg
and then that'd be throwing all the water away it w it wouldn't UNK in
and it was important the way they built a stack
they used you know th in different layers
then they used to put a thick layer round the sides to start with then they would fill in the middle and keep that always stronger so that each layer er it UNK
so that it would if it were just like a UNK
it would draw the water in but since there was much more hay on in the inside than the out it er it UNK and then it wouldn't er erm absorb any water at all
if you didn't put enough middle in it would sort of sink then it would be drawing the water in
oh i see
and it would spoil
did you w
y yeah that if there was a depression in the centre
but after they'd put the outer layer and then they used to UNK and walk hard and UNK the middle down
did they
so it would be hard and solid
mm
and then when you were cutting it in the winter you could see the layers you know
in a sort of a half shaped in the stack you could see every layer the way it had been built
that was the art of a good stack builder again
was there ever any danger of those catching fire
oh yes it you carried it too green
if you carried it too green erm i can't remember that happening to our but i've heard of some people having to cut a shaft down into the stack you know
we always used to push a long wire in to see how er every stack used to heat a little but er UNK i've never er never saw a stack heat that badly
but er there was a time they got so if you had carried it too green erm you er it could catch fire
and on the other hand if you carried wet well it would go UNK then
and UNK and it would be all UNK together you know
and a lot of dust in it which was very UNK
that was why a lot of the old men used to get farmer's lung then feeding this stuff in the winter
and nobody knew anything about UNK or farmer's lung or an everybody are very conscious and they wear UNK when they're feeding hay now
to stop them breathing these er UNK which can affect their lungs and cause farmer's lung
was there ever any time when you just had to accept the fact that the hay would have to be carried in wet
b because of the
well erm you kept it out as long as possible but the weather spoilt it and the more you turned it the UNK it came
and all the goodness was being washed out of it
no er eventually you would get it dry of course
it was better to let it rot out on the field then go to the trouble to carry it wet because it would only rot or become UNK and absolutely useless
and then eventually you would get it er dry enough
but then when you cut that in the winter it would be black and there wouldn't be any er feed value any sort of UNK at all in it
it had all been washed out
when you came in the winter to gain access to the stack
yes
how would you how would you do it
get at it
yes
well you used to took er take one length bet from one s er erm er straw up to the other that was about a yard
then you had a very sharp knife er and you used to cut down half the what we called the face of the stack you know half the width of it
to start with
then cut that into er UNK again
those again would be about a yard wide and a yard deep then you had a big er wire with a UNK on one end with a sharp point
and they used to push this through the amount w which you had cut
and erm er grab this wire
have one foot on a ladder or the other stack stuck into the f into the into the erm face of stack and then you would struggle and work yourself underneath what w we called it the UNK
i suppose you would call it a UNK in english
and carry it loose into the cow shed or into the sheds for the out UNK cattle
or into the barn for UNK for the horses
always made certain that the horses had the best hay
yes
yes
the seeds hay the first crop after er a filed had been UNK the first crop you grew that was reserved for the horses
and then the cow man would be UNK maybe he had some second class hay for cattle
and then he'd be UNK why is the UNK getting all the best stuff
why can't i have my horses and my cattle you know
well the men considered their stock as their own then
and looked after them and er after them and took pride i in to have them in the best condition
oh they were not the br UNK stock they were their stock
my cattle and my horses
and the UNK used to steal a lot of oats for the UNK used to give him a ration for a week and the UNK would be lo locked
and many were the tricks that the UNK they used to get on the right side of the maid and get her to make an impression of the key on a block o of soap
then he'd take it to someone who could cut er a key er so he could open the up the UNK the late in the middle of the night when everybody were asleep and steal oats for the horses
it was a it was a competition between the UNK to get their horses into the best condition
and then they used to go around on a sunday morning from farm to farm to see how the other chaps are getting on and to say how much better their horses looked
compared to what they had i in the next farm you know
oh they were very keen
keen competition
w why was it that horses were given pride of place over the cattle
well the horses had to work hard
and er with the ploughing and the UNK the UNK the UNK manure UNK in
er everything depending on the work of the farm would come to a UNK if erm if the horses y if they were not kept in good condition they wouldn't be strong enough to keep on going every day
how would er how would the UNK day begin and how would it progress and how would it end
well he'd be getting up about oh shortly after five in the morning to er feed his horses muck out the stable and groom them
and then he'd UNK them all except the UNK
and erm shortly after seven breakfast would be served
he'd be in the house having his breakfast at seven so he'd be ready to take the horses out to start erm ploughing in winter at eight
he'd be out most days ploughing
and on a farm when there was only one team if they wanted to have half a day UNK aye well the UNK was very annoyed he didn't like that job at all
no
but the fairly large farm they used to have er two teams
the second UNK would be having well the first UNK h the head UNK had the best team of course ploughing
and then the second UNK would be have another pair er UNK er and UNK manure
and doing all the odd jobs round the farm
so the actual so w why was it the UNK of etcetera were thought of as being not so good
well erm it was a UNK bus you know er a field in winter it was just er bare soil there was n no grass on it and with the cart UNK back and forth getting towards er a gateway you would up to your knees in mud you know
erm and it was rather a and heavy work you had to have a team of horses to pull a load of UNK and you had to get them in some you used to carry out on and just drag them i mean s spread them out on the field er for the store cattle and the sheep
then you had to bring some into the yard which were put through the UNK for the dairy cows and the young UNK that were housed
and then the store cattle they were in big open yards during the nights and then you used to let them out and eat these off er a grass field in win i in the daytime
and you used to pull them e every four rows making them into a row
er throw two and two together into the centre
and the ones you brought into the yard to put through the UNK you cut the leaves off
of courses otherwise that would UNK the UNK
but the one that were UNK out on the fields they were left with the leaves on because the cattle ate the leave as well
w what exactly was the UNK
well er there were two they was a UNK and a UNK
it was a machine which you we had an oil engine in the barn
there was the UNK for UNK the corn and the UNK cutter for UNK the er hay or straw and there was the UNK
and it had plates inside er it used to cut the into like big chips
oh right
you had sort of a these eyes on this big plate and it was turning round and it would be er churning them up you know cutting them into like big er chip potato chip you know really
into these log thick chips
and they were there was another er UNK
there were two UNK on that cutting them into round UNK about oh three quarters of an inch thick
cutting the that was for the or the dairy cows
and for the for the young UNK you had to scrap them cos they couldn't eat the big thick UNK for the young UNK
how was the UNK then
oh erm with a we had a er erm a UNK driven er a UNK a big oil engine with two big UNK to it and a big UNK like a bucket
and then you used to have a blow lamp to heat it up and after that you erm put it on half UNK and you were turning one of the big UNK round until it started and you had to keep the UNK on it
that w pet th there was no petrol engines then
and er eventually he came er an engine which er there were some which started on petrol and then you turned on to UNK but most of the work just going on petrol with a plug and a UNK
you used to start that with a handle of course
but er with the er the original the first one you had to heat it up with a UNK and you had to be very careful to get it just to the right heat before if you tried to start it too cold it would kick back and if was too hot again it just wouldn't start
and that was er oh it could break your arm you know this huge big UNK and you were taking hold of one of the of the of the UNK and turning it if it were to UNK suddenly it could break your arm
and on the other hand if it started and took off suddenly it could pull you might fall right on er face into the UNK again
the safety officers of today oh they'd have a blue fit if they saw such things you know
so th this was a standing engine was it
a standing bit on a be big concrete base
and then there would be a big what we called a big UNK going along the side of the barn with UNK on it
and the erm the erm oil engine would be in a little shed outside the barn and this UNK would be going through the wall
and there'd be two UNK on that what we called a loose UNK
and then you had a sort of a UNK what would slide the st there was strap coming from the UNK of the oil engine onto there was a loose UNK and there was a UNK you could slide the strap onto the loose UNK then that was only just er turning loose of course then you UNK it back on the fixed and it's be turning all this UNK along the barn and then there were UNK sets on that and in direct line with UNK and UNK cutter and the UNK machine you had a strap form those
those were fixed as well
not in concrete of course but er you had erm they were UNK from the erm oh there was a UNK above barn then from the UNK there you had a big a bit of wood to wedge them down solid
so they wouldn't move
so there was a sort of UNK er this sort of sliding
UNK o yes er there was no UNK only something you could erm it was sort of a UNK iron er over the strap and then you had a long plank in above the UNK cutter that was the most dangerous thing
and then there was an iron bar going from this plank through the wall and you could er then this sort of a UNK thing that was over the strap you could s push it over with that pu pulling the plank up here
it pushed the strap from one UNK to another to the loose UNK or the f fixed UNK on the end of the long UNK
why was the UNK considered the most dangerous then
well you had to feed it you know erm then there was this erm er sort of a UNK in there was a long UNK leading to the knife and then there were some UNK which pulled it into the knife
and should you be UNK enough to get your fingers caught in there well that would be the end it would draw you in and it would chop your fingers and your arm off in half inch er bits you know
and then er but it was this was fixed right above then you could reach if you did feel you hand getting caught you could slide it off and stop the p switch it onto loose UNK immediately
so t
so there were at least three pieces of machinery that you could run
yes
yes
the UNK the UNK and the UNK
yeah and the corn UNK
oh
for UNK the oats
but there were some people you know on a UNK farm they didn't have an oil engine then they would have to turn the UNK by hand
and that was real hard work
er i saw how they used to do it in the after they'd finished work used to be at it till nine or ten that night
and at one time we used to feed what we called for the used to UNK some of the poorest hay and straw and spread it out in a thick layer about oh twelve of fifteen inches high on the floor of the of the barn
and then scrap the and throw that over
make it into a thick layer and then in a day of so the juice from the would have UNK into this second class hay and er you used to mix it with a UNK and load it into bags
and when you were carrying it on your back into the sheds for the cattle the juice would be would be UNK through the bags
your back would be UNK wet
it was not very healthy food erm we gave up doing that because er as you know cattle they UNK their UNK
well they like to cut their food in their own length and roll it into balls in their mouth and then they can er UNK it up and UNK it
well with this stuff they couldn't do that and then they their stomach used to get UNK the they couldn't er couldn't er get their UNK up and caused a lot of stomach trouble
so and they were tempted to eat erm poor stuff which they wouldn't eat otherwise because there was the juice of the UNK to it
and er that went out of fashion because of the two reasons and the most was because it's it was it would compact in their UNK they couldn't lift it up again
couldn't get their UNK up
oh i see
yeah
with er this machinery
yes
er were you ever a in a position to sort of to help other farmers er if they wanted their
f with the with the corn UNK
corn UNK or
oh no just they were bringing the corn to put through the UNK
right
er not with the hay or with the
but with the corn er few people had then they used to er to bring it over
i remember er that was the way my father used to get a bit of pocket money to buy tobacco and things a shilling a sack and the other farmers they used to find the biggest sack they could find you know and UNK it with oats and then you used to be after supper
i can remember UNK up about one o'clock in the morning and to hear this old oil engine going UNK
and the and the UNK of the UNK you know the two plates rubbing against each other
about one o'clock in the morning he'd be at it getting it ready for the neighbours to collect the following day
for a shilling a bag
u maybe he'd be at it till about two o'clock in the morning
so he would actually do the work himself
oh yes then after the men had gone to bed of course
i see
and then th that was the his tobacco money
and he was a heavy smoker an ounce a day
although it only cost about UNK ha'penny an ounce then
mm
were you involved in operating this machinery
yes when i grew older of course it took all the men when er you know one would b the whole lot would be going together you know
the erm the UNK the hopper was fixed underneath the UNK and then there'd be a little trap door in the floor or a UNK right above and you could er shovel the corn the oats down into
then that would sort of feed itself but you had to have one man feeding the UNK machine and another man with a shovel pulling away the UNK at the side and then you had to have another man feeding the long hay into the UNK cutter
and another one moving the UNK away to one side
so it took at least four men
wh when the fo the three machines were going together
needed at least four men to attend them
so in fact although they were there to save labour
y
they in fact involved quite a lot
a lot of labour yes but that was far better than to have to turn them by hand you know
that was just UNK
mm
how long would they all be going
over what period of time would th would you have all of them going together
you mean during the day or well it took about an hour say
about two afternoons a week
and how often how often does that go on throughout the year
throughout the winter
yes
say w when we would used to bring the stock in at the UNK bridge fair that was the twenty fourth of october
and then you started erm getting food for the UNK and UNK food for them
and that went until they went out in late april
from the end of april to from the end of october to the end of april say
mm
can d during the winter what sort of things would the UNK b be up to then
well erm he t in the spring after you had turned the cattle out the sheds you know the cattle it would be full of manure
then after you had finished the UNK that would be the next job
clearing out all the manure into the er big heap down into the fields where you wanted to spread them next winter
and then erm as soon as the UNK was over before you started ploughing you'd have two carts going UNK this m this manure out and
give him
just take your pipe
can we go a little bit into the background of the boys' ploughing match UNK
how did it UNK
do you know
how did it all begin
well there's been speculation about that but no nobody can actually tell us how it began but it's easy enough to imagine how it began i think
because er if you look at little boys on farms today they play with toy UNK and things don't they
and er they don't necessarily er do things with these toy UNK er well th they tend to things with these toys to UNK the real thing er so i th i think the same thing would have happened maybe a hundred years ago or maybe less in regard to ploughing with horses on the in the fields
and er they would maybe er devise or make or r find a piece of suitable wood or something to scratch in the garden or in the sand or on a piece of nice soft soil to make UNK and er UNK maybe what their dad was doing out in the field and er they had no concept of doing anything else to play really it was just pretending they were pretending they were grown up and working
and i think that it would just grow out of that kind of activity and then eventually when ploughing matches er as such in the you know in the adult farm with horses became the great thing er which was the second half of the last century you know after the farming revolution
er UNK and UNK were the UNK of farm workers and the sons would could only UNK to do what they did and er eventually i suspect it got to be a little more organized and er they had these little games of ploughing matches maybe in a UNK farm to begin with but it eventually came to be as we see it today over a long period of time
is it possible then that perhaps there were boys' ploughing matches on all the other islands as well and the tradition has only survived in south ronaldsay
mm no it's er it was in UNK it was in UNK
i've seen photographs of the ploughing match in UNK
er pre war
er but in south ronaldsay and UNK only i'm pretty sure it wasn't anywhere else
it used to be at a different time of the year though didn't it
well it fitted into the easter holidays erm and in fact it followed the farming seasonal pattern
you see no nobody UNK in the summer time really on a farm
you plough in the spring you plough in the winter
and you get the seeds UNK in the spring
so they er would have done the same thing in those days the children and erm it fitted in to the easter holiday time to have the actual ploughing match you see
no in your memory of course you've been involved in it for a long time haven't you
well off and on
i haven't been so much involved in it as perhaps some other people and i don't pretend to be an expert
but i did take part in it when i was a boy in school and that's a that's a fair while ago now right enough but er i used to attend the er well a primary school i went to the small UNK school in the north end of south ronaldsay which has now been closed for over twenty years
and er we had our own little ploughing match there you see
maybe not more than half a dozen in fact i remember only four i think the UNK one i was at
er on the sand at UNK now there's hardly any sand there then you had difficulty finding a patch not like where you've the huge area now at the barrier and so er i know that in the hope they had a bigger one and i believe in the UNK area they had one as well you see
but i was never really involved in those ones at all
how much has it changed in the costume and the UNK nowadays compared to when you were young
well it's become much more elaborate and sophisticated and er dare i say expensive
you know to do er in regard to the so called horses UNK
er as i remember it was pretty UNK and er you didn't keep a costume or a suit for the job
people couldn't really afford to that then
er on the day of the event you went either your mother or somebody else's mother usually the custom was that the boy who was to be the horse would be UNK either by his own mother say or perhaps the person who he was s he who he was UNK as UNK you know UNK
with the UNK and er in my own case i remember going to the house where i was er i was to be the UNK for this so called UNK you see
if you understand that
and had these things kind of pinned on wore first world war army UNK
i remember one with the r g a the orkney r g a royal UNK artillery i remember that badge being pinned on and er bits of UNK you know UNK round the bottom of your of your trousers short trousers
and it wasn't a lot and then as soon as the event was over it was all UNK taken off you know
what about the judging is that really based on the UNK or is there any ploughing skill involved in that as well
th the ploughing
mhm
oh very much a very much a very much a skilled job you know
you won't get a prize unless you're up to it the er the ploughing has to look professional
it has to UNK the real thing as done in the fields
even today tractor ploughing is you know there's a pride in doing a good job and er while the single UNK plough the techniques are a little different the end result is much the same
what about the UNK themselves now they of course are all UNK specially for the match
mm
mhm
were they always made by the local blacksmiths or did somebody sometimes construct one as you said at out of wood or other material
yes
the blacksmiths made some and they were rather heavier and slightly different UNK after what they are today
er they tend to be more sophisticated and UNK and nice looking but we have quite a few craftsmen around now no blacksmiths as such but even in the old days er you had rather cheaper versions made with wooden UNK and just a nice piece of light UNK bent over to form the board the mould board and that
erm now you're getting them much more er s ooh sophisticated you know
with nice UNK and UNK steel boards and things er because people have access to these materials and you have chaps who are er good with their hands and can do it make a plough for their son that sort of thing
have the rules changed over the years for example have the age groups or allowing girls to take part or anything like that
well the age group was always just school age which was up to fourteen
now of course it's up to sixteen or rather under sixteen
that is includes fifteen
they tend to drift away when they get to the last year anyway you know
er girls were never included as horses as i remember it but nowadays there are of course which means that you have more boys available to be UNK and this perhaps helps the numbers
the girls used to join in the in the party afterwards you know
but no they didn't take part in the event really
and does it have to be young people resident in south ronaldsay or is it more of an open contest now
oh it's always been confined to the really it was to the school areas you see
er each school area
it wasn't run by the school as such or anything it just kind of happened but the er i mean teachers or anybody like that was never involved in it
but it ran with each school area you know UNK and so on and now of course the total areas as one but i think perhaps it would be UNK to somebody with local UNK maybe not resident in the area
don't see much of that happening actually
it's a very strong local tradition and i think it'll stay that way
so we have to hope for a fine day for this on sunday obviously
what happens if i it is a really bad day
has it ever been in your memory UNK or cancelled or do they just carry on regardless
i don't remember it being UNK
although at easter time there is some shocking bad weather sometimes you know really cold UNK showers and it's just a question of getting out there to the sand and get it over quickly
but in those days you didn't have many visitors at all
there weren't many people looking on
now that it's become a summer time exercise it's er good for the tourist you know
and this helps to foster it because the tourist contribute well to the funds and this gets the children more prize money and so on
lovely
right anything else you want to add on that UNK
so how did the event get the title of the festival of the horse
well er to me it doesn't quite ring true it's always been the boys' ploughing match and it always will be as far as i'm concerned but i think this happened at the time post war i can't say exactly which year when the date was changed from easter time to august
this was partly to get better weather i think for the competition and also to attract tourists
and i think originally it may have run in the first year both at easter and at august
erm and it was organized then as a tourist thing
and this title er the festival of the horse was shall i say UNK up erm and in fact we had one or two horses UNK horses on show down at the UNK square in the hope
just to make it more of a UNK event
so that title to some extent still sticks with it but it i can't UNK i'm old fashioned enough to th to think of it as being a bit a bit false you know
that's grand love
i couldn't put you right with that because i'm not sure then or no
i can't remember
they could have been mind you
but the only difference that i see was that they pushed their UNK there so they must have been smaller than the ones we use
but we had er horses pair of horses no or UNK or whatever
and that's what year
i don't know how many years had there's a chap in the village jim he might be remember but he ran out of time too to win the cup i think
you see i think he'd win it three year
it's just like the world cup
where did people get their UNK from
well the blacksmiths made two that i know of
and there's one hanging in the village that you'll see in a window
and me dad he made three anyhow course there'd be non of them to the for they were wood
they were just wooden UNK you know on end
a beam made the wheel and the counter as we called it on it and all
wood is a good working thing
we'd a very good job
he was a good hand
in the sand you see the iron although it broke it more but this plough he'd kept the thing fairly together
i mean about the job that's why i got fast you see
it was keeping the thing just like what you do in the land
in the ploughing matches you see the size and smooth that's how they were and that was what this wooden plough did
the sand i's solid more solid than the earth you see
and it just you UNK it up with a plough you see
just lovely and was no broken again it was just standing kind of like really made a good job
it's was our wood plus the bore had made
i don't know how many years it went on and then there were a lot of UNK and boys a lot of their own UNK i think
they couldn't afford to get a UNK made plough you see UNK poor in that times you know couldn't afford to get one made
but that certainly was in stronsay and that's the to prove it
an and that had stopped by world war two would you say
oh aye stopped before world war two i think
i don't know why it stopped they had to get out of it you see
more UNK you see
er there were UNK now for peedie boys
as well as william i also spoke to jim
in nineteen thirty and ninety thirty one i won the cup i'd been twelve year old then
onto the sand here in bay and then there seven site or UNK laid off for every UNK that was there you see
and you had to plough that within a certain time
i think it was two hours for me i had to plough that one
and i was judged by the judges and
was there an upper age limit that you could compete
yes there was
fourteen i think was the limit
how often did you manage to win it
twice
but you had to win it twice before it became your own property
so i won it twice
er do you have the cup yet
yes i do
it was just like just like looking at any ordinary cup standing in the black UNK stand and er UNK head in each side with rings in it's mouth
and it's silver cup
do you know how long the boys' ploughing matches went on for
when they stopped
in thirty six somewhere thereabouts
not ju exactly sure
and in the thirty five i think
what sort of plough did you use for the competition
iron UNK made by a blacksmith
i tell you why because he we he won the UNK window across the road there
and what did you use for horses
two boys
like a pair of horse th they pulled the plough
i don't mind whether we used UNK or not th they just well i mean they knew what to do you see
in fact we had the two boys pulling we had th it just as near as possible to the proper thing
what d what do you want to know
can you tell me what your first er job was
in the quarry
what you were employed as
oh er i i've only been erm i've only had one job
i mean er you know i was went in as a mechanical fitter and er stayed as such getting sort of bigger and more UNK as i went grew up
that's all and then i was looked after the production machinery for about fifteen years the top here
i was doing the new developments as the years went by of course we didn't stay still for long
can you can you give me some idea of erm w what it was like to start in the quarry as an apprentice
w well erm you mean from the day one started sort of thing
yes
er well er one went up we the fitting shop you see was at
erm the it was about i should imagine well guess three years old back then
cos two companies had amalgamated and built one fitting shop
the works and the people had sort of amalgamated and so they used the one place where they had a fitting shop
did away with one at in at this end the new quarry
and er b built a bigger shop a more modern one
er of course one went started work very nervous and er thought that everybody was sort of putting a tape measure and er oh to tell you the t truth i didn't know well i knew there was one apprentice been there about twelve months or nearly twelve months
they were younger than myself and er we'd been at but er we'd been at together
we'd started at the same time
and er of course one felt a little more a little happier after sort of meeting someone you know because it's quite and i was very shy at that at that time
and er of course everybody there were only about what half a dozen fitters in those days and erm er as a mark of their profession or trade in those days they used to wear a white collar you know with out a tie
and er they er well er what shall we say w we have got UNK people introduced themselves and asked who i was and who my family was and all that's the usual thing you know
was that important
was that considered important
oh yes they course the there was then er relatives were then they sort of knew there were some who knew someone or cousin of whatever
i mean there were so many h well really whole families working in the quarry in various parts of the quarry you see
and erm those erm oh and then i was told which p put me off rather
er by the man who or one of the men who swept the shop and kept it clean and all the one of the labourers that my job was to one of my jobs was to make the tea for the men
so that put me off a bit
was it true
and i thought oh yes
and fetch water for them to wash and that
and erm so really three times a day i had to er make tea
er of course it took a bit of time to learn as to er you know the rotation who the to take the tea from various men's buckets they was buckets or UNK wherever they had their stuff in their bags
and there weren't so many bags carried in those days as there were in later years you know the sort of er UNK thing
and er having to er knowing you know which and what time
i mean if er that w you you'd had it if you w ruined for life if you er took one man's see but served two UNK
er say er yeah within say er two days or worse still you could it the same day actually because they used to have those erm er have you seen them those an UNK tin with two ends er it was split in the middle
have you seen them
yeah
i've got one somewhere in the shed here
because you could i mean you could do the empty one tin in a day really
and er tea and sugar
but th the thing was that there was a mess room outside the fitting shop actually but there wasn't much room there because er men from other jobs er they p from outside used to go there and eat
so the our men er the fitters had erm a table in the shop itself
erm with in a corner sort of thing with a thing around it and you know
it was well i didn't see much sense in that either but er i mean if they were eating on the j er eating on the job didn't give you a break at all
but erm anyway the erm and some of the men used to go the older men used to go and er to the UNK and cos er the our the s fitting shop had a three fires at one end you see where the am blacksmiths were
oh they weren't blacksmiths in the ordinary sense of the word they weren't quarry blacksmiths as such because they were more or less engine UNK you see
yeah
they had to make and shape things for us well for the fitters the machine and that you know
they were w what would be called in the navy and that er engine UNK
cos they worked they didn't bash er ham UNK and things like a shop and the gear for the quarry men as such they cos that was the usual work of the erm the blacksmiths outside in the quarry itself you know in the b on the in the various banks
there was one usually one blacksmith per bank really
w were these
were these UNK still primarily concerned with UNK
yes
were they
they did the UNK work and all that you see and they looked after erm the er the inclined brakes what we call the brake
i haven't i haven't seen heard another name for them really
erm they looked after the w the ropes and er there was one blacksmith where he used to go on his rounds and check the wire ropes and the UNK and that on the UNK you know
test them for sa well that the insurance and the i suppose er the erm er what is it
the mining er you know the there's a body which looks after the mining
oh the inspectorate
the inspectorate er men i don't know whether it's the same as the one that looked after the coal field and all that but erm we had an inspector coming round every so often anyway
and erm the that was part of their work you see the these blacksmiths
and there were ooh a couple of what
a couple of dozen of these brakes or more
no at least a couple of dozen working at that time
so they were kept really busy
some of them were kept really busy just er looking after the brakes and they had to er check the er the erm UNK
they used to take the UNK off the wagon you see there were two UNK one each end of the wagons that they used on the UNK
and then they were put they were er put er in the fire wire UNK and all that and looked and UNK for cracks you see
and that came round er i mean they were UNK and er the turn you know the each i don't i don't remember what they were examined but er th you know the that was the law that they had to be
there were piles of them in the UNK anyway
that had been through the fire and they were taken out and you know whoever
and h well no they were put on the wagons actually
which were built in the wagon shops
and erm
can you give me some idea of some of the other trades that were represented in the er in the shop
oh erm they erm they did a lot of the work that were well they helped out at least they used to make wearing plates for the mills and that for the UNK and that
you see
erm oh they what else
erm oh there were a thousand and one things i can't really erm you know they were always they were at it hammer and UNK you know they had er s what would be called something similar to a steam hammer and you know
did they
to do the job yeah
er you know the they had a f what was it
four hundred weight UNK hammer
so you can imagine the he the amount of heavy work that they had as well
did they ever have a UNK
did they have a
no er well no er not that i remember
but erm i remember er h having i was quite interested actually er there was er a sort of loft in the stores
and there were patterns up in this store you see
mm
and i but i couldn't get up at them the UNK was fairly strict with us youngsters and he used to chase us
but erm they were oh m er wooden er gear wheels of all sizes and such things you know
up in this loft say
so i don't know whether they'd been sending them away to be er as patterns to some other firm or what but there was quite a UNK there was er a quantity of casting sand you know black stuff that you use
around the shop so obviously they'd been either been casting brass at some time or other
obviously
they didn't do i understand that the quarries at and those places used to cast their own stuff but erm i haven't i never heard of them actually casting anything erm UNK anyway
but erm the what we o very often did was er we used to run our own bearings with white metal
and we had er a special erm furnace for that
and er we used to run well most of our bearings actually er white metal bearings and machine them afterwards
and er we cast during the dark days of the war when toys weren't available we a few older blokes er apprentices used to i remember being at it for a couple of hard week we had a hard week well evening during the evenings anyway
er working sweating like er real steel men ca turning out soldiers and er and erm e UNK got hold of a mould of these er toy soldiers you know the old er lead soldiers that er
yeah
they used to come out in threes i think UNK
and some UNK aeroplane erm g er what er i think they were if i remember rightly they were the er oh dear
forget the name of the plane now for the moment
yes well
there were hundred of them flying round the end of the during the war
oh designed for the UNK
er coastal command
oh dear never mind
but we you know one was one would be boiling the white metal we'd fixed on the and er one would be boiling and pouring the stuff and the other cutting y you know breaking up the mould sort of thing and UNK the stuff out and as fast as we were UNK them up some UNK was creeping in and stealing them
oh dear
you know in actual fact one of the men working in the in the in the UNK shop
he was he'd been hurt that was the UNK that's why some of the men did
he'd been er had an accident in the quarry some time ago and he was working in the helping as a mate or something in the UNK shop and he must have been h must have had his hands in our pile of finished products and er well partly finished products and er he er he was caught one of the cos er these castings there was a an edge to them you know the joint of the mould that came together sort of thing
they had to be filed clean
this UNK had come in to the fitting shop corner at the back corner where he shouldn't have been
i mean he wasn't supposed to be in the fitting shop UNK
so the manager our greatest enemy we used to know when he started from the house in the morning actually by quarry that er he was coming but the on this particular day anyway somebody had slipped up somewhere
and he saw this bloke you see where he shouldn't have been
er filing away
and he had this erm casting of a plane you know he was cleaning up the edges gave the game away of course then
oh dear
anyway we i think we supplied dozens of UNK kids that had no toys during the war
you know
erm yes well th that's the only erm casting you know that we did
bearings for you know UNK mills really the old type UNK in mills that they were really old fashioned UNK
and they had to be the bearings had to be either you had to have a s a set ready at all times sort of thing you know so a spare set
erm yeah oh the bearings we they usually were bought from they were american er brass bearings huge brass things you know
they used to cost about two hundred pounds in those days and that was a heck of a sum in those days you know that sort of thing how much they cost and had to be careful of them and all that
and erm the other UNK the UNK up in here the primary UNK the american one
well that used to be sent away the o the main bearing the main er jaw bearing that was on the
it was usually about six was it
er somewhere about aye getting on for five foot long
erm th that was sent away to london white metal that was quite a costly affair as well
that's the one that you see in this er book you know
is that the one which was having the
yes cuts in it
yes
yes
and erm the old chief that designed er erm a boring bath for it for boring that
they didn't they just cast them roughly
well not roughly i mean they i mean they didn't sort of finish them off w wherever they was s sent to in whatever the firm i don't know the name of the firm i was i wasn't involved in didn't bother as long as the job was done
and erm the he made a boring bath so that the whole block it was a massive thing you know that had to be
i should imagine weighed somewhere about five six UNK
the capping
cos of the design of this UNK affair the whole weight was carried on the c what could be the UNK of the bearing you know the bearing cap
the whole lot down you see
oh i see
on the on the you there was only the was only er three quarter of an inch out of centre sort of thing you know but the shaft weighed ten tonne and you have this huge and it just l UNK of course and the whole lot UNK under this cap
so the whole weight of the whole er the gear that actually sent the UNK going and made it so the UNK the swing jaw swing and all that was er hanging on the cap you see
it didn't matter the other half didn't matter because it didn't come into contact really with the with the shaft
and erm the oh he'd made i'm getting er losing my track
but er he'd made er a boring bath from the UNK of a steam engine
there was a spare one lying around we'd finished u er stopped using them during the war some time during the war
cos coal was hard to get and all that
and er gone on to diesel
and this old UNK had been built up so that this bearing lay on that and it was turned by and electric motor and all that and the boring bar went tool went and bored this bearing out and travelled along on its own its own it was fed off course
you know it was a quite a brilliant idea really
cos he was a brilliant man actually my boss er my chief at the time
he was the erm he came from anglesey
and he'd been UNK in liverpool with a firm called they were ship UNK in liverpool
and er i suppose he he'd gone there when he was about thirteen fourteen and er he came from a family from where was it
and some of his UNK relatives they UNK but some of his relatives were blacksmiths as well you see
so he'd sort of had a well i suppose he'd UNK around helped and played about in the UNK
before he even started erm when he before he went to liverpool as an apprentice
but he was a brilliant man he was years ahead of his time really
erm UNK w wanted him in america
he was offered a job in america with UNK but he wouldn't go
and erm he was by the way he was the er step erm father in law of the man who erm owned who was the erm building firm er in er oh dear they've gone now
it's just been taken over by you know it's gone into the big time er oh dear me i forget his name now
name of the man
g anyway
oh er and er he had a son who was a dentist in
john quite a well known UNK he was a very good dentist
i suppose he erm william owen old chief
he used to bring his tools up during the war to er to er so be seen to you know
cos they were hard to get
oh yes
and er one of the men that was helping the old man to do something to repair the these tools you know and he he'd gone to the stores to get something and leaning over the counter to get something er to sort of talk as one goes on a on a counter lean he was leaning a on the counter and he erm the UNK he was a tough little UNK and he said i've got a i've got a i've got a UNK
he says
and asked him you know erm which one is it
and the other silly UNK opened his mouth and pointed to a tooth you know
and he just UNK in there and got hold of it these tools er once you get a hold of those things you know they they're pretty they're fantastic you they won't
i mean them they're designed to er so that they don't slip or anything
and he held on the handle and he pulled the UNK tooth out
but he pulled thing was sorry thing was that he pulled the one next to the one that he had a UNK in
wow
was tough he's still alive in
er couldn't have done him any harm
and er no but erm that's how the old chief
erm as i say he was a he was brilliant man er i mean we all we i'm about one of the last of the ones that were taught under him
i mean we were very fortunate in having been UNK er UNK under him you see
were you were you aware before you went there that erm you were going into you were going to serve under someone who was rather UNK
well i'd heard of him yes
but i was er here i was one of the first people have forgotten that there was such a thing as a fitting shop in you know in
and i started a fashion really in going cos no one had er thought of the thing for many years
and erm later on let's see f when the war started and i mean they wanted cheap labour and all that there was room for apprentice
several boys went to the fi to the fitting shop you see but the i'd started i claimed to have started i mean it's i mean there's no credit to me but at least i was the first you know i'd really started the thing you know
where had they come from before then
oh usually
yes
yes
yes
they knew
more about it yes
was the well i suppose they had first claim in
that sort of thing yeah
but they came with the chief being an anglesey man you see they came from anglesey as well to erm they used to come a lot in and erm as apprentices you know and er aye no the UNK same old game again that er we in wales seem to inherit it's in i suppose it's in the b c and everywhere isn't it
it's not what you know it's who you know
and er somebody's got a relative somewhere
i mean happened even with the monarchy and all that most welsh people ran england when they didn't have it really did they
these families that left wales to help out with the UNK and all that
erm i still er think i think they're still running britain aren't they
gone way out i've gone through to get to UNK
erm th this tea making was a er job of course there was a break at nine o'clock you see
cos we started at half past seven
i used to catch a bus ten to seven down when the in those days
never been late in my life
erm the erm course the UNK was on at nine
they used to blast first UNK at nine o'clock throughout the quarry you see so everybody had to go in so that was an excuse for a break
about ten minutes break
then cos you had er three UNK you got five minutes before and er then you had a the erm final warning and then the UNK and the they give you the all clear
i mean it took about ten minutes quarter of an hour altogether
so if these UNK up at the top it was had been er thought out had a break well er it was UNK right for the others working down in the bottom to have a break
so nine o'clock break
make the tea go round the used to take about three UNK of tea to make the bottle
i remember we i had this sort of UNK brown UNK jug ooh it was mm must have been somewhere about four
mm couple of pints at least eh
oh more three pints i'm sure
er and erm i used to put it in this and go to out into the mess room outside where they there was a cook and it was a very grand name for a person you know a cook
it's almost as grand as a UNK these days isn't it
the bloke who sits behind the ship in the chip shop
UNK that basket he had they have erm and er the er used to go there er and there was a boil or was it er an old fashioned i don't know
have you se have you seen them the old fashioned UNK they used to have
er sort of
yes half UNK
yes
cast iron
built er with bricks built round it and er a tap we used to have a tap on it you see
and the cook in that mess room and the cook was always a UNK who started in the quarry
that's the way you started up a ladder to the to be a managing director
a cook
you know like the this thing about every soldier having a field UNK in his UNK
anyway erm they started at well you know quite an easy job but the er s their wage was about UNK i forget
i d i wouldn't know
i think my starting salary at fifteen was seven and six
out of that i had to find threepence a day erm bus fare
excuse me
and we worked six w six i mean we worked saturday mornings you know six o'clock
plus er going up going to you know all that
UNK there wasn't much left of the seven and six to UNK feed me and all that
and er i think after and when i became sixteen that er had to start paying your m paying the union i had to join the union as a junior member you know
and er hospital fund and all this business
anyway erm so you
our standard of living well our standard of living was alright
i mean er didn't bring much home
and er the cook i think the boys e had about er started on ten shillings you know ten shillings a week
erm but er that was this boy's job and then he used to er you know scrub the tables in the rest room and of course boil the water first thing in the morning
and er wash the cups and he used to have to go running er down with messages down to or down to the head office rather that we had an office in where our fitting shop was where there was a UNK office
and a store a store a sort of store clerk
cos we had other people concerned with the stores down in the head office as well the buyers and
and a couple of young clerks that's where they bred their clerks for the future use sort of thing you know
i see
and this cook had to go down and carry messages back and forth and all that was his job as cook
not he couldn't handle a UNK duck or er couldn't UNK a duck or anything like that you know
or make orange UNK or er anything of that sort
er and i don't think any other most of them started and they're still here some of them
er still UNK a duck any more than i can
well er not without a book of instructions anyhow beside me anyway
er anyway the that was the UNK job and that was my job i used to sort of go across and fetch this tea and have it ready by the time the men gave up work at nine o'clock
but er i used to go i didn't eat with the men you weren't allowed to eat with the men you see it was only the full men that sat round this table well
that was
half about eight of them you see
well it was the same no distinction at all in that sense but er you know we were sort of they had more serious things to talk about than i wan er you know i knew the cook er couple of o other apprentices from the UNK shop we used to go into the main th there was no one to keep an eye on us in the in the mess room you see no one to tell us
so we could play
and erm at the same time there was an old mill there as well with an old er engine room
which had apparently been a steam there had been a steam engine turning this er mill UNK mill and er i remember there was a name in this engine it was queen of the valley
and erm we used to go and play in that sort of you know do the things that boys usually do
sort of oh we used to risk our UNK walking across the UNK this mill was a bit of a UNK actually and we used to go playing in places where we shouldn't have really
anyway that's beside the point
but erm and then at during er before lunch and all that i used to have to go take a bucket and go to the UNK and erm as you may know there's a cooling er tank beside in the in er beside every erm UNK fire and er you know to bo keep the er no t no to keep the UNK of the
of the UNK
UNK going you see
oh
how do you do
how do you do
hi
and this co er and used to get w hot water from this tank you see lift it out with a ooh with some sort with a UNK actually
er and er put it in the bucket and get the right temperature
up my elbow and er anyway put it used to take it back to the shop and er well i was still inside the shop down to a certain place in the shop and put it on a on a stand and then there'd be a on that stand beside the bucket was a box of not UNK not UNK soap but er yellow soap
oh yes
in welsh
and erm UNK of it had been cut like er it looked you know if you sort of cut UNK or something like that
no you don't belong to that age either do you
erm you know you get it in packets now anyway
but er you know used to UNK cut it out of er big UNK
but er there's be lump of this y yellow er stuff you know
and beside that again another box full of erm well partly full depended on what time of the week it was
erm dust quarry dust and er very fine UNK you know
so you got a handful of this yellow soap
and er rubbed it and it was quite very hard you know
and er put a UNK er UNK your hand into this the UNK as well started rubbing using the water we'd got
some hot water
and see my hands they they're quite they're exactly like a er well shall we say an educated person's hand a person who's spent his life working behind a desk
but you know it's funny how why it was so i mean the UNK and those were quite sharp you know you you'd have thought that it would have taken your skin but then it was ideal stuff for getting the UNK the you know the dirt and i mean the UNK dirt away
it's easy enough to dirt
that was the method that we used and i didn't i never heard i didn't hear of UNK or anything until well twenty five years afterwards
erm i mean the one could very easily have got er some form of UNK with all the you know various oils and stuff that we had to put our hands in
but erm and all the old mill for UNK that we used to used i mean kept our hands clean anyway
so that was one job a and then we had a big used to beg for a an old sack from the stores and open that out and er i used to wash them wash it and get it very soft and clean and hang that up and that's the way used to clean and keep ourselves cl hands clean
and er but for all this erm funny enough we had er a fair in twice a year
we haven't had one for oh many what fifteen twenty years a co er there used to be a couple of women used to come to sell rock
up to about UNK they kept the thing going their pitch going i suppose UNK to about twenty years ago
but we had a spring fair in april and the other in october
i think so
and the fair was on the first of october
somewhere round that time
i i'd er you know the older men would tell you
cos i didn't sort of go by fairs and things like that i belonged to a different generation
erm but erm come the time had come for the fair let's say the spring fair
i'd get quite a surprise because very s small number of men in the shop
i get about shillings eight and six nine bob pocket money
fair money they used to call it you see
mhm
er i know er perhaps i was er civil or UNK or whatever i don't know but er i they u they used to have this collection for the for supposedly for carrying the water i don't know
but erm er it was a nice sum to be to take with you to the fair
you know
er because it was more than a weeks wages
to spend evening
and used to happen twice a year and erm sometimes UNK remember my birthday or find that i had my birthday or and at christmas time we used to get some money
and this was out of a you know er i mean they were only what oh couldn't be more than about six eight people working in the well not actually fitters but er you know they were involved within the shop sort of thing
i don't know how many t other people were approached in this collection i don't know
but erm they were you know they were UNK kind really
yeah they were very kind too
cos their salary we well their wages weren't much
they i believe that er a UNK wage was somewhere they'd a take home pay at the end of the fortnight
you'll notice that i say end of the fortnight that was the settling time
er was three UNK
was it
it was one and three an hour
the UNK and UNK rate in those days
and a UNK rate was eleven pence an hour
mm
wh what erm what ye what year would this be that you sort of s
i don't k nineteen thirty seven maybe
thirty seven
yeah
mm
yeah
and erm you know it was a bad time really b you know it was the thirties i mean people say it's bad now but er i don't think it's as bad now as it was then
i know the unemployment figures may be higher and all this business but erm i mean er a single person during those days er say a young man in his teens working would been s stopped in the quarry
they were bad times they used to stop
er they were very fair er if i may bring in er this has nothing to do with my er well no it has as well
you know friends of mine i knew them
erm they were quite fair the in this quarry then
cos if it was UNK or anything they used to stop the UNK first you know
i see
er you know i af i mean after i didn't think anything of it and in those days i was too young of course to think of th things like that
but thinking back i mean they were it was very good of them really you know the they were very fair
er in the way that they and they sort of well i suppose it was the situation in which the quarries you know sort of or and
and er the foreman and bosses that knew people and they knew the circumstances and i suppose they put a word in and erm you know men were sort of stopped because er i mean if a man had a house full of children or something he'd probably be the very last you know before he was sort of forced to g you know sacked or wh and i mean they weren't sacked in a sense they was always ready there was a place ready for them to come back to there
but erm
so
laid off i suppose would be a more appropriate way of s of putting it
so that it was it was generally thought of as being a fair system
yes
in the main i should think yes
you know you know erm a young man i mean it was er reasonable wasn't it for a single man to be laid off before a married man with family responsibilities
and er generally er with families being larger er in those days erm there'd be perhaps another couple of sons working or something like to help
make a family income you know or increase the family income
or so they could all eat at least
and erm no well as i say erm i think they were pretty fair
i mean f i d i doubt whether firms would do it these days eh
it wouldn't be considered fair today anyway
no the union would step in probably and er say that er last in er first out or some UNK
mm
nonsense like that eh
but that's the memory i have of it eh
wh when you went in as an apprentice did you have any i idea of what the job was
what it UNK
oh yes erm you know having been brought up w in a you could almost say a UNK atmosphere that's the right er expression but erm i mean one knew what w went on in the quarry you know
erm mind you it was really a step onto something else that as far as i was concerned in those days i meant o go to sea of course and er that was the best place you could have er to serve an apprenticeship because everything er i mean it was one of the as everything was starting to get specialized in other works nowadays it's gone completely now
but erm we had a sort of a spectrum you know it covered such a wide well area if you like of er of engineering that one wouldn't have had a chance to have a any contact with in any other works you'd be doing as one certain sphere you know a certain type of work and there you are you that's your lot eh
but we covered everything you know steam engines and diesel engines and oh UNK and construction work and development and UNK gear UNK and oh any damn thing that went going
we made everything ourselves more or less
and had a hand in oh designing really there
we were always taught this er comes back again
i think er you know this our boss er who mr as he was called he was given his full title of er mr william owen then
i mean er much more should have been something should have been aye he's well worth er within the engineering world at least well worth looking into his life really
because he he's done a you know he he's been a what shall i say a well he's done a lot really to promote erm interest in engineering and all that and he's done a lot in helping er to young men to become engineers and that you know
he he's erm really er the results of his interest in teaching
er north wales you know have benefited
firms in north wales here along the coast which came after the war of course
can you sort of UNK that if you can
well as i told you to begin with he must he was a man was er years ahead of his tim really
i mean and he although he er he wasn't a graduate or anything like that i mean he was a brilliant engineer
his ideas are as i they say that he was er i don't know how much truth i that he was the first that he UNK and devised the first UNK machine
rock UNK machine you see
cos the f the they did have UNK machines quarries
for ooh from beginning of the century i suppose
but they were only UNK in a sense
they only UNK the they the they didn't rotate
i see
they just r UNK their way and you had an man the they had a man they tell me i i've never seen one but erm this was as far as i can make out er by the they had a man standing by you see with a UNK and er gave it a quarter turn every time it UNK the drill sort of hit the rock went into the and UNK
they had to give it a quarter turn you see with a UNK
but erm that old the a and b we used to call them actually
a and b erm there was no dis UNK but a and b and er he'd erm he devised a method he what he did he UNK the inside of the UNK
he UNK the inside of the cylinder and the UNK was UNK as well you know slightly UNK so as it went forward it turned you see
came back and there was a er it couldn't turn cos there was erm oh dear i'm forgetting my engineering terms but er you know it's a that's the
and that's this is er i think i've already told you that he was offered a job with UNK which were the main er people that dealt with air and air products in the old days
the american firm
they tried to get him to america you see
but he wouldn't go there
william didn't want to take his UNK off
because he liked to work with his hands
yes he was a heck of a man
he could he was a brilliant UNK and er oh UNK i've seen him turn out a three throw er UNK within a couple of days er you know without any precise measuring and in fact he just sort of put his roll on a on the shaft he was turning and just sort of gave him an idea as to i mean his eye was almost as good as many a UNK measurement with a rule
but er a three throw UNK for a bump you know couple of days to erm he was a heck of a man
and he dis we had i haven't told you er didn't tell you or h i er don't think i've told you have i that we did have a chemist in the quarry you know
full time chemist
would he be analyzing samples
yeah analyzing yes
mr his name was
and he apparently was a very nice man too er i mean he was i mean er a nice UNK i mean yeah
they stand out
and er oh he was he erm during the war now come nineteen thirty nine and that UNK period when er there was nothing doing really in france between the time that er our UNK to the to the UNK line and all that
er he went over s there was a plane laid on for him and he was ve went over very often to advise them on UNK on all their concrete UNK in france
did he
yes yeah
very well thought off actually
and he designed some er i remember them being built
erm air raid UNK
built to his design under the rock face up at the top here in
and er concrete and all stuff
and er rock er dropped use that expression they used they were both right at the at the foot of the quarry face or UNK or whatever somewhere around a hundred foot high and then th they UNK the top see and dropped a whole fall
a fall is what we call you know a bundle of
rock
rock there
ah excuse me
and erm on this er structure and obviously there wasn't a everything was fine inside it
mind you no one volunteered to stay inside when it was
but erm all the UNK
check that
okay that's on
we er when you
right okay
forty three
that's it on now then
yes
well that's when i first started farming
mhm
after i left the council i worked for the council for ten years and then i stopped the council in nineteen forty six for i UNK you that afore have i
that's right
yes
i couldn't leave them you see with the war on
mhm
well then in later years t UNK came to be a great fashion in orkney here
mhm
and er j and w in kirkwall started to UNK hay in orkney but it didn't pay for you to take to kirkwall everyday to go to since the war
and if it was bad weather he'd to take them home again
so he asking me if i would do it
so he gave me a UNK and i did all of UNK around about UNK and sanday and round the area here and UNK their hay to them
and then he bought another UNK and he worked with two UNK
but there was no UNK in orkney then at all that was the first UNK that came here
aha
so was that first UNK belong to this chap in kirkwall
j and w
oh right
he was the agent you see for international UNK
i see
and he was going to start old charlie a very old man
the grandfather of the people that has it now
and he wanted to help me to get under way you see but i wasn't long started farming
mm
so then he bought another UNK
well then people started to get UNK of their own and er d i didn't er get so much work
but i did the whole of orkney for a while i did everything that could be done
and then later on combining started
and er for the and then at UNK took on two new UNK from ma from the UNK company that was them days
and of course they didn't hire with them
but the man who lived at in UNK he was going to retire
so i bought his combine from him
so i hired it out to people and work night and day when the weather was bonny combining their barley and that
and then i bought another one and then i bought a third one so that i had three UNK but there were no other UNK on orkney at all
that was the first of the UNK
but what date it was i couldn't tell you but if you like to mind when they first started
aye
i think it'd been about nineteen sixty maybe but i'm not sure
mhm
so
and the and then the council they used to cut the roads with UNK you ken cut the weeds on the roads
and i worked for the council so he spoke to me one day and he said will you cut the roads with a tractor and a mower
i says yes i'll cut them
so he in the paper then asking farmers anybody had a tractor and a mower if they cut a certain section of the road
well he didn't get much satisfaction with that for some people wouldn't do it
so i said i'll cut all the roads in the west mainland if you want
so they took me on and the to cut all the roads from UNK right to west mainland right out into kirkwall and
that's the end you see
some other body did the east mainland
and i cut the whole roads in three weeks time with a mower
and i oh it's you see three weeks to cut the isle of orkney mind
i wonder how long it takes them now to cut the roads
and they paid me sixteen and six an hour for the tractor and a mower and myself
and i started in the morning at eight o'clock and i didn't stop till midnight
i did sixteen hours every day six days a week
i didn't cut on a sunday
for i had to stay at home and look after me farm for
but me wife was good then you see and so was my son and they both worked the farm you see
and looked after it and i went to do this job for
it was
mhm
was it
so what happened afore the machinery came in
did they actually have folk with UNK
UNK
aha all cut with UNK
long ago
i mind it all cut with UNK
the UNK
yes
the road UNK
yes
see the road UNK wasn't the same long ago it was UNK
mm
on the roads
but as i told you before when the council started preparing for hitler in when i went on the council work in nineteen thirty six i had to fill the UNK in there
and make UNK on the roads
and they UNK the roads and UNK them
well they only started UNK in nineteen thirty six
that's the first they started in orkney
it was the road was still there he had to do it and they were put there by the government
to be a road surveyor and a travelling foreman
and peter was a super foreman
but he was coming for doing the borders UNK and UNK down that and UNK
and they were a they were you see
mhm
at the job
mhm
and they took me on in nineteen thirty six to help them you see
for i was looking for a job i was newly married in nineteen thirty six make a pound or two
mhm
i see
so how did they work it with the UNK
was the council chaps employed
council men put out with UNK
yeah
and a lorry you see to cut the road UNK
mhm
well they found they could do it far better with a tractor and a mower
mhm
and then you see the council i did that for nineteen years
and then i stopped farming in nineteen seventy cut it till sixty nine
well the council started then and they took on machines of their own
which they work on the same system as a as a UNK
and it cuts up the grass in wee bits and instead of er making the roads better it makes them worse
for it cuts up the grass like UNK manure it chops it up you see and it UNK quick and makes the grass grow quicker
but when i cut the roads it was cut with a finger mower
and it lay flat and it UNK the grass out
and it only needed to be cut once a year
now when they cuts the roads every week if there was a watch as you go by you see them cutting the whole time with a tractor
the council
how do you like to hear what it's costing now
the old fashioned way was the best way to do it
mhm
and when they cut it with UNK did they gather it
no they left it lying
they just left it lying
yes i rot it out you see
yeah
to rot out the grass
mhm
see anybody who cuts their garden with a mower if you drag the grass off it doesn't grow so quick
mhm
but if you let it lie it UNK it you see
mhm
till you put it down on a on a field
mhm
and that's what's happening with the council you see
they cut it and chop it up
mhm
and makes it s small
mm
well it UNK quick
that's right
mhm
so when you had your UNK did you did you go round the neighbouring peedie farms
yes they used to book for cutting you see
i used to go and cut their barley to them and i bought a thing for drying the barley too
oh
a great big leicester thing
that UNK the UNK out of it
oh right
if you'd anything to put in it you'd UNK the a the UNK out you see and dried it
oh
what they called a UNK
i bought it from
mhm
a very powerful thing
you couldn't stand in front of it there was that much power in it
oh right
and was it mostly the bigger farms that wanted you
anybody who wanted combining i did it
aha
was it mostly the bigger farms or did the peedie ones
oh the peedie ones did it four or five or six acre you cut the and bag it the barley to them put it in the er the UNK on the machine you see
mhm
but in latter days they came with a tank and they put it out and put it in a trailer you see but i just worked with bags when it was the first of it
oh right
but you can't get bags now except plastic ones it was all UNK bags then
i worked every day there was weather
mhm
if it was a bonny day you worked on till sometimes three in the morning they were doing the
mhm
you would work any hours to suit the weather you see
mhm
yeah
and it's never hurt me hard work
it must have been quite a UNK though when the first combine came
oh folk came form far and near to see it
is that right
oh yeah
on a bonny day
ah
it would be quite a unusual thing at first
oh it was the first that ever started in orkney nobody ever thought you see before they used to cut their crop and set it in UNK
then you used to build it in a stack and then you used to take it in the barn and UNK it
going with a combine it's all done in one operation you see
the UNK in the bag
mhm
then you do the it
mhm
and three great big bins from the they called them and i had three bins in my shed that i stored the barley in and i put the UNK into them and it blew it had wee in it and it blew all the UNK out
and when you brought it for your cattle like the UNK making whisky
mm
it UNK you see the cattle was for it
oh
it UNK and made it very sweet
and it made your dairy cows milk awful good
oh right
mhm
we worked with dairy as well seventy two dairy cows
mhm
right
i suppose the UNK machines coming in would have been another
they come in nineteen forty seven i started dairy in nineteen forty seven
i shifted to this farm in nineteen forty three but i d worked on the council in nineteen forty six
and then i start dairy work
well dairy cows
mhm
and bought a UNK machine
mm
used to start to work with the farmers you see but i didn't
mhm
and put it in bulk tanks you ken taking milk away down in a tank i mean we used to take it away in cans
mhm
ten UNK cans
on a lorry
mhm
take it into kirkwall
mhm
mhm
mm
a big change from the from the UNK by hand
oh same as always
yes
you know
i never UNK by hand it was always the machine
yeah
do you mind seeing folk doing on the
oh yes er when i was at home as a wee boy everybody UNK by hand and give their UNK the milk then to drink
mhm
but then later to UNK their UNK it's less work
mhm
everything their doing now is always making less work and that's why there's so much unemployed
mm
they're cutting labour you see
mhm
and there's no it doesn't help any for UNK so expensive to buy the machinery
mhm
like a combine UNK about thirty or forty thousand
mhm
well that's a lot of wages
mhm
and UNK only used a s short time of the year
mm
but it's only used in the bonny weather you see
i see
UNK are used for the twelve months you see but not a combine
mhm
more worthwhile getting a tractor right enough
yeah
yeah
that's true
and then i when i was about the UNK fishing in the loch here
well my UNK my great grandfather came from sanday with his wife and a wee daughter
and my grandfather married the daughter and he came to
UNK loch and the stenness loch were fishing
with the tourist trade so they always kept boats you see
mhm
so we worked with boats those UNK for four generations
and my mother came from the farm along the shore and they were in the same position they worked with boats too
and you hired them out to the tourist trade
but in them days there wasn't many tourists came to orkney for they didn't have transport no cars
but UNK you see there's an awful lot of folks coming and buses on tours and that and the tourist trade on the loch here's busy you know
there's more folk working don't make so much money on it
mhm
did your father do that when you were peedie farmers
and my grandfather and my great grandfather
all did and so did my mother's side they came from the farm up the l up the loch i mean that's where my mother came from
mhm
what sort of folk was it then
was it gentry folk coming up for their holidays
yes they came for their holidays
mhm
and no they come from all the world and hire boats that people would make
all over the continent and all over the states and that
mhm
aye show you people you'll see in the loch not last july but the july came to the states
mhm
i can show you photographs of them in the loch here
mhm
yeah
so when you first started UNK out boats was it where did you get your boats from was it
well i mean they were handed down for generations
our UNK had boats see and you either bought new ones or repaired the ones that was there
mm
but my family done that for four generations
yeah
on the UNK loch and the stenness loch
that's some while
it was a while ago
yeah
that's some while
were your boats made by a local boat builder
well somebody built them at the boat builders in orkney built some
mhm
they used to they started boat building in UNK where the builders is now you ken what do you call them
aye
builders what do you call them
erm
well that's where they started boat building there
yeah
at that big shed
i see
what do they call that place now
erm has the UNK that it
yes
yeah
well that's where they started building boats at
something i can't remember what it is
yeah
yeah
i see so that was originally where the boat builders was
and they came with a and started there
mm
was the name
and the same UNK working in UNK yet
UNK of them making boats in UNK
but i get people to the fishing here asking if the UNK built there
by
and all grand boats
they built awful bonny boats
but there a that builds boats some of them you're in the builds boats
mhm
right
and i suppose they would be wooden boats would they
aye timber boats but now they're making UNK ones but they're not so good in the loch for the water runs up them quicker they're so smooth
bodies are made in UNK you see and there's a UNK in it
and it keeps the water from running up them so quick
mhm
in UNK weather
when you get strong winds here in the sometimes in the summer
you get gale force winds sometimes
mm
did you fish much yourself then
oh yes i always went fishing as a wee boy me and my brother
mm
we used to catch a lot of fish and it was always in them days you used to catch the UNK in the summer and you used to dry them on the on the UNK and hang them on the line like you could see UNK and that drying
you've seen that on south ronaldsay you know
mhm
mhm
we used to dry the UNK here
i suppose UNK would be your fish of the summer rather than er
well get it aye it was only UNK you get in the harry loch you see
you'd get a chance salmon
mm
yeah
what about stenness do you ever get the sea fish coming
well it used to be the stenness loch was very good till they built the barriers
the barriers spoilt it
is that right
yes when the barriers wasn't there you see the water came right out through hoy and went right out at
and kept stromness and kirkwall clear of UNK
now you see it's blocked and good now is at
or
mm
or er hoy
mm
so it made the stenness loch UNK for the as pollution comes in the stenness loch and it f spoilt the fishing here
since the barriers was built
that's my experience of the happening in my time
mm
do you mind actually what would you ever get sea fish in stenness loch then
oh it's sea UNK you get there
come from the sea
would you ever get like or UNK
oh yes you get UNK
mm
and stenness it's sea is salt you see
mhm
would you get a mixture would you ever get the UNK fish as well as the sea fish
oh yes you get them too
they come through to the
aha
must be kind of it's kind of unusual really
yeah
both the sea and the
well when i was a wee boy the loch had never looked it before the barriers was built when i was going to school well i was born i started a co school at nineteen eighteen
well there was a air station at UNK at er stenness then for sea planes landing in the loch
that was during the first war
and seen UNK going out for the stenness hotel s with sailing boats i've seen eight leaving there in the morning i went to school
all on stenness they never went to UNK for there were plenty of fish in stenness you see
but now you can fish stenness all UNK and you'll never see a fish
the sewage has spoilt it whether you can't come it it's all dirty
yeah
yeah
mhm
would that be where the local the local sort of gentry tourists stayed then at the stenness hotel
there wasn't there's no other hotels one at the but there's very few hotels then
mhm
it was it was called hotel then
mhm
built it and he built he had the kirkwall hotel the stenness hotel and the stromness hotel and an hotel in shetland
mm
and the hotels he put up he bought them in glasgow there'd be an exhibition hotel made of wood built in glasgow
he took two of them up here and took them in sections and built one in stenness and another in
and this man came from the UNK of scotland
i remember him finding going to the school
his son took over the kirkwall hotel when he grew up
and his UNK did couldn't manage the hotels at all and him he went away he lived in UNK and canada a while
and i don't know if he's living or dead
that was three i remember
er
so did they just keep the hotel open all year for these visitors
no but they didn't use it for they didn't have a license then they only got a license after the war you see
oh i see
and the same the kirkwall hotel was kept open and the stromness hotel but the stenness hotel was closed
for they'd no work you see and the staff there was paid off
for i remember it all shut up
mm
they'd no they'd no electric or nothing there you see and they'd water through a well
mhm
but then the got the electric and the county water but the UNK the kirkwall hotel and the stromness hotel and the stenness hotel was all connected with the man's own private phone
he had his own private phone
for he UNK with the telephone people and he put another wire on the other side of the road to himself
good grief
he didn't th he didn't have a public phone that was a private phone he had
mm
i remember the school
mm
heavens
so the stenness hotel has been up for a while then
it was up nineteen five i think for tourists or nineteen three somewhere ni just after the turn of the century
heaven UNK
but i think it was built maybe in er in the er nineteen eighty or early eight maybe nineteen ninety five or UNK but it took a while they got it UNK
and they came from glasgow
in sections
and they added onto it and made it bigger since
mhm
but the last the first part of it that was built went on fire not long ago
mhm
and it was UNK that's the only part burnt out
and it built of timber
which would be why it was such a terrible UNK it ripped the roof right off
yes
yes it was all timber
aye
i remember i remember first war starting
oh i see
so did this fella keep visitors right up through the year or was it just the summer
not in stenness
not in stenness
but in you see travellers and that came up to stromness and the kirkwall hotel
mhm
and then he used the stenness hotel for visitors but there's not you got some
see in them days of the old steam boats and they came from er from leith and aberdeen
mm
and then they had to walk
no cars you see
i remember people walking
mm
pony and UNK
mm
yeah
would did the local folk get employment there
oh yeah that's what i'm saying there's eight people used to go up i've seen eight people leaving the stenness hotel UNK were around go round UNK for the stenness hotel
i've seen eight boat leaving there with UNK on them
i see
when i was going to school
how big would these boats be
how many folk would they carry
two folk and the UNK
there was two folk one each end of the boat and the UNK in the middle
they boats were anything from ten to twelve feet
that's the size the boats were boats you see
mhm
yeah
that's a making some of them fourteen feet long now
mhm
and i suppose er l some of the UNK would have UNK work as
oh they all got work making food you see UNK
and whatever yeah
and chamber UNK
mhm
all the local people you see there's nobody goes to work now there's nobody to work
mm
the houses there's nobody
yeah
there used to be big families i've seen down at there were six girls there
we'd have plenty of work for them you see
mhm
and did anybody ever hire out like ponies and UNK for this
yes everybody nearly had a pony and UNK then
mhm
now then you see the motor cars came
mhm
my father had a pony and UNK
every family nearly had it
mhm
right
and my father used to UNK in the summertime
and my brother and my grandfather used to and my great grandfather they all took helped on the loch you see
mm
did you do that too
oh yes i did it not long ago
i used to i UNK here
mhm
would that have been a kind of enjoyable job
well if you were interested
mhm
mhm
the first pay they got was two the first i remember people UNK for the stenness hotel their pay was two and six and a gill of whisky
that was the days pay
two and six
that wasn't much money
no
no
would that be straight from the folk that
at
they UNK for
yes the
or from the chap at the hotel
no they were paid from the people that employed them
mhm
and they give them a gill of whisky that was supposed to be for their lunch you see
for their lunch
yes
a gill of UNK not much
and it was good whisky they got was too new made you see
mm
mm
mm
yes
and there were a woman in stromness at a white horse there were a garage in stromness they call the white UNK
well there were a woman that used to have that and they called her maggie and she used to serve drinks there whisky and that was before stromness was voted dry you see
after the last war you see it was voted dry
did you know that
it was voted completely UNK and the people who wanted to drink had to go to UNK
well maggie at this place they called the white horse and it was two er two pence for a nip
and they used to heap the glasses
and she always gave them good measure and did an awful trade
but then they voted stromness dry you see
there was no drink in stromness of any kind
was that just after the second war or just afore it
the first war
oh the first war
ah right
right and they didn't get a license back to the second war
mhm
i remember stromness dry for i was i used to drive a car then i used to pick up folk and take them to the UNK and take them back again
but i used to do work for customer down the garage there he used to have two cars to hire and i drove one in my spare time
oh right
i see
so was stromness voted dry after the first war then or afore it
after
after the first war i think it was
oh i see
and there was a big UNK in stromness you see
ah
i can't remember the people that'd be in records there used to be a UNK there
i've heard of that right enough
cos there
yeah
was a bottle of whisky from that UNK went for a huge p price at one of the big
yeah
UNK south
aye
i and i can't mind forgotten
i can't minded there
mhm
right
i see
the man was heard of him
i don't know he's the same s in south ronaldsay or not would he be different s
no idea
would it be the same
a UNK in south ronaldsay is it not
used to be
that's right
yes that's right
are they there yet
no
er well not the same folk
oh different ones
the UNK still there
yeah
it's kind of it's calls itself the treasure chest now
well that man bought the UNK in stromness and broke it up and sold the timber out of it
grand timber in it you see
aye
it was a big place
mhm
i see
and i can't remember what they called the whisky
they shipped it south you see
shame though you know
yeah
mm
stromness must have had a big UNK movement then
yes
and the herring fishing in stromness they used to walk with the boats right across the pier
they would walk over the boats the herring boats herring fishing
and then it stopped and they went to stronsay then
mhm
but stronsay fishing from the herring fishing
you've seen old photos of that
yes
mm
quite amazing the number of peedie boats just available
i'll show you a photo here in the water right up at the c the cathedral
you ever seen it
no
i'll show you a photo of that
oh brilliant
is that just with a high flood
no there was no houses there
oh i see
oh right
back road wasn't there
ah right
oh yes i'd like to see that
that'd be great
see folk well maybe UNK in boats right up to the cathedral
you'll not mind it like that though do you
no but i mind it well the power station i mind it no road there
great western road
mhm
i mind no road there
for i worked at the council they were trying to make a road there then
dumping rubbish in that end you ken driving the council lorries
mhm
they built the council garage with built for the when UNK came here
mm
and he built a new house at and they call it UNK house yet
mhm
and they call the road UNK road
is that finished
no it's a wee while to go yet
they call it UNK road you see
mm
he's a marvellous man he came to orkney to improve the orkney roads
that's about him and peter they're two men who could do it
mhm
they understood what they were doing
mhm
mm
well there must have been a lot of roads
you know that they did improve
well they made an awful lot of new roads since you see
yeah
well if it was a narrow road then they made it twice as wide
mhm
i mean you could hardly pass two buses on it then
mhm
and the road here was just UNK road grass road in the middle of it
mhm
now it's a having buses on it
mhm
since the war UNK changed terrible
mhm
mm
yes the amount of machinery and changes in farming and everything it's all just
yeah
all the all over really
mm
mm
what about going right back again what was what relation of i of yours was the had something to do with breeding horses is that right
my gran my father
ah
start the what they call they what did you say the name of it again
horse breeding
central horse breeding society
yeah
and then when he gave it up when his wife died he stopped it then and they changed it into the west mainland horse breeding society
mhm
mhm
and they used to wh why they used to work this breeding you see they used to ad well some people in the south UNK they wanted to travel to orkney to make money and advertise them
mhm
and they used to call a meeting and this horse breeding society would have called a meeting you know the ones that looked after choosing the horse they were gonna select for this certain season you see
they started in april and they travelled on till july
oh
and was it his job to take the UNK round
well the man travelled round the man travelled round with a pony riding a pony and the UNK walking alongside you see
and er they like i told you before they used a whole a UNK in kirkwall
that's where the UNK is standing right now there was great big piece there and they held a UNK there in the very first early in april
and all the people that had UNK south been left in orkney all winter somebody had kept them
they all UNK in there
on a certain day
and i used to get in when i was a young boy and see them when i started working on a farm i always to see them
it was awful interesting to see bonny horse
mhm
mhm
and then you see they when the UNK was by they used to set out the next day some maybe taken for the west mainland and some taken for and some were
and they went round on their rounds and they called along every eleven days
why every eleven days
well that's when your when your UNK came in season
ah
and then when you put her in foal served her with a UNK
mhm
when they served her with a UNK you see it was three weeks UNK then before she if you didn't go and foal with that service it was three weeks UNK afore you game again
but if she took the UNK at the end of that three weeks he came back in another eleven days in case er she wasn't settled you see
i see
mm
and is that when they would say that you know they had so many good UNK the year before or
well you see then er say a man owned two UNK here and he'd two UNK travelling
well er they took so much money when the end of that when they stopped travelling the horse when they was finished the season they went round all the farms and collected what they call the UNK money
which maybe be two pound for every UNK
or three pound
at the end when the UNK proved in foal you'd pay another three or maybe four pound
well they went round then the spring and collected all that from the farmers but the men that travelled the UNK went to the house first to see the UNK was in foal
for some farmers would say their UNK wasn't in foal you see
and the UNK went round to make sure she was in foal before he took the money
and they would collected maybe a hundred and fifty pound for the season for travelling round
mhm
mm
and was that their main wage was that how they got paid
well that's groom what they call the groom then he had another job he did in the winter he out in the council with the roads or any kind of job like that
mm
but he usually travelled the UNK for three month
mm
well they started in april
april may june and july you see
mhm
and some travelled the horse walking it but some UNK a pony
but in later years they got a UNK and it was far easier on the pony you see with a big heavy man riding a pony is awful UNK on the pony you see
mhm
mhm
and would
tonight as the lottery bill becomes law in britain in america there's growing concern about how lottery companies win contracts worth millions of dollars
but first flying in the face of the worst ever recession in air travel virgin atlantic is doubling its fleet and adding new routes a high risk strategy
but can richard branson land safely
i would put pretty well everything into making sure that er that virgin atlantic is here in twenty years' time
okay i'm off now
UNK flies with virgin atlantic perhaps UNK best known independent airline
tonight she's on the flight to new york although virgin atlantic flies to seven international cities and is now the biggest part of the virgin group
across the u k this is virgin twelve fifteen
virgin radio is one of the latest additions
phil UNK
the UNK computer games publishing and even UNK all trade under the virgin name
it's become one of the most famous UNK in the world
but increasingly it's the airline that UNK the man who built all this
he's one of britain's most popular businessmen richard branson
it's completely UNK i think an anybody that gets involved in the airline business will say the same
i think for me i love erm er i love a challenge and er i suspect the fact that before i went into it people said it was erm something which was erm absolutely impossible er and that the their was no way that one could make a go of it erm made it made it made it perhaps all the more challenging to try to prove them wrong
for the crew this is just another new york flight but it's been a rough ride for virgin atlantic
having won a UNK case against british airways over the much UNK dirty tricks it's set to announce losses UNK fourteen million pounds for nineteen ninety two and all airlines have been UNK their belts in the recession
anybody whose ambitious at this point in time is taking a risk in the last three years the world's airlines have lost between them about ten billion u s dollars
now at first people thought that was because of the gulf crisis an and the UNK in traffic but actually it's the economic recession which has cut off demand er and which is lasting much longer than people expected
drinks courtesy
thank you first class service at less than first class fares has become something of a UNK for virgin atlantic but that's put it on a UNK course with big international airlines especially british airways
virgin wants to make itself less vulnerable and it thinks it can do so by offering even better service to more passengers flying to more places
trouble is competition for passengers has never been so fierce and virgin is still a tiny airline that's losing money
but richard branson is so determined to win he's now betting with his own fortune to put more planes like this one in the sky it could be his biggest UNK yet
the picture looks very different from UNK early days in the record business
in nineteen seventy richard branson was making waves as a young UNK even then he had aspirations to take on the UNK
virgin records is t starting up new groups who ac you know have been UNK by some of the big companies
he took a risk with the sex UNK and landed up in court
then came the city branson UNK virgin but soon went private again
with every new UNK his UNK enthusiasm UNK the company's name
and of course his own then nearly ten years ago virgin bought its first plane
as money from boy george and culture club poured in the airline really took off
and then last year branson sold the music business to UNK e m i for five hundred and sixty million pounds so he could focus on the airline which was losing money
well obviously one would like to make money rather than lose money erm i mean there's the there are quite a few factors why erm virgin er lost money last year er first of all you know we had er the very well UNK er dirty tricks campaign being UNK against us
er we believe that cost us many millions of pounds secondly there was the worst recession that the airline industry has had thirdly has been er a you know we're a growing company we're investing
we built this model and asked professor john an airline specialist to explain UNK commercial problem
running an airline is an expensive business at the best of times during a recession it can be a way of using up money really quite quickly now UNK particular problem was that they began this recession with relatively little in the way of capital and reserves only about thirty six million in nineteen ninety one
so what would have happened last year when they lost over fourteen million pounds
well that has to come out of their capital and as you can see it takes out quite a large chunk
how bad is that
well that can be very serious
if you lose the same amount of money for a second year you're down to a position where one small slip would take the business into UNK
so what can virgin do to turn this round and start trading UNK
well what most airlines have done has been to try and trim back their scale of operations but what virgin are doing is using richard UNK personal money to try and expand out of trouble
we can reveal he plans to invest about a hundred and fifteen million of his own money without going to the bank much of it's for planes staff and facilities but we discovered he's just used forty five million to buy out UNK the UNK japanese UNK
we have erm er just bought UNK out so er the twenty percent share holding they had in the airline we've now bought back in house
so does this mean you actually want to be in control of it yourself er or not
i think for the time being i i'd i think that it makes sense to be fully in control of it i think that i you know have great faith in virgin atlantic erm i think that it erm it's got a great future erm but erm er i don't think it would be that easy to erm you know to i don't think we'd have partners falling over themselves to get into the airline business in this recession
this may look like drinks for the passengers but it's actually part of virgin UNK expansion plan
great lovely lisa if you'd just like to stop it there that was lovely
can you remember when we did the classroom training
mm
which passenger would you normally serve first
the window seat
and today what should you have done
well that's right
these trainee UNK our among nearly five hundred new recruits being taken on for flights to up to eight additional cities starting in the new year
you're all looking very smart
UNK as the new recruits graduate some of them will be flying the new non stop service between london and UNK kong which had been a UNK for british airways and UNK pacific
with UNK we're both going to UNK and back
oh which one
i quite like it
experience suggests that fares to UNK kong will fall once virgin arrives the danger is that in flying to new places virgin may reduce the money in it for everybody
virgin will not pull it off if they add too much capacity in too many routes in a very short period of time because filling capacity is becoming increasingly difficult
to fill the seats you have to drop the fares there's a price war going on especially in the markets that UNK involved in price wars mean very low fares which in many cases will not cover the cost of flying the aeroplane
what would you say to the criticism that by opening up new routes you simply add to the problem of over capacity and so there's less money for everyone
i don't think the consumer would ev say that and i think sometimes one UNK er people forget the consumer i mean the erm er but obviously by us going onto the UNK kong route we are going to reduce british airways and UNK profits on that route considerably we think that because our costs are considerably less than british airways and i suspect considerably less than UNK pacific that the player that er could be around in thirty or forty years' time is virgin atlantic
to open up new routes virgin needs more planes and it's come here to UNK in the south of france for some of them
UNK is building four a three forties like this to fly on UNK long distance routes in fact this one will soon be off to UNK kong
virgin may only be a small airline but so far this year it's UNK biggest customer that's because many bigger airlines struggling in a tough market either can't afford new planes or are cancelling their orders
virgin says that by expanding UNK and UNK the trend it's been able to get some really hard UNK
ah wonderful
richard branson has come
magnificent
to see his new planes for
the first
thank you very much
time
very first delivery
yeah were going to be using the first plane on UNK kong on february the first
it'll cost virgin an estimated five million pounds a year to lease each new plane with six on order
then the others
including two from UNK that's over thirty million
urgh
and then there are other things to pay for like new in flight UNK systems
seventeen this isn't i'm not going to
no good i'm not playing with this thing any more
virgin argues its new planes
what else do you have
are much cheaper to fly but simply having more of them will push up costs so it'll need about twice as many passengers
well we know that they plan to have fourteen planes in operation by nineteen ninety six and i reckon that will raise their cost of operations to something over six hundred million pounds
and how many passengers do they need to make that kind of money
well to make that sort of revenue they will actually need to fly rather more than two million passengers a year and in the present state of the world UNK market i reckon that's quite a tall order in fact if they fell short of it by five percent in a particular year that would be capable of using up the kind of capital and reserves which we've been talking about
well this looks fine alan how about the summary
well
the new survey for travel group o a g on what business passengers want
whilst they only fill a tenth of seats they bring in a lot more income in UNK case almost half
ian UNK virgin UNK marketing manager says business passengers do value good service but increasingly cost matters too
we discovered that the significance of value for money is creeping up the scale particularly for the corporate buyer the person in a company that's in charge of buying travel services
they are becoming increasingly more important as they want to er and try to impose policy on travellers and therefore price is becoming much more of an issue with them
this man is a corporate travel buyer the sort of customer that virgin atlantic most needs
his name charles his job director of the city bank UNK his task to decide which airline staff here can fly his annual budget for this is six million pounds
okay pilot ready for take off
with special services like this bike to airport UNK virgin hopes to UNK big wheels to send business travellers onto its flights
such UNK have helped to make UNK upper class service UNK to business passengers but virgin knows the real business is done by men like this and they're not just looking at service but also cost
hello
hello
good afternoon
good afternoon
a lot of companies actually er reviewed there policies and have down graded
we for instance use mid class on virgin as well as upper class for some er levels of staff and departments
prices are coming down because discounts are being raised and it's got very keen in the market place
so to stay in the frame is virgin going to have to get in there and
yes they are indeed there going to have to compete on price as well as on service and value added
clearly corporate buying habits matter to richard branson
morning all
everybody at his house for lunch is a corporate travel buyer he has lots of these UNK
branson wants feedback from people like these
the erm crucial questions i'd like to ask is that of cost
he UNK them virgin atlantic can and does compete on cost as well as service but he claims british airways isn't playing fair and has complained to the european commission that b a is offering anti competitive deals virgin claims it's losing business as a result
if they can go around for instance and pick off all our key accounts and use their dominant route structure to effectively take all our principle clients away er we won't have any anybody flying on our planes so er so we've got to strike quickly erm you know relatively soon after they started this new attack to make sure that it erm it er it doesn't get doesn't get out of control
sir colin british airways chairman UNK of foul play
thank you very much
what we are doing is what is being done er in the market generally there is nothing unique about british airways position in this regard in the event the european commission er should find against er our interest in this respect er they are in effect going to find against the interest er of the er european airlines as a whole and that would be very detrimental to the interest of european business and travellers
most corporate buyers we spoke to agreed that b a's doing deals much like those from other airlines indeed UNK said they'd just dropped b a having got a better deal elsewhere
i think british airways offer a fair deal erm but it's not necessarily the largest deal they invest a lot in their service and what they do and i think erm virgin do offer generous deals
right so is there anything unfair in your view about the kind of deal british airways is offering
erm in my experience erm i don't think so
this flight UNK lady is part of another row with b a which is just as important in the battle for business passengers
inside UNK pilots are landing on runway twenty seven at heathrow in the UNK they can take off and land as often as they like at this the world's UNK airport but in real life virgin says it has to fight for slots to take off and land at the times to suit business travellers it UNK b a b a says it doesn't allocate slots or UNK heathrow airport
b a er had a very clear dominance at heathrow erm it was a dominance that erm has effectively been erm given to them on a plate by the government or UNK governments over the last fifty years erm and which in effect saw off you know UNK b UNK dan air europe erm and er and er and er it's them having that dominance and then being able to erm er effectively UNK that dominance by er by using the UNK the dominance on say the routes which say virgin atlantic don't fly to er actually damage virgin on the routes that erm that we do fly
UNK determined to fight on thursday it began legal action here in the united states
UNK filed this complaint against british airways here in the federal court of new york
the central UNK in what's certain to be a UNK case is that b a has a UNK based on its dominance of heathrow which it's abusing in a bid to force virgin out of the market for UNK travel
in establishing this virgin finally hopes to win compensation for the dirty tricks affair and damages awarded here could easily run to one billion dollars
in bringing its fight to the streets of new york virgin also hope to win an UNK b a b a say there's no basis for the claim
it all hinges on b a's share of slots at heathrow which is about forty percent
the complaint is really a UNK of er a whole host of the old UNK there that we have heard several times er before and we will be dealing with the matter in the proper place through our u s council in the u s courts in terms of er suggestions that it is that it UNK the question er of UNK we certainly er do not accept that thirty eight percent of slots at heathrow in any way UNK a UNK it certainly does not
according to anti trust lawyers independent of both sides most successful anti trust cases involve market shares of over sixty five percent UNK who recently acted in another UNK anti trust case says they often last three to five years and cost millions dollars
and this case looks tough
it would seem from what you've told me that the market share is on the low side of a UNK case and that kind of case to begin with is always a complicated and long drawn out case
how sure can virgin atlantic be of winning this case do you think
i don't think they can be extremely confident if there UNK it on a forty percent market share
so with a fight on two UNK in the market place and the courts what are UNK chances of success
it's certainly a tall order to win both courts and market battles and we have to recognize that the background is one in which number two scheduled airlines in the u k have not been successful look at british UNK look at air europe look at dan air
so how do you rate their chances
well it might be that this turns out to be an extremely successful UNK and branson has expanded virgin into a world recovery or it may be that this airline runs into more serious financial difficulties in the middle of the decade and it either contracts or it sells out to either an american or a continental european carrier
UNK already ruled out bank loans so if there is serious need in future will other virgin companies fund the airline
no fortunately the other companies are stand alone companies erm making erm you know making their own way and they don't have to fear erm richard coming and UNK them of their hard earned earnings to put into the airline erm because erm you know because fortunately we've got resources elsewhere to look after the airline and see its development through
it's here in the channel islands that most of richard UNK money is held
it may seem curious given UNK talent for publicity that the full details of its financial affairs and ownership are actually UNK private
st UNK here in UNK is one of the offshore tax UNK through which richard branson and his family control most of UNK shares
many of them are held through trusts with names like UNK and mars registered here at morgan UNK
it's hard to tell how much money's in these trusts because they're not open for public scrutiny but they may indeed be the main source of funding to expand the airline
our research suggests that after the sale of the music business to UNK the trusts would have got about four hundred and fifty million pounds even after paying off debts and setting aside money for the initial expansion of virgin atlantic that would still leave about two hundred and fifty million
that sounds a lot of money but it's not difficult to spend it on an airline
neither branson nor virgin atlantic as a private company have to make such matters public
using offshore trusts like this is entirely legal it also UNK up extra money and that may be needed in future
i would have had to pay tax unless i'd set up trusts er by setting up trusts i could then effectively delay paying the tax er use that money to invest in new companies
you've told me that you're putting in about a hundred million pounds for this initial expansion is that the limit
i suspect that erm er that erm er a UNK person should say yes definitely that's the limit
erm but er i don't live my life erm er just with a profit motive in everything i do
as i said at the beginning i love a challenge and i would put pretty well everything into making sure that virgin atlantic is here in twenty years' time
but the future of this airline could be decided much sooner than that and with it the levels of service and fares we can all expect on long haul flights
in the end it may all depend on the depth of richard UNK pocket in moments of UNK even he may wonder if he sold the wrong business
with annual sales worth four billion pounds the british lottery is expected to be the biggest in the world
as lobbying becomes fierce for lottery UNK here across the atlantic how companies win contracts is under investigation
saturday night is lottery night here in the streets of dublin where UNK game of chance is UNK on the culture
grab a hold of that please and give it a good hard tug
everyone's hoping for that dream ticket and tonight there's a big win
five four three two one thirteen thousand pounds
now it's britain's turn
with the UNK of royal UNK on friday the lottery is finally on its way
millions of people undoubtedly will gain great pleasure from their weekly UNK
targeted UNK could top four billion pounds a year and provide a war chest for good causes such as sport and arts the UNK cut will be twelve percent of proceeds leaving a honey pot of six hundred million pounds of turnover a year for the operator
four UNK have already declared their intention to bid the great british lottery company UNK of UNK bank carlton communications and associated newspapers
n m UNK and UNK of australia the rank organization and UNK of g tec de la UNK and i c l UNK computers and UNK machines will be a key part of the job for any lottery operator
world wide there are only two major suppliers and the question of how those crucial contracts are awarded is now under scrutiny across the atlantic
california the UNK and largest state in america here the state lottery is big business with annual sales of more than one point seven billion dollars it helps fill the federal UNK through taxation and provides about one percent of the states education budget
hello california state lottery this is UNK can i have your UNK i d number please
federal government officials run the california lottery and equipment is supplied by g tec the company has experienced UNK growth it now runs UNK in twenty six of the thirty six u s states which operate them
today g tec UNK world wide sales of over five hundred million dollars
i'm gonna need three
shops like this sell lottery tickets all over california these machines link directly to g UNK mainframe computer
g tec has supplied the lottery with equipment since nineteen eighty six
its contract UNK earlier this month but last year an independent consultancy recommended california replace its existing system it had already purchased it UNK from g tec for sixty million dollars
sure
i hope so
sharon director of the california lottery since nineteen ninety one was appointed by the state governor
a former nurse she used to run the UNK lottery
last february acting on the report she recommended that a new four hundred million dollar contract be awarded to g tec for a replacement system there were no other UNK
the lottery business is basically a very small business with limited competition and for a state the size of california it makes it very difficult to have large competition because only a certain number of companies can actually put in a system of this size
the decision created UNK throughout california joanne is a computer expert she was head of the technical division at the california state lottery until her firing earlier this year after a period of sick leave
she has argued for more competition in state lottery UNK
why did only one company bid for the contract in california
i think there was a perception from other vendors that the bid itself had specifications that could only be met by g tec
that it was UNK biased towards the UNK vendor and therefore chose not to participate it is very costly for companies to put together proposals to bid for an online game
these concerns were reflected in UNK like this gordon head of the state lottery finance department was part of the team charged with evaluating g UNK bid he warned on november the third last year
if we are accused of UNK a massive bid proposal to UNK favour g tec and if g tec end up being the only bidder we should expect to encounter major public relations and or legal problems and we could end up paying far more than we had anticipated for the needed goods and services
three weeks later in another memo he wrote
i continue to have UNK concerns that four months is simply not enough time for any vendor other than g tec to implement a UNK online UNK system
it was UNK like these that concerned politicians like state UNK tom better known as jane UNK ex husband he teaches at a religious college in UNK
he UNK but he is also concerned about the way in which the contract was awarded
the largest er state contract in the history of the state of california something like four hundred million dollars was let to g tec and competition er i believe was UNK
why
we don't know and that happened not once but several times leading to er a good ne honest professional members of the lottery commission er to warn in internal UNK er that this was going to raise legal and public relations problems
