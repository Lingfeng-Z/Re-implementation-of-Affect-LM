sharon UNK the decision she argues that few companies have the resources to undertake the UNK capital investment needed
for instance to er to put in this lottery and put in the new system that we just converted recently a couple of days ago UNK takes tens and tens of millions of millions of dollars and most companies who come in and work on a percentage of sales don't get their capital investment back until several years into the contract
the contract was UNK by the UNK office last march as a result pete wilson UNK the go ahead of the g tec deal but said that the state UNK bidding process needed UNK
processing scratch cards like this needs a central computer system last year a hundred and fifty million dollar contract to do the job was awarded to a smaller rival high integrity systems in april mrs cancelled that contract after the company says sixty five million dollars had been spent on the project
UNK is currently UNK the california lottery
no luck
but a third much smaller contract twenty three million dollar contract for scratch card machines brought things to a head at two public UNK
sharon recommended the contract should be awarded to g tec without any competitive bid there was a public UNK ten days ago she was forced to change her recommendation to the state lottery commission and opt for a tender
there was a lot of controversy involved a lot of name calling if you will erm a lot of UNK none have merit i'll put that right up front none have merit i would recommend that you go out to bid to satisfy those concerns
that was after joe UNK lawyer had claimed at a previous hearing that yet another g tec rival scientific games had been told not to bother bidding by lottery officials
it is our understanding that were it not for the contact that was made by the state lottery with scientific games that they would be a bidder the scientific games system is a good system
g tec say the allegations are UNK and the companies representative robert was UNK at the loss of the contract
we are beginning to wonder what it what it takes to engage in good faith negotiations as a business with the state of california if all it takes is one person to get up make some kind of UNK allegations and throw the entire bidding in into cast some kind of doubt upon it
but it's not just UNK procedures that are under scrutiny in california
here at the UNK federal court the trial of a UNK clay is now under way
has been UNK on twelve counts of UNK and offering UNK to elected officials to advance the interests of his clients one of whom was g tec
state UNK was a regular UNK of 's UNK
i'm not going i'm not prepared to in any manner er discuss er the case of the proceedings
UNK is now serving a jail sentence for UNK and tax fraud
in an UNK at his trial he said
as part of my agreement with i received campaign contributions totalling thirteen and a half thousand dollars from g tec in october ninety eighty six
the campaign contributions were in return for my agreement to and actually taking official action at 's request
this is where UNK sold his vote to big business
when a g tec rival scientific games sponsored a lottery bill detrimental to g UNK commercial interests agreed to vote it down
in a new development on thursday the court heard a conversation between clay and UNK taped in november nineteen ninety one as part of his cooperation with federal UNK during that conversation the UNK clay UNK to his one time UNK that sharon newly appointed by governor pete wilson was our girl
pete wilson put a new UNK in who's our UNK yeah the woman from UNK she ran the UNK state lottery
sharon was UNK for comment this weekend but her UNK joanne described the recording as a bunch of UNK
in london this weekend robert described the UNK from the clay trial as media UNK mr who is still on the payroll he said has not UNK for g tec for more than a year
i think the bottom line of this issue frankly is that the u s er UNK the UNK er investigating authorities in this matter have had this information at their disposal for several years now had there been any question of g UNK behaviour er we would certainly be the subject of something that we are not right now and that the bottom line is we have been assured from the outset that g tec has not been a subject of this investigation that g UNK behaviour has been above UNK and as far as his comments go we don't really know what context to put them in
they certainly weren't speaking on behalf of the company and appear to be frankly UNK
what is the relationship between er your company and mrs sharp
our relationship between any lottery director and g tec as a company has always been professional and above UNK and as far as our relationship with the current director in california we've had instances were we've been successful in california in gaining business while she was a director and we've been unsuccessful
but doubts about g tec have spread beyond california in UNK the company also operates the state lottery here too the UNK of contracts is being UNK a forty nine million dollar contract to provide a popular UNK game called UNK is being investigated by a grand jury
UNK is a local UNK politician
he UNK and was UNK in UNK the current federal investigation
in california there was no competition in UNK there was no competition every place that g tec operates they go in they hire the highest price talent they hire the most politically connected talent and they end up getting the contract
now what we have to know is whether or not they are in fact getting these contracts because they are the best and the cheapest or whether they are getting it because they have the best connections and they are paying the most money
what do you personally believe
i believe it's because they have the best connections and they're paying the most money
i can't comment on comments that you are UNK however i will say that in UNK er we UNK an UNK vendor who had been there a long time er that vendor was a bit upset as you might imagine with being UNK as a vendor and in UNK we had a situation that kind of evolved into the same kind of political row you would expect when a company loses a long time business
what are people in britain to make of this as you come here to present yourselves as a future er lottery operator
what people have to keep in mind and what people really should be very concerned about here in great britain is the fact that this is a very contentious industry that there are a number of competitors out there who have taken to UNK around as if it were mud
er frankly these investigations at any level are very thorough we depend upon the very thorough investigations in UNK of all the government UNK in which we operate
the government announced on friday the appointment of peter as the national UNK director general he's to ensure the UNK of the national lottery
our UNK er UNK is that we have a lottery which is run with UNK and without UNK and the director general has very widespread powers fact to investigate the UNK of any UNK
a UNK for the UNK is the battle cry but much will ride on how the UNK industry is regulated
in the past decade UNK has experienced one of the biggest gold UNK it's ever seen
fortune UNK up to a million of them have UNK terrible damage upon the environment on public health and law and order
now another threat demonstrates just how frightening is the real price of gold
what is gold
an empty UNK
UNK shining trouble
this is UNK a UNK town that serves numerous gold workings or UNK the UNK gold UNK that flock here are called garrimperos when they visit town garrimperos come to sell their gold in the numerous gold UNK shops that line the single street
with the proceeds of the gold they buy provisions heading UNK numerous UNK for drugs to combat diseases UNK that UNK them all
and they come to buy mining equipment pumps and pies and engines to extract gold bearing UNK form the rivers and UNK
also on the shopping list are sex UNK and UNK
so bars and UNK are UNK
even those that live in UNK find little to commend the place
UNK is a UNK violent and UNK place on the banks of a UNK river
it has no hospital no doctor and save for the police no government presence of any kind
it's a place you'd be happy to leave unless you're a UNK who must head back to work
some of the human UNK from the UNK up at the hospital at UNK hundreds line up daily for UNK tests
children are often born with the disease
it's no coincidence that UNK took hold as the gold rush UNK
conditions in the UNK made it inevitable
here blood tests will confirm the type of the infection and determine the treatment
dr is the local UNK specialist
on his hospital rounds he UNK treats garrimperos in the terminal stages of the disease
this patient has been UNK more than twenty times
nearby is a man who paid the price of gold with a bullet in the back a victim of UNK gun law
as well as victims of violence many suffer from UNK diseases
it's hard to believe but this river the UNK is part of the same UNK river system where garrimperos have caused such UNK
UNK by name the river is still UNK by nature
why
it's protected by nature reserves on both banks
this is UNK as it used to be before the coming of the UNK and the UNK after gold
UNK are UNK
even the UNK river is UNK and by something far more dangerous than mud
the fish that swim here carry in their flesh a poison that can make you very ill
and if consume enough of it will kill you
that poison is mercury
messenger of the gods UNK stuff that UNK the child in all of us
and yet with the exception of lead this UNK more people every year than any other heavy metal
and it's now found in UNK high quantities not only in the fish but in the air and the soil and the water throughout the UNK river system
and where does it come from
from the UNK just a few miles down stream the UNK waters of the UNK flow into the UNK river and UNK stained by it's burden of UNK
once this UNK was UNK too
but with the coming of the UNK it's grown UNK and more toxic contaminated by things visible and invisible
oil and UNK as well as mud and mercury
and it's the same story in many other rivers throughout the UNK
a vast area that drains one third of south america and covers half the land surface of brazil
up to twenty five percent of all water that drains off the earth is carried by the UNK
and now sadly much of that global resource is contaminated by mercury
worse affected by the gold rush than most rivers is the UNK and it's UNK
more gold has been produce here in this present gold rush than in any other part of brazil
it's UNK like this that are doing the damage
UNK the river with mud and mercury
this is one among thousands of similar UNK or UNK that employ UNK
working on the river bed with a hose attached to a powerful pump the UNK up gold bearing UNK
this is pumped onto the UNK to be processed
the UNK passes down a UNK where UNK of gold because they're heavier are retained behind wooden UNK and up on the carpet that lines the UNK
when the time comes to recover the gold the UNK are removed and the carpet is UNK
it's at this stage that mercury comes into the picture
it's unique property is to bind with gold however small the UNK to form an UNK that's easy to collect
mercury will be mixed with the UNK to separate the gold
inevitably some of it UNK into the river
as a trip down this UNK shows this is a huge industry
it UNK at least a quarter of a million people in operations large and small
few will ever get rich but between them they've produced in recent years nearly five hundred tonnes of gold in the UNK region alone
and for every tonne of gold at least twice as much mercury has thought to have been lost into the environment
everyone uses mercury and some use it in much larger quantities than others
mercury that is not amalgamated with gold slides easily from them pan while mercury mixed with gold leaves more UNK
after excess mercury has been run off the residue is UNK through a fine cloth
this UNK any further free mercury
what's left is the gold that the days work has UNK with an equal mass of mercury
finally the mercury is burned off using a butane UNK
this job could be done simply and safely using a UNK to UNK the mercury
but that never happens
as the temperature rises the mercury is driven off as a toxic white gas
has UNK dangerous amounts of it
tests show he's carrying ten times the acceptable level of mercury
but then he's been burning gold every few days for ten years
in gold shops they also burn off mercury on a huge scale
the law says dealers should recover ninety six percent UNK away to be UNK by all and UNK
no one seems to worry
they've come to sell gold and it's the money they're after
money that will be used in part to buy more mercury that's supposed to be a controlled substance
according to UNK law the responsibility for controlling the sale and the use of mercury lies with the national institute for the environment UNK and in theory these controls are very strict all UNK and dealers are supposed to be registered and the use of mercury in any process and in whatever quantity how ever small requires an official permit
what's more the law specifically UNK the use of mercury in UNK unless they're UNK
here in UNK you can buy as much mercury as you like and no questions are asked
i've just bought this little UNK i have no permit and nobody asked for one
it says here the UNK for dental purposes but i don't think there's much doubt what it's actually for
this was once a gold shop
mercury UNK form gold burning below UNK into the flat above and this is what happened to it's UNK
the mercury caused UNK damage
by the time the cause was discovered and his condition was diagnosed it was too late
the received no compensation and all the expensive medical treatment they've had to pay for themselves
is your father now completely dependent on you to nurse him and look after him
this woman works at a UNK and has also been exposed to mercury UNK
she's worried that she may be in the early stages of mercury poisoning
she's brought her worries to dr who's seeing more and more patients with similar symptoms
the destruction of UNK forest is all too familiar a story
but it's connection with the gold rush should not be UNK
it's the search for gold that opens up virgin land with roads and UNK and then other UNK follow
this is the result and it seems there's another connection
here around alto UNK in recent years hundreds of thousands of acres of virgin forest have been burned and continue to be burned to provide UNK for cattle
on some days the smoke is so thick here that it UNK the sun
to find out what effect all this burning may be having on the upper atmosphere particularly upon global UNK the UNK space institute in UNK with UNK from the united states has been carrying out a research programme
one possibility that's emerged from that research is that mercury UNK from gold burning may be combining with the ash and the other products of UNK the forest to produce an even more toxic UNK in a lethal brew
on a satellite photograph of an area near alto UNK and gold mining show up as pink UNK on the green of the forest
the large clearing is one hundred and fifty square miles
sandra is one of a team of scientists trying to find out how mercury levels in the air are influenced by weather and other factors
the team will investigate the human consequences of the mercury pollution
this work is of special importance for pregnant women who risk UNK damage from mercury
results so far signal danger ahead
here mercury levels are one thousand times greater than one would expect in such a remote area
although the UNK of mercury UNK and dust is an obvious hazard there is another danger that's potentially more long lasting and UNK
much of the mercury that UNK in to the soil and the air and in to the water finishes up here in the rivers and there it UNK with naturally occurring compounds to form a compound called UNK mercury which is far more dangerous to man than is mercury itself
this UNK mercury is absorbed by small organisms in the water which are eaten by fish which are eaten by larger fish and all the time the poison is being concentrated as it moves up the food chain
in some of the larger and older UNK fish concentrations of UNK mercury can be very high need and of course these are precisely the fish that are most sort after by the UNK and by their customers
now if this contaminated fish is eaten in large enough quantities it can cause symptoms of UNK disease
the disease is named after a terrible industrial accident that occurred at this chemical factory at UNK in southern japan
UNK mercury was accidentally discharged into the sea and as a result the nearby fishing communities suffered terrible consequences
this child's name is UNK
UNK means wisdom
her mother showed no signs of mercury poisoning at all
yet this is how UNK was born
the result of eating contaminated fish
many children were born with UNK disease but more than one hundred adults died while thousands were severely disabled
although the situation in UNK is different there are worrying similarities
here too fish and UNK are eaten in large quantities
here too fish in certain areas are found to contain high concentrations of mercury
in UNK mercury poisoning was diagnosed first in cats
here mercury levels in pigs near UNK are UNK high
despite all these danger signals evidence of mercury UNK of people is very limited
work has been done on UNK of fish and water and air but little has been done to study it's effect on the human population
in the UNK research is UNK by the sheer size of the region and by the UNK of scientists to work here
but one individual researcher has not been UNK
from his base in UNK dr UNK travels to a number of UNK communities
today it's the turn of UNK a large village on the banks of the UNK river
dr is a UNK who in the course of his work UNK cases of mercury poisoning
some came from fishing villages so he began a clinical study concentrating on UNK and their families
these tests are designed to detect early signs of UNK damage
the UNK has high levels of mercury because he catches and eats large fish that lie in UNK and UNK where UNK mercury UNK but so far he has no UNK symptoms
in this UNK and UNK spot they've heard the UNK of dr about mercury but still feel UNK to combat such a UNK threat
if it seemed UNK not to eat the fish would that be a big problem for the
dr comes bearing small gifts for the children
in return for his UNK he will ask the children for a lock of hair
UNK mercury shows up in hair and by taking samples at regular intervals he can keep track of it's level and how they relate to clinical symptoms when and if they appear
hair samples collected by dr are sent to the institute of UNK at the federal university at UNK de UNK
here they are freeze dried treated with chemicals and then analyzed
the hair frequently shows UNK mercury UNK well above safe limits
these findings were confirmed by a joint british UNK scientific team
they ran blood tests on UNK and came up with equally UNK results
bad news for the eight hundred thousand people living in the UNK river region
in some areas we have measured a UNK which is much bigger than in the UNK incident in the japan
er the only reason for the fact that we didn't have a tragedy is that the population in the in those areas is very UNK
but it's true we recognize the problem and we are serious trying to avoid it
this protest song suggests that some at least are aware of the mercury UNK and the plight of the rivers and are calling for action
the price of gold
this piece of street theatre is performed in UNK by members of the UNK defence group warning of the dangers of mercury poison through eating contaminated fish
the aim of the drama is to do what government is failing to do
tell the people of the UNK the truth about gold
that it's UNK their river and that mercury could UNK their lives
the play is a UNK light UNK account of a UNK who eats contaminated fish and dies
at UNK federal university scientists says that even if the use of mercury ceased the danger remain
it would persist for many generations
we've done research in other places and there's mercury from a hundred a hundred and fifty years back
but st it sticks around
so to call this a chemical time bomb is not unduly UNK
no it's not
it's a time bomb that's been ticking for centuries and the fuse has always been gold
this is UNK which means black gold
built three hundred years ago on the profits of the first gold rush
but those who dug the gold never lived in these fine houses for they were african UNK
they payed for all this with their sweat and their lives just like the garrimperos today
the UNK came to brazil to win UNK for christ and to win gold for the king
in both they succeeded but at a terrible human cost
the UNK of those who now process with UNK bands once UNK in rows UNK the UNK under the eye of armed guards
much of the gold dug by the UNK went back to UNK
enough remained to build magnificent UNK churches
in this one church hundreds of kilos of gold were used to UNK god
but perhaps more UNK it might UNK the UNK that died to win it form the earth
this church UNK was where the african UNK came to worship to pray to the saint to protect them from the dreadful accidents they faced in the mines
as with the garrimperos today so great were the physical dangers of UNK gold that the risk posed by mercury poisoning must have seemed UNK
oh yes
they used mercury in those days too
and evidence is coming to light that present generations may still be suffering the consequences
in the old gold mining regions of UNK and UNK scientists are finding an UNK high incidence of mental UNK and other UNK conditions and the finger of suspicion is pointed at UNK mercury that's UNK in the soil and in the ground water
if it can happen in the old gold mining regions it can happen in the UNK too
it's another piece of evidence suggesting a long term UNK towards a serious mercury crisis
for a mercury crisis is not an immediate or indeed a long term worry
in UNK he's what is called in the UNK world a UNK the owner of the gold digging area and it's machinery
but here on the UNK river is more than a UNK he's a king or at least he acts like one
not just king but an absolute UNK
mr started in a small way but now two hundred and fifty garrimperos work under him
in the local government he's the secretary responsible for mining and for the environment
as surveys his operations is it with the eye of the secretary for mining
or the secretary for the environment
one wonders
he also uses mercury in large quantities and as secretary for the environment one might have expected him to seek less damaging alternatives
we haven't been trying hard to persuade the garrimperos to adopt different technologies more modern technologies that would avoid the UNK of the mercury but as i said i believe the only way of reaching this goal is if we can organize the garrimperos to have er a kind of er UNK way of UNK gold not the sort of gold rush i that is being on and on and off in brazil for two centuries right now
this cheap and simple piece of technology could UNK the mercury UNK problem
this is the part of the UNK we have water in here
the mercury gold UNK is burned in a closed UNK rather than in the open air
how efficient is this UNK
ah well it'll recover about ninety five percent of the mercury
ah th the problems that the mercury causes are not erm easily seen immediately seen
so you have to show them that is very important not because of the mercury recovery but because of their health
yeah
the UNK is not only safer it saves money
UNK the mercury for UNK
why is something so obviously superior not being used
we have to work with the garrimperos we have to try and convince 'em
as er as you can imagine it's a very difficult task nobody wants to go up in the region it has UNK it's dangerous it's it transportation is difficult
but we have to manage to find out how these people think how we can convince them even to protect themselves one of the things we'd like to show is look using this mercury you're killing yourself
but this takes a long time and a lot of convincing
could local secretary for the environment be convinced if the right equipment was readily available would he encourage it's use throughout his kingdom
because if he wanted it done it would be done
the trouble is the culture of the UNK is a macho culture of UNK and drinking and UNK and UNK work where mercury is the very least of his concerns
he's more likely to die in a bar UNK
and why should the UNK the advice of the authorities when the authorities ignore him
it is at the bottom a social problem
it is the failure of UNK society to provide those people with jobs with a decent living which er has led the garrimperos to this activity
and the problem is although they are er very negative for the environment they destroy rivers they effect the navigation they are quite popular with the population with the peasants with the indians because they bring money they bring activities they bring weapons they bring all sorts of things that break the isolation of those populations that live along the rivers or er in the middle of the forest
nothing has broken the isolation more than the light aircraft
it's these little planes that make this gold rush possible
and it's the people who own them and fly them and those who supply the UNK with food and fuel and UNK who make the real money
they've grown fat on gold not the garrimperos they're a strong political lobby and would never allow business to close down over the little matter of mercury
but they can't ignore them all the time
elsewhere in UNK a thousand miles from the UNK federal police recently responded to the murder by garrimperos of seventeen UNK indians
in a fierce UNK they destroyed gold UNK operating within forest reserves
but the suspicion is that this was little more than a public relations exercise
garrimperos put out of business here are likely to UNK elsewhere in the UNK of UNK
indeed in the UNK there has been a sudden increase in the number of big UNK
although the number of garrimperos has declined the scale of their operation has increased
and as the large machines move in the destruction grows
so does the consumption of mercury
and those that operate the UNK are quite UNK
he and his kind are unlikely to be UNK by UNK
more UNK are under construction and this activity will continue and UNK
it's one of number of worrying developments
garrimperos are now beginning to sink UNK to mine primary gold
these youngsters work seventy metres below ground in appalling conditions
one of their team was killed by UNK the week before our visit
deep mining also produces environmental damage
developments like this mean that even if UNK gold gives out or becomes less profitable the UNK search for wealth will continue and UNK
and although the technology is different it still involves the use of mercury
large amounts of mercury are mixed with the UNK gold bearing rock and are UNK in a concrete mixture
yet another source of pollution adding to the risk
one UNK that's being proposed calls for drastic action now
a distinguished UNK er suggested to me the only way to deal with this UNK problem is to close them down
now is that a politically possible solution do you think
no it's not realistic because you know that there are thousands of people involved with the in the UNK and er there is no way you could er shut them down without offering them an alternative
in a country like ours where half of the territory er is still in the UNK situation er there is an enormous difficulty in UNK some laws
it's not the same situation as you are used to in europe
while the politicians seem UNK and UNK communities continue to live under the shadow of the mercury threat
some would like to forget it but it won't go away
in the final stages of the journey from river mud to UNK metal gold is treated to remove the last stages of UNK mercury then it becomes pure but not innocent
in brazil gold is guilty of crimes against the environment and against UNK
and the criminal record goes back for centuries
whether the new charge of UNK to poison the people will be proved is still unclear but the evidence cannot be ignored and unless UNK steps are taken it could be too late
started with this device this is the thing i made it at the grammar school when i was working there
it's like a wooden box with a glass lid and inside looks like UNK is that right UNK wheels
yeah that's right
switches inside
there's a motor been on here it was on to ring the school bells
that's like a sort of UNK driven timer
yes that's what it is and in the grammar school they had biology wanted to have plants growing in the dark but provide a light for them
one plant had to get light for eight hours per day and the other one had to get light for sixteen hours a day so another wheel at this end did this job when this went around so many times
aha
ah so that controlled the lights to your plants then
yes
i see you've made several versions of
yes that's right
this one had a whole lot of switches on so it can be altered from outside without going inside
that was what looks like a satellite dish what on earth is this
it's a very
yeah it looks like a satellite dish it's only a yard in diameter
the focus of this is about fourteen inches from the centre and if you put a microphone here when this thing is outside it's ideal for picking up bird song
you can pick up birds from a mile away
we'll have to have to get a few of these in radio orkney i can see
yes it's quite good for long distance
it's ideal for birds with the high frequency voice but for people they the speech is a bit lower in frequency and doesn't work quite so well
so you can't use it for UNK dropping
no
did you make this thing
i had a satellite mirror found in a quarry and took i used this it was a mould for this to get it a perfect UNK shape
and it's made of UNK glass is it
UNK glass
yes i see
and er underneath it here we have a glass box i see
there's a mirror inside there
UNK glass screen on it
yes
so when i take this out and UNK this through the window it UNK straight up and you can look at the clouds and you can tell which direction the wind is
ah i see
ah right so the direction the clouds are moving in against this UNK glass screen
yes
you can use as a
just see them go you can't see it today when there's just one cloud
ah yes it's continuous
a continuous cloud
and you can tell by the speed they're travelling what sp speed the wind is
aha
i see so that measures the speed of them across the screen this way you can time it
yes i had a seconds timer there as you can see
so the UNK you've got set up here you can use as a timer against
yes
that
it's a simple timer
yeah
well simple minds can simple things
i never had any education since i was fourteen so i used the very simplest things when i find the very simple things can do very complicated jobs
yes
so on the bench here we have a device on a UNK again it has wheels on it where marked off in what looks like degrees
am i right
that's degrees yes
aha
two wheels one on top the other and a what looks like an UNK to look to look through
what what's that for sandy
yes well it's at an odd angle you noticed th that because we are in UNK fifty nine so the centre of this has to look at the pole star
it's an UNK device then yes i see
and er this th has to be thirty one degrees to the level so that er you follow the stars as they travel around the sky because they're always highest in the south and like the sun and the moon they're always highest when they're due south
so this is the same idea and if there's a star something that i did see a wee while ago i saw a f a light very close down to the horizon and i said i've never seen a star so bright way down there
so i looked through this device and er found what the reading it gave so i went to my map and i found that that's where mars should have been
so i UNK assumed that this was mars
when i got my telescope to look through it was gone
so it was on look for it later so i UNK it up and it was mars
so you can use to identify stars
stars
just from their position in the sky
and er the sun doesn't always travel at the same speed it goes fast and slow so we can also measure the sun
i see so you take that top wheel off and you have another one underneath where alternative reading
and that's and that's in hours
of course yes i see
and er the sun can be as much as nearly twenty minutes slow or fast
so you can adjust for the differences there
the sun is only at th the correct time four times in one year
the earth doesn't take a circular path around the sun so it passes it quickly sometimes and slowly at other times
it makes the sun appear to vary in its time keeping
so you've UNK built this machine to incorporate that error so you can compensate for that
oh i see
i UNK look through the sun at it but i see the sh the shadow of the one on the other
ah yes
UNK it's painted white so it gives a sh shadow
and it also tells me how high it is in the sky
so it's a bit like a UNK almost in a way
oh well aye i suppose
it's an interesting machine
this is the same idea over here
oh yes
and the camera goes on there and a wee electric motor over UNK which drives it around at fifteen degrees per hour which makes it follow the stars as they move around the sky
oh so it's so it's for UNK the star and
yes
well it's a time exposure
if you take a time exposure of the stars with a static camera you just get UNK because of the UNK movement and i should make the device follow the stars at the correct speed you can get an awful lot of stars that's completely invisible to the naked eye
it picks up the very UNK stars
so this allows you to follow them along while the UNK open
yes that's right
you can take an hour's exposure with this one
i've never done any more than fifteen minutes
have you got any photographs that you've taken by this means
yes i have indeed
i took my early ones in black and white but the later ones i took in colour and er i saw to one side of UNK what looked like the plough
you can see the stars there are quite bright
i've looked with UNK and i can't see them with the naked eye
these are so faint and they only show up because of the long time exposure
i see so a way of seeing stars that you otherwise would not be able to see at all
you can't see
here's the belt of UNK and the UNK
you can see the centre one is red
tremendous
is this just an ordinary camera you've used
just an ordinary camera
thirty five millimetres
yes thirty five UNK
ha UNK you wouldn't have believed that was possible
and this is the picture of the moon
how big the moon appeared with this
it fills the frame yes
but er the only problem here is we're too low down and there's too much sh UNK in the atmosphere difficult to get anything really clear
i see presumably this is why all the big UNK are near the UNK is that right
yes well they get on top of mountains if possible to get rid of the UNK
the moving hot and cold air
now i'd i notice there's a an enormous telescope behind us here as well
what size of telescope is this
er it's er it's a ex w d lens after wartime they sold these things they sold them in UNK and i sent of for this one and it's about a stone and a half in weight
and er
that's a size
the glass is six inches in diameter and is a thirty six inch focus
i have another UNK on the end which is suitable for looking at the stars and planets
it's also a piece of ex w d equipment and gives a right UNK viewing and turns the picture right side up
most UNK view everything upside down and er i drew two hundred lines to the inch inside this UNK
the lines are so close together that two of them can be seen crossing the planet UNK at any one time
the lines are about eight point eight inches apart at a distance of one mile
i notice we have a chart on the back of the door here as well a circle measured off in angles and er this is lovely it's got UNK
yes
well
earth mars and then it's measured off in
UNK is as far as we can see
this is already UNK now to find the planets and stars when you're using the telescope yeah
yes well they would
well brings us very UNK to your first choice of piece of music sandy too is this
yes
part of the planets suite by UNK
yes
UNK god then sandy
oh well it must be my before i was a UNK
and i very young days
living on the farm we were quite isolated we had no street lights outside there were no lights very many lights anywhere at that time
and we had very clear UNK and showed up the s the stars quite brilliantly
i found a lens in an old box and i used i got another two UNK and i fitted them together in an a tube i had no UNK but there was an old bicycle at the house and i cut up the frame and put one lens at the one end of the frame and the seat UNK i used the seat UNK for focusing
and my pictures were upside down but i could see the rings of UNK with it which was more than what UNK saw first when he looked he thought there was two stars at either side of UNK
if he'd had a bike he would have er done better then
we found then that the bigger the objective lens was the more light could be got and the bigger you could make it so as i got bigger and got er the chance of making my own UNK and building up UNK of various kinds i found that i could get quite a good UNK
how do you actually make a lens
i got a UNK from the UNK when it was being sent off for being UNK
and it was about ten inches in diameter
and of course i had to get another lens a piece of glass about the same size in order to grind it because you grind the glass with another piece of glass with a UNK in between
UNK and water
UNK powder and water
and you rub backwards and forwards backwards and forwards and i ground like this for several hours every night after i came home for three months
that's a long project
and that took the centre of the glass down by maybe a one and a half millimetres
that was all of the glass that was worn away in that time
but er it did not do bad got a fair good picture with it
now we've got some interesting photos here now in this album of people standing beside themselves i would say
ah twins yes
how did you how did you achieve this
well er i had a lot of friends here and there and when i've had a lot of photos to develop for them and then when i got everything done you felt a UNK of relief at getting it all done
so you tried then to do something to use up the rest of the developer
and there's one here with a group of people and i found that a stone wall makes an ideal thing to trick photography with
because you can join it anywhere and it doesn't look messy
ah yes
i er see the way the two parts of the photograph are joined on the
i
the stone wall
i turned out the f the negative upside down to do the other half which makes 'em look keeps the group equally s h
yeah it looks like a large family group
four sets of twins
and over the page here we've got some more
the UNK jungle this UNK called
yes
this was a real life picture with great big trees and a real forest and it was done by it was a footpath through UNK and the
i see
UNK are only about two feet high
or rather less but the jungle track through the centre helps to show you it's a UNK though it's only about a f a foot wide
so the camera was right down on the bottom
now there are a few branches there there's one that's lying kind of horizontal it'll be an idea to set someone on top of that
so we have this in the next picture and it was another one vertical we got one to g grab a hold of it
mm
lean on it
yes er it looks either like tiny folk or enormous UNK
yes
this is done in two UNK presumably
yes
that was done a different way from the other pictures
you actually take the UNK photographs first cut them out and plant them on the original
UNK it
this got me into some problems too with a chap in UNK who was very fond of black UNK cattle
knew a fellow somewhere in UNK that wouldn't be seen dead holding a black UNK cattle so er he er came along to me with er farmer's weekly and a black UNK cow on it and gave me a photograph of this man
so he wanted it me to make this man hold this cow
anyway i had to photograph the man i photographed the cow and i had to photograph a background
and i had to merge all these pictures together
it looks very convincing i must say it just looks like a farmer
the
holding the b the UNK or
feet of the cow was not in the original photograph so i had to go up to a farm and ask for straw to hide the
the UNK feet
you went away with a photograph to show us
yes and i never heard of this and there's another lady that brought me a picture with four generations in
but a fifth person appeared in the reflection of a window can i remove them
so i had a shot at this but if i cut it out that part of the window was black it didn't look right so i put a shade over it
now it was a fairly white it still
aha
didn't look right
so oh i say i'll cut it out and make a wee hole and transport part of the wood work across the window
the window was completely UNK up it took me a while to do that
the next thing i got was an order for twenty of them
i
whole thing twenty times over
well what's your second choice of music then sandy
well er
this is a photograph of you as a young fellow walking the high wire
yes that's right
oh w where did you get this high wire to walk across
well this one here is a water pipe it's er what
an inch and quarter or something in diameter
i found it in hoy and there's some deep UNK there
there's UNK where er s the water has run away all the UNK clay and left maybe a ditch this one was nine feet deep
and i put balanced it out across this and i set my camera down er down below on a time exposure which runs off in about one minute so i had one minute to run up the side of the thing and get out here and balance myself
i had another l pipe piece of water pipe which i used as a balancing device but i found with the UNK pipe you are so stable you feel it's a shame to be seen holding on
i say you don't look very stable
to me up there i must admit sandy
aha
so you took the photograph yourself as well
more or less aye
there's er this other one here with a i carried a fish box out onto the wire and set it down and sat on it
i had no balancing pole then
i can see that
that looks like a bit of a balancing UNK right enough
what led you to try this
i don't know
it's just something i just felt like doing and i couldn't have any real reason for doing it
well i don't think there's any better reason than that
on this page we have the UNK barrier
this is er early stage of construction
barriers were getting closed up and above water we were permitted to walk across
so i was still in UNK then and working at the grammar school so we had to walk across all three UNK for some time
there was at th near the end or the middle number two causeway and i was crossing there one day and the tide was out and er the big ship that was along the causeway was very close to the s to the stones
and i saw a hole in the bottom at the side of it where they had UNK a hole in it in order to sink it
so i says i'll pop down and go inside to see what like it is
i had my camera with me and i saw there was a ladder up on the top deck and when i got up on the top deck it was quite a UNK height not to be bit i looked at the mast then i UNK up the mast up three quarters of the way up the mast and er the view from up there looked right down on the causeway
oh i see
i thought that was an aerial photograph some height up there
we UNK go to daft places to get photos
at times it was UNK top UNK for about fifteen years
it's in books a few books have it in it
well sandy we've only looked at a few of the things in your shed and a very few of your photographs but it's been fascinating
thank you very much for your time
what's your third choice of piece of music then sandy
well i'm not awfully good at music but my wife is very keen on music
what about the UNK barriers
very appropriate i think very appropriate
yes i think that might be my
when my mother was young she was down there
and she gave the school no she gave them did that much that they brought for here school books and she finished her education in
and if i mind right i think it was some kind of relational that used to e in the bank that was a teacher there
and then she they lived in UNK she was born in UNK
what size of a school would there have been in
oh it would have been half as small and she used to tell us grand stories with them setting off in the morning with their a bottle of milk and their it's like a pi with them to keep the fire going to keep them warm and everything
oh what grand stories she did tell
and what was it like as a small UNK then
well she thoroughly enjoyed the life in fact right up oh till nearly the end she spoke about UNK and as long as she was able she used to go and she imagined she could see it better with the UNK glasses
she loved UNK she loved the country she loved the people
and they were half a good smile and they did not tell who's ninety two
mhm
and what was it like for a UNK on UNK
oh i think that the well more or less kind of like what it'll be when we were young
they made their own UNK and she learnt to knit and they had long winter nights round the fire o and they used to go she used to call it we used to go after day set that she called evening
and they'd visit one another and take their knitting with them and sit and UNK and that was all the enjoyment
i don't never heard her speaking very much about games
but oh she was perfectly happy there
how many were at the school
i don't ken
it wouldn't have be so a great number
how big is UNK
oh god i don't ken
i have no idea
it's not that big
would there have been maybe about how many houses
maybe about a dozen houses i don't ken
i have visited the house that my mother stayed at er called the north house aye it was just a pretty bit of a but and beam
what did the folk do
well they UNK in small way i suppose and went the fishing
and they had what they called a floating shop you know just a bit of a s a boat that came oh i think it was once a week and they used to go and get supplies off of it
aha
oh no she loved the life in UNK
mhm
and you've always lived in stromness
all my days and hope i finish it here
all me days
can't understand what families want to go away at all
what was stromness like when you small
oh it was super
it was quiet but there was different things that UNK us that the UNK would just laugh at today i mean there was no pictures or things like that
that we'd go to the shore and we'd spend a whole day there no UNK and biscuits then
a bottle of water or a pale of water and maybe biscuits i don't ken and we had different games and there was a game
like those certain games that you played at certain seasons of the year
like maybe now about this time of the year we would start with skipping and then in the winter time we well there was has a lot of we would just seem to UNK ourselves
we peedie concerts and things like that
and oh me mother was good
she would read and everything else and there was nine of us children had that much time but we had a very happy childhood in lots of ways
they did not have electricity it would be oil lamps and some of them i cannot mind when gas would come
but it would be old lamps and peedie bits of and when you speak about long ago times i associate the smell of UNK and UNK and cooking apples and all that you go into peedie shops and there was a fine relationship you go in and well i used to be for the old folk and they were all awful good to me and the particular and we used to go every saturday night to a shop called UNK and it stayed open till nine o'clock
but there was oh what to me seemed in that days to be oh awful grand shops for baking and what not
folk would not look at it nowadays
been a kind of peedie that's UNK and what not
and it was basically long ago in the well in me mother's day there was the herring fishing it was a busy time then
was your mother involved in that
well not in the herring fishing but er there was also a salt fish kind of processing place out in the hens and me mother work at it and she used to tell us about i supposed they'll be not rubber boats in that d days
or the protective that we have now and they would have sometimes have to weigh the whole
and send a whole day with and it never hurt them
and then in the herring fishing time oh it was very busy right enough and you see they did they did no fish on a sunday and they would come in on a saturday night
and me mother used to say y you could you could have walked from the point of UNK to the pier how were the boats were that tightly packed in
and i remember herring fishing in me young days
it was the it was boats in me mother's day of course then the UNK was
anyhow it was like the sea and boats and everything else and i used to i was working in a shop and i use to get up early in the morning and go down and UNK all the numbers and names of the boats and there was an old man came in to shop while i was working in and asked about a certain boat i says oh i can tell you trek down
and i give him the whole book what lists names and numbers and what not
and i got a great big box of UNK of him
oh well i always loved the sea i don't think i could live without seeing the sea
you said your mother could walk across
well when the tide was low they would walk for the outer homes then their hens and back again
and sometimes it would be a good of water you see and they would get their feet wet
you can still walk across it low tide
i've done it myself when i was young
what kind of a job did you do then
what white fish was it
it would be UNK and UNK and maybe UNK i don't ken
just what salt fish you had
and who was processing them
well if i mind right i think my mother used to speak about man that had this fish UNK station over at the hens
and did he employ UNK to fish for him
maybe the local UNK did where he got the fish i could not say
or it might have been a bigger concern than i ken
and maybe he had other outside boats took fish to them too
but me old mother certainly spoke a lot about this and the and the salt fish
how did they cure them
what kind of a job was it
they would salt them down and let them lie in the UNK for a while and they would take them out and dry them
what way they dried them whether it was in the sun or if they'd anything to dry them with i don't ken
but they made a great thing with the salt fish
it must have been awful bad in the hens
mhm
i don't think
they would have rubber gloves or any in that days
it was the same with the herring UNK that was here i mind them working on the pier down here and they all had their fingers tied up with UNK there was the skill that work in this
where did all the rest come from
oh well they the north east a lot of them if they all oh my they would not do it nowadays
no
in all UNK the poor UNK would be standing parking and what not
for very little money
what sort of hours did they have
they would start in the morning er i would say maybe eight o'clock i dunno maybe sooner
and they'd still be working well on after s what we call tea time
and what about your mother when she worked at the white fish station
well i think she'd go off early in the morning and then would come home about teatime
they'd take a piece with them and that was all they had to sustain them the whole day
oh it was hard times
it's a wonder that they were as fit as they were
i would only been six or seven when the war started
it started in nineteen fourteen
first i mind about it was the first UNK that came over
great big thing like a huge balloon and lived out at UNK and i mind me mother coming and getting us early and this great big thing come over
who was in it
why it be germans
what were they doing
UNK about the fleet likely
that was the bigger threat the big thing that brought them to orkney
it was not i suppose for anything other than the flow that they came up as far as orkney
do you remember the british UNK being in the flow in the first
oh yes
when they would come in there would be like a all lit up UNK
what were the UNK told at school about the war
oh we oh i suppose we were told about the war but being young and UNK we would not take it all in
i was ten when we could
and all i ken was that we got word that there was to be a school trip and that we were leaving i forget what tie in the morning and going down to see the german ships
did you know about the fact that they'd been captured
no i did not realize it
and i was only one out the family of nine that volunteered to go and none of me brothers or none of them that was all keen on the sea they did not seem to want to go
and i went
i dunno it was arranged but it was a small water boat that took us down the flying UNK
oh we left and oh we were all excited about going on what a great big boat and it was in fact only a small water boat
and we were all enjoying it and looking forward to going to see this big ships and whatnot
sailing along quite the thing and we were right down i dunno how far if we were right in the middle of them or just on the edge of them but we were not far from them
when there was a sense of UNK and what not and then first one ship then the other starts UNK but before that happened we saw germans coming off in the UNK and that
some of them swimming in the sea and whatnot
i was terrified
and then the ships UNK and some would go down by the UNK and others would UNK up and they'd be great UNK of water
by his time i was terrified and i don't ever be so and our teacher took us down below and tried to play games my mind i UNK my
and eventually we got they were frightened you see that the UNK of the boats going down would pull the water boat under
so we turned and came back and oh it was grand
we got a grand welcome home
did nobody have any idea what was going on at the time
i don't suppose no they wouldn't have any warning about this going to happen or they would never have taking a lot of UNK down among it
it was just very spontaneous surely
but they had it very well arranged the germans did
but there was a big loss of life as well but what frightened me was this germans coming over on peedie bits of UNK and the men swimming in the sea and whatnot
were you frightened because it was germans
yes
i was terrified of the germans
well what did you think they were going to do
well i had no idea
maybe come and kill us or something like that
i did not ken
i was just terrified out me UNK
when our people what was going on and one thing and another
but i as i say i were young and i wouldn't have been paying particular attention
but oh we were told about the war and what was happening between the germans and whatnot
and did you think that the germans were bad or
oh yes very bad
well there was lots of families you see that had their boys and men and UNK and all at the front it was a sad time
people that you knew you know getting wires and that to say that their UNK had either been killed or were missing or some like that
that sticks out in my mind
but our family was too young to me in the war like me brother
in
what i mind of the last war it was too busy then
very UNK
i forget how many troops were here
but we lived near a battery we lived out at whale park and when they deciding give the elizabeth was just a baby then and i used to grab elizabeth and go in the bed and the d down UNK and the UNK on top of us and lie tight and send you until the was in the sitting room and the search light follow the plane was at the plane was that near the house that the UNK come right into the window and the next i ken was the UNK off the roof
where did the UNK come
the german plane that the UNK was following
it was a german plane coming over
and the UNK the battery that we were the camp that we were near they opened fire and the battery would open fire at that and the UNK anyway came in through the window
it was not a very fine experience
were there a lot of air raids at that time
oh well there was quite a lot of UNK and whatnot but er on the whole there was a lot but no more than any other place
but oh it was busy then
where did all the troops stay
there was some of them UNK in private houses and we just had a two r bedroom house out at whale park a peedie bungalow
and you were if you had a spare room you were all well i think you were forced to take in troops and we had elizabeth a baby and we had UNK nearly all the wartime
we kept two at a time sometimes one and not what not
and then there was the were staying our the stromness and the commercial and that
and the UNK and then of course there was camps at the belt
what about UNK
well speaking personally i had plenty of UNK here was pictures and there was mess dos and parties and what not
oh it was a gay life
oh well there was clothes and gardens and just the same as it is now
but oh that's where the was it the UNK bank that's at the top of castle street
mhm
that was and that was a grand shop
we used to all wear UNK white UNK on the top of our dresses and going to school and i used to go into old mr n and he would say to me and what colour of the bow do you want on your UNK today
and i would say he'd wait for me to say blue to match my eyes
just as a kid he would lift me up on the m up on the er counter you know and me i was born in and then we shifted to the bottom you know that white house i think it's all offices now in the erm big gates of the cathedral
you know at the bottom of the market green
well the house you just went in a gate there and went up the stairs there
so it was just my mother used to see me across the road with my shilling to pay for my UNK
and one day i UNK i dropped it down the drain as i went into the shop
and i tears of course you know and er the poor old man he was a very small man mr and er he lifted me up and told me never to mind i could get another shilling
but i don't know whether i ever got
or whether i got the UNK for nothing i might have easy
yes
did you have to have a different UNK every day then
oh very nearly
oh yes but they were just things that you tied at the back and er had a UNK round here they were bonny
on the top of your dress
and what was the UNK for
oh just dress
you were dressed in a clean one you had a clean UNK on
you know just a thing with UNK and er UNK hang loose on you
you've seen pi pictures of that surely
was that to keep the dress clean
i don't know i think it was just to make us look pretty with a white UNK on the top of our clothes
and did all the UNK wear t all the girls wear these
oh yes
nearly every girl
well when they were tiny anyway
mhm
well it must have been an awful job to keep all these white
oh yes and then we oh whenever we had anything like UNK or anything like that we had lovely white dresses that were made of what they called UNK
what could i say it was like
it was a sort of UNK soft material but very er thin
and the ladies all when they were dressed they would have a skirt made of this and a UNK with a high neck and er a silver UNK belt round their waist
did they wear very tight UNK
oh mercy yes
yes my aunt was mrs david and goodness me i can remember her having the UNK pulled in
just slim UNK
big UNK i always used to say
what sort of things did they have to keep their UNK in
they looked terribly tough
well just UNK like that and they're UNK on the front with things that UNK in and then sometimes they would have a what they called a oh what on earth did they call that
it was a thing made of whale bone that they shoved down side without UNK
and there were just as stiff as boards
did they have to keep that on all day
oh yes
well did that not do any damage to their UNK then
well you would think so wouldn't you but it nobody ever to say anything about it
did they have to wear lots of do you remember your UNK or your mother did they have to lots of layers of clothes or they seem to be
yes
and they very often when they were dressed they would have a little UNK that they would lay over their shoulders instead of a long UNK thing you know
they'd have a little fancy UNK or my grandma used to always have a fancy UNK that just a small thing that came you know a bit down their back and my grandma used to wear erm a white much it was just thing like a baby's a cotton thing tied with a just a string you know just to erm just a tie under her UNK and it would have a wee bit of lace s on the corner or the or the end of the tie that was through the day and it was all UNK and then when she was on holiday and came into town she had a thing on her head made of UNK and it all had fancy little things in it
very posh
did she live in the country
she lived in UNK
mhm
was it a big event to come into kirkwall
oh yes
my goodness yes
some of them were never in t i well i didn't know my aunt when i met her with a hat on
my aunt
there was one time she was all dressed up to go to town and i didn't know her because she had a hat on
i never seen her with a hat on in my life before but grandma wore a UNK when she came into town
and grandma was the same she had a she had another little fancy hat that she wore
funny little things then
did could everybody afford to have their own horse and UNK or was there a bus that came in or
oh never such a thing as a bus was brakes in these days that went to the country
they didn't have a horse bus of any kind did they
no well yes they had what they called brakes that came in
and erm they the w it was a place called UNK in UNK
er UNK was the name of the farm or the place and then it came along to the lighthouse corner
new lighthouse was the name of the house
that was one of mu un UNK that had that house and well my cousins have it now
and then they set off from there into kirkwall about what time
about nine o'clock in the morning
and we sat in two rows and two horses pulling at us
and did they have to stop and change the horses
no
just you see
no they didn't do UNK
but granddad had a lovely little what could you call it
a little UNK it wasn't a UNK either he did have a UNK but he had this thing a sort of long shaped er what would you call it
i i've got mixed up with the names of the things
before my time
i think it's oh by UNK it is
er and they used to sit in that
erm two little doors at the well it's just kind of the shape of what could i say it's the shape of
well there would be a seat they would be facing each other in their seats
there's a picture of granddad in erm that new orkney book that came out
erm what's the name of it
what the
n david UNK had a whole lot of pictures and there's an awful lot of pictures in it belonging to my granddad and grandma
we're not in it but me cousins and UNK and UNK and everybody's in it
is that the one
the all the old photographs of orkney i've seen that one
yes
yeah
well if you see an old man sitting there with a shining UNK cap on you'll know that's me granddad in a white UNK
is there any sort of shelter
well when no
no shelter
what happened if it was a pouring day rain
it must have poured on us but i can't ever remember it raining you know there was when we used to go to UNK i had very long hair and we and kirkwall wasn't just the UNK of place at places at that time
and my hair was UNK more or less the colour of the map you know or a little UNK than the colour of the map
and when i when it was opened out for me going to UNK well that was a great event
grandma used to always say oh i know she's on the bus because i can see her here
and er when i went to school miss the old teacher she used to take me out er i used to go to the school ready to go to UNK we had to ask out a quarter of an hour early
and erm when because we went the first day of our holidays right away to UNK to my mother's people
and er i had to ask out this quarter of an hour early well i got me hair all UNK out all ready to go you see
but miss used to take me out into here to the teachers UNK room and er UNK my hair up again and s say to me i'll take it out before you go away UNK because there was it wasn't a clean place in kirkwall
such a thing's never heard of UNK days i don't think
so you said that there wasn't an upstairs downstairs kind of thing at all then
well i didn't feel it
i never i never had that feeling
we certainly were like being in the army more or less and er there was the head servants and erm the under servants you know
but it was er we all sort of had a respect for each other and each other 's jobs but there was none of this erm upstairs downstairs and running frightened for people or anything like that
we all kept our place but we all it was as i said just as if they gave you credit for what you could do
it's in er well how can i describe it to you
but we never were made to feel inferior or er erm anything like that
i never i was never made to feel that way anyway
i just get so annoyed at this english women that wrote that book upstairs downstairs you certainly th we know that the UNK and the cook are boss you know
they're the they're the head ones and they're place in you're sort of in charge
but you don't rub up against that horrible feeling
what was society i in orkney just before you left you said you were a young girl and you left about nineteen
yes
was there er was there a big gap in society in orkney were there you know were the rich were rich and the poor were poor
oh yes dreadful
far worse than anything i ever met in the south
and er there r there are no real er gentry in orkney you see and you'll always find that if anybody gets a well as i said to one boy here i said to him look here i said your old grandfather worked in that shop till his UNK was hanging out his UNK
and i said that's the reason that you can get a car anytime you want it
i said i've lived lo long enough to know that
i said and i always say that it's the UNK
okay
recording is that
now if you UNK want to say your name or something just to check that's re it's recording
if you just give me your name or say hello or something
dave
no say it towards the
oh dave
er do you want to say it now
david
mhm
walter
okay right that's not bad
that's just
is that working
that's working fine
okay well we'll just we'll just start then
i mean
mhm
don't be frightened to speak loud
no
see the clearer you speak the clearer it'll be on here
ah yes
okay
mhm
so then and er is that a bit UNK
no it's fine
for your there
it's fine it's fine
is that is that okay
fine
but okay then so i'm here speaking to walter and david and you've both worked at lyness during the second war
no the first
no the second war
no
it's both it's the second
right you are
well i was just actually gonna ask you about what you did afore it
how you got into this work
so i'll start with you walter
well when i left school i stayed in the island of hoy to lyness
mhm
and er my first job i had at lyness was working for william on the tanks outside UNK under the tanks
mhm
and then when i finished there came and i was employ employed number one by them
so your first job was working with the UNK
yeah with william
mhm
doing it under the tanks
mhm
and then when that job finished i started with
and they were the firm that were make a tunnel up the hill
but first they had to look for a camp site so mr was the chief engineer i was employed by him to have a look round and we discovered lyness farm to be a suitable place
mhm
so they decided to build the camp there
they bought the farm from the late william wards and built the camp there
and would that be the first camp buildings on hoy or
oh no there was more camps afore that
there would have been sir william before that
mhm
and er so what er what er sort of era was when about was this still right at the beginning of the war when you were doing this or
that would have been i would say maybe august nineteen thirty eight
nineteen thirty eight
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
cos i was reading in hugh 's book that the very first sort of work was in surveys done in thirty seven
that's right and testing the UNK for the tunnel
mhm
they did drill holes up the hill
mhm
but before that was working there on the tanks digging out the tank farms
and their amp was the fleet canteen
i see
yeah
mhm
mhm
mhm
and while the while they were testing did they employ any of the local folk for this
i think there was somebody employed dragging the stuff up the hill
i don't know how many how many were employed
there wasn't many men there was just a company come up and test bored in the hill
mhm
mm
and was this testing for possible underground fuel tanks
that's what it was testing for
yeah
and did you know that on hoy
no well
were you to told that this is what they were planning
nobody knew they said it was something to do with tanks but nobody knew
UNK
yeah
mhm
aha
mhm
that would kind of be kept a bit quiet was it
the
well not in that base no but
not in that base no
there were quite a bit lyness because i remember once the hoy head coming down from stromness with a lot of party makers aboard it and cameras out and afore they knew where they were the UNK men was there UNK the films out of the cameras
is that right
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm and this was just an innocent party
party mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
so they do they test for the for the hill would be the first thing
yeah
what can you mind what was the first sort of action on hoy that impressed you cos well you'd been there all your life you would have really seen the whole process happening
well the first would have been the building of the tanks the outside tanks
mhm
when came to dig out the foundations and like the buildings round the tanks
mhm
that was the first
mhm
and did you go straight to school
from school to doing that
no i was working various small jobs before that
mhm that on hoy
on hoy yeah
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
so did they just have you on right away
oh yes
full time
there was no trouble to get work then
there was no shortage of work
mhm
yeah
mhm
and what about you UNK
you wouldn't have
well i started on farm work
mhm
i started on farm work and then er we left that and we started with the county council
on the
yeah
roads and quarries and
mhm
one thing and another
and then we decided that me and me brother would go chance our hand at lyness
ah
so the camps was up then of course when we came down
yeah
mhm
what
so
time would that be about that you started
i think about the same time as walter for the war was declared when we were down there on the third of september
aye you'd have been there in thirty nine
no the war was declared in thirty eight
aye well that was the that was
thirty nine
thirty nine was it
that was the crisis thirty eight
ah
ah it was thirty nine
yeah that's the crisis
yeah
ah yes
yeah
mhm
mhm
so i mind war was declared then
oh right
frightened the life out of us altogether
and where are you from yourself
are you from the mainland
yes just here i belong i belong here
oh i see mhm
right
so it wouldn't be too big a step just to go to lyness really it was kind of a natural thing
no just caught the boat at stromness and old hoy head and down there and took a bit
one and six it cost on the UNK
mm
and why did you go there
it was
well for better money that's better prospects that's why
mhm
we went there
mhm
erm
yes that really would be where the employment was
yes yeah
we were working with the council at ten pence and hour so we thought we were going to improve on that a wee bit
right i'll stick it UNK you again now
er now and i'll sit in front of you listening
would you like a table to sit
mm
mm
i'm dead right with this
ah
okay
so what would your first job be then when you actually
working in the quarries er loading the lorries with a hand shovel
hand shovel
yeah
is that all the equipment they gave you
that's all we got
and they was high sided lorries it was a quite a throw up
jesus
and old boss old west do you mind old west
tom west and john west
aye
yeah
he always said chuck it well over chuck it well over
all blooming right for him when he was six feet in the air
is this the lorries
so yes that's the burn transit lorries that were loaded
they were UNK lorries
aye UNK
yeah
mhm
mhm
and were they did you see them coming up
were they transported specially up
well yes from london
it was a london firm
mhm
mhm
yeah
mhm
but they all didn't come at one time they were always had new ones coming again
yeah
mhm
and was i how did you work it was it like a certain amount of men per lorry or did they just come in UNK
ah well they d well as you see it's three or four lorries there so many men at each lorry
mhm
yes
mhm
and was it continual like as soon as one lorry drove away did you get an empty in
oh the lorries were standing waiting for you
worse luck
mhm
mhm
about how can you mind how many of you there would have been
roughly
er in the camp
well
working in the quarry
oh my goodness
be twenty would there
aye it'd been about twenty or thirty
yeah
mhm
mhm
mhm
twenty or thirty
mhm
mhm
and where would you have stayed
in the camp
it was all camp
mhm
mhm
and that was that was the camp just right on the lyness fell
the lyness fell right on the point yeah
aye right down to the shore there
yeah the shore
in the middle of a UNK field
there was
turnips underneath
they were building the camp on the top of the UNK and crop and turnips
it was turnips underneath the UNK
yeah
yeah
and er put the UNK up
of UNK
is that right
they employed a lot of local labour of course too
yeah
they had a lot of UNK up from UNK and they employed a lot of local labour as well
mhm
mhm
but despite that it wasn't the first camp up
there was camps up for the tank workers
no er they had tanks up for their men yeah
they had UNK up for their men
yeah
and did not
they had the fleet canteen
ah
mhm
they had the whole fleet canteen
they maybe had a few UNK for their bosses or UNK round it
mhm
but they used the fleet canteen which was there in the first war
and it was right near the pier was it
in the centre of the tanks
in the centre
yeah
mhm
of the tanks
mhm
mhm
yeah
mhm
mhm
and then later of course you'd get all the rest of the camps
was this was still fairly
oh yeah
early on in what nineteen thirty eight thirty nine
thirty eight thirty nine yeah
mhm
mhm
mhm
and then it would er at that time you would just have the tank workers and the quarry workers
yeah
is that right
yeah
and the ones up the hill
yeah
digging the road up to wee UNK
ah right
and trying to get the light UNK up
there's a london firm did the light UNK
that's right
from london they did the UNK up from the lyness up to the hill
mm
for the lights
and right over the hill from north to south
yeah
was that lighting inside
lighting inside yeah
ah
but the lights to keep power
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
so you changed jobs then really did you both you both kind of started out in the quarries
yes as labour for
oh no
i actually started with UNK civil engineer going round looking for the camp site and then we did tramp the hills
ah right
and lay off were the tunnel was going to go and the road up to the hill and lay off the power station and
mhm
mhm
all that on the hill and then go down to the and measure from there to the top of the hill to see how much pipe for the
aye
for the to pump water to the hill
right
mhm
yeah
so how many folk would you be working with
it was just two of us along with the surveyor
that would be kind of the UNK job
yes
carrying that UNK and labelling
i mind
yeah
mhm
mhm
mm that would that would still be seen as likely a better job that
oh yeah
yeah
it certainly was
yeah
mhm
but i got promoted to the road roller and then into the power station so
mm
mm
mhm
yeah
mhm you
it was a different outfit altogether
then i left the surveying surveyor civil engineering i went in the black gang
along with the fitters at the tunnel looking after the UNK and UNK in the tunnel and all the rest of the
mhm
mm
tunnel gear
mhm
mhm
can you mind roughly h how long it would have taken you to get the rough survey
how long
was that done
oh there was weeks of it
weeks of it
weeks of it because the after the put in all his markings the UNK came and checked the whole thing then
to see if it was right
mhm
before they was allowed to go ahead
mm
and e every week the UNK had a clerk of works going round watching the progress
and er they had a surveyor gang checking all the lines in the tunnel that the surveyors put up to keep the men driving the right tunnel it shouldn't go p one past the other
oh i see
yeah
mhm
mhm
they were working with both ends
both ends you see
they were working from both ends
they had so many men they had to start at the other end and
aye
to the other side so as they
met in the middle
and
and they did meet
did meet yeah
and then they
just a few inches
and then they had the UNK coming down from the top
the two UNK coming down as well the
what's UNK
well they were UNK too
it's just a UNK hole really for
and they chaps down to the pumps
the pumps was at the bottom of the UNK
the pumping for the tunnel
mm
pumping they'd a pump away along used to pump it along
aye but they had two at the bottom
one in each down at the bottom yeah
oh it could've been
yeah
yeah
mhm
and they pumped in there
mhm
mhm
right
mhm
so you would wait till did you ken what you were doing did they explain it to you
the surveyors
what was happening
aha
oh yes they told us it was to be underground oil storage
yeah
mhm
they had three surveyors there
mhm
and they finished
and they had an assistant
mhm
a chief engineer edward
and
aye they had plenty of bosses
he was a local he was the engineer up the hill
mm
at that was boss
aye UNK yeah
yeah
mhm
mhm
ah right
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
oh well i'm going back in time to catch up with your side
wh did the when you were erm still UNK did they ever provide you with better equipment
than just your UNK
no you just had your shovel
it going
oh i see
and was it all
down at the survey i wasn't very long there i was only about
mm
mm mhm
three or four weeks
mm
mhm
on that kind of work and then
mhm
mhm
then i was on this roller and then we got er started up at the power station with the
mhm
with the engines
mhm
and your roller that would all be shipped from down south as well was it
well it was there when i came i don't know where it yes
mm
yes
it come up on the boats
yeah
mhm
all the machinery come up from wherever the headquarters was
mhm
mm
and could you drive already or did they
oh land rollers is no bother to drive
no
just one lever
forward and start
and the biggest job was keeping the water in the boiler and keeping the you had to get steam
mhm
oh of course
mhm yeah
mhm
steam roller
mhm
mhm
aha
right
yeah
and to get the stones you would be working with just UNK
to start
aye you you'd be blast it down it was UNK and UNK
mhm
mhm
yeah
and then the road roller
so once you were road rolling was you still on that job when you started to make the road up to up wee UNK
yes
yeah
yeah
mhm
mhm
that would be another major operation
it certainly was
getting a road up that
a lot of it was done by hand
it would have been mostly done by hand
there were some bits the UNK was in but mostly by hand
yeah
yeah
and then it was all with stones and
aha
and pitched and UNK
it's still standing good yet
but all the machinery was put up before the road was
yes
afore the road
yes
afore the road yes they just UNK through the mud and
yeah
mhm
mhm
was that because they were so desperate for it
yeah
yes they had to get lights for working
mhm
yeah
mhm
and i suppose that would have been this
aye that's the
mhm
the UNK
six cylinder er four er six cylinder UNK
mhm
and what were they
just g generators
no
they drove generators
they drove generators
aye that's
yeah
mhm
mhm
fixed down on a concrete bed and then your generator goes on the end on
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
coupled
mhm
mhm
its UNK and all this are going after it's
what would you call one of them then
a six cylinder UNK
ah right
never heard of one of those
that's what it is
mhm
oh
so would you mind describing how you got it up there again cos i thought it was quite a good story
well they set off they UNK it up and then they had at least six of them burn transit lorries all UNK it up
yeah
and er our road roller was pulling too
and we got half up and stuck
and then er
they put a UNK away up the hill
that was kind of a massive UNK in concrete
and then put the ropes round the UNK and pulled down the hill instead of pulling up
mhm
right
so we got it up that way
mhm
that's quite clever use gravity to help you along
er yeah
yes downhill
and
see the roller smooth tyres wheels that could pull nothing up there
no
but with its own weight going down you could er oh we got it up
you would need steep rope for your UNK
oh yes
oh yes
aha
can you imagine down a hill in road roller
it's just a nightmare
yeah
so there was there was no accidents caused by all that going up
no it all went
mhm
mhm
sticking here and there but er
aha
we got it there
mhm
and then once she was up you did you have your power station already built
no oh well the floor was there
it was what the i think
what was the station
that's part of the station
is that
that is
that's the station
yeah
it's a it was a
oh right
UNK iron building
it's UNK iron building that's the station
yeah
yeah
oh right
of course it's just quite a peedie building isn't it
it's not a great big
oh it's not
no
it's not very
no
not very big but my there was some noise inside there
when that big er belt
yeah
er and what was actually inside it then
well there was nothing in it but the engines and the
and
generators
mhm
and UNK
and how many engines would there be
er
five was it
it was er three two hundred and forty horse UNK
yeah
one small one
on hundred and forty horse
ah and a UNK
and a UNK was three hundred and fifty it was the biggest one of the lot
yeah
yeah
mhm
there'd gave been five engines
five engines yes
and how many generators would that run
five generators
all the all the generators
mhm
five
so you had to have an engine for each generator
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
and then that was all erm giving light to the tunnel
light and power yes
in fact lyness got light off it to begin with
aye
aha
because they had no power station at lyness
of course
un until the UNK put in two stations later on
a and b station
mhm
aye
mhm
mhm
it was the UNK
mhm
ah right
mhm
your UNK was that for air
were
yeah
you feeding air
yeah
into the tunnel
for the UNK
aye the
ah
and for the mechanical UNK the UNK
aye it was all compressed air
compressed air
mhm
mhm
ah right
mhm
what about the folk working in the tunnel would they need air at all
yeah
no there was plenty of fresh air
plenty of fresh air
ah but they had a UNK line
they had they had round to suck out the
a big
the UNK fumes and the diesel fumes yeah
it was a fan blowing it out
UNK blowing it out yeah
mhm
mhm
mhm
and if you went past the end of it with your hat on and you're UNK
you'd a bald head
the fans are still in it yet for the
oh
for the UNK the fans in it yet but they're
oh right
not UNK up of course
aha
aha
no lights
and what was your day to day job then
in
oh well worked in shifts
three shifts right round the clock
mhm
mhm
seven to three and three to eleven and eleven to seven
mhm
one week about
ah right
and you were supposed to work half past seven to half past five
mm
but there was no limit to working time four to ten at night if they wanted you
mm
ah right
there was no hours worried about
mhm
work on work on
mhm
yeah
aye
mhm
mhm
mhm
and once your surveying was done did they actually put you inside the tunnel
oh you the whole time
with the surveyors
oh right
because you had to put in the level plugs for them to keep the level and the centre lines to keep the centre
mhm
every day you were in with the
of course you would survey the outside
yeah
and then you would just need to be b used to build the whole of the inside then
yeah
yeah
they UNK the whole hill right over the top
mhm
and then er decided where the entrance was to go in
mhm
and then er kept the centre line then
right
mhm
so d you had a north south
aye north south yeah
east west
no
no
just right through
no just north south
right through
right through
that was right through and then once they got it right through they cut the big chamber then
they drove a ten by eight tunnel on that side
mhm
to the right and a ten by eight to the left and then they went up a grade and they drove up same on both
till they got a good piece through
mhm
and then they came back and they drove UNK down to the bottom
right
and once they got that down th cut the UNK then the wide arch
and they UNK then as they took the big piece out they kept pumping concrete and shifting then pumping again
so as the roof was all secure before they UNK the centre out
oh i see
yeah
and it was on rails that
on rails yeah
mhm
and then pumped the concrete in at the back
section at a time
and once they got that section all set they started to cut the next in
and then they shift again
pump that one in and kept moving on
mm
they got the roof secure cos it was a wide
mhm
hole then
it was a massive job
yeah
mhm
and then they UNK the centre out
mhm
the side and the b floor put in then
oh right
mhm
and was it off this one central chamber that you took the tank chambers round
yeah off the first one
yeah
and then you drove another tunnel out to the right
right
and you so far out and then you drove another one in to the next chamber
yeah
same again to the next until you got your six chambers
i see
and then they drove another tunnel out an access tunnel which
mhm
once they were UNK the pipe tunnel as they called it
yeah
they used that to take all the muck out then
ah i see
yeah
yeah
mhm
and how were your six chambers arranged
was it in a circle like that a central one no
aha
no
no
one l one like that and then the entrance into it
right
the next in like that
aha
and the next and the next just the same
ah i see
yeah
mhm
mhm
and the same off this side then
no
no
just all the one
just this one
mhm
six on the one side
ah i see
mhm
mhm
mhm
so you would like come in to the main entrance and then
come into
you'd have all the tanks right
yeah
to one side and then your exit
yeah
mhm
ah
mhm
mhm
i see
mhm
like i imagined it at all
mhm
mhm
and where did the expertise for this job come from
they would all be folk engineers for south
engineers for south yeah
aha
and was that 's job
's job yeah
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
course checked the whole time by the UNK
mhm
they were there checking the whole time
mhm
see that nothing was
mhm
faulty or out of place
mhm
UNK if it was wrong
mhm
yeah
were they pretty careful then
oh they were
yes
mhm
mhm
mhm
they watched everything closely
and what about your UNK
were there any other local fellas on it or
oh yes a lot of local fellas
oh yes yeah
everyone who was spare was
everybody as they left their school got a job doing something
aha
they worked in the kitchen or UNK
yeah
working in the UNK
or running in the running to the
yeah
yeah
mhm
mhm
mm
mhm
mhm
and you see a great lot of the people stayed locally well they had their wives up
yeah
yeah and they stayed in local houses
mhm
mhm
and of course had their own camp and their own UNK bungalow lyness down on the point
where the UNK
gordon stayed and
aye
ian and jimmy and bert and er tom and all that ones
tom and john
john both of then stayed there
all the gentry was down there
and if it if it came an air raid you started UNK to the hill to get in the tunnel
the air raid shelter
yeah
mhm
er
mhm
and then of course erm would it be later that they took up the english miners
no they came up pretty soon in it when they were digging the road but
yeah
yeah
they didn't think too much of the weather like this
no
yeah
mhm
is that right
mhm
d ho roughly how many came up
fifty or sixty i think
aye it was about sixty
about sixty
sixty in the first lot
yeah
right
but then men came from all over
they came form and aberdeen and
mm
UNK and
yeah
shetland and all through the north isles of orkney everywhere
mhm
they UNK in
mhm
and UNK
UNK
i was not there when they
the UNK lands
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mhm
grand workers they were
yeah
mhm
mhm
great big tall men
yeah
mhm
aha
mhm
yeah
mhm
did you have special clothing did you
no we got we got an UNK coat and a pair of rubber boots
for to protect you in the tunnel they said you wear a UNK but nobody hardly ever wore it
for
is that right
on your head
aye
and folk weren't keen on wearing them
no they hardly e there were maybe some did but very few
ah right
mhm
and did you get any UNK for the fumes
oh no
no
what about you UNK were you in
i was never i didn't work in
what about working in the power station did you have any did you get ear UNK for the noise
no
didn't have them but we should have had
but what a noise was in there
mm
but you didn't get them
no
no
no
no
i had a wee office but it was kind
yes
of sealed that you could go in and have a cup of tea in
mhm
ah
mhm
mhm
so was your main work in the power station checking everything was running alright
checking
aye just looking after engines
aha
aha
mhm
and d had they shown you like were you sort of trained if anything did go wrong you would have fixed it yourselves
aha
oh yes most of the things we'd have done the work UNK
we did all the engine repairs
mhm
mhm
er we UNK one of the six cylinder engines we did it in a shift
me and tommy
mhm
we
mhm
removed the UNK and
mm
new UNK and that in the eight hours we were on shift
it took a bit of doing
yes that's going
and the blooming heat and the
yeah
noise in there
we never spoke we just worked with signals
ah
you know our putting up the UNK more or less a which is we had a big of er tommy would know what i meant and i would know what he meant
mhm
mhm
yes you would need some form of communication like that cos shouting would just be useless
yeah
yeah
mhm
no
so it would pretty well train you up as engineers by the t by the time you'd done that then
oh yes oh yes certainly knew you had to know what you were doing with it you know
did you have any kind of basic training afore it like
did they take you for a week and show you
not really well we the UNK engineer fitting up engines he stayed with us for a while to show us the ropes like you know
aha
but after that you just had to do it yourselves
mhm
ah right
mhm
and
and air raids i mind the air raid
mhm
we'd to clear out
you couldn't work with the lights you see
no
shut the lights down
you used to switch off the lights and run
yeah
mhm
oh really
right along the hill
mhm
and you'd hear the UNK about the tin sheds
they had a they had a air raid shelter below the power station later on
aye after
mhm
mhm
oh
but er when you were after the power station so when clean away from the station altogether
did you never enter the tunnel like you were
well they were in the tunnel anyway
yeah
ah we were too far away
you were too far away
we didn't go in always we used to if we were on the top of the hill we used to watch from the top
mm
i think one time there were some folk up from lyness they cleared out and they were in the tunnel and of course they UNK
and somebody says oh they've dropped a bomb on the tunnel
it was the UNK in the tunnel
aye quite safe in the tunnel
yeah
yes
yeah
you would be in the dark though were you if you shut the power down
no the li the lights was on in the tunnel
oh yes
yeah
oh yes you could leave the lights in the tunnel but they could see the lights that were any light about the station they could
yeah
see that
ah i see what you mean
yeah
yeah
yeah were very particular about lights they i think it was about a hundred feet in the entrance that there were
yeah
there was no lights at night
so as the light wouldn't have reflected through the entrance
oh i see
yeah
mhm
mhm
mhm
and then they had a tip outside where the lorries backed into
mm
to pick up the s the er muck out of the tunnel
they had a very small very faint light and they had a blue light
aye
a very light man UNK the UNK into the bins could see what he was doing
right
and the three lorries could back underneath and load and go down and tip at the golden UNK at lyness
ah right
oh yes i'd forgotten to ask you about that
yes
mhm
mhm
that was the
and
and of course a lot of the muck was tipped on the hill you can see the marks of it yet
yeah
where the rail track runs from the north town to the south town or you could go by rail from the one side of the hill to the other
inside or outside
aye
yeah
mhm
mhm
yeah that must have been quite something to see something UNK round hoy
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
think what you would think of it nowadays
it's just crazy
mhm
aye i must ask you once you once you had your sort of main UNK built and your light and then you would start concentrating on your chambers
the chambers yeah
mhm
mm
now h wh what did it look like inside one of these chambers
well the
once it was or while you were building it and once it was up
when we were working on it was just a load of UNK
mhm
and you could see all the UNK going in below
and the UNK at the top and the UNK down to the top
mhm
to get ready for putting the UNK in
mhm
it was only when you UNK the centre out that you actually
yeah
yeah
saw the big
yeah
right
UNK then when the roof was secure
mhm
did you did you go up right through the hill at all to get light
never you would stay a good bit underneath
no
no there'd be there'd be about it must be two hundred feet above
oh yes
oh yes
aye
so we'd be half up the hill i would think
aye
yeah
mhm
aha
mhm
so when you came to blast the centre out was there like a special warning to everybody
oh there was
who was working in the hill to
the no oh no they the you just moved back
n aye shifted back
shifted back out of the blast and you got boom
that's all you got
mhm
mhm
you you'd think there was somebody knocking on your ears
yeah
yeah
is that all is sounded like
yeah
aye it wasn't a big charge it was
no
just breaking up the pieces of stone
yeah
yeah
right
mhm
aha
mhm
you n you were never concerned that the whole lot might come in or something
no
no
you wouldn't be with your concrete
no
it was just if it was a clay UNK like number five chamber were the full of clay
mm
and they made it shorter for that reason
right
but most of the hill was quite safe
aha
er but er
lots of slates falling down on
yeah
the top of your UNK
yeah
yeah
ah
coming out
yeah
mhm
mhm
be terrible dark would it not be
no it wasn't dark at all
mm
no
no
you got water running in places but not badly in the wintertime it wasn't too bad
mhm
and you said there was actually this the two irish fellas that got killed in the tunnel
yes they
what h
boys
what happened to them
it was a roof fall
mm
ah
after the UNK
mhm
ah
quite a long time i would have start probably with more than thirty years ago because me mum always make cheese and i just thought making when i was still a girl at the school and since we came here and UNK on me own behalf well twenty six years we've been making UNK here
is it all your own milk that you use for cheese
yes we have our own cows and its all our own milk
i've got a UNK of milk
how do i go about making it into a cheese
well when it comes in from the cow it's at blood heat and e you put it through your UNK and then you drain it and er you leave it be and it UNK goes consistency of UNK slightly UNK than UNK and after that stood a certain time you apply heat then you warm it up and you UNK it you break up the UNK and the UNK gradually rises to the top and your UNK to the bottom
and again you leave it standing a certain time and you pour off your UNK and take your UNK in to a UNK and er hang it up and again more UNK drain off cos it's hanging up
and after a certain period again you break up that UNK and then you pack your UNK into your er cheese UNK then and er apply pressure
it goes in the UNK mid afternoon you leave that until next morning and take it out put in a clean UNK and turn it back in the coke and more pressure until the next morning
it seems to be one of the things actually that people that are home on holiday to orkney you know maybe you have lived here in the past and orkney cheese is one of the things they want to take back with them a UNK cheese
oh yes er a local people coming home always like to take UNK cheese away and orkney people go on away on holiday again like to take ones off to their friends and relatives in the south too
now i believe you're having your dairy UNK at the moment
how is this going to affect things
it shouldn't really affect things er a lot it just makes things slightly more convenient
there's been a few small alterations
i had a dairy before it's just been updated a wee bit because i make slightly more UNK than i used to make and it'll make it er easier hopefully
what's your output of cheese
the season of the year makes a difference presently i'll be making approximately eight pounds probably everyday
that will increase very shortly i'll have more milk
it'll probably go up by another three four pounds and then later on er when the cows goes up to the grass i'll be making not quite double probably but er quite a lot more than i do now up to maybe fourteen fifteen pounds in a day
how do you see things in the future then
things can change very quickly but presently the demand is very good
in fact it's increasing the demand UNK the supply at the moment
it's small round UNK that you make
what's the reason for that
they're very popular with the tourists i think they feel they are taking back a whole cheese as opposed to a portion cut off a bigger cheese
and some of the markets that i supply it's the hotel and restaurant trade that some of them go to they like the small whole UNK
they can put the whole cheese out on the UNK again i suppose to just a portion going on the UNK
and i have packaging specially for the small ones it makes them easy for people to post if they want to post them off to friends
they're quite safe in their own packaging
tourists that take them back they have the label on the box to say where they have purchased this cheese
it's a an attraction i think as well
what was the story about the UNK again
well she l she lived i think up on the hill above here
UNK land somewhere
and she was supposed to be a UNK right enough and the men from all round about here er had a meeting about it and they i think met at the barn of UNK
where was that
UNK the farm just over the hill
and they all had their UNK with them
so they went to the UNK well which was s supposed to have some kind of UNK properties you see and er i don't ken if it was a holy well or exactly but it certainly was UNK to have some kind of properties that could cure supposed to cure any disease save the black death
so they went to the UNK well and UNK their UNK in the water
to UNK the whole operation
and then they and took this poor old wife and they beat her to death with the UNK
and er they couldn't bury her in the in the UNK
you see in UNK ground so they buried her in this bit of wheat land at the UNK water there
the UNK
so they say
and she was reported to have er have said when they when they took her out that there would be nothing grow on the site of the house but UNK and i don't know the they were awful hungry for land in that day you ken and there was quite there was more than one occasion there was old folk just putting up with the house just to get the land that it stood on
mhm
so whether the fact that they thought that she was a UNK was maybe kind of half an excuse just for getting her out of the house i don't know
but they they'll tell you that you can still see where the house was because there's a UNK grows there
there's different stories about i know that long ago about men being put out of their putting out of their houses just to and they just er demolished the house you ken and
mhm
just to get the land it was
there was a man that used to that worked in the mill
his initials is UNK on a stone above the UNK fire
and i think it's eighteen sixty six
peter and was a house just up the road UNK
and he was just UNK out of his house
mhm
and they
put hens in his bed and he come in one night and there was a s a man a stray man you ken an UNK of a man like and it was hanging by the neck from a UNK in the house
and i think they'd just been UNK him for a while and that was the last straw
and he came down he would have been working for he would have been at that time my great grandfather maybe or and he came down and he lived in lower UNK after that and just as soon as he was out of his house they just had the house demolished
blew it up
mhm
and then divided up the land
mhm
you were telling about that UNK story afore is that something that your father told you
i think it must have been indeed
mhm
they are oh i don't ken when but they must you ken obviously a long time ago story
mhm
kind of story
er well story about the man from UNK
it was the harvest time and they were going to brew
which they i you ken they were all the houses would have about harvest time
and you ken and all their friends and neighbours came around to help with the harvest they'd have this home brew
so this man i think he came from UNK
which is out along the shore in UNK
and he was going to somewhere in north end i think it was UNK to get barn to make this ale with
so he got the barn and he had it in a peedie UNK you see and he was on his road home and he was coming by this that UNK at UNK there
and he heard this awful grand fiddle music
so he stopped and he listened to this and went to have a look see what was going on
and this was the UNK having a celebration of some kind
and so er whether the UNK he was there or not i don't ken but he was watching this all the all the dancing
and listened to the awful grand music
and he stood and listened to this for a while and then he thought he was delayed long enough so he set off home
when he was coming along the road the they were UNK
and there was a mark on his finger where his the handle of the UNK was just sunk into the flesh of his fingers he was stood there the whole winter listening to this music
i've heard one like that i've heard about the one where the man goes into the and is there for years
mm
you know listening
slightly different i think
can you tell me about the one
erm
there was a there was a man from UNK in UNK supposed to be
it was UNK he was out at the UNK and it blew up a gale a UNK gale and blew him across to norway you see
and he was likely in poor shape by the time he got to norway
but he survived it anyway and there was er folk found him there and kind of looked after him
and UNK him back to health and whatnot
and he was there but there was no way of getting back
and he was there for quite a while
at nights he used to go down to the shore and look out across the sea you see and he wondered what was happening back home at UNK and fairly UNK
and this had gone on for some time and he was down on the shore anyway one night and looking out across the sea and thinking long for UNK and he met this man
and the man was asking him what he was er looking so UNK about and what
he said he told him the story and he said if you could just get back to UNK he says i would give you the best two cattle out of my UNK
if i could just get back to UNK
so the man told him to be down there the same time next night and he returned
so the next night this m the man comes down to the shore and here was two men with a UNK boat
this man he was spoken to the night afore and another one
with a UNK boat
i don't think he was just too impressed with this set up but it was the only chance anyway so
they got him in the boat and they he had to lie down in the bottom of the boat and they and they covered him with a UNK
and he couldn't look out
so they got him settled in the bottom of the boat and just as they were putting this UNK over him and getting ready to set off the one man he heard the one man saying to the other he says right forty miles a wee stroke of the UNK
so they set off anyway and just in no time at all they were coming into the shore below UNK
and it didn't seem very long to the man anyway
and er he was just delighted to be back of course and first thing he did was up to the house and had a he had a look round and he was in the UNK and had these two awful grand
and he was awful proud of them
and they were grown UNK while he was away and they were better than ever and the deal was been that he had was gonna give them the best two cattle you see and this was this was the best two animals he had
he was very UNK to part with them
and he did kind of consider taking the two the next wasn't fairly so good
mhm
but he thought well that was the deal
so he stuck by it so he UNK these two and them down to the shore
and as soon as the first ones UNK touch the deck of the boat the boat just disappeared and it was the UNK that was taking him home
and that was the last he saw of them
and that was the last he saw of them
and he didn't have to part with his cattle after all
but what would have happened to him if he'd not taken the cattle down i don't know
that's another story with a an unusual ending cos i'd have thought when you were saying that he wasn't that he didn't give them the
mhm
and some something
the nice ones and something happened
terrible UNK him but
are there any more that you're about UNK or whatever
i don't think so UNK
i've really ne you don't hear many stories about UNK at all
mm
i mind them they used to say too when afore having a boiled egg you know just peedie
insisted that they pu put the eggs the shell
when you were peedie
which i don't think mum entirely approved of cos she
seemed to think it was just quite proper table UNK maybe but
and it was so that the UNK wouldn't sail away in the UNK
mm
but you
well it was this old wife had a fairy that lived with her and apparently it wasn't an UNK thing
and the UNK was boat you see but they were kind of wandering kind of things
and this fairy was it was found an UNK
so it'd got this UNK in the bottom and they used they would work a mast a sail on it
and they'd got this UNK in the bottom anyway and away it went
and it sailed off to a island that it came to
and there was just a whole loads of UNK on this island
and the peedie fairy was just delighted to start with but soon realized that there was something kind of UNK going on and it wasn't a very happy place
and it turned out that there was a big UNK that lived on this island and he just ate UNK
and he used to come around everyday and kind of size them up and pick the kind of fat UNK ones
and he would tell them that when he was going back to get gonna be his next meal
and er of course the UNK was kind of gradually disappearing
so it wasn't a very happy island right enough
but this peedie fairy anyway it was wandering about one day very UNK at the prospect and found a UNK with a broken wing
so it kind of UNK this UNK you see and got its wing UNK up and whatnot
and er and the UNK started to get better and er it was starting to fly a peedie but again and was just getting its strength back
and this UNK came along one day and says to this peedie fairy that like he was coming to get her in the morning
so UNK off to find the UNK
and er the UNK thought he would maybe make it back to the mainland now so the peedie fairy UNK on his back and the UNK flew it back to the mainland
and the peedie fairy came back and lived with the old wife been afore
and it never UNK any more after that it was seen enough of the big bad world outside
but the old wife always put he egg UNK through the bottom of the UNK when she had a boiled egg after that
i've never ever heard of that before
is that something that other folk on stronsay know or is just something you
i don't know
there's maybe not enough folk knew it because i don't know that there's very many UNK around
no
where there never many ghost stories speak about some of them but
och i don't ken
there's not very many black stories here that you've heard
and then came back and took a woman back with them as their servant
are there many in stronsay that you've heard of or not
that happened in stronsay
did it
mhm
tell me about that then
erm well but the UNK of them still here
is that so
mhm
i mean it's happened all over but
but there's no ghost stories or
no
anything associated with it
but i believe it did happen
mhm
ghost stories
ah i don't ken there's not really an awful lot of ghost stories
there's lower UNK supposed to be UNK
you see and it's likely one of the oldest houses on the island
you ken it's well among the oldest houses on the island
when you say that roughly how old do you think have you got any idea how old it is
no i haven't a clue
the mill has been i don't ken how long there's been a mill on the site there but the mill as it stands at present 's been there from eighteen sixty
mhm
eighteen sixty one is the year it was UNK and extended and whatnot
but there's there was a peedie single story building there
mhm
before that
and you can see on the UNK end just here you know where it's been UNK you can see the old UNK end
and there was a there was two water wheels
one where the water wheel is now
that was fed by the
but there was another wheel at the other end and there was a loch that the f there were hill fields up between
the UNK mill at the other end
and as i say as i say i don't ken how long it had been there but that see that likely about the same time as the as the mill was UNK and er the UNK would've been putting on
you see there wouldn't have been a UNK at the mill before that i think it every house had their own UNK and they dried their own you ken
dried their own grain afore they took it to the mill
but so about the same time as the mill was UNK i think that th land was UNK
for my grand uncle could mind the man that dug the ditch that UNK it
you ken he was an old man then
mhm
so that in about nineteen sixties
mhm
sometime
mhm
and that bit that comes right
mhm
that's right
mhm
that's right
and
you don't have any idea
no i've never heard of the mill being on anywhere different from where
no
it is now
no
so i would think it's just always been at that site
what was what was the ghost story
i don't ken nobody UNK where the ghost came from
or who it is really
i think i've heard that it was er it was the doctor's house some time
i don't ken how far back that is
but er there was something about a servant UNK that got pregnant
and committed suicide to avoid the scandal
or something
so it's possibly her that
aha
that UNK the place
mhm
but it just UNK itself very rarely
have you ever heard it yourself
no
no
but mum has heard it
maybe twice
and dad had heard it
and what form did that take
i mean if they heard
it m it makes an awful UNK sometimes
and always at night
terrible UNK and things that there's just no explanation for
but
no
just noise
the last time that it happened was er on it must be maybe twenty year ago or so
there was a beautiful night in the summertime and the house was just full of women
there was mum and her and my grandmother her mother
and UNK sister
there was a friend of UNK from austria in the house and UNK
yeah there was five women and dad was away and i was out at the fishing just for the night
and i came home about i don't ken maybe eight o'clock in the morning or something a beautiful morning
flat calm
and here all these women was up and er the ghost was surely been performing that night
they'd heard this awful UNK you see and they'd thought it was me coming and falling or something on the stairs
but you ken very early in the morning
mhm
and they all they got up in the morning and i wasn't home still
and must have been the ghost
UNK heard it as well
aha
yes i'm sure
UNK was there
mhm
i don't know it's not a very UNK ghost anyway just
UNK noises
just the sort of UNK noises thirty year or so
were you speaking to about another ghost story or was that the one
no i
no
i don't ken
there's not really many ghost stories on the island i don't think
that was the one that i'd heard about
what about any other stories linked with characters around about here that you've heard
old characters that maybe you don't mind but you've heard spoken about
i
a wolves penalty miss lets in stoke derby dig in to hold off palace and peterborough put birmingham on the spot
hello welcome to the central match goals extra
coming up the best of the action from the UNK insurance league we start at UNK it's wolves and stoke city phil the reporter
in each of the last four games there's been speculation that UNK was taking charge of stoke for the last time
if this was his swan song it started poorly
david kelly sixth of the season put wolves ahead
UNK opposite number would have been pleased
graham UNK future has also been to the fore recently but for different reasons
and had andy UNK scored with a penalty after he'd been UNK by simon UNK would have been even more comfortable
but it wasn't to be and within a minute stoke were level
paul UNK poor pass let in martin UNK
his shot was well saved but mark UNK was present for his thirteenth goal of the season
in the second half wolves had chances to win it
a neat move resulted in UNK good to watch but off target
and wolves should have had a second penalty after UNK had apparently set up kelly but UNK challenge went UNK by mr harrison stoke escaped and wolves were denied the chance to regain the lead
derby county needed a win against crystal palace to put them right up with those early leaders
palace though are not the easiest of UNK
dennis has been watching the action
five minutes gone and tommy UNK free in the palace penalty box is confronted by a nigel martin
the ball went loose and john scored his first league goal for derby
and then eric young UNK towards the corner flag has a clearance against UNK the loose ball against the post
but with fourteen minutes gone derby moved the ball UNK from UNK to UNK and on to paul for a measured finish
two nil and the completely in charge
but there must have been a palace revolution at half time
the visitors UNK in the first half were very UNK in the second
UNK neat overhead put in the persistent chris UNK who UNK the ball between UNK and taylor
with twenty five minutes into the half UNK made a UNK tackle as UNK charged towards the derby box
the only question was yellow or red
the UNK opted for red and UNK made an early departure for the second time this season
but derby kept up their hundred percent home record and added a third goal with UNK free kick
derby three crystal palace one
we stay out east now for peterborough united and birmingham city who met at london road
keith UNK has been watching the action there
peterborough have been looking increasingly like first division UNK but today it was birmingham who were left UNK around for UNK and there weren't too many of them
UNK with a terrific run carrying the ball fifty yards and really there wasn't too much doubt about the penalty decision
it would've been a bit dodgy at UNK road let alone london road
but it took a couple of goes to get the ball in the net
the UNK said the first time the ball wasn't on the spot properly so the kick had to be UNK
no problem though for tony he just hit it to the other side
in the second half peterborough had a man sent off but it didn't affect the final score peterborough beating birmingham one nil at london road
well oxford UNK match against luton town had the air of an early UNK battle as tim now reports it's not a good result for oxford
oxford have a problem
they do all the attacking but the other team do all the scoring
while united threw away a UNK of chances luton had two shots on target in the first half and hit the UNK with one of them as kerry hughes got them a goal
united UNK and UNK but could they find a way through
could they get a goal
same story in the second half
UNK penny UNK they could have all scored
none did oxford nil luton one
and notts county had won four of their five league matches at UNK lane this season but they were given an early shock by today's visitors portsmouth
the last thing you need when you're at the bottom of the table is to concede an early free kick but today notts did just that
tony UNK put portsmouth ahead early on and it looked for a long time as though that was going to be the only goal of the game
but richard walker had other ideas with just two minutes to go he UNK up
notts have a terrific record at home under mick walker and they kept it going
at UNK lane today notts county one portsmouth one
and no joy for west UNK in the northeast where a single goal separated those sides as UNK prepare to meet aston villa in the coca cola cup
and er once again the UNK defence has proved itself somewhat UNK five three
UNK with that er goal from UNK smith stay top
shh UNK got the quickest goal of the afternoon in the first minute and walsall got the only goal with seven minutes left
football live at two fifty tomorrow it's leicester city and nottingham forest
join us for that we'll see you there
bye
good morning
it's UNK gold cup day it's been raining heavily at cheltenham there's a non runner in the big race details coming up
we'll also be looking back a little bit at the UNK cup we'll also have the result of your poll for the channel four racing personality of the year there's the picture UNK and lots of other things as well which i can't remember
you look a bit like annie UNK this morning
or annie get your gun if you're not careful
exactly
and UNK i do like your tie
i'm glad you mentioned that cos it was given to me by the wife of the UNK handicap a very important man today cos for more than
she didn't UNK
and UNK his wife runs simply delightful which is wh that's one of the things she has a shop
in UNK and that's something
didn't UNK anything that's well in today in the UNK did she
no
what's on today
it's a busy old day
well it's UNK there's racing all over the all over the country and except at UNK in scotland it's raining everywhere i'm sorry to say
racing at UNK up in scotland where it is dry nottingham cheltenham where the UNK gold cup is big card at UNK with a lot of runners and finally the all weather racing at UNK
well as john said wet and UNK everywhere unless you go very far north but those people up at UNK it's gonna be cold so you can't have everything
main meeting as we've said is cheltenham let's have the news from there
first race there twelve fifty the going at the moment is good but they have had a quarter of an inch of rain overnight so of course i suppose there's every chance it could go to good to soft by this afternoon
two important non runners there in the twelve fifty number seven far senior and in the two o'clock number thirteen the i wouldn't say old timer but UNK prince anyway shame he's not going to get a run
it is raining at the moment and it's gonna be wet and UNK but quite mild for the rest of the day
no UNK but there'll be a good crowd so get there in plenty of time
actually there's a race at eleven thirty it's a running race between members of the press and the jockeys people like peter UNK ben UNK for the press he could be the dark horse
it's over UNK as well that could be good for a laugh especially if er you don't clear them as well as you should do
erm
UNK for the press
UNK running for the press
UNK yeah
yeah
yeah is that a help or a UNK
i don't anyway this is just one of the highlights of what has been two marvellous days at the UNK meeting sponsored of course by UNK and the big race today is the fifty thousand pound UNK gold cup UNK fifteen runners over two and a half miles
UNK prince is out and general UNK is now new favourite and clear favourite
neil UNK eleven to two UNK star that has to be the favourite UNK slightly this seven to one with general idea
just looking at those prices on the screen i suppose UNK general UNK is a worthy favourite or is he
well it's a very competitive race i suppose he may have the best chance but there are an awful lot with good chances
i think he's got a great chance
i saw him around two weeks ago at UNK and er i think he'll run well
he was ten to one earlier in the week and the rain will have helped
yes i mean if it if it does go to good to soft he will like the ground
there's a couple in there that would prefer it faster
mm
erm but at that sort of price i think he's UNK
well let's see what we can oppose him with
UNK star is a very nice horse he's a UNK this one UNK horses are in tremendous form and i was talking to the man who UNK him UNK he's my next door neighbour he thinks he'll run a big race
he would be my pick i must say of them he's
the trouble is he's run he's run some marvellous races but somehow when it comes to the crunch and er in better class races he just gets just gets beat
he loves cheltenham though i mean he's had four UNK and a second
erm he's only won i admit
yeah
he's only once been beaten at cheltenham
erm another i know er i've spoken to UNK as well being the UNK jumps jockey and erm they think he's the gold cup horse well if he is he's gonna have to put in a good performance today then i'd stick with him
think he's gonna win
yeah exactly
it's a it's a very good race this and one of the good horses is a horse called general idea
now what a training performance this would be if this horse could win because he's trained by UNK and do you remember ten days ago he sent out UNK crop to win the UNK cup down in australia
well the word from ireland this week is that this horse is jumping out of its skin
the only problem is that the ground now might well have gone against this horse
but he did win the UNK plate earlier this summer
this is fast ground
at UNK and that's the problem with general idea as you say derek er if it gets UNK like at cheltenham that will be very much against him
but er it doesn't look like a UNK but it is in fact
a two mile UNK the UNK plate and general idea running really well from and express but the UNK the problem
and lighter weight as well last year and has more weight today so he's had he would have had to have improved about four or five pounds to win today
that's right
and there's very li very little between him and er the other ex irish horse second schedule
exactly
well let's have a look we've got er second schedule
now he's recently joined david UNK stable
yes that's right er i er believe in fact i know because the duke says so in the racing post today the reason he's gone there is to get adrian UNK because adrian has UNK him already in ireland and the owner wanting to stick with UNK which you can't blame him for
exactly
as david UNK said he'll be taking orders from the jockey today instead of the other way around
i don't imagine he says that very often
perhaps he's given the duke his orders
oh i'd like to do that
now well let's have a look at this horse and another schedule because as i say he was trained in ireland by arthur and er we saw them at UNK back in april where he finished second to another of his UNK today UNK hall
as they come to the final fence second schedule being pressed by UNK jane and UNK hall on the UNK and over the last second schedule and UNK hall on the UNK jane in third in fourth place is joe white and racing into the closing stages it's second schedule with UNK hall on the UNK graham UNK again as they go to the line UNK hall wins it for harry second schedule is second joe white is third UNK jane four
UNK hall doing it nicely under UNK and it's good to see him in the UNK today because he was offered the ride on UNK street but he'd already said yes and he's a man of his word and he agreed to ride this horse
and there's been a lot of UNK ha in the press about should be ride UNK street or shouldn't he
once you say yes you gotta stick to your word and UNK street good horse but has a lot of weight today
lot of weight and again it's UNK isn't it
he'd last time tried over these he wasn't at his best
erm had a run on the flat so you know i mean i think we should be but
it's a it's a very bold thing of UNK to run him in this race it seems to me you know i mean he definitely appeared to not like
yes
it's only his third run and he's in the most competitive two and a half mile chase in the year
but he UNK class and he's had a strange preparation
you mention the flat race
let's have a look at that race
it was at newmarket just a couple of weeks ago
and i can tell you he does an awful lot
here you can see him second last but making ground now
er my UNK and er is taking the lead from UNK who later ran so well in the UNK but just look at UNK street now
here he comes past one past another past yet another into third place in the end and that was an UNK good performance
no
it's a very good turn of
foot for a for a UNK isn't it though
very nice
and he very nearly won the UNK cup wasn't it
yes i think it was the UNK cup
yes mm
i seem to remember UNK has said that erm
could be the short head
i backed it with thirty three to one is that it
i remember that
trust you to remember that
now he does say he would you know he even thinks he could be a gold cup horse and UNK dawn run i mean again it's great claims this early on but er they wouldn't be running him if they didn't think he's got a chance
light would be a UNK tip wouldn't it
yeah wouldn't it just
and will like the ground
there's just got to be a bit of a stamina question mark there
mm
the connections and i know john as well are sure he get the trip
erm he will like the ground
i suppose he's every you know he's got every chance if he gets home
andy UNK horses running well
just doesn't they're running really well
mm
but it just doesn't want to get too soft because that old hill you know it does get a big of a drag
okay
we've talked about it
what's going to win the UNK
i'll go UNK star
yeah he's gotta be there
UNK lad
UNK lad
mhm
mm
well i think general UNK will win but watch out for our margaret twenty five to one
how's the betting looking UNK
well general UNK is the buzz horse this morning
victor UNK the longest eleven to two i should think he's been UNK to death in the rush
er UNK went five to one
that is being taken to good money they say it was the UNK choice yesterday the faces were all backing it yesterday
the five to one will last to the end of the ten minute guarantee at the shops it will then go four and by the general UNK could be as low as seven to two or a hundred to thirty according to UNK
hills have had erm each way for UNK and our margaret but the focus of the betting today with this rain coming at cheltenham is going to be gordon UNK general UNK and he's gonna go off a short price
is your money going to be on the favourite
er my money's gone on storm alert about ten days ago at UNK and
mm
that's almost certainly enough to nail it to the floor i would have thought
are you worried that you were obviously worried about this rain as well
er likes it likes the ground
it needs the ground
mhm
and i've said that you know i'd rather it was on the soft but whether it will get
yeah
the trip or not we'll find out this afternoon
it's gonna be a UNK good race at too
but what about the other race meetings today
let's have the early news
UNK
yes
UNK up
there's no danger of the river rising so fast it floods the course as it sometimes does but sadly as you can see rain overnight and it's raining now
and do watch out for those roadworks on the m four just by the m twenty five junction
well at nottingham as well as first race twelve forty five there's a wedding
the prospective mr and mrs martin are celebrating their wedding in a private UNK suite and as well as er entertaining their guests they're UNK the andy and tracy wedding day UNK chase
and they have a runner in
so all the very best to them
the going however whether their horse will like it or not is good from good to firm and there's a non runner in the one fifteen that's number one urgh UNK there we go
that's about a third of an inch of rain overnight and again it's gonna be wet for the rest of the day
when you go into the course follow signs for UNK park
celebrating your wedding with chase but this is UNK and it's the only dry spot in the british isles
there was no rain overnight so that the ground er is good with just a few soft places
no UNK on the roads
and the where the meeting of the day is at UNK park
first race there twelve twenty because there are eight races so an action packed good value afternoon there
an eighth of an inch of rain overnight but that shouldn't make any difference at all but a wet UNK day
no reported UNK
doesn't look a brilliant day does it UNK at the races clouds
UNK by the way tuesday third annual charity meeting in aid of the international UNK research trust
it's on tuesday sixteenth of november
a lot of local people have certainly er given UNK so should be a good day's racing
always is at UNK if you can win there you can win anywhere
but what about the guy who's won the channel four champion UNK competition for last week
let me first of all give you his name and i'll tell you what this guy's damn brilliant
it is robert from road in UNK who got an amazing a hundred and thirty points
now i say amazing let's just see where he got his winners
now that okay no problems there second and third but look at this he gave the first second and third and they didn't even have a handicap
er the looking for a UNK flight lieutenant all skill of course well you deserve that
well done robert and you get five hundred pounds
we'll have another champion UNK competition in a fortnight here on channel four which will be coming from newcastle
now let's test your UNK knowledge as we go into the commercial break
this er UNK today has been sent in by s who comes from great UNK in county down
know it well
he asks quite simply with which horses did trainer fred rival win the UNK gold cup four years running in nineteen sixty eight sixty nine seventy and seventy one
you get UNK those heads and i'll give you the answer in three minutes from now
okay did you get it right
with which horses did trainer fred rival win the UNK in sixty eight sixty nine seventy and seventy one four years running
they were UNK boy gay trip UNK and gay trip again
what an incredible performance that was
three different horses won it four years running
the late and much missed fred rival by the way i saw mercy at the horse of the year show a few weeks ago
still looking as good as ever
erm non runners non runners there were three in so far two of them were at cheltenham
they are far senior in the first in the twelve fifty and UNK prince did not run in the UNK at two o'clock
and UNK is out of the one fifteen at nottingham
any good news in the papers UNK
well derek for a change there is
and here in the sporting life there's the man who UNK gay trip to UNK victory one of his UNK terry UNK
large as life and smiling
he's been in the wars a bit since his racing career
he was one of my childhood UNK a marvellous jockey and a great chap
he's been on the UNK basically but he's kicked the habit and he says of kicking the drinking habit i've had a lot of help and a lot of good counselling in the end it's up to me
i don't want to be UNK but since march i seem to be winning
well that's great news
and a lot of people have UNK round terry UNK very popular man injured UNK fund among others and he's back in the back in the swim fully employed and in action for UNK today at er cheltenham
here in the mail peter UNK wearing his new UNK hat
pipe can still meet the gold standard
there are a lot of people saying that mike martin pipe is not the force he was etcetera but there's been a change of policy down at and if anyone thinks that pipe has lost his touch they're talking UNK
he'll be back and he might be back at working men's prices
you pay your money and you take your choice on the UNK and here j a UNK in the telegraph idea represents UNK value
he has some very harsh words for the japanese about their ban on UNK saying it's UNK and harsh in the extreme and we'll all say yes to that
er in the star UNK a star
this is UNK exclusive another one of these trainers learning to be a journalist
time some journalists learned to be trainers i think
he says
i'm convinced he's a mu this is UNK he's a much better stronger horse this season and really do think he can bring the beer money back to sussex
we will see
and here today's UNK rolling tip UNK po UNK to fulfil his promise that's paul UNK in the racing post john de UNK in the express UNK to strike his target and now here is something of which nobody can be proud UNK park south africa
this is in the sporting life and it's also in the racing post and this is a cynical move by the UNK to pick your pocket
there are five race meetings today
there are more dog cards than you shake a stick at yet the UNK are UNK this UNK from south africa through the morning
now in the first race the ten fifty number nine is called UNK wanna bet
now when you hear that mentioned in the betting shops go no and pull the plugs out of the television
we do not want to bet thank you very much on south african racing we've got quite enough of our own without the UNK
i like south africa
well you're UNK
we've got quite enough of our own without you UNK the
south UNK
now controversial stuff here in the sporting life david UNK
now jerry bailey the man who UNK ah kong this is at a press conference after the UNK cup
jerry bailey typically UNK was being asked about his success on ah kong he described how he had moved alongside a european UNK horse
he didn't know which one it was he just knew it wa was a european rider
how did he know that
the americans all UNK
bailey UNK a bit
well he replied he was kind of UNK about
and everyone laughed
well all the americans did
we didn't
that was walter UNK he was talking about
and UNK comments are backed up by the trainer derek UNK who says american jockeys are better they ride closer to the horse they're UNK and they are stronger too
there was a warm UNK of approval from the american UNK
you were there john what did you think of all that
i wasn't part of the warm UNK of approval
i don't suppose so
and mr UNK was a failed jockey in england
he ended up riding a few UNK in france so its erm although he's a good trainer now i don't think he's an authority and it's UNK er frankly
but when appear over here they're a great success
is there anything in it
oh of course they're of course they are a great success
they are top class jockeys
but our top class jockeys in america do not UNK about they use a slightly different style
admittedly they're a little bit less UNK but if you're going to say that makes a serious difference
but what's the difference in the courses
as well over here that our guys have to cope with
true
the tracks in america okay we go over there and we say they're tight they're quite difficult to ride
there's nothing like an UNK there's nothing like the variety that our jockeys have to cope with
yes
day in day out
true
and it wasn't one of ours that dropped their whip
that's true
out there so you know you can criticize
talking of the whip i mean we're only allowed to hit them five times over here
in america they seem to hit them twenty five times
and in all sorts
everywhere they want to
anywhere they want to
yeah
so but there it's a very interesting point there because a lot of our young boys now the UNK holland alan UNK are riding more the american style
it's an interesting point
i don't think he's right in what he says but i think it might have been a bit tongue in cheek as well
they certainly weren't saying it about UNK on royal UNK a couple of years back either
no but i did say about it UNK on a few weeks ago
yes
UNK when he won on
mm
and the next
very good
very good impression
talking of UNK he of course was the winner of the first ever channel four personality of the year UNK which we awarded for the first time last year
he was a guest on the morning line at newmarket and there it is that magnificent UNK which is valued at five thousand pounds
now we couldn't have him in this year to give the others a chance so this is how you voted for the nineteen ninety three racing personality of the year on channel four and let's take it in reverse order starting with the person who finished fourth
in fourth place one of the hardest working and most successful trainers in britain jack barry
he UNK nine percent
in third place the most successful jockey in the history of national hunt racing peter UNK
he UNK eleven percent
runner up the ever popular UNK
UNK received seventeen percent of the overall votes
so who did you vote for
who's the nineteen ninety three channel four racing personality of the year
it is mary UNK who UNK twenty percent
just as successful on the flat or over jumps i think this is a very worthy winner our congratulations to mary UNK and i'm gonna get her on the show and present the prize to her
if we get her on the show that really will be something cos i know she's shy but well done
UNK can be proud of her up in north yorkshire
charity UNK twenty five pounds and we came down in the car from newmarket she had the she had the post out the light everything now what's it going on
exactly
i've not UNK accused me of being UNK because of a member of the royal family this week this is not the reason but i've gone for UNK in the one twenty five at cheltenham
could a lot fitter than it did
ah
i love it
UNK what are you going for
mm
UNK i'm going for
UNK
there's a slight i mean over UNK there's a doubt about his stamina
mm
but erm he won at a huge long was it the er queen UNK
yeah
at royal UNK erm so that i'm confident he will stay and mr pipe is not dead yet
that's true
and UNK what do you fancy
what's your
er front street in a small race at nottingham
small prize big chance
cor UNK
i haven't heard of that one
general UNK is the one to be on at the big race
that's mine let's check it out
UNK is going for UNK in the two thirty five cheltenham UNK going for UNK that's the top weight in the first at one twenty five er oh in the second
UNK going for front street at nottingham number five in the two twenty UNK going for general UNK in the two o'clock at cheltenham
picture UNK
picture UNK
can you work out today's picture UNK
this horse is running somewhere today
okay
i wonder where
i promise three extra ice UNK
a day now will you please come on the set
something to do miss er UNK i wonder where that's running today
o eight nine one double nine double one double four win a hundred pound do you win a copy of this book
this is the william hill racing dates
it's a smashing book that graham UNK brought out
what's the date today chaps
november the thirteenth
peter UNK a five timer at UNK in nineteen ninety two
eighteen eighty nine the UNK selling plate at derby was declared void after the whole field got lost in the thick fog covering the course and ended up running round the back of a cricket UNK
have you been round the back of a cricket UNK recently
no
but there was a one day in which UNK nick UNK erm brought all the tail UNK across and had been told the one thing he shouldn't do was be last he was thinking i'm not last and behind you then he came in front of him and he was last
i love it
lovely story
anyway that's it from the morning line
i'm off to UNK they're off to cheltenham and everywhere else
we'll see you next saturday
we'll give you the result of picture UNK then
till then from all of us bye
see you next week
in europe er product
so we have an established base
now obviously in UNK and in the city erm and as i said to you we've recently opened er an office in leeds er to base our expansion in the north and up into scotland
erm well over a hundred staff and growing
erm a comprehensive er training centre in all locations and a team of professional consultants
where are we
i mean any anybody services which is probably the background we came from success on wall street
er we now have applications in production areas in all those er in all those
we own the street i think was the er one of the advertising campaigns that ran in america
eighteen of the top twenty two market in the in the u s a use
not just use but have built their whole company i t strategy around
er nearer to home we've recently have adopted a similar strategy of making their
in the commercial names such as and are implementing solutions throughout their whole store network
their manufacturing plant and process control depends entirely on products
we've inherited from the states and er UNK throughout the u k and into europe
government er for us in the u k and representations within er within the audience
erm customs and excise and charity commission they're not just users again they've chosen as a strategic partner for database development
er and yes there's even a UNK from
solutions applications from UNK erm you'll hear more from one of er systems integration and product developers later on in the day
we have our erm developing products
we don't we don't sell applications but we develop the products on technology er in all those areas
what i'd like to do now is hand over to UNK er europe talking to you the client server strategy and where we are today with our products
UNK
what i'd like to do for the next twenty minutes of the er of the seminar is talk about client server today
as UNK already mentioned started back in nineteen eighty five and delivered its first products in eighty seven
it was fairly erm revolutionary at the time in the fact it was really adopting a client server approach in network computing and it was the first way to do that
so what i'd like to do is just discuss with you what we believe client server is as a combination of hardware and software and the architecture for delivering a client server solution
at the end of this part of the presentation we'll also see a short UNK which erm UNK the experiences of one of customers using this architecture
when we talk about the online enterprise what really mean is the business needs of organizations in the nineteen nineties
and we believe there are several of them
one is the need for applications
traditionally database management systems have been excellent at decision support
however they have had to prove their worth for online transaction processing
they were good at UNK reporting on data through a relational model but has really delivered online transaction processing when it came to the market back in ninety eighty seven with its multi UNK server architecture
what the customer's always looking for is distributed UNK systems which means that the software that they are investing in is an architecture which is portable
so is an architecture which runs across multiple different types of hardware on server machines plus multiple such as desktop devices and across lots of UNK networks
so we can really protect your investment in your present hardware infrastructure
something that a lot of other open systems vendors propose is a big bang approach to UNK to that type of architecture away from UNK systems
is very different in that it proposes a UNK and UNK approach towards open systems
we can UNK with your present hardware and software environments
now that's something which is unique to
so we're not proposing that you turn off the mainframe on friday and turn on your UNK or open systems machines with your database on it on monday
we're proposing that you integrate your presently existing investments in hardware and software and move over time
and enables you to move your UNK over a time as well
all of these things are really integrated through definition of a client server relational database management system and that's what i'd really like to describe now
just to underline what i what i was saying
when we talk about online we're talking about the ability for the software infrastructure to support decision support and transaction processing
and just because the software you're using can do transaction processing it doesn't mean it can do decision support
they're very different requirements
traditionally with relational database management systems companies would batch load data from the mainframe on maybe a once a day or once a week basis and load that information onto the database systems and use it for decision support
we're talking about integrating both of those distinct and different requirements
this slide really sums up the mission or the goal of which is the integration of yo all your information resource
if you look at the blue line in the middle of the slide then look to your right each of those erm UNK represents a source or service provider a server on the network
so for instance you may have already have a relational database management system it may or may not be but that information exists as a service or service provided on the network
there will also be non relational data
over ninety percent of the world's data is indeed not held in a relational database and it may not be appropriate for all forms of information
so for instance you may have real time
if you're a financial institution that might be or data and if you're a manufacturing plant it might be process control information on p l cs on the shop floor
you'll also have application services so in the office it might be UNK or you may have e d i talking to your suppliers
certainly applications
these are applications which you wrote ten years ago and they may have been written in a an old like UNK but they meet a business need and if they're meeting the business need day in day out then why should you replace them
so all of these things are service providers and provide information on the network
and goal or mission is to enable you to integrate that information UNK and deliver it to the desktop in a form which is appropriate to all of the users in the enterprise
so we for instance will enable you to use decision support tools against any of that information in a UNK manner
and that's not jus just decision support tools from that's decision support from any of over two hundred front end vendors which link into the architecture
you can really choose the best of the tools and technology for the best users
we'll also talk about the ability to integrate the information to application development through online transaction processing applications and the UNK at the bottom representing software which i've just mentioned
tools like lotus one two three like microsoft UNK paradox UNK the list goes on
if we go back to the nineteen seventies or the early eighties and look at how we developed applications we take an old language like maybe UNK as an example
we might define the way we that application as four logical components
and that's on a host based system on one machine
those components would be presentation services which is the man machine interface or the way the application looks on the screen
that might be a thirty two seventy screen on a on a mainframe it might be a g u i p c on a desktop
behind that there'll be presentation logic which defines the way that the screen UNK based on user input
so if i press erm a function key on the keyboard what happens next on the screen if i click the mouse on a certain UNK on the screen what happens next
but the fundamental part of any application is what we call the transaction integrity logic or the business rules which actually model the way you want to do business
which model your enterprise
so you look you look analysis of design er come up with er sort of UNK functions which you need to model inside the applications
and that's what we're talking about by transaction integrity logic
that's fundamental
and that becomes the UNK for requests for information for the data access mechanism whatever that happens to me be
it might be a it might be a relational database management system it might even be a UNK system
it could be any source of information within that application
so the challenge in the eighties was to say how you best split that processing of the application across the network to take advantage of the processing power and the UNK of the server machines the processing power and the strengths of the desktop device as well as UNK the network traffic between those two types of er hardware
traditionally other open systems vendors have taken this approach which is to say we'll have the entire application on the desktop and we'll UNK the server resource on a server hardware machine
so we'll have a single s twelve query server a relational database management system which can be UNK from the applications on the database
now there's a number of disadvantages to this traditional approach
one is the performance aspect because every time we need to access the relational database across the network we have to send a large piece of UNK logic a piece of s q l code across the network and that could be significant in size
we may have many hundreds of clients UNK that database all passing over large pieces of code and obviously this four g l code is not a message based protocol it is in fact a language which we're using in the wrong manner
so we can have a network UNK with many users
but also the database is passive it never knows which client is going to communicate with it next
it takes requests as and when they turn up and the server deals with them and res returns the results back to the client that requested that information
but the s q l code which is sent to it has to be interpreted when it gets to the server machine and we all know the difference between compiled and interpreted code
but the real disadvantage to this approach is in terms of the control of maintenance because as we've already said you'll have done analysis and design on these UNK but fundamental business functions which UNK inside the application
if we decide to change the way we do business or change the way the application works on how it models our environment then we have to revisit using this architecture every single client machine on the network and upgrade that particular business function
now if you've got many hundreds of clients on the network that's a significant effort in terms of maintaining the code
and if that piece of code is fundamental to the application it may UNK in several different UNK within that code
so maintenance is a burden of this approach
but also control
if for instance erm fred UNK at the end of the office is sick on friday he turns off his p c at lunchtime and goes home and we do the software upgrade during the afternoon on friday then his p c won't get the upgrade to the software because we're sending it down the network
on monday morning everybody starts UNK data into the database through the application interface and UNK in data at fifteen percent v a t everybody else is UNK in the data at seventeen and a half percent v a t so we're looking at a two and a half percent margin
now there's no way of telling inside the database where that incorrect data has come from
in fact we've lost the integrity of the database without knowing how we can resolve that
so we have a an application control and maintenance burden and problem with this architecture
so back in nineteen eighty seven looked at the application models of client server and network computing and said how can we better address the needs of client server
and this is the architecture which all the products are based on
the client server software architecture from was revolutionary
and it has been proved to be the way to do client server software with all of the other major vendors now moving towards this type of implementation
so relational database is intelligent and UNK
it's not only a UNK for relational data it's also a UNK for each of your business rules and business functions
so every er each UNK business function is stored in a central UNK which can be UNK by each application on the desktop
so first of all performance is greatly improved cos we now have the s q l or four g l code stored inside the server and we send a message based protocol across the network a small request to UNK that UNK routine or function from the UNK and return the results
so we've greatly improved network performance and removed the UNK of the of the network
but also the code which UNK on the server or the server actually knows in advance now what all of those transactions and pieces of code are therefore it can UNK that code
so again you have the difference between compiled s q l and interpreted s q l but again the major advantage of this approach is in application maintenance and control
a major customer did er a bench mark recognizing that sixty percent of any project cost was taken up by maintenance of the code after it went live
so they actually bench marked the maintenance phase of the project and found this approach to be three hundred percent more productive than the approach we showed on the previous slide
because if i want to change a business rule rather than me visiting every single client on the network and UNK that code i will re revisit it once on the server
that the code is UNK and is UNK and is UNK
if i change it once in one place only then automatically every program on the network is using the new version of the business rule
so we have an extra control mechanism and maintenance and no version control issue
so that's the er the architecture that is proposing to deliver client server
a step back in time over the last five years of what has been delivering and there are many thousands of customers using in that manner
each of the UNK on this slide represents the four key components of that architecture in terms of the software er products
the top right hand corner UNK the circle with a UNK in it represents multi UNK sql server
that is the database with the UNK for business rules
top left represents sql life cycle tools which are tools which have has been delivering for the last three years which address each of the needs of the entire project life cycle
it includes case tools it includes four g UNK report writers end user tools UNK operation control
so we can really address all of the project life cycle with own front end client development tools
but that is a choice which you make
is noted for its UNK
erm i've already talked about there are over two hundred front end tools which access or have integration with the database
so the UNK in the bottom left hand corner represents open client a p i open client application UNK interface
now for instance using that a p i could write a piece of c code a piece of three g l which could access the database as if it was local to my machine on the client
the open client a p i would make the network UNK
it wouldn't exist as far as the UNK was concerned
now that in itself is not unique what is unique is because of our relationships with people like microsoft who actually o e m and UNK and o s two then many of the p c and desktop four g m and tools vendors have UNK themselves behind that a p i
so we have a wealth of choice for you as customers in terms of for instance using tools which you're familiar with which you've already invested in
i'm not expecting you to invest in new technology to take advantage of this architecture
the bottom right hand corner represents another product which is unique to which is the open server p i
the open server UNK interface is almost a
tool kit for writing UNK to other data sources
so it enables me to integrate other UNK data sources into the architecture
take for example e d i or UNK
using the open server i can integrate UNK into the architecture represented by this diagram
and because it has open server in front of it from the client's side it looks like a server so any of those two hundred clients or any of front end tools can have access to the UNK system as if it was a resource or server
so i can for instance use erm paradox or use UNK as a front end to access and send UNK or e d i messages
so those are two third party tools that are integrated using client server architecture
but on top of being able to access any information resource inside your organization using open server also deliver a set of off the shelf gateway products to integrate with other relational database systems
so we can provide you with off the shelf UNK which integrate these sources into the architecture from UNK r d b r m s d b two UNK etcetera
so we can actually integrate most of the erm dominant relational databases that are out there or in your organization into this architecture to protect your investment in those technologies
one of UNK one of the er the UNK i just mentioned was the open server for UNK and the mainframe integration
approach is to work with people like i b m in fact you may have seen in the press er this week the announcement of a strategic relationship between and i b m and we will talk about that briefly a bit later
but that is an UNK of client server architecture
so we're not proposing that you turn off the mainframe on friday and turn on open systems on monday
we're saying let's integrate the mainframe let's take advantage of the processing that it can do and its er strengths and ye let's use it as a server which is available on a network in a client server architecture
so open server for UNK is an a p i an application UNK interface which allows us to get at s q l data on d b two s q l but also allows us to get at any another database or application system which UNK in
so you can really integrate any information which UNK on the mainframe
that's just one example of the gain with solutions i've just mentioned
at the beginning of the presentation i said that has really erm grown through recognition of its leading edge technology and its leading edge relational database management systems
we consider database to be online because it has a number of distinct features UNK
enterprise capacity performance is the ability to do transaction processing in a relational database
but not just for one or ten users but in a UNK manner for a hundred or many thousands of users
so we have a UNK solution
server enforced integrity we've already talked about the need for holding the business rules in a central UNK with the data to protect that information but also to allow you to control the overall client server architecture much more tightly
application UNK obviously very important
if we're talking about using this UNK er type of system for running mission critical systems where if the database goes down the business stops running and starts losing money then we need to be able to run twenty four hours a day seven days a week
is designed to enable you to do that and in fact who are a key partner of actually o e m and retail on the hardware as s q l two thousand
and if you're not familiar with they are a fairly extensive and fault UNK hardware for ultimate twenty four hour a day seven day a week operation
that's a very good UNK of erm online capabilities
and finally what we're also going to be talking about today is online distributed database management systems as we move towards enterprise wide client server which we'll talk about in a lot more depth in the following presentations
then we'll talk about how is delivering UNK distributed UNK to enable you to use client server at the enterprise wide level
these have been the building blocks of client server
what i'd like to do now is erm show you a short video snap from a customer
there's many thousands of customers using worldwide
one of those is which is er a financial institution in the city
and they're a strategic partner
so what i'd like to do without further UNK is move onto the video and show you a recommendation for products
i know it looks as though he was being UNK in a prison cell
erm i'd like to assure you that wasn't in fact the case
erm the project erm that he referred to there has in fact now gone live and erm partly as a result of that are now investing further in products by implementing a range of new projects on that same architecture
as it says i'm john i'm marketing director for northern europe with
what UNK and UNK have done so far is really tell you where stands today
but the main objective of the seminar is to show what we see as the route forward
particularly to show how we're addressing the growing need for integrated information systems right across the enterprise
and we propose to do that by extending the traditional model of client server computing the essentially departmental solution across the enterprise to integrate multiple computer systems across multiple
so my aim here is to talk about how we will address these needs which we see emerging er at an increasing pace through the nineties
i think probably many of you are familiar with the concepts that UNK described and what those concepts what the client server approach has done is to really bring about quite a revolutionary new breed of systems since the term was first UNK in fact by in ninety eighty seven
in fact although sometimes the rate of progress or the pace of technology seems sort of UNK slow if you look at what has actually changed what has been achieved over the last five years it's quite incredible
the systems UNK user UNK the concept of database management systems UNK of information which are accessible and UNK are really taken for granted in many organizations
but of course this technology software or hardware and indeed our requirements are not standing still
we're ready we believe to move forward from delivering primarily the solutions through to the next stage which is what we've termed enterprise wide client server
and this next stage really offers some potentially huge benefits because what it can allow is the integration of the corporate information systems and the requirements of the corporation as a whole to manage and exploit its information resource
with the requirements needs and preferences of individual departments and individual users
so it promises to bridge the gap that still in fact exists in many if not most organizations between what happens at the local and individual level and what's happening at the corporate level
if we look at this client server model today one of the most significant advantages it UNK is that it allows us to run different kinds of applications on different computers
it means we've been able to choose the most appropriate hardware for the job
to take advantage of new technology as it comes along while still protecting and preserving our existing hardware investments
but in fact of course it's also there to UNK because either perhaps individual departments have UNK that freedom of choice to build systems
that they want to use and operate and to UNK any benefits that they require
but it hasn't really UNK into the issue of how we can control and operate and exploit the total environment
benefits i think have been within the architecture is that m i s can now be more responsive to the users needs
for the users they can be more productive by UNK the of choice
and hopefully the business as a whole in a competitive environment they can be more responsive more flexible to new requirements as they come along
now as UNK has already shown the client server software market is now seen as a backward growing sector of the software industry because client server has effectively become the standard way of UNK new systems
and in fact nineteen ninety three is really something of a UNK year because according to at the beginning of ninety three probably something like forty percent of new applications built using the client server model
and this is going to rise to fifty percent by year end and as high as sixty five percent nineteen ninety five
and some research by foreign suggested that whilst this sector is worth a mere seven hundred million dollars a day by nineteen ninety six the client server software market will reach seven point five billion dollars in size
which is a growth of erm ten fold over three or four years
but the more important question is why and to what benefit er this change might occur
well increasingly we see that organizations are recognizing that effective use of information as a corporate resource UNK and UNK as a whole can be of a tremendous competitive advantage and the client server has become the most effective way of UNK and UNK that resource
and of course has established itself as a leading player in this industry
we defined the model and we solved a generation ago many of the technology issues surrounding client server such as and so on that erm other software suppliers are now pushing to catch up on
but to fully achieve this potential for client server into the future across the enterprise raises for us some really quite difficult new challenges and demands for the software environment
as i've already UNK at even with our products and products most of our customers today in fact are implementing departmental systems
the departmental systems maybe mission critical in other words they may be important to them you know they may be necessary to doing business to getting out orders or what have you
they may be quite large an volume in terms of transaction rates or users
but typically they're dedicated to achieving a single business goal
or settlements or what have you
and so we still see separate departmental systems growing up and central i s groups not necessarily well integrated and well in control of this new generation of client server systems
in other words we've effectively UNK the island of information that we used to talk about five years ago and the key motivation behind enterprise client server is really to integrate the efforts of these two groups
because UNK of business my be a correct and fashionable philosophy or perhaps one that is no longer fashionable i don't know it still needs we believe a global approach a coherent approach to tie these things together so the organization can not only get the benefit of UNK and flexibility at a departmental but the leverage to exploit that information on behalf of the organization as a whole
so the key requirement here is accurate and UNK information available across the enterprise to the desktop of the users or the management which can potentially reflect the whole business requirements
and that's really the ultimate objective of enterprise client server
now as we move from the departmental model to the enterprise model of client server computing quite a few things to change
at the departmental level we might have ten a hundred possibly a thousand users but when we go enterprise wide there may be thousands or many tens of thousands of users
our users will no longer be UNK erm situated in building one country one department
they're likely to be geographically dispersed nationally or internationally
and whereas with departmental approach we may have been satisfied with the ability to do UNK down from our corporate mainframe systems in the enterprise approach we'll look for proper and full integration of the mainframe as an integral part of the environment
in the departmental model as i've already said and often we will typically be looking at a single sweep of requirements a single business function
essentially a stand alone area of the business
but ultimately those sectors of the business need to be integrated so our enterprise systems will be integrated corporate wide across mo multiple departmental functions
we may have been able to buy our departmental systems from a single vendor
a server here and a few clients there UNK in between and the systems may have been relatively small in terms of their total hardware capacity
but in the
enterprise model it is inevitable that our information will be coming from multiple vendors and our data will be in UNK data sources
there will be multiple databases erm databases relational databases mainframe databases and external
and also we will encounter new types of users new erm and users will be different in terms of their erm literacy if you like
they will be different in terms of the sort of interaction they expect to have with computer depending on whether they're data entry people or management users and maybe some of our users are people in the street our customers er who will increasingly become users of systems themselves
so whereas in the past we may have been able to think of single user types and single solutions to meet those users
using single devices be they UNK or erm perhaps microsoft windows in the future we'll need to UNK deal with the different categories of users and the different devices they have to deal with
and don't forget that our users may not even speak the same language as we take our systems enterprise wide
so in UNK to architecture we're very much focused on what are the real world problems and the real challenges that we need to face to deliver effective and UNK solutions
and we need we need to make sure that we don't embark upon this new plan based on a whole pile of UNK which in fact er lie in a world of fantasy
er this erm world of fantasy is a very wonderful place because in this world it's very easy to meet UNK i t requirements
it's certainly UNK by some and it's certainly UNK by some
of course in fantasy land it's very easy to build computer systems
once you've built your computer system it will run all the time certainly all the time
all the data will live in a nice tidy fashion in a single relational database but what happens
in fantasy land there are no politics so everyone can quite happily agree on how to things and agree on common
and we can impose solutions on our on our users you know you users can all have p cs you can all have erm dumb UNK
we can decide what you want to use
in fantasy land if we ever have to replace our systems we can of course simple switch off the old one and switch on the new one
and er in fantasy land erm if you're responsible for i t you're of course very secure in your job you're a very happy employee because vendors will always come along and solve all your problems and ensure your personal security and success
well we hope that erm by coming here you've demonstrated that you don't live in fantasy land so i'd like to welcome you to the real world and in the real world we know that open systems despite the progress they've made still struggle to replace the mainframe
and even where they have the technology capabilities to start doing this there is clearly little point in replacing an existing system with a new one which simply does the same thing
even though open systems may be able to meet requirements at a lower cost than perhaps the traditional UNK systems if you've already paid for the traditional UNK system clearly there is no saving to be made by throwing it away and replacing it with the equivalent UNK on new technology
in the real world there is undoubtedly no such thing as an organization of any size or substance that can say all my data lives in one source
we actually erm sometimes conduct a little informal surveys in our seminars and meetings as to how many information sources exist in organizations
and these sources will be things like spreadsheets relational databases our own and our competitors and filing systems like r m s er i m s er databases whatever
the answer is never one the minimum we've come across in an organization is two the typical is five to ten and in some organizations it's going on fifteen
and the number is not likely to reduce as the scope of UNK and as we're offered new technologies software technologies by vendors
in the real world our users have different requirements and are not going to be slow to tell us what they are
in the real world systems and networks fail so there are times when our systems are not available
and that may be okay in a departmental level but when i had an integrated global enterprise operating in integrated fashion around an integrated i t system then clearly i cannot afford to allow a failure to actually UNK the system
of course i have to say that er software fails as well sometimes and indeed one of the problems we all have is that with today's hardware technologies some of the er computers are so fast that it really reaches the bugs rather quicker
erm there still is no way of designing and managing distributed systems
i've actually taken something of an interest in this over the years and there's no substantive which tells you how to UNK and plan a distributed system in terms of what you do when
and the final point is that vendors will not be able to solve your problem
the decision you make today about which vendor you go with and which technology you go with may be the right decision today and yet may be the wrong decision tomorrow
you only have to look back over what's er happened over the last few years in terms of for example o s two microsoft windows a variety of UNK and you'll see that technologies will come along and however sound a decision you make at one point in time the market circumstances and potentially mean that what was right for you then not the right
this is the world we have to live with and find a way
so we can view the requirements for enterprise client server really in terms of some UNK and the UNK arise because of the conflict between what we actually want to achieve and the constraints of the real world
we would like to have well proven technology because our systems need to be reliable
and yet we want to be able to exploit new opportunities and new technologies as they come along to get the best out of our systems for our businesses
we will want to be able to build high capacity systems so going to take on the class of applications that have traditionally been associated with a mainframe
and one interesting thing is that as we integrate that system as we double the number of users our requirements the loading on our system may go up by a factor of four
it's kind of an UNK relationship about systems bigger
in fact i've often said that if you show me a system which doesn't have a performance problem then you've shown me a system which is a failure
because successful systems attract more use and more workload
so we need to build our systems to meet the requirements we have today because we couldn't justify more and yet we have to build in the scale UNK so that systems can grow to meet the growing requirements which are almost inevitable
the systems need to be capable of integrating and inter operating with these different technologies
so they need to provide UNK access across technologies and deal with the multi vendor requirements
in fact er dan who is the president of the corporation which is one of the sort of user pressure groups in the open systems world has said that integration is the highest cost component of nay i t system
for every dollar you spend on software he UNK that you'll spend between one and a half and two dollars simply on getting that software to work the other software you have
in other words perhaps fifty percent of the spending on i t is wasted in inverted commas because it's simply concerned with tying together what you already have with the new stuff that you want to integrate in
the systems have got to deliver data UNK otherwise they're not of any value at all and yet they're going to have to deal with UNK events such as network failure software failures hardware failures user failures or whatever
and we want to be able to provide the UNK that we achieve traditionally through UNK in the mainframe environment in what will inevitably be a distributed world
and our systems need to be consistent because in that way we can manage and control them and yet they need to deal with the variable requirements of our different categories of users
so we'd like our systems to be low risk to be UNK to be inter UNK to be reliable UNK and yet still be able to face all the challenges of the of the enterprise client server environment
so that's really the challenges which way the client UNK and what today's er event is about
in the second half we'll be describing how our er new generation of products really seek to address each of those challenges
summary the system architecture which is the focus of today's seminar is really an er a complete environment within which we can deal with the challenges of this new generation of enterprise client server applications
and the underlying here is to provide the control and UNK
we've achieved our er our aim in the first half of the seminar
leading on to the second half i'd er very quickly like to introduce you to UNK er from er one of the u k's if in fact er worldwide now leading er leading developers of financial software and he will be er talking to th talking through to you his experiences er in developing with
thank you
thank you UNK
er good morning ladies and gentlemen
i'd like to spend erm a few minutes hopefully not too long because i'm er known for talking for hours and hours when it comes to our company and our product but hopefully just a few minutes telling you about our approach to developing an open accounting system
if we go back about two years a little bit more than two years now we sat down and considered those areas which were most important to us in developing a new accounting package
first of all we wanted that product to be totally open and i'll qualify in a minute or two a little bit more what i mean by totally open
i think at the moment suffice to say we wanted a product that would give ourselves and our users total choice and total flexibility
it was important to us in developing a new system now that we are very much of a worldwide supplier of accounting solutions that we make it truly UNK in all countries of the world
now i UNK to come up with a good word or phrase to describe that but the one we use for now is UNK
and i'll go into that area in a little bit more detail in a few minutes
it should be a totally integrated solution both from the point of view of the accounting application itself and also the way that we inter operate with the other applications in a user organization
we were conscious as well that in UNK into this brave new UNK world that accountants being fairly boring individuals i mean how many accountants do i have in the audience today
i can say that reasonable safely and i can apologize to those people who put their hands up by saying that i too am c am an accountant by background and it's fairly brave of me to admit that in front of so many i t people
but we were conscious that an accounting system UNK the corporate financial information and we must protect the integrity of that information
so we must UNK those erm opportunities for security within UNK and ensure that our application will maintain the integrity of data within the system
and finally and i can't emphasize this strongly enough in developing our open accounting product we developed a totally new application
we started with a clean sheet of paper we didn't start with one of our earlier UNK products and try and convert that to UNK try to move that into the open systems world
our approach to accounting has always been one of a truly integrated nature and that approach fits like a hand in a UNK with relational database technology
so the arrival and use of relational databases has been absolutely perfect for our approach to development of accounting systems
i mentioned a moment ago that we seek er total choice and total flexibility in the UNK open systems world
and the only true way that we can achieve that and that we can deliver that is by UNK to the emerging industry standards
now on this slide we have a UNK there are six probably important UNK in terms of standards which we should follow or adopt in the development of the product
if i start at the top with the user interface then clearly we should use or employ a UNK user interface
in developing a product these days everybody's been very used to using p cs using UNK user UNK the idea of a mouse drop down menus so on and so forth and we should employ that technology
and the standard we chose ooh some two years ago was o s f UNK
now that has clearly been the right choice given that i think UNK has clearly achieved the UNK over open look
moving round the picture UNK
well we should use x UNK standards and at the moment if a network UNK to t c p i p as the communications protocol then we can work with that
and we'll actually look in a minute or two at the different aspects of the application the different layers of the product and how those communicate
on documents we must bear in mind with the development of any system that we should support true electronic data UNK
we should have a good and straightforward mechanism for UNK documents into our system and exporting documents from our system
and the standard we've chosen to adopt there is UNK
now that's probably er one of the least well defined areas for standards and i mean if you say UNK to er a north american user they'll look a bit puzzled if you say it to somebody who knows something about UNK they'll say which UNK standard is that
but er those are gradually UNK and we believe that's the correct choice
on operating systems we wanted to be as truly hardware independent as we can so we have chosen to operate potentially under any UNK operating system so that gives us all the UNK or UNK of UNK and a number of UNK mid range operating systems which are achieving UNK compliance as time goes by
even i b m have stated that o s four hundred on the a s four hundred will be UNK erm oh certainly within the next twelve months if not somewhat earlier now
far more UNK to today's conversations and our host is the question of databases
as i identified a minute or two ago our approach to UNK accounting applications fits hand in UNK with the concept of relational database
we need a relational database to store our accounting data in and whilst our overall approach is that we will work with potentially UNK s q l UNK relational database i would like to emphasize that has been our primary development environment over the last two years
and as a brief but final point on there what language did we develop our product in
because we are er developers of a core accounting package which we hope will have many hundreds of users before the end of this decade we didn't want to rely on the vendor of a particular four g l so we've written our product in c to retain that independence within there
so we've identified a number of standards which we work within standards for operating system for database and for user
interface
and those lead very clearly into another technology client server architecture which we've already touched on a number times during our presentation so far this morning
and i'd like to explain since we find ourselves in the real world rather than fantasy land how we've approached the subject of client server
if we start off by considering the accounting application as an object developed in c sitting there in the middle of the screen we need the ability to talk to the users through a UNK user interface
we need the ability to address the relational database in which we hold our data
and delivered as an integral part of the application are two utilities to give us as much flexibility in achieving that goal as possible
in terms of the user interface we have an x UNK and controller UNK as we UNK know it by erm in order to talk to the user through the users desktop device
now we're conscious that there are a number of desktop devices available to us today and i'll go into these a little bit more in a moment and that we want to support UNK users of many different type of device
and in using UNK and using potentially x UNK as the most UNK method of delivering that UNK we can control x and we can UNK x on certain other types of device
looking at the database our UNK in writing the central application and in developing and UNK that application are at one level totally independent at the functional level are totally independent of the underlying database technology
and our database controller understand and knows and talks to the database layer at the bottom
so if that database for example is there is no constraint within the way we use our system or the way we develop our system or indeed the way our system will develop in the future and the way capabilities will develop in the future
because we're using our database controller to read and to write that database as more function becomes available more features become available within the server the ideas of UNK and so on an so forth as time goes by we will be able to exploit that technology or more importantly you as users will be able to exploit that technology
i think the concept i want to get across is that the design of the application does not UNK the way that you implement firstly a client server technology and secondly the use of your chosen relational database management system
so by UNK these individual items of the application the presentation layer the application layer and the database layer we i suppose to say we don't care is the wrong word we don't mind how much client server or how little client server you want your particular application to be
and indeed if we UNK the picture out a little bit and we've talked about the user interface and the relational database clearly an accounting system can't stand alone
at the left hand side of my diagram we have a number of other applications existing in your environment which need to either provide information to the accounting system a simple example might be a payroll application passing payroll costs across on a batch basis it may be a sales order processing system passing invoice information across in real time UNK and indeed requesting information from the accounting application
so we have a powerful set er of open access tools to truly integrate the n application with the other systems running in your environment
and finally to complete this particular picture picking up again on a theme that was introduced earlier on we are using UNK relational database technology so there are many other tools which are available to you for example the ability of lotus one two three to go directly into the database pull information out present it in a spreadsheet present it UNK
many other tools many other applications for example forest and trees which are all capable of directly UNK the database
so the application is concerned with maintaining the accounting data and maintaining the integrity of that data but you have absolute flexibility in the tools that you use to access it and UNK it and present it in your organization
and the way that you do that is going to depend on the sort of device which you have on your desk
now again because of our approach we don't mind what kind of device you use
UNK the most er UNK delivery of an o s f UNK type UNK user interface is through an x windows terminal but i wouldn't imagine very many of many of you have x windows UNK
they tend to be fairly large and fairly expensive devices
we see an awful lot of people have got a tremendous investment in traditional character cell UNK and by a character cell terminal i mean a dumb terminal of twenty four lines of eighty characters
erm i if i was talking to an audience in the united states you'd probably have a somewhat different approach cos over there they seem to throw their desktop devices away every two or three years and replace them with brand new technology
in the u k we seem to keep the equipment for twenty years and then complain if it goes wrong before we have to throw it away
so on a character cell terminal through our x UNK and controller we can deliver a
UNK style user interface even on a character terminal
clearly the degree of definition we can go to is only one character but we have drop down menus we have the ability to move pop up windows and UNK boxes the ability to UNK and UNK within those windows and the ability to UNK the use of a mouse by the use of arrow keys and the UNK on an ordinary character terminal
so we can deliver a consistent UNK user interface across a number of different devices in your organization used UNK with the accounting application
and in between the p c which we find on many peoples UNK may be UNK a character terminal may be UNK erm an x terminal to provide that user interface to an individual
now i think in our experience so far we find that erm the accounts clerks in the back office are those who are most likely to be UNK away at the character UNK those are the people who are UNK data into the system
and they understand those devices and work with them very well they're not particularly interested in a mouse and all sorts of UNK facilities because their job in life is to get information quickly into and quickly out of the system
many people in a management position maybe using p cs on their desk i mean those move more and more into the organization as people work with spreadsheet people work with electronic mail and so on and so forth and the ability to use the p c as their terminal their window into the accounting application but secondly they have these tools such as spreadsheets which again are able to directly access the database and the accounting data maintained within it
so in performing a particular query there are many ways of UNK a cat
somebody may use standard enquiry facilities within the accounting system they may use the report writing tools that are provided with the accounting system or they may use other things forest and trees lotus UNK so on and so forth which run on their p c which they know and which they love
and it may be entirely appropriate to use any one of those for one style of enquiry depending on the preferences of the individual that's what we mean by flexibility and freedom of choice we don't want to UNK a particular individual to working in a certain way
i can't resist the temptation while i'm here just to tell you one or two things about the accounting application
er because i don't have a group of accountants in front of me i'm not going to go on about UNK and credits and so on and so forth
but just to consider one or two aspects which we mentioned earlier on as being important to us
in working in years gone by with UNK applications we've been able to rely to a large extent on security facilities provided by the operating system
we can no longer UNK do that in the open systems world
so we need to ensure that we provide security at a number of levels accounting type security which may be er the limit to the amount i can write off in a cash in a cash matching process for example
functional security which is going to give me effectively er access restriction to the system by the menu options the drop down menu choices
taking that level of security down to individual data items what areas of my chartered account can i update what areas can i look at
and that's important to us because we can give erm people who are responsible for a particular department full and immediate access to the data which relates only to their department and not the wider organization
but we do need to consider a couple of other areas
one which i've defined there with the word views
we are aware that we can control the method of access by users though our application but there are other tools they are using in the company to access the corporate relational database and your database controller must be aware of those tools and implement the same controls on those views of that information within the database
and very importantly to the accountant the way that we can ensure that we maintain the integrity of the accounting data is by UNK techniques in the database to ensure that the only valid way of u of updating the accounting data is through the accounting application and that's it's therefore properly secure and properly audit UNK
i mentioned culture briefly earlier on er i'd like to define that a little bit better by saying we want a user sitting down in any part of the world to be able to use the product which we develop and feel that it is an accounting application developed for their world and their market place
not an american product which is being bent to their requirements not an english product which is being bent to their requirements
and there are immediately two areas which are very obvious and straightforward those of currency and language
we must for example be able to use UNK users of the same accounting information in many different languages
but we need to take our consideration beyond that a little way in thinking about the accounting customs and legal requirements of the different countries
the taxation needs it's not just v a t it varies in the european community it where it varies in a wider europe and the world at a whole
so we need to be able to address those different requirements
and one which we o often UNK was dealing
properly with the different banking requirements of other parts of the world
i mean back in the early nineteen eighties when we sold our first er system abroad we were quite surprised to find out that the french didn't have a road called UNK road and an organization called b a c s on it
we need to ensure that we can comply with the banking mechanisms of the different parts of the world
another strength of using UNK relational database technology is that we can use many report writers which are available to access that database not only the accounting data but potentially all of the corporate data to pull out not only accounting reports but reports which combine information as necessary partly from the accounting system partly from the sales order processing system partly from the UNK system whatever they may be
and so within our accounting database we'll have various types of master file information transactions balances some of that information may have been UNK but still be available to us
with a single relational report writer we can gain ready and easy access to all of that information
a very brief commercial just a little bit about
erm i mean is a british private limited company
erm i'm actually based in our harrogate office which is our corporate worldwide headquarters we consider that to be the centre of the universe
but over the years as an organization we've grown UNK and geographically quite significantly such that while in the u k we're in harrogate and UNK we have an ever increasing presence in north america europe the far east and UNK
and our philosophy as a truly worldwide supplier of accounting software is that we should increase our presence in different parts of the world as our sales and marketing activity there merits it
we've seen a very controlled and steady growth over the thirteen years that we've been in business and i think as you can see there year on year we have consistently increased turnover and increased profitability
so to give you an idea of our size although we may be a little bit smaller than last year we turned over some eighteen million pounds and declared a profit before tax of just over three point one million pounds
one of my slides that didn't appear there erm we're just going to mention one or two other points on erm our customer base
now the open systems world is a very new world to us we have three earlier UNK products the first of which we started selling in nineteen eighty
and we actually have more than eight hundred and fifty users of our accounting software installed in more than forty countries worldwide
and to tie in to a couple of things mentioned earlier on
i noticed that amongst our user list we count an organization called and we also count an organization called
so clearly many of the things do are very right and very appropriate and probably one of the UNK was to choose accounting software on which to er prepare their corporate accounts
thank you very much for listening to me UNK i said i would try to keep that down to erm a fairly brief session
what i would like to do now is to UNK who addressed us a little bit earlier this morning who's going to tell us a little bit more about enterprise client server solutions
UNK over to you
thank you
we've heard a lot this morning er about the merits of client server and where it's come from in the last five years
before the break john talked about erm some of the requirements for moving that architecture towards erm the enterprise wide solution
so what i'd like to do right now is explain how system ten will be the way to deliver enterprise client server solutions
and i'll do this by describing each of the system ten products that resolve the UNK of the i t department
we mentioned earlier the UNK which were that for instance erm we're looking for a low risk investment or our customers are looking for a low risk investment they tell us they need well proven technology but that needs to be advanced technology
sql server is UNK product
it's the foundation for client server and other products in the family
it's well proven having been shipped since nineteen eighty seven but provides new advanced technology with the new system ten release
we talk about for instance reliable data delivery and transaction delivery
we need to be able to do business whether or not the network is UNK or whether or not the system fails we still need to make business decisions
based on best available information
UNK server is a way to guarantee data delivery where it's needed and when it's needed
and we'll come on to talk about that in a lot more depth during the presentation
we talk about UNK if we are indeed to UNK mainframe style applications towards the open systems platforms then we need to UNK as a truly worldwide supplier of accounting software is th software components with a low entry cost
navigation server is designed to handle massive amounts of data and users but is still totally UNK from very small machines
we talked about each department erm being able to invest in their own technology and make their own er decisions on what sort of database or interface they would use to UNK their applications
but if we grow a client server towards the enterprise solution we've already talked about the straw pole that we often do where it indicates to us that the average number of er data UNK or data sources in an organization is more than ten
so our customers are looking for multi vendor UNK
UNK sql gateway provides UNK access to UNK and UNK data sources
we also talked about the need to be able to control this vastly more complex new environment as if we were controlling a mainframe
with system ten has announced a family of control UNK which will enable us to control this network of UNK and clients as if it was a single machine
and finally in terms of UNK productivity each of our users have varied requirements but we need to provide them with a consistent solution
enterprise client UNK server tools erm is a very important part of strategy
with acquisition of gain UNK tools and the UNK of a leading edge tool strategy in june of this year should now be considered as a major player in the tools arena
providing tools that UNK the user with all of the data which is available through the system ten architecture in a form which is appropriate to all of the users
during the rest of the presentation what i will endeavour to do is describe each of the components of the system ten architecture which is represented by this slide
before i do that i'd like to describe sql server ten which is the UNK of client server solution
sql server as we said is well proven technology it's been around about five years
five thousand customers have written many thousands of mission critical business applications using the sql server
it's designed from day one to address client server
it UNK technology which our competitors are only now putting in their solutions
still procedures UNK and r p cs
the new release of sql server sql server ten is a hundred percent UNK
so we have such facilities as UNK and UNK integrity
and that's not to say that they replace UNK because they are actually have a very important role to play in terms of being able to er maintain arbitrary business rules and model the way your organization works inside the database UNK
i'm going to be talking a bit more later in the presentation about back up and back up performance which is one of the key areas which erm organizations trying to support very large databases have come across as a as a as a major UNK block or hurdle to get across
and have er implemented something called the backup server to get over that hurdle in the system ten release
also the sql server ten UNK c two level security we also have a b one UNK database for government applications
so we're have in such things as UNK and auditing
and these are sorts of facilities which we'll will need if we're going to erm enable central i s or i t departments to use and therefore charge back that facility to each of the departments using that resource
but sql server alone will not address all the needs of enterprise wide client server
it needs to UNK in several ways to meet these needs
as i go through the rest of the presentation you'll see erm the agenda slides highlighting the area of the architecture we're talking about in the section
so right now i'm going into a section talking about distributed UNK
during the nineteen seventies a lot of research work was done on distributed database technology by such people as i b m UNK and other database UNK such as
their intention was focused on some of the huge benefits that distributed database might deliver
and these expected benefits were things such as performance data could UNK closer to its point of most frequent use
and multiple databases could act in parallel
it included such things as UNK
with UNK systems if the computer goes down the entire system goes down but we still need to make business decisions
with distributed database systems we could continue with a couple of things mentioned earlier on
i noticed that amongst our us includes capacity and UNK since a database could span multiple machines the capacity of any one machine would no longer limit the database size
these needs lead to a number of different database technologies which are represented on this slide and the first one i'd like to focus on is UNK
UNK meets the need for UNK in a distributed environment
whereas businesses are moving to more and more UNK operations business units still need to have UNK access to information
access to data wherever they are no matter what location
distributed transactions guarantee that data at each node is UNK as it changes
a global model of the business delivered to who needs it when they need it where they need it
but as i've already mentioned distributed database theory has been around a long time
the model suggested has not met with widespread acceptance
it doesn't necessarily address all of the needs of the real world
at we believe there are two types of distributed database application
there are those where mission critical business decisions can only be made based on absolute up to date information
these applications require absolute UNK of related data at every site in the distributed database
and for this we would use two face commit technology
two face commit for those who're not pu er familiar with it is an all or nothing approach
if any one node in the distributed database is UNK the transaction will not complete on any other
if we took an example of a of a launching of the space UNK
in those types of applications those types of systems we cannot afford UNK of information we need to invest significant sums of money if fault UNK hardware in UNK disks in UNK networks
this investment can only be justified for systems where transactions have a huge value to that business
two face commit is the software technology that supports these types of systems
has had two face commit technology for five years in support of that style of application
however we believe there's a second type of distributed database application more appropriate for general commercial use
very few organizations the first model due to its UNK cost
UNK server takes a revolutionary approach to distributed database for those organizations who don't need absolute data UNK but the UNK need the advantages of up to date data at UNK of its points of most frequent use
the need reliable data delivery in the event of system failures without the UNK cost of fault UNK hardware
UNK server is based on our primary UNK model
each UNK on the network we might represent the primary as the server on the left and the other two server as UNK
each UNK registers its interest in a data item on the primary UNK server
the primary UNK data changes or transactions to UNK as UNK or UNK occur on that primary server
so this model uses a loose UNK
there's a UNK between the primary changing and the secondary data changing since the primary will change and then we UNK across the network to each secondary location
but that's measured in fractions of seconds
and this is e such facilities as
