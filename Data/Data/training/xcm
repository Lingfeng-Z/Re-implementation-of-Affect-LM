and then when my wife died and i had to sell all you know it UNK er i think er it got away with er some old stuff you know
you lost it
i think that's where lost it
but there a UNK to it
long after i came to the army as i were telling you i used to go to pictures i were in the s in the UNK down UNK street one night i went and there in the programme there was this old er travel picture er some town or other th
and th that night the travel picture came on and it said UNK
and it c all come to me then
i remembered that german lad at er sat at side and i gave of one my gun buttons and he gave me this postcard
UNK
and a beautiful town you know
showed all about it
remarkable that i
it was
you never got round to going over to visit him then
no i er i said er if i'd have kept that postcard it there were his address on you see i could have f i could have found him but no
but you know when i when i c last time i came from france and i came a came across the UNK part of the channel er i got done once i had a b written on my board and then they come and crossed it out
and i back up the line i had to go
but some months after when i was er i were badly hurt th that last time
i got it round here you know
in your head
aye er and er i got to the now on the and UNK go so far up past le UNK at the mouth le UNK we UNK when we went out to france first time and we took guns and all sorts
but coming that time i was dumped in a in a field
thousands wounded you know you couldn't get you into these into er UNK they were army UNK you know er and taking them in er out in rain and er best you could
but even eventually i got in
oh i could tell you a lot about this but i'll just tell you a little bit that's all
er we came i was er the doctor put a big b on my board at back
UNK
oh i'm alright for i'm going this time
and they didn't cross it off
there were one night the door and we'd been in UNK you know for th that three weeks
but that's where there's a lot more stories attached to that
he said he shouted my name out
be ready for england at two o'clock
ooh
and it were er early evening then
and i were ready
got my uniform on and everything
i could walker i were a walker
i could walk you know
i wasn't i were only UNK up
and we crossed from to southampton
that's th the UNK part of the channel
and night before they'd sunk a hospital ship
u boats
we came across in broad daylight
we got to southampton alright
and i'd written the postcard on boat er they gave us all postcards to send home
but i er i never wrote it till we got to t other side
and i wrote it w because we there was a new great western i remember this quite we new great western hospital train on double engine on platform at southampton
wonderful train
six of beds
and the corridor down and UNK two or three kitchens that were we went er i asked one of th the UNK i got a i grabbed the another chap with me we we'd come across together
he said let's get in here and we got in he got into one UNK at one side and i got in to t other
right level with the window
you know you could see out onto platform
and we went from there from southampton to aberdeen
that's a long way fifteen hours on the train
and it only stopped once and that were at er unless it stopped to change engines somewhere perhaps it would but it stopped in birmingham for twenty minutes and what a twenty minutes it were
they let the people in you know ooh my by time we set off i er it were like christmas
my UNK and all the others were UNK up with stuff cigarettes UNK money magazines anything you could wish for
what
they'd have given you their if they could
we'd all er just come from france you see
what regiment were you in
i was in the royal field UNK royal horse and royal field artillery
we had horses in them days
and i could ride like a red indian
really
i used to like riding
i did that
er on these sections when they have to er UNK up after being away you see
what happened to your horse
ha
what happened to your horse
oh i don't know you'd a fresh horse every day
you never got same
oh did you
horse twice when you were training
no
that's another story i could tell you it'd er make your hair UNK
mm
isn't time to tell it now
but er when we when that er train i er had i'd written the postcard for home and i asked a lady if she'd post it for me
she says i certainly will
i says i haven't got a stamp
oh good grief she says you don't need stamp
there were books of stamps all up and down your bed and cigarettes and money and any everything you could think of
how much was the UNK for a postcard in those days
penny
ha'penny
ha'penny
ha'penny postcard
penny for a letter
overseas th er the forces are all free
there no nothing to pay on them
no
what's the UNK and churches in UNK
well majority er then in them days we were welsh they are they are english they're english erm UNK christ church and then there were the english UNK across the road
but the majority were welsh churches
have there been many changes in church and chapel attendance since then do you think
er no i don't think so
no they're very er
er the er of course it is more or less welsh district than they're very well attended is the welsh churches
and the er there's er one of them two of them had to close down
er close and then they moved to er help other churches you see
you see there's the UNK in er street that had to close to make way for er for all that shopping area boots and whatnot
that was er that was the UNK
and then there's st across the road that's very popular is st
and there are all these er singers in er summertime special services
oh yes erm er that was the welsh church that closed
i don't know of any more
how long have you been here in UNK y UNK now
mm
how long have been here
UNK y UNK
in UNK y UNK
four years
four years
it's very er it's a good thing look how nice isn't it
can you tell me something about it
is it
oh er well it's well UNK well very well conducted
and very well liked
and very good staff indeed
you're very happy here
the yes they look after you your slightest wants
you only need mention it and it's there
they look after you for everything
the er they're exceptionally good
and that was a that was a good er i didn't know nothing about that you know until they er gave me
what's that
it was it was in the pa television
oh yes
it was in the paper about it er the presentation you know in er the royal artillery club
are you telling me it was presented to you by the royal artillery club
mm
are you telling me it was presented to you
yes
by the royal artillery club
by the by the regiment not by this club
oh i see
by the regiment
and i had a nice letter from the commanding officer the royal artillery
that was nice for you
yes
about two years since they gave me that
and it's working alright
ooh fine er yes
i've no trouble with it
yes
they made a nice presentation made a nice er nice do with it and then they er quite a few there
there's one at er one man in er UNK belonging to the disabled soldiers and sailors looks after you they come and see you know they come here
he'll be coming here anytime now that man
mr he had a lot to do with this and the royal artillery club here had and er i thought it were a nice gesture
very nice
oh it was
yes
yes they look after you
they do
well you're looking very well
aye well i don't whether i told you i had a er i went on a holiday to the er beginning of september
did you
then i had a blooming fall
no old war injury you know
and it made it ten times worse
they shouldn't wi all the money they spend on des designing and er whatnot and the big shops
and then they went right across the centre of the shop two steps no UNK nothing
down i went
i thought i'd broken my leg
and i'm still under doc but i still hurt you know
i can't walk half as well as i could
no
and i were doing very well
i walked whole length of street first day we there
and then i were UNK
i couldn't go nowhere
no er i th i thought mr had been here before now but he's a very busy man you know he'll be coming
yes
they don't neglect you
no
no
have you seen that picture
yes
aye
i have been looking at it
that's one of t
and this this'll be interesting if you er if you've any engineering friends that'll
do you want it back
no you can keep that
i can get some get another
i go to UNK sometimes you know
and i'll be going there in december all being w
it's awfully nice of you
thank you
oh yes
goes to the museum
yes
oh yes
have you got to know all you want
i think so
i'm overwhelmed with that
if er if there's UNK else you want to know you can always come in come in or i'll come and see you either way
thank you very much indeed
back issues have turned out some previous lectures but you can pick them up afterwards rather than now
today still unfortunate cos you've got a two page handout
why
cos they do little trees on them which takes space
er well this is the last week at kings term which means that this is the last lecture in this series so if you come back next week you'll be disappointed
erm the service continues next term with me starting and then mike taking over half way through and what i'll be doing is supplying the general two UNK two UNK semantics that i've been talking about erm two specific instructions in a natural language i can get what six
definite descriptions and names something like that
so today i'm going to talk about UNK of structure or about sentence structure and logical form so point one a reminder something that i keep saying knowledge of language is knowledge of a UNK a body of rules that UNK and semantic properties to words and sentences
thanks
you've got a box in your head and it's got rules of those three types at least those three types
erm now something that puzzled me for quite a long time when i started out doing philosophy of language er one or two years ago erm frequently you hear claims or we hear claims to the effect that this is a logical form of this sentence or this is the structure of this sentence or this is the semantic structure of this sentence and i was never quite sure what that actually meant erm it's partly because apart from UNK erm a lot of people who write on these issues don't actually tell you what the background theory is and exactly what the point of the assignment of structured sentences is supposed to be erm however after thinking about it for a while i've arrived at the following general view there are at least three rather different enterprises er which might lead you to UNK sentence structure and er one needs to figure out the relations between them
so point sentence structure
there are three distinct projects logic syntax and semantics which might lead you which do lead you to UNK structures to sentences
logical structure accounts for certain UNK relations among sentences
i'm gonna elaborate on all these a bit in syntax a lot as we proceed
UNK structure accounts for well and ill UNK
semantic structure accounts for the UNK of meanings of complex expressions from those of their components
it's not obvious a UNK whether all or any pair of these projects UNK on a single set of structures
and now just to spend the rest of the lecture UNK on what i just said
so logic first erm point three
logic needs to account for logical relations among sentences the sort that we'll learn about in UNK logic
for example needs to account for why if the sentence p and q is true then so is the sentence q and in order to do that it UNK a certain structure for example as on the handout in my assigned structure and brackets p q erm anyway erm it just has and has a separate UNK operating on two distinct sentences that are not ordered syntax needs to account for the well UNK of the structure sorry p and q the ill UNK of p q and the similar grouping of and with or that is in english between sentences and where you can find one and find another but not with not you don't say john loves mary not peter loves jill
a slightly more subtle data the well UNK of the following dialogue sally likes jill yes and she likes mary versus the ill UNK of sally likes jill yes she likes mary and
well what this suggests is that and she likes mary accounts as a legitimate string with and at the beginning of the sentence but she likes mary doesn't so you can't stick and at the end of the sentence
thanks for
okay erm okay moving on to semantics we're half way through point three
semantics needs to account for our understanding of p and q on the basis of our understanding of p q and
it might just UNK a structure p and q three separate constituents between their structure
in each case the assignment is part of a large theory with its own particular data and goals
so it's a UNK possible that the three projects don't UNK
erm okay i'm going to talk about syntax mostly erm is everybody happy with the role that the assignment of structure plays in UNK and semantics
i'll come back to semantics a bit at the end
but if you remember your UNK there should be no problems
that rules deduction rules of whatever kind er UNK rules or rules er applied to sentences in logic on the basis of the structure brackets what kind of UNK you have and so on
okay
semantic syntax and then afterwards the relation between syntax and semantics so i'm actually going to do some real syntax
lesson one in syntax
point four erm sentences are made up of noun phrases and verb phrases those phrases can be composed of UNK standing alone or UNK and objects so you can have four the structure what sounds like florence smiled actually has a structure as on the handout in the sentence composed of a noun phrase and a verb phrase the noun phrase contains a single noun florence and the verb phrase contains a single verb smile or you can have something like four two florence teased dougal and there the verb phrase contains the verb teased and another noun phrase containing the single noun dougal
okay that's the question is why does it have that structure
it might be that the subject noun and verb phrase go together to form a constituent so you have florence teased dougal or the structure might not be that it might just be three separate constituents with no firm structure forming a further constituent so why that structure
okay well i shall now give you evidence for that some which is straightforward some which is a little bit more subtle
so point five evidence for verb phrase structure
first of all UNK
this is where you drop something from a sentence or phrase and you leave a word or a phrase out
you can often allow a verb and an object together but never a subject and a verb so sentence three and five you can say florence said she teased dougal and she did i e she did UNK dougal but sentence four is ill formed
florence said she teased dougal and dougal which is what you'd get if you allowed it and florence teased so you can allow teased dougal but you can't allow florence teased
so here's the hypothesis to explain that UNK is confined to constituents where constituents are just what they sound like genuine components of a larger thing which is UNK by sticking brackets labelled brackets round them so they make a phrase and you can do certain things with them
okay
second four b erm the UNK where a UNK is like a pronoun or a UNK or if you fancy a pro sentence erm sentence five florence teased dougal and brian did so too did so means teased dougal the sentence for that is a UNK
that's fine but sentence six florence teased dougal and did so brian too doesn't sound right but notice that's exactly what you would get if you could substitute the UNK for a subject verb construction and then it would mean florence teased brian too
okay
c the third piece of evidence UNK tend to be either whole sentences or noun phrases or verb object instructions but never verb subject or rather subject verb instructions
when an UNK is just something that has the form of has a certain apparent UNK form but actually occurs just as a single unit of a fixed meaning so it has no genuine semantic structure from which you can determine its meaning for example kick the bucket means die and you don't get that in the meaning of kick the bucket
but notice kick the bucket appears as a verb phrase and eat humble pie get your UNK in a twist and so on
so if you just generally think about the UNK like that frozen pieces of language and fixed meanings you'll find they come in formed sentences and subject expressions and verb phrases but not subject verb
could you say i walk i walk
i walk
by UNK
yeah
erm well really it's just what i said it's er roughly speaking it's when er a string of words doesn't have the meaning you'd expect on the basis of the standard semantics of the language but rather has a fixed different meaning and whenever there's any apparent structure in it i e several words er their normal meanings are irrelevant which is the meaning of the whole phrase
so like i said kick the bucket the meaning of that UNK is just die sorry die
it's a UNK meaning originally
er it might be i don't know in this particular case
it often comes about that way it starts as a UNK and then gets frozen
what do you mean subject UNK and
er what i actually mean is whenever you have an UNK you can substitute in the position of a whole sentence or of a verb phrase but you can't substitute it for a subject and a verb leaving the object of the sentence UNK
yeah so okay then the general i'm for is that in a subject verb object sentence there's very important sense in which the verb and the object go together they form one unit and one constituent of a sentence whereas subject and verb don't
so in point of fact UNK is you'll find that they always fit in either this slot or in this slot but you won't find an UNK which has to form such that if you remove the subject and verb from a sentence you can stick the UNK in there and it will make sense
you're the UNK one
a because it's not an UNK and b even if it were it would be a whole sentence because walk is UNK
well think about it i mean there might be one in which case we have to do a little bit er dancing around
why doesn't the UNK just take the place of the verb because if you get rid of the object as well
well it's a verb phrase so erm they just all that means is if you take a subject expression and well what goes what goes after such expression is a verb phrase that my opinion not just you know
so although in all these three kick the bucket eat humble pie get your UNK in a twist er all look like fairly complex UNK
they look as though they don't really they actually UNK
so that's okay the point is that they can substitute in a sentence UNK verb or UNK verb object UNK
how about erm god smiled upon john god smiled upon someone
er
meaning he was UNK
mm yeah good
i don't know i'll think about it
very good
well unfortunately if they're UNK then they do
god smiled upon him er UNK
it does seem to be doesn't it
because if you substitute something into the god it doesn't really work or smiled upon fortune smiled upon him
fate smiled upon him
yeah it's not an UNK
notice it really isn't smiled upon smiled upon is one is the UNK
so that's just a verb and then you can put in anything such that if such thing UNK upon you are blessed god UNK fate fortune
i'm sure there are things about
well there might be er and that's the trouble when one starts doing philosophy and there's real study of language it gets really difficult
erm okay moving on to point six and now we soon get a little bit fancy
this is more evidence for the claim that you get a verb phrase in a sentence erm but it introduces er it's also an example of how you can account for UNK in terms of er structural relations in sentences and large expressions
so point six erm okay look at the sentences one and two under six one is apparently ill formed herself left except in i think some irish UNK actually yes well it has a rather special meaning where herself is given special status erm in the context but in normal english herself left is ill formed but two florence saw herself is fine herself is a UNK pronoun refers that herself each other or one another the other are UNK
erm and then if you move on to sentences four and five underneath them er anyone left is ill formed but no one saw anyone is fine
still ideas that the UNK pronoun herself and the item anyone which is called a negative UNK item the item anyone needs to have something else in the sentence in order to license them they can't just occur freely in the normal position for er UNK even though they are UNK
so florence UNK herself and florence herself and no one UNK anyone in anyone
okay but the item that UNK them the other licensing sentence you need in order to license these items you can't just go anywhere in the sentence so sentence three herself saw florence is no good even though florence is there it's in the wrong place relative to herself and similarly six anyone saw no one is no good even though no one is in the sentence
so what we need to do is you need to figure out what kind of items license erm reflects the UNK like herself and make it a UNK items like anyone
what kind of items license them and where do they have to be in the sentence
well the position the relative position is to find in terms of pre structural UNK
erm okay the notation for UNK florence teased dougal is it can be expressed converted directly into the explicit tree notation on the handout
that just UNK the same structure in terms of constituents and sub constituents so the whole thing is a sentence which in the UNK notation just has the sentence with its bracket and the other UNK way down the other end and this is UNK by the label sentence occurring at the top of the tree it means it covers everything below it roughly
the sentence is divided into noun phrase and a verb phrase and so on verb phrase
that's just a bracket notation made more explicit
okay we can now define certain pre structural relations which we'll then use to explain the behaviour of things like herself so it's only over okay and node x UNK a node y right where a node is the point where a label appears sentence node and so on
so node x quote UNK a node y if and only if there's a path leading down the tree from x to y it's straightforward just means it's higher up in the tree and there's a path UNK them
okay we can now define a further notion called c command the phrase x c commands a phrase y if and only if a neither of x nor y UNK the other so neither is directly above the other and in the path and b the first UNK node is UNK x also UNK y so let's find out if x and c commands to y you go up the tree from x and you find the UNK node the first UNK node UNK x and see if that node also UNK y okay
well i've just defined it as UNK notion and am now going to show the point having done that
what c command really is a scope it's er UNK in the notion of scope from logical semantics
no i don't think c means anything
it's erm terminology it comes along with government binding
dominant
which is if i mean when he was giving lectures in government and binding people would invited him would put up posters saying government and binding so he got all the wrong audiences
it was quite a serious problem i mean that you get hundreds and hundreds of people in a room to get jobs to talk about politics and he'll start
okay
what's the point for a c command
well the main point is that actually it's the proper er UNK definition of scope and but in this context it'll explain stuff about er negative UNK
yeah
yeah
so if you look at the tree t one okay
florence c commands both saw and herself because if you go up the tree from florence you find the first UNK node that's the s node and that UNK both saw and herself
okay and saw c commands herself because if you go up the tree from saw to the first UNK node you'll find that UNK node also UNK herself
okay but saw doesn't c command florence because the first UNK node dominated saw it's a verb phrase and that doesn't dominate florence it's on the wrong branch
okay so the UNK require a c commanding UNK really is just a noun phrase from which it can get its reference like herself back to florence
florence er c commands florence
er yeah i think it does actually erm yeah cos florence doesn't dominate florence and the first UNK node UNK florence UNK florence erm
okay now i've just used this one example but if you look at erm each other and one another there is also a UNK pronoun to find that they work in the same way in the appropriate UNK and it also works for UNK pronoun relations every girl UNK herself which is fine but herself UNK every girl doesn't make a whole lot of sense
so i just picked two examples but you'll find that they UNK a some interest
okay negative UNK items that's the anyone case they require a c commanding trigger so if you go on to tree t two no one saw anyone no one c commands anyone but notice if you reverse that and you had anyone saw no one with no one in object position anyone subject position no one would then not c command anyone
so that would predict what we found that anyone saw no one is ill formed
this also UNK er the trigger is basically some kind of negative element
people i don't think anybody really knows how to define the notion of trigger properly but there's always some negative UNK like no one erm and you can say i don't like anyone but you can't say i like anyone
well you can actually but you can't say i like you any more but you can say i don't like you any more
erm well c commands roughly it's just a noun phrase which can UNK the pronoun with a reference or an interpretation so if florence saw herself florence is a noun phrase and gives herself the reference florence
it does work for UNK every UNK saw herself and there the interpretation of herself is like in logic
every x UNK x saw herself cos all the does are standing around looking at the lake seeing their UNK so there is just a UNK
herself works very much like a variable from logic
erm
right no one itself isn't a negative UNK item
negative UNK item is the one that needs to be UNK by something else
given them the negative UNK item i give a damn
i don't give a damn
actually the trouble is the UNK ones is people deliberately messing about especially americans
how about erm the UNK called upon you can't do that the same thing as god smiled upon
the UNK called upon
yes it's different because the
first of all the UNK just a name for a UNK being and i think that is a normal
yeah
it just means the UNK has been called upon probably just means called upon
since you know what the UNK does when he or she calls upon you
yeah but whole thing is an expression and you can change the object
i think you can change also expressions
but that doesn't mean
well maybe
well let's say this okay i just don't accept it
i mean let's say this
erm let's say that erm the UNK sang his name was an idiomatic expression meaning er that his time was up he was he was he died so he sang his name
erm now you couldn't do that with that and that sounds UNK like the kind of expression that we might have just because i can't think of one doesn't mean that
but that's a whole sentence
erm the UNK erm the UNK sang john's name the UNK sang UNK name do you know what i mean
and that doesn't sound funny at all
we must have some like that
erm well that's tricky because the object isn't what goes in here erm it's actually the whole thing
yeah
the UNK name
but that doesn't destroy i mean as soon as the class is over i'll think of one that's the problem or in the middle of the night
mm well maybe i mean to come up with a clear example
it doesn't matter a whole lot i mean because the er all it would show is that UNK needn't take the form of constituents in sentences
sorry not UNK sorry
it wouldn't show that the verb phrase wasn't a constituent
and does this er does this only matter when the subject have an object that is
because i mean there's plenty of UNK like a rolling stone UNK no UNK but that's a subject not a verb and it's actually saying something totally different or every time
er
about the situation and sort of used in a sense about somebody's situation
yeah it's just that's the whole sentence
yes
a rolling stone UNK no UNK
but it's and a verb which are idiomatic and are used
well the whole the whole thing is a single UNK in that case
i just wanna go over the form of the argument erm subject object
now the there it appears that there's a whole variety of UNK er which suggests that sentence UNK up in this way and that can be explained on hypothesis we just call such a division a constituent and then we UNK that as certain operations can only apply to constituents
we suppose that's a rule in our minds and that explains our judgments about for example and UNK and so on that's so we define the notion of a constituent plus label it with brackets and then we make certain predictions about operations that can or can't be performed on
okay now one of the predictions made is that UNK to sorry UNK to form into this plus
that might turn out to be wrong but that wouldn't UNK the other data the stuff about er UNK and particularly erm the stuff about UNK and UNK items yeah that's why it's not it's not actually crucial
but of course if you start if you find that the other evidence dissolves as well then you give up eventually
yeah the whole sentence is a constituent itself er it and can be a constituent of larger sentences obviously
it's just that it's the
yeah
it just can't be the i mean if you think of all the i mean like say you've got a sort of er UNK expression for if he's got UNK might be something like you know johnny UNK him or something you know there must be things like that you know there must be loads of things like that
you know there must be loads of things like that
i mean that just sounds like familiar you know i mean not that
ha
no johnny rotten UNK object
yeah but it's what you're standing in well
yeah
the subject and verb stay the same the object
subject and verb by themselves which
well johnny rotten UNK
that's it yeah
yeah and then the idea is the verb you plug in there whatever then you plug in there is fine
you then get a UNK sentence and means this person
UNK
you're right it doesn't sound odd but then the question is why does this all really occur
it does really occur i'm sure if it doesn't sound odd it must occur
if it doesn't sound odd you'd expect it to occur
i'm sure it does
i know that
yeah
how would you
we'll be just like t two with no one and anyone reversed
yeah but
yeah but the claim is that anyone needs to be UNK by the c commanding trigger which is no one and the point is that erm anyone will then not be c UNK by no one because no one is too far down the tree
erm but notice if you stick an if in you have if anyone saw no one then i'll be surprised that does actually make sense
if nobody saw anybody yesterday i'd be amazed it's fine because if is the legitimate trigger and it would c command no one
okay erm just carrying on quickly it's very hard to see how you could account for erm the stuff about UNK and the UNK items if you didn't have the structures of the kind you get with t one and t two on verb phrases erm and the UNK just erm you want that kind of a UNK between say florence and herself between their positions in the tree and no one and anyone except you can't reverse them things like that
if you had less structure as in t three which is a UNK tree instead of binary UNK be just an n p b n p it's real hard to see how you can account for the data
you can try it of course you can try and use erm linear ordering and things like to explain the data just turns out often these doesn't work
so now point seven
neither semantics nor logic requires v p structure a UNK that is there's no particular reason why you'd expect verb phrase UNK in particular from either of those two enterprises because either could get by with er either the flat structure florence teased dougal that's the structure in t three separate constituents or teased florence dougal where teased is one constituent and florence dougal is another which is the way we most UNK do it UNK and that works fine
so erm if you're looking if you're looking for semantic structure which is any structure such as and you then provide interpretations for parts of sentences and rules are getting sentence meaning from word meaning in the structure you can get by with crude structures that don't discriminate very much and the same applies to logic
when you do UNK you get UNK structures more detailed more complex
so now what are the relations between them erm we talked about the logical bit last time but about semantics and UNK and point eight
well here's an actual hypothesis to make semantic structure just the UNK structure
why
well a this would be an economical and UNK way for our knowledge of language to be organized
UNK structure does appear to be suitable for semantic purposes one can develop UNK semantic rules that apply to UNK structures
basically because in syntax you get all the structure you need for semantics and some more which doesn't do any harm
now suppose you are designing a language learning and using machine you really wouldn't want to have separate levels of structure for syntax and semantics
it would be UNK it would be messy it would be UNK and it would create the problem of the relations between the two you'd have to have UNK to get you from one to the other
so the first thing you'd expect on just by the false but enormously appealing principle that the world is simple and UNK is there is just one level of structure there
it's a terrible thing actually because you always pretty much er once they work once they to the data and people still worry about it why have rather than some other
they it's simple it's nice it's UNK and it's not an item at all unless you have a further premise that the world itself is simple nice and UNK and you have no reason to believe that at all but since that applies across all sides i think UNK is in no worse shape
okay secondly and more importantly eight b the idea that UNK and semantic structure are the same or rather that semantics just works over the UNK structure erm that would help solve the acquisition problem
remember the acquisition problem infants acquire language on the basis of minimal evidence that's called a poverty of stimulus problem which i talked about a bit in lecture one or two
it's just it's very well put it this way children seem to learn language very quickly and they've got very little data to go on when they learn the language
small number of sentences number that they come out understanding and that's rather UNK so to explain just in general terms you're interested in describing language in such a way that it's the UNK thing that's easy to learn rather than hard to learn
that's the basic idea and the fact that we do actually learn becomes less UNK
so now if UNK and semantic structure are the same then both kinds of evidence both semantic evidence and UNK evidence will UNK the choice of structure
one of the things the UNK got to do learn his language sentence and in the context he can figure out what the sentence has to mean like radical interpretation kid the kid is sitting playing on the floor a UNK by and the mother goes
okay
erm the UNK got to figure out if it's going to use that to project the other sentences then it might come across it's got to it's gotta UNK that into structure
right
that's one of the important tasks
well if there's only one level of structure then evidence about the and evidence of that meaning are both going to bear on that
the same structure
if there were two levels of structure the task would be much harder
okay so language would be much easier to learn if this hypothesis were true rather than if it were not true
er for example
more or less yeah
yeah
are they a related meaning
i mean
yeah
it might just be a case
yeah
yeah obtained just they're just photographs
words that are spelt and sound the same just like and
how about identifying the normal and identifying the philosophy
erm what's that going to find the philosophy say
identify it
er well as in the english you'd probably say if you didn't study philosophy you'd say were identified as UNK but it's not the same thing
er yeah
it's just i mean as philosophy just very UNK takes words from ordinary language gradually gets a technical meaning er which is different from the original meaning and then when ordinary speakers use it in the original meaning they get told off
er that's i mean i think if you really in these cases you have to count them as different words just like i mean maths and physics doesn't mean what maths used to mean in english
energy certainly doesn't
necessary
necessary er all those things
it's hard i mean it's difficult to tell difficult to decide when the meaning has actually changed it's a UNK hard problem which nobody really knows how to solve in the principle way
nevertheless sometimes it clearly has and other times it clearly hasn't so there does seem to be a line there even if we don't yet know we certainly have to draw it
mm
erm i don't know if i mean remember that in order to do any UNK semantic theory you have to UNK
remember the little truth theory that we did in lecture two or three or when you do semantics in logic by swinging two model theories when you interpret the expressions of a logical language you have to UNK a structure and er the claim here is just that the natural language that structure that the semantic interpretation rules apply to it's just the UNK structure
is that okay
yeah
it does i mean it's it wasn't clearly UNK until er about nineteen sixty eight i think by UNK
UNK kind of claims this in semantics in natural languages which i suggested that you read but UNK puts the claim the other way round that is there's no more syntax than that structure needs in semantics and that's just false that's just false because you're not going to account for all the data i've been talking about verb phrases
semantic structure
er yeah it doesn't really er
but UNK actually makes the claim that you to UNK no more structure than what's required by a truth theory just to get the coming out right
don't ask me what truth theories
okay
UNK says i think he actually claims all you need to do is to develop your UNK semantics to get the truth theories coming out right and that's the only notion of structure you need
he doesn't really doesn't seem to have room for his idea of having independently motivated UNK structure i don't know why cos simple idea but i think
but is it true about the semantic structure where you can say it hasn't got a verb phrase
yeah
then the other one still has to have the equivalent of a c commanding although it's in a in a different way
but you wouldn't have c command i mean that if you take the first structure in seven that's just the one in t three
okay so now suppose you have florence as the first noun in t three and herself no do it the other way round suppose you had herself as the first noun and t three florence okay then you'd find florence does c command herself but it shouldn't
erm
oh right
er say if you look in seven you've got er say the
yeah that's erm actually there's that's this structure
okay if you said the first one was saw
mm
and er and the last i believe there was herself then er the middle item has got to be a particular type of item
yeah erm
and it's then related in the same way as the c commanding
er in fact florence does c command herself here
yeah
so that's er on the other hand erm it would do if you also if you'll reverse them herself florence which would which would presumably be herself saw florence structure but that's
yeah
but that's UNK
yeah but that's what i'm saying there's
so that you'd have to
you'd have to well you don't you don't because the thing is you want an UNK relation between florence and herself because florence or herself is okay and herself or florence isn't
here it's symmetrical
yeah
now you could have the linear ordering that's an alternative proposal erm but then you've actually got erm you've got to come up with a kind of proper account of these structures of how they come about and of the relation and then you've got to check it out against all the other data and all i can say is as it happens i've tried that and it doesn't work but that's only and we want to find out if you can see that the quite a long way
so i mean by all means don't take any of this for granted
yeah
well you have to
you have to decide if that really is
structure it may well be that it's a structure is the other way round in which case
er erm about the it doesn't matter about my voice you see there
erm about working in the office of the brothers in porthmadog
well brothers were very early organized er slate merchants in porthmadog
started by my uncle by marriage jonathan of and his brother richard of
and as i understand it they came down from somewhere er near they obviously were involved in the slate business and then they or organized their own firm brothers and i believe it was about seventeen er eighty nine maybe earlier
and their of first office as i recall as a little boy was on the q quay as we used to say in porthmadog
yeah
now whether it was n near UNK quay or wherever it was they had a quay there and of course they had a quay in
yes
er where the used to bring the slates down from
yes
UNK and those who went by train would be transferred to the quay in
yeah
those going by sea of course came right down to the quay in porthmadog
yeah
would the offices be on the side of where
yes
yes
hill that would be
i think it'd be in that direction
yes
fine
if we were walking down there now i think i could probably give you the er exact place where it was because i've got a young memory of going in there we used to er walk around the you see
er shall i go on now
yes yeah
well i suppose i should introduce myself
er since i'm UNK on my very early youth
my name is UNK and i was born in the on november the eighth nineteen ten
and er my mother janet hughes was a s sister to mrs jonathan
and jonathan was justice of the peace and quite a leader in ar area
after my father's death in twenty three he was executive of the estate and my guardian
co guardian with my mother
so i have close contact with the family from my childhood
and anyway erm i first went to and the money ran out and so grammar school and then er i was transferred to porthmadog county school where er jonathan at that time was chairman of the board of governors
and after some slight difficulty i wasn't a very good student er i finished early before there was no chance of my passing UNK anyway
it would have been a w waste of time
so i became er an office boy at brothers
by this time they had purchased a building which had been i think a bank or a savings bank or something at street in porthmadog
and that's where i served as an office boy kind of a latter day bob UNK
how old were you then
well i was between sixteen and seventeen because i think i started r er working there in the mid summer or m early spring of twenty seven and worked there through that period all through nineteen twenty eight then i UNK to the united states in nineteen twenty nine
so i was between say sixteen and seventeen and erm brothers er by this time of course mr richard was dead
and his son in law o j had become one of the partners and my cousin was one of the partners but old jonathan was still the senior partner
the rest of the staff was w old w j who had been who had worked in the central post office i think in london very well trained in er office management and so on so on
and then your cousin er margaret
and then er james was a doctor of captain james and er a daughter of captain james
she had another sister by name of UNK went to school with me in porthmadog and another one older i've forgotten what her name was
but we were the staff and er my uncle jonathan was a very victorian in every way
i think he was er at one time head of the er UNK methodist church and he was a great chapel UNK
and a very strict man and er his word was law
now and robert were in the front room sharing a room and uncle jonathan had his own room upstairs and there was a little bathroom up there
and then we were down below and er there was erm a table with some antique UNK on it
and then we had the UNK so that these huge big er
UNK
UNK that are now on the UNK could be l placed down there and UNK me because he could add a column of pounds shillings and pence he'd take his three fingers at the bottom of the long UNK column and as fast practically like a computer would add to the top and then put it in pencil
and then and never made a mistake of course he tried to teach me but it was just a waste of time
but anyway i did have to do some of them
but my basic job would be kind of a UNK for everybody
i had to keep the fire going for example and i had to go and get er some e UNK cakes for uncle jonathan for his tea
and the telephone number i remember to this day was porthmadog so that shows it was at least probably the telephone to go into being in porthmadog
he didn't like using the telephone
but er uncle jonathan only used the telephone if absolutely essential
and necessary
h he thought that er it was very UNK for UNK behaviour and for a well organized and to put things in writing
and as a matter of some real interest he would have a copy made and for example say that er i was a messenger boy among other things he would er give me a written hand written and he wrote beautifully
a hand written note to go to say er lloyd george in george's offices
and william george of course was still practising at that time
down the road
and er say send something to william george or something involving the magistrates cos he was chairman of the of the er of the er
the bench
bench
and he would then call f ring three times i think maybe it was four times and it was my job to then run upstairs and i mean fast you didn't UNK
and yes sir
and he would say go on UNK mr william george
and he'd have written a thing i'm just using william george as an example of course
yes
yeah
and he said here's the note
and then he would fold it very carefully and put it in an envelope and then UNK the flap he'd not seal the envelope
and he said now he said why do i do this
well i had no idea of course
he said well he said it's a matter of tradition
that if you send number one you should never use any messenger unless the messenger is UNK
and naturally you expect a member of our own family to be UNK
therefore he said you're to show your trust in the messenger you never seal the envelope
then the receiver would know that this was a UNK messenger and could treat you accordingly
now he said if there's any question of doubt he'll seal it and then the receiver would know there was some question of doubt and he would seal back the reply
but if it came UNK he would return the reply UNK
he said that is a showing that people are honest
which made quite an impression on me er have you heard of this before UNK
no and er what is interesting to me too is that erm in that office you w were responsible for carrying me message in the porthmadog area
now erm the letters that were er written there was always copies made
oh yes
how was this done
and er this of course er we th the office was being run i would think in the early twenties very much like it was done in the late nineties
and we had all the equipment that was needed the only new thing wa was a very aged er typewriter maybe
mm
two
and there was the best one of course your cousin was able to use
so then er and i had to do with the antique
the other
mm
but basically when my uncle he sometimes would dictate his letters
and your cousin was one of the first one of the few women i ever knew who could take shorthand in welsh
because he wrote quite a few letter in welsh and he would dictate them to er margaret
margaret
and then she'd type them on this special machine that had UNK ink in it
then it was my job to take the original t and take the original because they didn't use erm er black sheet as we m er americans call it
carbon
d didn't use carbons
you would take then the original and you'd put it in the copy press
there's be books o of they were leather bound er letter books you see
and UNK on them
and you would take this book and you'd put a hard piece of it was a kind of a cardboard that wouldn't absorb water i've forgotten what the thing was made of
you'd put that down first
then you'd put the UNK down
er no the out the original of the er letter down
yeah
then you'd put the UNK over it and then there was a kind of a an e an UNK kind of a rag the right size not too wet cos if it was too wet it would run
and you'd put that on top of the UNK and you'd close the book and you'd take the book and put it in the letter press and squeeze it UNK theory of a screw and this thing my cousin later told me was bought third hand in eighteen sixty nine
so god knows where it was built
and er it's cast iron of course with a steel screw and then er big brass balls on the end of this thing and then you would squeeze it down and then if you did it correctly you took it out and the UNK ink would have transferred the actually letter including the signature on the UNK which was then filed in the
UNK
in the UNK
in the letter UNK you see
for every amen
and then you UNK the letter or delivered the letter or whatever was necessary
yeah
now you didn't have to copy everything but uncle jonathan was very UNK and anything that there would be any debate on or any discussion on he always made a copy and it was my job to do this without UNK it
and if i UNK a copy god help cos then there'd be a problem
er
how many of these a day would you have
was it quite a lot
oh yes because er we had a lot of letter going back an forth to architects or to other slate merchants or to quarry owners
mm
or er you know er quotations on this
yes
and quotations on that
and you had to be careful and you had to keep your hands clean
that was one of the orders there was a little bathroom down in the in the first floor and the thing that they must not get was your hands dirty
now old wore a black thing afore his shirt now because he was with ink all over him you see but he didn't do this
that was my job so therefore my hands had to be constantly clean and that's not easy for a seventeen year old to keep his hands clean all the time but i had to
and if you did UNK it there was all hell to pay because then margaret your cousin would have to UNK it
yeah
and then i'd have the joy of taking it up to uncle jonathan to get a new signature and of course he'd know that something had gone wrong and then he'd
yeah
looked over his glasses you see
and then they had a dumb UNK from er the main office to and UNK office and did not suffer UNK either
and so he'd UNK down he wanted a certain book of correspondence and invariably you might put the wrong one in
and once i nearly got my head UNK cos i sent up the wrong thing and bang he sent it down and i just got my head out of there in time
but this was a part this was a very dangerous job to stick your nose up in there
but then
we had a strong room were some of the very confidential matters estates and all that kind of stuff er was kept and some money kept
and because er as i said this had originally been a bank or a
mm
savings and loan or something and this was a big UNK in there
and it was a lot of fun you see to get in there i hope will never hear this to get in there and squeeze her
in the strong room
yeah
but er then there was erm a desk we had big UNK and poor old was trying desperately to get me to add correctly you see and he'd let me add and then he'd always find there was a mistake in it and he'd try to tell me why
didn't carry this didn't carry that
but i was supposed to do some of the clerical work
but he checked every bit of my work of course and so most of the time do it by himself and let and me do other things
and then the table where the girls sat on their UNK then there was a on this on a hall you came into a hall
and there was erm a kind of a glass door a sliding door with a er b bell push on it
so that if somebody come in to call they'd pull this thing and then mr or somebody would open the sliding door and you see
so one time i made a very sad mistake somebody pushed the bell and i opened it and i said i'll have two UNK
and it was my uncle jonathan
well this was not very good
so orders were given that i was not under any condition to open that thing unless i knew who was there
you also got into trouble about the press didn't you
oh yes
trying to impress er and your cousin on my strength you know young men always try to sh show women of any age how strong they are
up to a certain point
i've reached that point now
i couldn't fight my way out of a paper bag now
i was trying to show how tight
yeah
i could squeeze this
yeah
thing and cracked it
so naturally i had to get it with and it was heavier th i don't know how much it weighed i got it by the way in my barn in farm in UNK one of the last UNK of brothers
and i had to put it on the seat of my bicycle push it all the way and it'd be a good mile from street to right across from
to have them er UNK it
cos it was cracked it was useless of course
and i had to pay for it of course
now i was making ten shillings a week and i had to pay a penny toll every day to come to from office
and then i had to pay tuppence in cafe for a cup of tea and mother would fix me a sandwich
and occasionally if i was really UNK i'd buy a little cake for another tuppence you see
couldn't afford to go to they was too expensive
anyway i had to push this thing and had to wait for it
no i wasn't allowed to wait for it cos it was gonna take UNK all the way back to do something else
and the next day i picked it up and of course it was ten shillings my full
week's wages
yes
week's er wages and erm and i'd UNK so it was my own damn fault
mhm
it was years later that my cousin who dies some years ago he was ninety two
told me that at just about the same age he did the same thing to try and impress the then girl in the office
so anyway that was one of the reasons when i found that brothers was slowly going out of business when i saw last in and i asked him if er i could have this thing
and he said well he said you go and see
was still there
this was many years ago now ab ten years ago i guess so i went and saw and of course erm mr was dead and his son was running it and had sold his shares
but anyway they allowed this that they didn't have any further use for it that i could have it
so i asked some friends of mine who were in the antique business from UNK pick it up
and i've got it at home
but er it was interesting that both young men
mm
s several decades apart had broken this about the same place you see
when you were in the office wh was there much contact with overseas countries were they shipping a lot of slate
yes there was still some contact with UNK and there was still some contact with other UNK ports and then there was some contact in repairing of erm s churches
i think i think there was som some sent to UNK for example i think they were doing something in the cathedral in UNK
mm
and then you were talking about UNK earlier now there are some churches in UNK that had welsh slate and it must have gone by sea all the way
yeah
to UNK before my time
the one that i remember and i hope that er the papers are either here in UNK in the UNK or p possible in the national library because my cousin gave most of the brothers papers that he had control over
mm
to the national er
library
library in wales
and i understand that have given you the balance here
mm
so therefore the brothers are divided
and anyway the thing that i UNK recall vividly this happened in nineteen early nineteen twenty eight
it was years later that i knew all about it
but the UNK brothers as you probably know have spent millions of dollars in UNK er UNK virginia which was the UNK capital
and also where from taught at william and mary college
and is buried there
and er william the college of william and mary is still going of course
they're one of the fine universities of virginia
but anyway some lawyer i think in new york working for UNK brothers sent a piece of slate to my uncle jonathan asking him could he tell what quarry in wales this particular UNK had come from
because the UNK palace was in a state of very sad repair and they had to put a new roof in it
and they had come to the conclusion that it was not american slate cos there were no quarries in that time
even in UNK and that this was welsh slate taken probably from bristol in UNK to get tobacco back
so i cannot tell you now i can't remember where the quarry was whether it was north wales quarry whether it was slate quarry down in
mm
south wales because uncle jonathan was part owner of the quarry
and as you know the UNK on
mm
on er the college here in
mm
in bangor
and but anyway i remember this inquiry coming in
and the old man saying exactly what quarry it came from
mm
and then writing back to this contact i either in new york or in virginia or wherever it was saying that it th they would give him the dimensions of the roof that they could tell him exactly how many slates they'd need to cover it
so many squares you see
mm
mm
so e eventually in due course brothers got the order
to UNK the slates to UNK the UNK palace in UNK virginia
and i hope when you go there e UNK that you'll look at that because that's all welsh slate
mm
and handled by brothers now
i remember working on some of the of the paperwork involved in it
we had a you know there was a lot of paperwork involved
we had to but the slates we had to er g get the right dimensions the right UNK and all that stuff
and so i worked on it as a kid now
i wasn't er the main one of course because it was
mm
all very high UNK muck stuff and they wouldn't trust me with anything but at least i did the copying work on it
yeah
so it must be in the records somewhere
yeah that's very interesting
how many slate UNK were there in porthmadog when you were in the office was there another UNK
well was er was
yeah
sending slates and er i think i don't know if there are any o er many of the slate merchants had gone
had gone out of business yeah
there were some of course in bangor and UNK
yeah
yes
from the
yes
but not in porthmadog
not in porthmadog i think i think that i think that brothers probably was the last
yeah
slate merchants
erm david the UNK was still alive then wasn't he i think
do you er did but they hadn't built a ship in porthmadog since nineteen thirteen
disappeared
no i remember i er i don't remember the yard
no
but i remember so i remember the ships some of the ships in porthmadog
yeah
because er on another er matter my uncle john from er
during the first war he'd lost a ship and so finally he decided to buy a ship and he bought two little UNK in f in porthmadog
one i think was the industry and the other was it the UNK that he says in
yeah
brandon yes
well i remember being aboard the brandon because uncle john came and stayed with us at the cliff and er father was at sea somewhere but he came and stayed with us and then he now went down into er to see his captain cos they were sailing on the tide the next day
i think they were going somewhere to ireland i'm not sure but they had a load of slates
for somewhere and something else
may maybe something i don't know what they
how many crew would there be on the brandon
about four or five
and anyway they sailed cos i was aboard the night before they sailed as a
this was about nineteen seventeen
you see i i'd be about seven
but i was interested in the sea i wanted to go to sea and er uncle john was my UNK uncle i thought
yeah
very fond of
and erm he'd gone to sea at a very early age and had er both steam and sail and you k i've given you his history er and he was quite a fellow
but the only thing i know is that ship was sunk by the germans in UNK bay
probably the next day
and i was interested in seeing er your t v series about this ship from porthmadog that was sunk in the UNK
yeah
but you didn't mention a thing about a ship being sunk in UNK bay
maybe you didn't know about it
anyway the only we know is that the lifeboat was washed ashore near and not a sign of men on it
so the men all were lost
and as i recall there was some talk that there were some machine gun UNK in the boat
in the boat
yeah
in the boat
and this was nineteen seventeen
about nineteen seventeen towards the end of the war
cos there were a lot of losses of course o in after the UNK had been introduced for the ocean thing but they hadn't introduced UNK for UNK
that's right
and this is where the ships were being lost
that's right
and of course
mm
a sailing UNK was duck soup
absolutely
and of course er the UNK bay is dangerous for UNK god knows but they were pretty good UNK
yeah
the germans were
yes
and they would be
they'd be they'd be on their way if they were going to ireland they'd be a well away from st patrick wouldn't they
yes
oh absolutely
no you w to go back to your days in the office erm you say that there was er this group of wo people working in the office
yeah
erm were there er opportunities for boys in porthmadog to get erm work or was it a period when it was difficult to get work
well er don't forget it was it was after the w after the war and the depression
you see the shell factory at er at had closed down and of course there was a lot of women and er out of work there and boys too
and the ex the UNK were just starting up
th they had been mi ministry of UNK works
yeah
making t n t in
yeah
and the quarries of course were er the pretty dead
the quarries never fully recovered really after the big strike you know
and also of course the fact that the german market had closed
the german market had closed
which was the reason the UNK
that's right because you see the german mark was UNK
mm
in the twenties
yeah
and er you the i even if they wanted to buy welsh slates
mm
they didn't have the UNK
no
and of course another thing and my uncle jonathan was a very great liberal and a great believer in free trade but i think his faith in free trade started to take a UNK because he was UNK by french and UNK er not slate er
UNK
UNK
mm
was coming i
yes
in other words there were very n very little new building
mm
going on with the specifications of slates
i remember for example having to send UNK of letters to architects
mm
and i found that you do not address an architect as mr jones it must be edward t jones UNK
yeah
and er because they were professional men you see
yeah
yeah
yeah
to come back to jonathan for a moment you say he was a great liberal he was an UNK of lloyd george
he was one of lloyd george's very early supporters
and er whether this is true or not is UNK it's part of the family er story that when lloyd george was UNK by the this family up in
er w and he'd been turned down by and all the other er top lawyers in
yeah
in porthmadog or on taking on er the bishop of bangor i mean that was taking on
mm
a pretty important er UNK you see
and er the UNK been told many times that lloyd george advised them i've forgotten the name of the old man but his wife was buried in the UNK and his family wanted to bury him next to her but they wanted the UNK
mm
minister
mm
to do the UNK
and of course the UNK bill had passed but no it had not passed then
it was one of the things that brought it about but they could bury her there but only the UNK
mm
priest could er do the UNK
mm
you know the UNK was UNK
so lloyd george as the story goes advised them to go there with their father and take some UNK with them and not to break down the gate to break down the wall and take their minister with them and bury their father
then he said the bishop of bangor will have to sue you
then i'll take the case
well he was just a struggling young lawyer in porthmadog
but a close personal friend of jonathan
jonathan was a was a coming up he was then not then a justice of the peace but he was a up and coming young er business man in porthmadog and of course porthmadog was a very er UNK place at that time
and the slate merchants were doing alright because there were thousands and thousands of tonnes of slate going through their hands
and so the story goes that he er said he would support david er david g lloyd george and help on this case
and the story that i heard which may not be true that he had he didn't have the wig and UNK
because it eventually went it a high court you remember
and so er well they hired it from UNK they did uncle jonathan paid the fee for the UNK of the of the UNK and whatnot to try this case
but that's what i was told whether it's true or not maybe the lloyd george people deny it but there it is
he didn't have much money you see at that time
what else do you remember about porthmadog you were talking about it d during the war years now for example when you were a very young boy
erm what else do you remember about porthmadog during that period
well i remember er there was a fella by the name of have you ever run across him
or
who was a second or third officer on the UNK
and he ended up as the port captain for UNK in new york
because they had to keep him there for so damn long in this inquiry er the UNK inquiry and all the stuff on the UNK
so he finally they made him port captain for UNK and i knew him
he was a contemporary of my cousin
that's one thing i remember
and then of course there was always young men being lost at sea
and erm my mrs jonathan my aunt auntie UNK invariably in porthmadog went to call on the families of people who'd been lost as my mother did in we lost you see in fifty two men killed in world war one
and er i remember one day there was nineteen of them
maybe it was the battle of the UNK i don't remember but i remember i had to go carrying the basket and mother would go and call on these poor people who had lost their families
and occasionally i'd go with auntie UNK in porthmadog you see
do you remember the any particular vessels being lost
do you remember
the brandon i remember
yes
because i was aboard her
mhm
that's right yes
but erm
did you see any of the other UNK in there
do you remember
oh yes there used to be a lot of UNK
then there was an old ship the UNK
yes the sea UNK
sea UNK now she became a UNK didn't she
yeah
and she was laying up by the quay by where they've got those
yeah
silly buildings now
but she was there when i was a boy and even when i went to school in porthmadog
yes
when did she b break up eventually
er
must have been the thirties
ye yes i think so yes
and the elizabeth came back to er porthmadog at the end of the war i believe and was erm she was a UNK and also didn't er david the builder buy some UNK for scrap or something
seems to me that there was some and then of course the wave of life
yes
i rem vaguely remember her
you may remember her yes
yeah yes
vaguely you see seeing her UNK up and down
yes
we'll stop there erm for a minute
does this make sense
now another er i remember after the war er 's UNK took over the works in
and they started er exporting whatever they were making UNK
a lot of them of course went to the quarries but then they had a little UNK called the florence cook and she UNK wherever she went and you probably know where she went
mm
used to go to liverpool i think
yeah
and some other places
maybe UNK somewhere
but she i remember her going in and out of porthmadog
's father was master of her at one stage
was he
was he
yes that was a point of contact
yes
and jack of course went ran her out once i think
yes
jack of course er i know i've known him know him in the united states but er jack jumped ship in UNK
yes
i don't know what ship he was on
no
no
jumping ship no he w he went to the united states so did you
when did you go to the united states
well i went to the united states i sailed from on the r m s UNK from liverpool on the twenty eighth of september nineteen twenty nine and arrived in new york on the seventh or eighth of september in nineteen twenty nine which was just one week before the stock market crash
and i was er i was er let me see eighteen years and ten months old
and er i of course always wanted to go to sea but er wh with two UNK in the family er mother w didn't appreciate that much
so anyway i finally persuaded her that i'd that i'd like to UNK to the united states and she we i had some contacts in the united states of course through her
i'm sorry to disturb you
that's alright
may i just put this on
yes
mr 's desk
right
i'll take these away too
thank you very much for the coffee
have you got your
very good
yes thank you
thank you very much
right
er now it's rather interesting er as an aside i'd heard that the central african mounted police were trying to hire young men of er at least sound mind and probably tough body
and the theory was that if you served thirty years in the ce central african police you'd be given a section of land in what later became rhodesia
and of course i wanted some land as i presume all UNK are land hungry
and especially since we were UNK er but anyway er thank god i wasn't quite old enough
and i didn't go but a chap that i knew from whose name i can't remember at the moment did go and he was killed within about three months of his er arriving in africa
probably i would have been too
but so then my mother my mother's father and the father of golden rule mayor jones of UNK sam jones born in were first cousins
and er golden rule jones there's all kinds of stories about him of course
he became a very rich man but he er ran his company based on the golden rule
which was
to do unto others as you would have others do unto you
he was the first man to organize an eight hour day and two weeks' UNK with pay
and erm there's a lot they've done some television work on him and anyway er in nineteen o three he came over in the you know about in nineteen hundred with his family and i've got a picture of them in that's where he came from in
and from is quite a he's doing some research into him and who comes form you know these people
and they're chasing him
well he was my mother's first cousin you see
so he invited her sent her a ticket to come to america for a year in nineteen three
but my grandmother was an old victorian my mother would not then insisted that she have a UNK so mrs jonathan auntie UNK went with her
but er according to my mother's great joy she got UNK even on the landing stage in liverpool and never came out of her cabin so she had a big time as a young women running around the ship
and old man UNK of UNK fifty seven varieties they were a big time and gave her a little silver UNK with UNK on it
sterling silver and i've still got it
but anyway she went to so she had she wasn't she'd been very pro american until i decided i was gonna UNK
but anyway she made me promise that my first day in new york i'd go to statue of liberty
now statue of liberty of course is in the news
and when i was when i got to new york i was met by two first cousins from two different families er bert who's er UNK of my mother's sister UNK anne in new york and another one william who'd been very successful vice president of or something
so anyway erm they met me and bert had to go back to his office and will said he had to go back to his office but he said what would you like to do
i said i'd like to go see the statue of liberty i promised my mother i would
well he said alright he said i've made arrangements for your UNK to be picked up and you'll stay with me in new UNK and he was going away and he slipped me ten UNK cos i only had ten pounds money
and he said here's a cab and you tell this cab driver where you want to go
so i had no idea where this place was i knew where it was at the chart but i didn't know where it was from pier fifty four in new york
UNK pier
so i got aboard this cab and the guy said UNK where do you want to go to
and i didn't know what this UNK meant
and i said i want to go to 's island
he said where
and i said 's island
he said never heard of it
i said obviously you haven't read the chart that's where the statue of liberty is on 's island
cos i had studied the chart to k know something about er and i presume i was one of the few people in new york who knew the damn thing was on 's island you see
anyway i went there and i was impressed i'd seen it from the ship and i completely concur with everything that's been said
how all those UNK and children of UNK that the statue of liberty means a great deal to those americans who whose parents or who came themselves from another country
now i wasn't coming i wasn't a UNK from anything except unemployment
but erm er the on that ship i remember we stopped at UNK
and i remember a whole boat load of these young irish lads and UNK coming aboard you know UNK and UNK
and there was a guy with one arm and saying you know come ye back to ireland
you know
very moving but we had a big time and of course when you're eighteen er it'd be an UNK
and of course er i knew something about america my mother had been there and er we had some c i had eighteen first cousins in america when i went there
but anyway my job was to go out to UNK
and stopped on the way of course in
and they tell the story you know about the UNK from or erm or somewhere UNK to america and heard about all his life as being the great welsh centre
and we got to new york
how much bigger will be
in his mind was bigger than new york
yeah
but anyway er new york in those days first time i ever remember i ran into the UNK you see
girls with silk stockings and the girls in er wales i must say and even in liverpool in those days used to wear stockings
mm
but these silk stocking things you know just
yeah
drive a man up the wall
but anyway er that's when i went and then i went from there to UNK
and er what i had done really was to skip going into the bank
er my brother john had been er gone to work for the bank in and unfortunately was UNK in an accident when he was not quite twenty
and he had UNK my mother not to ever put me in the bank
and the only examination that i ever UNK and with UNK
mm
er failed was the bank examination entrance examination in UNK bay in nineteen twenty seven i think it was
and that's one of the reasons i ended up i ended up in brothers because i had missed the chance to go into work with the bank you see
and i didn't want to go work for the bank
at police stations across england and wales more than two hundred thousand people will be given UNK this year
to get a caution they'll have to admit their part in the crime but they won't have to go court
a caution doesn't mean a criminal record but it does mean the police can solve crime with the minimum of fuss
research also suggests it UNK some people from re UNK
he's gone into boots he's admitted to doing the offence erm picking up some UNK from the counter in boots put it in the basket then placed it into his bag
and walked out
what's his previous his
he's
previous record
he's got he's got one previous erm which actually date back to nineteen seventy seven erm for handling stolen goods
come this way please
the best thing for this chap would be to caution him for this offence
UNK
UNK do you think he'd react to that
well he's been very UNK throughout the interview anyway he's you know he said sorry throughout and he UNK doing it now he's he couldn't understand why he did it
cautioning was originally intended for first time young offenders and those like this man guilty of a minor crime
what intended to do with yourself is were going to caution you
now what that means is that you've admitted the offence which you were arrested for which is er
but more adults are now being cautioned and for more serious crime
it was the government's own guidelines three years ago which encouraged cautioning
they said UNK were acceptable for all age groups for a wide range of UNK offences
there was no reason to limit UNK to one prosecution should be the last resort
i want you to sign here and er the bit at the bottom does say that you admit the offence which you were er b er arrested for and then your release for custody will we'll give your er property back and you will be released
right
if you sign just there please
the cautioning guidelines were intended to ensure consistency among police forces but in fact they gave chief constables wide discretion
as a result in some parts of the country you're three times more likely to be cautioned than in others
that's sealed in there you go sir
in some police stations we've identified criminals actually stand more chance of being cautioned than prosecuted
follow this officer she'll show you out
okay
for this man the UNK of several hours in a police cell is over there UNK be no court case no difficult explanations for his employer
all he has to cope with is his own shame
it's something for my wife which i can't afford cos i've been off sick so i thought it would be something nice for her
can i ask you what your reaction was when you knew you were going to be cautioned and not prosecuted
total relief
what would have been the consequences for you had you been prosecuted
possibly the loss of my job
it's a UNK lesson for you is it
oh certainly yeah
i'm grateful for being let off
cautioning has advantages and not only for the offender
it saves the government more than a hundred million pounds by cutting the number of expensive court UNK and it's a quick and easy way for the police to clear up crime
the most dramatic rise in cautioning in england and wales has been for adult offenders
in UNK according to figures obtained by public eye adult UNK have nearly UNK in the last four years
in hampshire the figures have nearly doubled
in merseyside too the number of adult UNK has almost doubled
overall cautioning for all offenders which was falling before the nineteen ninety guidelines were introduced is now UNK increasing
last year there were two hundred and sixteen thousand UNK given for UNK offences those serious enough to be tried in a crown court
but under the present home secretary michael howard the climate is changing
i think repeated cautioning and cautioning for serious offences are completely unacceptable and i know you do to
if the home secretary is worried about cautioning he need look no further than UNK his own constituency and the rest of kent
the latest home office figures show that kent has the highest cautioning rate in the country
magistrates victims of crime the police and even offenders agree cautioning has got out of hand
a more serious concern is the extent to which it is UNK faith in the criminal justice system
across kent crime rose by fifteen percent in nineteen ninety two that's more than twice the national average
UNK figures obtained by public eye show that fifty seven percent of offenders were cautioned rather than prosecuted
you stand nearly three times as much chance of getting a police caution in kent as you do in south wales
i'm concerned that er people are not being brought to justice
and er that er very often the criminal UNK are looking at it as a ways and means of getting out of coming to court
these young men are known to police in the county
some have criminal convictions all say they have been cautioned or warned by the police several times
one of them three months ago for a violent attack
causing UNK bodily harm to someone now you might say that's a very serious offence which you should expect to be prosecuted
it is but
then again all i turned round and said the bloke that i hit he said he didn't want to press charges but then i thought the police can bring out their own prosecution against me but they turned round and said no he doesn't want to press charges so we'll just caution you again
you must have been very surprised that you weren't pro
i was then cos like i done his jaw in i done his nose in and i thought this is it
i thought i'm going down this time
and they just said were caution you and i walked out of there and i started laughing
what sort of things do they say to you
er they take you into the office tell you to sit down and they look at you as if you're a little UNK
mm
and they say right mr we caution you for er what ever you done next time you do it we'll take you for court for it
you just walk out the police station i run up the road i was laughing my head off
do you think it's an encouragement also to erm go out and commit more crimes if you're cautioned
yeah you do you tend to go out and commit more crime because of you've been let out you've been let off really
that's the buzz of it innit really
and you go out and do the same thing again and you're getting le let off for the same thing all the time and you think you're going to get away with it all the time
yeah
i wouldn't say it encourages you but it sort of you know you're going to get away with it
you get one caution an and er i thought the limit was two you get t two UNK and you get took to the court
so i knew that i could go out again and get another caution that's why i did it really
then if i get caught i just get a caution and that's it
what does cautioning mean to you
nothing
you go down there they slap you on the wrist you walk away from it and go and do it again
what about if you'd received a UNK sentence
you'd think twice about doing it wouldn't you
if they like sentence me straight away for doing something like i'd think to myself is it worth it
kent went to the top of the cautioning league under paul now commissioner of the metropolitan police
when the new chief constable took over in march he ordered an immediate review
the result is likely to be far fewer UNK
i myself take the view that the criminal justice process generally is the appropriate way to deal with criminal UNK and i'm not too happy with the idea that people who commit criminal offences should be dealt with outside the courts
isn't it the case though that people in kent offenders in kent have become used to the idea that cautioning will be the norm
that they won't be prosecuted at least for some minor offences
i think this is not just a problem in kent i think that there has been a erm an undue er move in this direction nationally er for what ever reasons public policy was very much about keeping people out of the courts er i suspect that this is er a policy which is of doubtful philosophical UNK
in UNK crime rose by twenty percent last year we found that for the victims of crime here the use of cautioning has undermined confidence in the justice system
they can get compensation only if the case goes to court
this centre for the elderly has been broken into four times in two years
all on his own little willy number one
ooh
you poor old
many of the volunteers are pensioners themselves
the last time it suffered a break in the UNK badly damaged a door
he was caught in the act but got off with a caution
you lot of UNK
we had been told at the time he had been in trouble before
we got a letter from the kent UNK to say that erm he'd been let off
and i felt absolutely horrified UNK to think that he could have done that sort of damage and just walked away he didn't even have to pay for the damage he'd done
i was i was so angry and i see him a out and about and when i first saw him about i could have i could have run him down
figures we've obtained for the first three months of this year show astonishing variations in cautioning rates across kent
in UNK for example there were far more UNK then UNK the same is true in other places such as UNK and UNK wells
but in other areas like canterbury offenders are more likely to be cautioned than prosecuted
the same applies to UNK where according to our figures the same has happened for the last three years
so how can it be that there are such enormous variations between different parts of kent
privately police officers have told us decisions on cautioning can depend on how much or how little faith they have in the courts to pass adequate sentences and on how much paper work is required for a prosecution
i would be deeply suspicious if the level of consistency were such that the figure were absolutely the same in every area because that would suggest to me that no discretion was going into the process
if you were talking about er high levels of variance then clearly erm they need to be addressed
it is exactly because of that level of variance and because we considered er that multiple cautioning on some occasions i think on the figures i have examined about six percent of occasions er were UNK that we have reviewed our policy
are you aware of other people in the area
john would welcome anything that might put more criminals back in court
well not as many er there is the odd break in here and there but no one has had the sort of amount that i have erm
he's a former chairman of the magistrates association and has spent thirty one years on the bench
he's witnessed a substantial fall in the number of offenders appearing in his UNK court
they know we're out and they're targeting their premises
do you reckon it's the same man
this experience is reflected across the county where the number of criminal cases has fallen by ten percent in the last three years
he UNK part of that to the rise in cautioning
john joined other senior magistrates who told us they're concerned about cautioning
magistrates who are UNK in public at least are UNK the police they say their policy has gone too far
they are making decisions behind closed doors they are making decisions erm arbitrary decisions without the benefit of accountability to the public and that to me is the most serious er long term aspect of the increase in cautioning
you're concerned at there being private justice not public justice
indeed well i d i don't call it justice
it's private decision making
i honestly believe that this is a financial exercise that the government have imposed on the criminal justice system
now i'm not opposed to cautioning of course not the odd one or two occasion i think it's highly effective
but it is being used i believe as a UNK to get the government off the hook for financial reasons
what evidence do you have from your own court about multiple UNK
only last week the last time i sat in court er there was an instance of one individual who had twelve UNK in a period of eight months er he was still a youth so his name obviously can not be UNK erm and it's not only the UNK i wonder how many UNK he'd received as well
we as magistrates do try and be consistent in our UNK er throughout the country i think it's UNK on the police to be consistent in their approach to offenders as well and it seems quite wrong that someone in UNK gets away with doing something with a guy in UNK er goes before the court
there is a UNK amount of UNK er of a kind that if we were to practice such UNK in our courts there would be there would be absolute UNK and it's something of a scandal i think that er that the police and the executive generally are apparently able to get away with UNK which we are not
the story of dave is a remarkable tale of coincidence and injustice
he was UNK his local swimming team when police told him his car was being broken into
the damage UNK to two hundred and fifty pounds
those legs go
it was the sixth time in a year he'd been a victim of crime but this time the UNK two youths had been arrested
after a little while they got back to me and says right one's finally broken down the seventeen year old it took them an hour and an half we've broke him down he's admitted he's done it
i said right what's the situation now
they said we've got a good chance now of UNK 'em
would you be willing to UNK
i said bloody sure i'd be willing to UNK
i'd said after all i've had done to me i said you've caught 'em i'll UNK
twice a week for four months dave would contact the police waiting for news of the court case
in the summer he was stopped by the police for UNK his UNK van
when he returned from a holiday in august he had some UNK news
right i have two letters on the side i open the first one
the first one relates to the child who broke into my car i won't call him a child he's a bloody UNK as far as i'm concerned who broke into my car has been given a caution a bloody caution
caught him with a UNK in his hand he's admitted he's done it and he's got let off
ta da don't be a naughty boy again
i open the second letter would you please appear in court cos you were UNK you are being prosecuted
well i thought if that ain't british justice i don't know what is
to get two letters
in one day i is i thought it was a classic
thank you very much you've UNK it both ends mr
the final UNK it was the same chief inspector who had signed both the letters he received
one of the victims we have spoken to in kent received two letters on the same day
one informed him that the seventeen year old offender who had caused two hundred and fifty pounds worth of damage to his car had been UNK cautioned
the other letter informed the victim that he was going to be prosecuted for UNK his UNK van he was in fact prosecuted and fined
his comment to us was british justice that's not british justice
what do you think of that sort of situation
erm i would share his view
you think it was wrong that he should have been prosecuted and the person who damaged his car should not
well i don't know th the er the detail of the circumstances nor the matters that went into the judgement but in the way you have explained it to me and if all those facts are as are as simple and UNK as you as you say then yes i would agree with him
and you wouldn't want that sort of thing to happen in future
i would not
elsewhere in the country similar views are being expressed among victims of crime where the offender was cautioned
more than two thirds of people UNK in UNK said they were UNK that the offender involved had been cautioned
most of those said they wanted them taken to court
three quarters said they hadn't been consulted before a caution was given and sixty two percent of our sample thought offenders should only be entitled to one caution no matter whether the crime was committed by an adult or juvenile
the picture is different in UNK where a UNK approach to cautioning appears to have the backing of victims and those involved in the criminal justice process
but there are fears that the government's UNK attempts to clamp down on cautioning could mean the end to a well supported and apparently successful scheme
here there are few of the excesses of cautioning seen in some other areas even though prosecution is considered very much the last resort
there are certainly criteria being fulfilled which allows me to deal by means of a formal caution
just over a third of those guilty of UNK offences are cautioned that's around the national average and well below that in kent
can you sign there to indicate that you accept the formal caution then
custody officers are specially trained to handle UNK they follow a detailed grading system which helps determine whether a caution is suitable
points are awarded or deducted according to the impact of the crime on the victim for example and whether the offender is genuinely UNK
the person's kept himself out of trouble so is it really right for us to get him back before the courts again
it well may be that erm you know with the help that er he can be referred to they help him keep out of trouble again for a lot longer
okay thanks very much so they're the new cases
has anybody got anything
the key to the approach though lies not just with the police but with the UNK diversion unit
social workers a history teacher and probation officers get together with the police to consider how best to deal with offenders
he says he thought the passenger was then going to hit him so then he hit him first and er i think
the unit tries to keep the offenders out of court an aim that sits UNK with the government's new philosophy that prison and punishment work
but the unit also UNK with offenders to try to encourage them to compensate their victims
one of the units success stories is richard
by accepting a caution he was UNK a criminal record
birthday and i'd been out had a few drinks and that
a few too many
and i was walking past and for some silly reason i felt like putting my UNK through a couple of windows
instead of going to court he paid six hundred and fifty pounds for the damage and UNK to the UNK owner
it was quite a shock
yeah
and then we found out that they'd actually caught you
yeah
and you were jumping around for joy and saying
well not really no
hang him hang him hang him
well also i could think of
both victim and offender are satisfied with the way things turned out
however one problem with this UNK scheme as it's known is that the offender can't be forced to pay up
all of our UNK work is based on the fact that we want people to volunteer to do this work
we want them to volunteer to pay compensation to the UNK er to the victim because that way we know that they genuinely have concern over what they've done and they've faced up their responsibilities
they don't have to pay the compensation or make UNK in any way
it is entirely voluntary
in some cases though there's no victim to pay compensation to and there are always those offenders who clearly know how to exploit the system
it's four o'clock on a sunday afternoon
a twenty year old man has been called in for a chat with an inspector
do you understand why you're here
yeah
okay you tell me why you're here
for caution erm for carrying an offensive weapon
what i'd say to you is don't mess up and throw away the opportunity you've been given because if you do you'll only have yourself to blame
whatever goes on inside outside this man says the caution isn't a deterrent
it's not
it's just summat not to go to court innit
it's not got to court for sort of like four or five weeks get adjourned or come up to the police station and then like get your hand UNK
just listen to a copper sit there and talk rubbish for a few minutes
reckon if you're seen carrying a knife again then there's only one clear alternative for you and you've got to know what that is
do you know what the alternative would be
UNK sentence
you're now saying that potentially you would
do it again
yeah but if you tell them you won't you just get a caution innit
no fine nothing you just get let off with it
and you're out again on the streets
so it's a bit of joke really isn't it
yeah it is
system you know the system just suck
sorry i sound like a right one but it does
the UNK pathetic
while such attitudes UNK the police officers don't find them wholly surprising
there are obviously individuals like that
similarly there are individuals that go through the court system and are punished that are perhaps sent to prison and come out of prison saying it's not going to make any difference i now know how to break into every type of car every type of building
and they're a much more efficient criminal if you like
isn't it UNK for police officers to see offenders not being prosecuted
it's very difficult for police officers who are UNK visiting victims of crime every day to see an offender apparently getting away with it
but we must look at the long term view
our primary objective is to prevent or reduce re UNK
now we know that our diversion system allows us to do that
nationally the a UNK have see a dramatic reduction
at one of their regular training days UNK magistrates are hearing about the virtues of the diversion scheme
custody
this is the bear results in nineteen eighty three
these are the converted
here there is UNK support for cautioning
one reason is the ninety two percent approval rating it gets from victims of crime according to a local police survey
there are plans to expand the scheme in the county to take in more adults
magistrates say they're worried the government's attitude to cautioning may mean an end to this local initiative
well i think it would be disastrous
and i think governments would do well to talk to the people at the sharp end like magistrates who use this system work the system liaise with all the various components in the system and do know what they're talking about
they're appointed because they're intelligent beings and i think they should be treated as such and consulted
the new guidelines will tell the police to give no more than two UNK except in rare circumstances and to caution only for minor offences
this is merely the latest example of the home office UNK policies earlier pursued with such UNK
there've been five home secretaries in four years and civil servants are unclear which direction ministers will take next
one of them told me the changes they've put now are so dramatic there might as well have been a change of government
but michael howard is UNK
in the last thirty years the balance in our criminal justice system has been UNK too far in favour of the criminal and against the protection of the public
the time has come to put that right
one of the officials in charge of UNK the more liberal policies favoured by the home office in the eighties was david
now an academic he's UNK at what he sees as a policy UNK on cautioning
he says it'll fail
for large numbers come into the criminal justice system unnecessarily erm that is likely to set back the progress which was made during the nineteen eighties and er increase and reinforce UNK
how much of a danger do you think there is that we'll get yet another sea change at the home office and policies on cautioning and criminal justice generally will be reversed again
i'm concerned about a policy which is based on er conviction and punishment
i mean the policy that er i helped er douglas UNK to develop in the nineteen eighties was based on prevention consultation and cooperation and moderate use of UNK
a lot of that has been set aside in substance and certainly in the attitudes and language which come from the government
the court has considered the application for bail that has been made by your solicitor
UNK up on crime will cost millions
the new cautioning rules will put tens of thousands more in court
those with first hand experience of crime will be watching closely
you've got to bring back some deterrent to this bloody country otherwise the next thing you'll be getting is UNK groups and if you get UNK groups then this country is in a hell of a bloody state and you will have bleeding trouble
this offence for which you have been found guilty
the name of the game is how can we reduce the amount of UNK in this country
if cautioning could do that we'd all be right behind it
the fact is that it's not
it's not a punishment but even the UNK are not UNK criminals either
accordingly we propose to adjourn the matter today
the home secretary may care to UNK this thought
cautioning may have fallen into UNK but to abandon it will mean a return to the UNK policies that this government had only recently said had failed
accordingly you'll be UNK in custody for a period of seven days
thank you
hello
what can we do for you today
er well i've had a sore throat
it's about three weeks now

ah but doctor it's plain to you john's
it may be the best thing for him

and this is the start
this is what's in his head
he's no equal with anybody else

she even thinks
i know there was
see because he w he was slow he had trouble with learning
mhm
at school right
mhm
see he
s he thinks that all the ones that were at school with him are s talking
about him
mhm
that's right
still yet
that's what he said the first night he came in
aye
the f the thing is if he needs to go in for treatment he's only going to get worse if he doesn't get it
but he'll say to me
i said that and all
but as i like you know john when he talks about it
if they found out
i'm up there like i'm just going to stay up there i'm never mind to come back here

let's have a look at it again
mhm
it might be ready for opening or it might just have dissolved away itself
aye
sometimes it dissolves away itself
but occasionally that one it's sort of in between it could come out
aye
to the surface
get a needle and
or it may dissolve away itself
yeah
or it might disappear itself but don't put don't go putting bandages on it
don't put
leave it alone
and it will go either it will come up to the surface itself or it'll just disappear
mm
it UNK it depends on your own system but
it's come up a wee bit
aye and what happens is it usually starts in at the corner of your finger
aye
and then it UNK down towards your UNK
aye well that's
that's
what's happening
it sometimes goes the colour as it as it starts to heal up the colour gets a wee bit lighter

every
i'm just off for my line doctor
aye
apart from that i feel great
i've stopped smoking now for four month
four months
very good
the very first spending stacks of money now
i've not got any now
cos when you smoke you kept your money for your UNK but if you don't smoke you don't need to keep it
i thought you'd have been buying an oil well or something like that
i know i didn't realize
my two brothers are off on holiday now for ten days
aye
there's a lot of folk given up just in the past year
it's terrible
i mean that UNK to it i was like a UNK you know
oh aye
oh aye i
and all these years they spend
you
i know
you telling me to stop smoking for
that's right
that's right
you see they tell you to stop smoking
the day it happened the day you got this
aye
heart attack that was it
well what really set my mind was when i lost my sister and my brother
mm
cathy and UNK like in two
yeah
months smoking
that's right
that's right
i mean we we've got a friend and she used to smoke sixty a day and she never
even talked about stopping till her pal into hospital a UNK a bypass operation
and that was it
enough
tt
that was it
no chance
i've been off for three or four time before for long a few years and
aye
och aye
i know but
back to it
they go back to it this is the thing
and it UNK me seeing the youngsters coming out carrying
that's right
and you know
a couple of youngsters yesterday seven year old eight year olds at the very most they have one of these gas UNK up round the back of the
it's so that nobody could see them
i know you can't you can't
can't tell them
tell mine
right oh
morning mrs
good morning doctor
well now what can i do for you today
i've been coming for sh three weeks now
and i came to ask the doctor if i could get h r t and she took my blood pressure and it was too high
she chased you
so she didn't give me anything the first time but she
mhm
the second time
the second time it was a different doctor again and she gave me tablets and i can't remember the name
it was i just took the last one on saturday and i then threw the
aye
the wee white ones
aye
right
UNK something
aye
so
right
show us your muscles
let's see what you're doing to your poor old self
i don't know why i think maybe the tablets helped but erm i was saying i was kind of having second thoughts whether i was wanting to go on the h r t or
no
no
no chance
no chance
not with your blood pressure up like that
no er well she didn't say much but she
well no chance i can tell you now
whenever er
just get yourself down
and i thought er and er i had wee tablets that you gave me a while ago UNK
mhm
and i was wondering maybe if i'd be better going back on them
aye you'd be safer a lot safer on them
and they won't er they won't fight with your blood pressure
here just let your arm
on second thought it'd be
aye
it's amazing how many folk come up to see about it and they decide eventually not to
doing fine
you're fine but you'll need to stay on your wee tablets i'm afraid
and er i think you can forget the h r t
i will i felt maybe er when i came up to see oh i was having all these heavy UNK
just was it was really
mhm
mhm
pain up sore back so
and
falling to bits
to bits
then i had another i had another wee problem that i'd been i had been to see and it was doctor i had been and the doctor that i saw the last time er i had three big UNK on my back and she
mhm
says i don't know what this is
but this was a wee sort of lump that i had down at the bottom of my UNK
right
i don't know whether you would call it a lump or not i said to her it was like a wee spot
mhm
so she says well i don't know what that is she says
so i'll send you to the hospital
so i've to go on
yeah
friday to see
right
doctor
right
now have you got plenty of the wee tablets or are you finished
no i finished 'em
finished all that lot
right UNK
finished them on saturday
mm that's how i was i was saying had been at the hospital come back and says no my
no
tablets are finished i'd better go to the doc
no you'd better
you need to get that need to keep that down because if you do go to the hospital and they did decide to take that out they would ne d they would check your blood pressure and they would chase you
there's no way they would touch it at all
so
it's no i don't really know cos the doctor says she didn't know what it was either
doctor seen it first she thought i had pulled a hair and it was kind of UNK
UNK aye
and she gave me tablets
aye that leaves
antibiotics
leaves a wee UNK underneath the skin
is that what it would
mhm
be then
yeah that's probably what it is
it it's no really er giving me any
no
just no
much trouble or anything but it was just the fact of it being there
it's there
it's there
and it's always a worry when you don't know what's going on
and the trouble is it can turn UNK again and put the whole thing sky high again
but s what about your UNK are you needing any more of them
i haven't got them
i've no i haven't
nothing
been taking them
oh well
for ages and ages
keep some in the house in case you do get a bad spell
because they're s they're safe
would it no be similar to kept taking UNK instead of the other ones doctor
no
no
no they wouldn't affect your
wouldn't do anything
wouldn't affect your pressure
no
they wouldn't affect your pressure
they're very they're good and they have very few side effects this is the beauty
aha
of the UNK they keep the UNK down
aye
and they don't affect your blood pressure
aye
so stick with them if
you're having a bad time use them
if you don't leave them be
leave them be
but keep on your wee white ones every morning UNK
one at breakfast time
aye er i
er
oh well i took them took them regular because
aha
you gave me only thirty
yes
and that was enough
that's right
so
well we'll see you in a couple of months again
er will i have enough to keep me going
er yeah
you'll have enough to keep you going for a couple of months
could i get some
there we are now
see how the boy takes UNK doctor is there two strength of UNK
mhm
and he's
yeah
getting the lesser one do you think
would it be UNK for him to get the higher one
er
he's
with the with the bigger strength you only take one they only allow you one a day
mhm
he doesn't really i think at the moment he takes one and er he doesn't sort of take them like
mhm
constantly or er when he gets the UNK
er that's
sort of thing
that's
he takes
aye this is this is the very strong one
just
aye just one of these a day
when he needs them
i was going to put the thing in there but i thought i would ask first before you know
he's still living with you at
aha
hasn't run away and got married or anything
no not till the sixteenth of july
and he's not running away he's getting
same thing
same thing
peace and quiet
what about your own family
you still got them
yeah
oh well
yeah they're still
still keeping you
still keeping me out of UNK
still keeping
still keeping me out of UNK
are they keeping you out of UNK
ah well
oh aye
oh aye
okay UNK
okay
right
thanks very much doctor
cheerio now
cheerio
come in
good morning
morning
you're a stranger
aye
what can we do for you this morning
it's my pills
i need pills
you need some poison
i'm only needing the UNK and er UNK
UNK what about your spray walter
no
no i'm alright for that
i'm okay for
you're alright for your spray
so that's i am due my line too

doctor
right
cheerio now
next patient dr
come in come in
morning doctor
good morning
now what can i do for this lady
my daughter's doctor
i didn't really want had a UNK another lump there
another lump
it might only be breast tissue i don't know that
mhm
let's have a wee look
and she called him in on sunday night i mean i wouldn't have
no
right
it's hard
but i it's like where the stitches are you know
where the stitches were right
well partly where they are
right er
i just happened to feel it because the UNK haven't been healing doctor
has it not
using that erm what's the name of the cream
that UNK cream
UNK
aha
right
well i've been to see mr and then i was off again to see him and he said i was right
but he didn't say whether i just continued with the cream but it was the other night i just felt wee
could be a bit of breast tissue i don't know
but it is quite a hard lump
aye he was quite happy
he couldn't feel anything
no he
to worry about
mhm
that's what he said
yes
here i felt a lump
yes
in a different
aye it's a different bit
it's higher
it's up he didn't actually examine that part where i think there's a lump
see after a breast operation does it take a long time with stitches
oh yes
oh aye
aye cos i tried the UNK and i tried the but it just catches and then er
and it's
keeps rubbing against this is
so sore
aye
that's the worst bit
that's the worst bit
but
in here
but that's no where the lump is
let's have a wee look at this lump and see what
stupid you're into a state isn't it
no not
cos
in that bit
see what's going on here
oh right you know what i
that it
oh
i think that's your UNK
my UNK
i think that's your UNK
no
aha that's right
oh yeah
that my UNK
that feels like a UNK
oh jesus
is it
aye
that's your other one that's the one on top there's the one underneath
and then there's the other one's just underneath that so there
oh it's a UNK then
see that that's your UNK
aha
it's hard
aye oh it's hard
very hard
because so was the last lump hard and then it was like you know
that's right
that's hard yeah
right
that's
er the edge of your UNK
i don't think i don't feel anything else there katrina
now when are you going back to see mr
i go back
right
i'll drop
him a wee note and tell him that you that you know you can feel this er i'll tell him i've had a look at it and think it's the UNK that's showing through
i'll see what he says
i've had a lot of bother with a wee bit of red UNK
aye up the top
that's the stitches
you know it's a bit of a and it's really sore like
and then as the day goes on i've got to go and tear this off cos it gets these bits get red
red raw
oh really sore doctor you cannae
right
then it comes in like a UNK feeling
like a ne a UNK you
right
know
and it's just
sounds
the clothes that are doing that
aye it sounds like the stitches right enough
and does that take a long time
i mean
yes
i thought i didn't think that it takes as long as that
i mean he did say they were stitches that come out er what
that there you get there are
some stitches that c
they stay in but he says that
that's right
in the body
but they don't come out with your you know your bath
that's right
they're too
they just integrate in the body
they're too deep underneath the skin
aye he said that
the way the way
cos i heard it takes as long
that's why they take so long
there's now
just keep on with that cream
u use this stuff instead of that er UNK it's
aha
slightly stronger
aha
and that might do that i'll drop mr a wee note tell him that you've been in
aha
so that when he sees you the next time he'll double check that
aye
aha
but i don't think there's anything
er
to worry about katrina
i hope not
no
no
i just i just felt that it was the cream the other night and then i just felt oh you
mhm
know b what i've been getting on friday and saturday night was an awfully big
yes
in my shoulder
up over the top here
on the shoulder more
yes that's right
i've always been getting a shooting pain there that kind of happened and i just
that's right
thought it was the stitches
that's aye it's everything's beginning to get tight
tight now aye
this is this is you starting to feel the sore bits
but er
i'll drop him a wee note anyway
aye
okay
right katrina
else i feel doctor i've
aye
got UNK and i've got the like the heart failure
mhm
and i didn't want any breast off naturally
no
i mean but see the tremendous strain that it's putting on me
ah
you know i feel that is left UNK because i've got to rip the UNK off at a certain time of the day
aha
extra weight
the extra weight
you know
i didn't want any off i think i'd have
right katrina
cheerio
right okay cheerio now
so doesn't matter
yeah you've met have am i the last
well i wouldn't say you're the last
but i have actually seen all of the others
right
erm i've seen deborah ray and cynthia
erm so yes in a sense
right
erm i the discussions have been interesting
what i did was prepare a supplementary form to the one that we had at the management team meeting
right
which lists the activities erm that we'd referred to before on the original note
yeah
and adds a few
and i have with each of the other discussions added other
yes
points
yeah
so i've got a number i mean i started with had about fifteen we've now got about ninety six
ooh
erm they'll probably all common off quite a bit
yeah
all i'm gonna do after this is UNK the list with all of the points that each person has agreed
i'm not saying to you or any of the others no i don't agree with that as a that's for our debate later
right
this is the list
and i'll look and see what ways we can collect the data erm to provide the er the intelligence if you like
right
and then we'll have the debate
but at the
right
moment it looks to me as though s if we do a spreadsheet it'll be something like eight foot six
long
but we'll only really worry about the last page if you
mm
like the last three or four columns
but as you say it may well be that erm we can look at it and say well really that factor UNK for that one
yes
in which case we can UNK because it
yeah
but obviously that'll take a little bit of time through discussion won't it
yes it will yeah
i'm not sure how happy we will be able to that but we don't we obviously have to try
mm
erm now
what i'd like to do
yeah
is i'll just run through the additional points and these on the list which have been raised by the others and
right
if you want to comment on any of those while we're going through or perhaps cross them off your list
and then we'll go through your list
so you'll know what the others have already said
okay
and then you can present yours
erm
well i wouldn't er i don't expect most things will completely but anyway we'll see
yeah
yeah probably yes
er i mean i've the number of part time centres
do you want this back
no you can comment on that
no right okay
if you would sue
and then just put on the top
erm number of part time centres half day sessions
yeah
the uniform agreement is that they should be graded up point seven five of a day
yes fair comment
wh which seems to me perfectly fair
yeah
and to be honest i wouldn't have argued if anyone had said whole day
yeah
you know cos it
yeah
it varies a bit
erm the number of further education colleges in the division
mhm
would include UNK like erm
northallerton
UNK
right
in the south
right
yeah
yeah
in the north it would include northallerton grammar school and the y c a p UNK
yeah
erm and i mean perhaps UNK agricultural but i mean that that's
mhm
erm they had a number of f e students seen in the last year
yeah
that's full time and part time
right
age seventeen to nineteen
do you want me to comment on that as we go through or
no if you
right you're just explaining it to me
you could if want to
yeah
if you want to add things then we can yeah
okay and then we'll go back on to it okay
erm the number of full f e students seventeen to nineteen erm full time and part time erm there are
mm
in a division
yeah
yeah
so that's you know greater percentages than those you've actually seen that's hundred percent and what you've seen is whatever it is
right so you
yeah
that's actually an additional one that you've put in
yeah
yeah
cos you'd raised that point
yeah
yeah
erm the number of sixth form colleges in a division as a separate institution
right
yeah
i mean not everybody's got them
number of sixth form students erm seen in the last year
yeah
yeah
i've got a scribble behind it oh annual report i'd get that from
right
and the total number of sixth form students in a division
sixth form students in a division
right
number of special schools in a division
mhm
and the number of special UNK students and pupils seen in years ten upwards
yeah
right
i'm not saying in here we also want a column of the total number of special needs
no
pupils cos we see them all
i mean if we don't we only gonna miss one or two
yeah this is a complicated one isn't it
yeah
yeah
now these this next band the annual mileage ones the sickness and the form seven projections for the next three years that data will come from alan
yeah
yeah
erm and this is going to be the area of horse trading i think
yeah
er i mean your point about how much time is spent in travelling a small number of miles in york
mm
ray made the same argument for scarborough because
mm
says the whole of the eastern division because it's all a UNK and it's
yeah
got the longest season etcetera
this where
mm
we're going to get some debate
mm
erm and
we well how
mm
has the sickness come about keith because i mean
well because if we got if we say you've got a certain number of members of staff and each full time equivalent offers you two hundred and twenty two point eight working days a year
mm
well if the sickness rate in one division
mm
is significantly higher
mm
than it is in another pro UNK
morale is presumably lower
well there may well yes possibly or they may have a much higher morale because they've got a much more UNK management style
yes and have more days off
yes yeah
i mean it came about because and i won't name names one member of staff for example has had an astonishing amount of time
mm
off sick
and in some organizations they would not be working for us any more
mm
or they'd have been in a different position
yeah
where sickness wasn't a such a crucial issue
mm
erm and i mean i've had a recent UNK i mean i lost my mum at christmas and got three days leave
mm
this person's had to three and a half weeks
mm
and not from UNK but because of the consequence of the traumatic shock of their eighty eight year old father passing away
mm
erm it's not fair on that division
no
so if we notice
ah
significant
right okay i mean it
differences
erm it's a case of whether i would've expected that an analysis of that over a significant period of time w would even out really
it might but if say we said over a year and we said there're a total number of fifteen members of staff
mm
yeah
and the average time off l fifteen members of staff is fifteen times two hundred and twenty two
mm
point eight
what percentage of sickness has that
mm
total number got
i mean see whether there the sickness loss as a percentage of your total of staff time is very different in one
mm
division to another
mm
over year but i mean in theory
yeah
you could go back over
yes
several years
but it really is no indication as to whether that's likely to be the case in the future isn't it
no not as raw data but yo you then go to use it as intelligence i e
mm
go back and look at so like this division was
mm
five times more sick leave than any of the others
yeah
was it all concentrated in one person
yeah
or all across if it's all across the division then that's a major problem of organization or something
mm
but if it's a single member of staff it's a it's only a difficulty isn't it
you can
yeah
solve it
yeah
theoretically tomorrow
yeah
but i mean i didn't want to exclude anything anybody's referred
we'll debate it when we're all together
and obviously if one person's
i think it
got more sick time than another they're
yeah
going to be more keen on that area of debate than their colleagues
yeah
yeah
i find it a bit UNK
well
i mean i found it almost as ridiculous as trying to sort of say well half of my clerical staff are fairly incompetent so i think we should have a sort of UNK rating for each of
yeah fine but if yeah but what we've got is hard data for every single member of staff and therefore every group of staff
yeah
on sickness rates
on sickness and we haven't on
and we haven't got a measure for incompetence but there's
no
a reason why we couldn't have is there
you could
no
award everybody on appraisal process
that's right you could
a hundred percent is efficient erm
yeah
and eighty five percent is less
yes
so you could add up all your members of staff and see what your efficiency rating
yes
was
er you know er
anyway
i'm interested in making this job last as long as possible but i don't think i want to go to retirement
erm ray raised an interesting point loading for management time for example ray would argue that he spends a UNK amount of time travelling to meetings more than any of the other members
mm
of the management team
yeah
you might wish to counter that because it takes you longer to go a smaller distance
well it d certainly does
right the of the reason is in
yeah
once you include that it because the more he's out of the office the more sheila has to cover for him
mm
therefore instead of perhaps her being fifty percent case load perhaps she
mm
should be thirty
mm
or whatever
yeah
so it's a drain on the time not just his but the knock on effect
UNK also introduced a holiday traffic for the scarborough and the whole division
mhm
to counter your busy york
erm the number of independent schools in a division
the number of independent schools serviced in a division
yeah
yeah
i mean servicing a school regardless of how many people there are is no but it
yes so it's not that's not on here is it
right
will be when i've written
yes
them all out
erm number of independent pupils erm aged eleven to eighteen in a in a division
yeah
and the numbers seen
yeah
yeah
erm UNK raised another point it's about for example the further education network links that he has to service the five n y b e c groups he has to service erm UNK work experience on the database
now my knowledge of that database is nobody should be spending any time doing anything with that cos nobody's ever said it works
erm the number of in terms of work experience there's a how many schools involved how many placements do you actually help find or whatever
how many placement providers are there that the careers service is actively involved in working with
it's going to be UNK
on work experience
yeah
right
because there's a wide variety of schemes operating across the county
i mean UNK is one and that has a certain effect
erm i don't know but there may well be activities for the divisional staff outside UNK related to work
yeah
experience
i mean you know UNK doesn't do it all
no th there
so
is an impact it isn't major other than on me
yeah right well that's fair enough then too bad
and it's the UNK of my life
yeah
i can't i can't understand why we're involved in it in the way we are
erm
mm
y t providers
yeah
erm y t providers linked to the division actively
yes
yeah
so
yeah
they might be out of the divisional area but you they might just as well be for the amount of you're spending on them
mm
yeah
y t providers associations serviced the numbers of y on y t erm numbers of applications for training per division
yes i'm particularly keen on that one myself
yeah
erm yes deborah raised that one particularly erm so this is UNK list now
erm how many f e students there are with special needs
yes another one i'm very keen on
yeah
erm a point about the c l as i e how much time does any each of the divisions have of c l a time
yeah
erm obviously got our eyes on jackie
erm the ratio of clerical staff to management and the amount of time managers spend on central management activities
yeah so how much time
hang on
are you away from your division
yeah
because you're involved in county wide or national things
county wide things yeah
and also how much clerical time is used up for non consumer activities in a division like supporting those things you go off to london and
right yes
brighton and bristol and birmingham
right yes
to do
mm
yes yeah
erm mileage per school linked to sessions
erm so how much time are you spending just going to the school
now we can't get that from alan's data because
mm
he hasn't broken down the mileage into how it's assigned
but if we get we it seemed to me i mean deborah raised it and i think there is a way of doing it which would be for example erm looking at the agreements how many schools have got agreements
how many visits are planned in the agreement
mm
yeah
and each visit is a session whether it's a day or half a day or twenty
mm
minutes and there's a mileage from the standard mileage list for that
mm
but again it's another one of these things that makes it really complicated
it does
there's a lot more work to get it we'll have to decide what
mm
we want to exclude
but yeah i mean on something like that there's a potential for getting erm b benefits out of bad management as well
in that you know if you're
too right
allowing careers officers to do t to call in at schools on a regular basis rather than trying to do
yeah
more than one thing when they're there
yeah w what i think it is it's a management control
yeah
because if one division we know how many each d i if we've got for each division the number of agreements the number of sessions the number of staff we've got three common factors different numbers obviously
mm
but if the ratio of visits to staff or visits to school is great really great significantly different in some
mm
then that actually says to that divisional manager
yes
you're not you don't seem to be using your time as efficiently
yeah
as others
not that you're going to get more time because
no
of this
but you could use it yes
yeah
i understand so in other words your research isn't actually going to tell us more than
it's more a control than a gift
yeah
it's going to tell us things over and above looking at staffing levels isn't it
yeah i understand yeah
yeah if we agree that's one of the things we want to include
erm and i think that's it yeah
er cynthia raised erm
yeah that's the numbers linked to the division erm cynthia i mean i was only going to be looking at n y c and c s funded staff yeah
yeah
because they were the part they are the structure of the service as it exists at present
yeah
cynthia also wants to look at t f e adult c s f erm and see how they're distributed
erm
mhm
i'm gonna have to look at how that can be done
because
right
she argues not UNK that it does have an effect on the management
it certainly does
because of the e o e particularly
i mean i have seven erm careers officers working with adults operating from york
yeah
and people like UNK and adrian are frequently through my door
yeah
and yet i've been in theory i don't actually manage them
that's right yeah
plus
so i also think that you know i'm quite happy to see something like that maybe dealt with in a sense as a separate issue because it's
yeah
very difficult to a to assess
yeah
but er
mm
it's is a factor
right yeah
yeah
mm
erm and the percentage of part time staff to full time staff which is one i raised
yes
because that has an effect on how you can use people
erm
yeah i was looking at that myself yesterday actually and er if i include three UNK staff erm there are thirty five individuals
mm
in york itself
yeah
and only seventeen of them are full time
yeah and i don't now but i mean i'm certainly in two i've been since there's people who've referred to the fact that they don't have those members of staff working for them at the UNK days
mm
because people have to come in on meetings so these people h
yeah
have booked their working days they're not the best in the division
i have an answer to that you don't have any meetings
well yeah that's a very good answer to that yeah but when how would you do research
yeah
erm but that was that was er points that are raised so far sue
right
so anything you wish to add erm let's
okay
add
well what i'd quite like to do is if we could go back over
mm
that keith
yeah
and there were a few things that you mentioned as you were going through that a you know i just really want to make a few comments on really
yeah
just to make sure that erm
mhm
y you're aware of my views really
yeah certainly
are you going to write them on down or do you want me to
erm do you want to do it because
i don't really mind okay and then as long as we agree what we've said
the you've got yeah w if we and we both sort of jot down what we've
yeah
then at least if you've got a record of what everybody's said
mm
in the list that you sent out in fact that one there
yes
that does mention cos as soon as i saw there were sessions at part time centres you know
mm
that's fine
erm number of careers centre operated of course is significant for deborah and i
in that we've if we're talking division we've got two full time centres obviously
yeah
so
ah i mean yes you've only got one centre
yeah
at york but you've got two centres in two oth you've got three centres in the division
yes that's right yeah
yeah and UNK got four
yeah
yeah
erm that's an area where the divisions are not identical
yeah
yeah
and it has an effect
mm
if york had erm five percent greater number of educational institutions there's still the same number of young people
mm
that would have an effect
have an impact that's right
yeah
what did occur to me though was if you were looking in terms of half day sessions
mm
you could actually sort of talk about right a full time centre is ten half day sessions two full time centre equals twenty half day sessions
yeah
and you could actually come up with an UNK total in terms of
yeah
contact time of careers
yeah
centre opening couldn't you
f if you used that sort of an equation
because there is a obviously tadcaster is the only part time office
it's only open you know a half day a week
yeah
but throughout the summer now i ought to find out for you exactly how much time in total this does accrue but we go to UNK library once a fortnight throughout the summer
yeah that's fine
erm th that's legitimate to include that
erm so i need to
yeah
i'm quite happy to put the number of full time UNK weekly sessions
yeah
and then what we would simply say is that i mean a day is one point zero
mm
erm and a half day in another location is point seven five
point seven five
yeah
erm but i just don't i'm not going to
yeah
argue i mean there's no it's not for any one of us
to come up
no
with the final list unless that one person is paul or alan
yeah
yeah
that's fair enough yeah
but i accept the point fully and that you should include any
now
that you do
how are you going to cope with er selby c or how are we gonna cope with selby college
it's the only UNK college
erm now
right okay
obviously we can't count it twice it's only one institution
yeah
so we either in terms of number of institutions i would think we probably count it as an f e institution because this the a level is much smaller than the other f e but in terms of f e students and sixth form students what i would want to do is count the a level students as sixth form students
yes
yeah
yeah
and the so i'm not sure
count all a level students as sixteen to nineteen
yeah
year olds
because the percentage of adults over that age presumably doing full time a level courses
yeah
is going to be minimal isn't it
that's right yeah
yeah i think so
so i must check that the figures i've already given you that's the way that i've done it
right
i'm not quite
okay
confident that it is
yeah
so
i mean i don't mind which institutional type you call it because it's not so much the courses it's the numbers of people and the numbers of places you have to service
yeah
isn't it
numbers of clients and the numbers of service points
that's right
yeah
divide er yeah i must check that out
right th the erm i accept that looking at work carried out which is what we've got in a number of instances like
mm
number of f e students seen
mm
erm number of special needs students seen and so on
if there were a few weren't there
yes
we got that
erm again that's valuable information
but there is a major UNK that was pointed out when we had our last discussion about counting that alongside other factors that you do a certain amount of work dependent on what your current staffing levels are
were you to decrease or increase those staffing levels then obviously that affects the amount of work you can carry out
there is of course a productivity rate that you could
mm
try and identify per member of staff
but i mean that would obviously be very difficult
yeah
to do
erm
yes there are services i know which are doing that where
mm
local managers have got UNK i mean f pe people using the account house or the erm one of the other major new computer systems
mm
where individual c s m r returns are entered by individuals
yeah
or the admin assistant
yeah
and you can actually say that the average number of visits this week was
yeah
three hundred and two
yeah
you only did five
yeah
what do you say you're doing
oh i was out at a school a lot
not according to this
yes
you weren't
yes that's right
erm and you can actually then produce a percentage
yeah
so i think that in terms of managing your staff and future staffing levels is relevant
yeah
but obviously we've got to be very careful about looking at actual work carried out bearing in mind that is
what we're doing now
yeah
all of this of course particularly related to how many erm year ten and sixth form and f e students we see is depend we're s talking about setting a structure from july of this year
yeah
and in less than a year after that the secretary of state may make it clear that our client group is UNK changed and moved
mm
up the age range
yeah
yeah
yeah
so all we're doing is what we're doing from july until
yeah
the new operating year really
that's right yeah
the only other thing i'd say is that the reason we're doing this is because we're facing cuts not
mm
not because we're looking at expanding the service
mm
yeah
so that's why i would tend to concentrate on what we're doing now
mm
what is our work as far as we can prove it today
mm
which is based on historical data but
mm
only going back one year
but i mean take for example the two office the two full time offices in my division
erm there are UNK work practices which i try to UNK but it is very difficult
mm
because obviously there's
so you don't agree in the er local accountability theory then
i you see for example york college of further and higher education is vast it is it is a very
yeah
big college
yeah
and our UNK into that client group is fairly small because we're er staffing levels and so on yeah
got a reason yeah
we know that as soon as we try and make UNK into that it would absolutely UNK
yeah
er and w you know we've sort of evidence for that
now in selby for example where i think a UNK bill and i have tried to offset the balance a little bit but in the past they have been better UNK
when we lost the i s c o posts the small
mm
office of selby gained a whole post
yeah
it was then really went into the school side whereas the same effect in york was much more minimal because
yeah
spread much further
yeah
erm which meant that traditionally selby gave a great deal more time to the college
mm
in some ca centres that's justified because of the sixth form
yeah
element of that
erm but i know that the true colleges it's a UNK service
yeah
erm and that is based on the fact that selby have were better UNK
yeah
so they consequently did a lot more work
right
in the college you see
but the only the only facts we've got is a number seen and the numbers that there are potentially there to be seen
mm yeah
now i don't know whether we'd be able to get that i mean
mm
whether the colleges will be able to say to us we have got
mm
three and a half thousand people sixteen to nineteen
mm
on any sort of course
mm
i mean if they did fine
mm
i don't think they will UNK
i think we should know as a service
but i don't know what else we could get
what sort of UNK we should expect to have
yeah i fully agree
erm i don't
no
but i think that's something we need to have
but if we know how many we're seeing in a in an age
mm
band yeah
yeah
and we know how many there are in the age band we can say we're UNK to a degree of
yeah that's right yeah
five percent or thirty percent
so we've got all i don't know what else we could add
yeah
at the moment
no
i mean is there
i i'm really expanding on exactly what that information tells us and in what sense you know there's certain bits of information that analyzed as a set of information tells us something
but it you can't then put that information together with other information because they're actually telling us different things if you see what i mean
all of it yeah
yeah
erm i think i think they're all telling us different things and they're gonna be int yeah
sort of UNK aren't they really
and they're gonna be interpreted
yes
differently
i mean this
yeah
is why i ideally with the original spreadsheet we had about five
yeah
items
that's right yeah
but it's the group that have decided that we'll have eighty five items
yeah
you see i would be quite happy y you know i through negotiation to say okay UNK college is in my division i know that there are UNK and so on
and we do offer them a service but they're a specialist college everybody
mm
there is UNK
yeah
committed if you like
and i'd be quite happy to sort of agree er a UNK level there that was a much smaller percentage than
yeah
you would expect in an another college
yeah
and so on
that's a debate area that's going to have to come to yeah
so i think that sort of weighting factors are quite important yeah
yeah
i mean it's going to be contentious because i mean erm certainly cynthia to a smaller extent erm mandy would argue that whilst you've got york college of further
mm
and higher education UNK got harrogate college of whatever it is now
mm
and you know UNK got scarborough
mm
erm numbers of those students whose addresses are in other divisions are
mm
actually being serviced at home in the home office
mm
how on earth
mm
the only way we're going to get that is the number of f e students seen
yeah
erm and i'm happy to include the number that there theoretically are
yeah
and we can make whatever judgments about that we want to as a group i won't exclude anything sue
yeah fair enough yeah
and you only mentioned that briefly once at management team meeting and it was included in all the discussions you know ray was the first one you know
yeah
right so where right that's the f e sixth form bit quite happy about that
erm special needs is a difficult one
mm
but i think that jane particularly will have a view on that because it isn't strictly a divisional issue
it is
no
more truly a county issue than some other aspects and i think that should help us out quite a lot
i hope so i mean
yeah
i did some figures last year on had this issue about distributing the special needs staff which wasn't in the
mm
m s u had planned it
mm
erm and what and because the decisions were made outside the division they were made here
mm
we just didn't get any
mm
yeah
it didn't happen
yeah
erm our special needs provision was a erm a scale six member of staff with no prior experience who'd had a UNK probation year anyway
yeah
you know
yeah
erm and when i looked at the figures we had a greater percentage of institutions and pupils than the other UNK or partner in the process
yeah
so i am interested in seeing
yes
what the numbers say
yes
well i know that my if i was to name my UNK member of staff it's the person that took on that
yeah
special needs work
mm
and erm i think it's erm an issue for us to look at as a management team whether we actually give it an even greater weighting
yeah
than we recently have done
i think that would be very justified
yeah
in actual fact
a lot of the work
yes it would y
comes post sixteen
yes
which is why i was pleased that erm
well it starts a year earlier as well
well that's right
erm but it's the i in york and in selby there are very big c p v e groups
mm
who have got quite significant special needs
yeah
and it th they're UNK time consuming and th that i you know
mm
i was glad that was it deborah had raised that because i certainly see that
yeah
as a major factor
yeah
it is
erm
yeah i mean
but again we're not in a growth area
no
you know the government may well have given a priority for special needs
o i yeah if we give a higher weighting to special need then we've to take it away from somewhere else
you take it from somewhere else yeah
we're not talking about s adding extra staff
but i do wonder is that might
and seeing who gets their share
no but it is an opportunity to actually
oh yeah
address that isn't it
yes it is
mm
yeah
yes i mean yes i mean
mm
i
which is why i'm a bit disappointed alan is UNK the discussions at two thirty on the day that we're meeting to discuss it
but anyway he's optimistic we'll have sorted it by two thirty
right well we will finish by two thirty then won't we
yeah
well we'll have to but we've got c s m t the next day anyway
yeah
but erm
yeah
okay erm yeah a again related to special needs it the number of training applications
yeah
erm which i think we can assume
is reasonably standard
in
well i mean the arguments i've had is that they're not
what that in some areas somebody wouldn't get an application whereas that they would in other areas
yeah
yeah
oh no sorry the numbers
are UNK yeah
the numbers are not standard i know i know that we have a very high
yes in theory we should be doing the same thing
i think most people would feel we've been doing it for such a while
mm
now and
yeah
i think that n y t e c would have said something by now if none you know if there was a UNK
yeah
or a vastly UNK er numbers
yes
that's right they'd
erm
have gone for the lower number wouldn't they
definitely low so i mean i s again i'm very
yeah
pleased that you're including that one
yeah
we are including
erm
it
what's thi we're including that one yeah
what's this annual sickness rate for c UNK and
clerk UNK
oh right
sorry
sorry i understand i thought it was careers teachers for a minute
oh no
ooh now that's an interesting point cos how much of a burden then falls to the careers officer
we go back to the incompetence argument again
erm i accept again form seven projections that that's obviously you know
yeah i know we're not in growth
no but we can't l year ahead
we can't ignore the next year ahead
yes
although there is this perhaps we won't be dealing with year eleven pupils
n i er well no but it still might be that year eleven numbers is still our UNK as paul called it in terms of so whether that's actually
yeah that's our that's our ratio yeah
wh the group
yeah
we're working with or not that might be our funding ratios
mm i must admit i'm UNK be interesting to see the outcome you know when audit commission and o f s t e d say that thirty percent of people who enter further and higher education fail
yeah
why are we concentrating on them
why aren't we concentrating all our resources before they start
yeah
you know
still
erm i didn't write down the other things that you mentioned as we were going through that weren't on this list
right
so i can't remember if there's anything
okay so we've got loading for management time
holiday
yes
traffic
so the management time was times b spent out of the office by divisional managers was it
that's UNK definition yeah
yeah
oh
yeah
f it'd fa fair comment actually yeah
if it can be UNK
yeah
yeah
erm
and if it's going to be relevant from july onwards if paul's talking about moving into different premises
yeah
it's going to knock an hour off UNK journey if we're in UNK if h q is
yeah
in UNK
yeah
yeah
erm and it isn't going to add anything to anybody else about from
the problem we must make sure ray doesn't include the amount of time he UNK extra he needs to arrive at every meeting half an hour early
well yeah that's right
yes he's not getting not getting
you know
extra two members of staff
no
because he's not using his time well
i mean
you tell him that
i'm not sure whether you see i think the management time issue is very related to this but i think it's a separate issue it's a major concern i've got at the moment that there is i mean i know everybody's got their own arguments but there has been no time at ever in the future that anybody who goes back further than twenty years in the service can recall where york has had such a small amount of management time as it's
mm
got at the moment
and there are a lot of as far i'm concerned there are a lot of cracks appearing
erm
yeah
and i think th you know i'm certainly going to be arguing that we actually address management time almost as a separate issue
well we haven't grown in the last three years as a service
mm
in the way that we have in previous years and management teams haven't grown in that sense but the responsibilities of management have been increased
and we're not doing yet the things that it was planned that we'd be doing of in a year
we're not financially responsible but we were
no
expecting to be but you know how could you be
mm
without any additional i mean
mm
the argument of m the lesson of my project is that without an accounts UNK full time here
mm
forget it
mm
erm and i suspect much you know if you're going to be financially down there unless you want to get involved in double entry UNK because you're transferring money from one fund
yeah
to another which is what we're supposed to be able to do
mm
without a part time UNK accounts clerk
mm
forget it
yes i agree
yeah
with you there
so i think i it'd be i can see it being a big UNK if we got into too much of a discussion in relation to this about management time
mm
because we could end up spending too much time on that
but yeah
at the expense of actually looking at UNK
yeah
staffing levels which is what
yeah i mean i hope all i will be able t all i will do is say well we've got about fifty bloody criteria here
yeah
erm i'll make up a spreadsheet with twenty five or thirty blank columns but with all the formulas in place
yeah
and we'll decide which ones we want and i'll just delete all the remaining empty
yes
ones
do you want the data to go in
i think we've gotta r
yeah
until we can meet and agree
yeah
some of the da all of the data i've g i can get i will get
right
yeah
which is the stuff we've had pre before most of which was centrally collected yeah
yes
erm the r everything else is an area of debate isn't it
yeah
really
i mean even the simple things the hard data like annual mileage is clearly an area of debate because you and cynthia would argue different points you know
mm
but what about things like post sixteen special needs
the thing about post sixteen special needs is it's like f e it doesn't happen where the clients live
mm
does it
no
so you know do you get all the credit for it because it happens in institutions in your division
or does somebody else get the credit f or does the credit apply equally because everybody deals with their own at home
mm
or do you get a weighting because everybody's dealing with their own but you're actually dealing with the institution and
mm
probably get some of their work
i mean
yeah
that's theoretically simple hard data
h i mean i'm really talking about the high number of post sixteen special needs people UNK has to see that i mean they probably exist in other
mm
offices as well but erm and i know she's half time and some offices have only got a quarter but as i say she's the UNK person i know and she's
yeah
very efficient
erm
what would you suggest for r for what would we do to address that
well in one sense i would like to see jane addressing it because she can do it from a non divisional point of view
oh sorry yeah i mean in terms of how what numbers do we
erm in terms of numbers
yeah
well i think to t we could try and make an assessment of the case load special needs post sixteen case load in UNK and we'd have to do it in terms of the work we actually do
yeah but
because
but
yeah
erm there isn't one in northern division
right but th
so there's no case there's no re no numbers
well isn't there
if they're saying they work with people that are post sixteen and a special need then they'll have to identify those people and have to say but th the
yeah but if you haven't got anybody in the post
right
if we h right
oh sorry
i understand what you mean
and we haven't had any post since last yeah that's what i mean is
right but presumably if that work's not just going by the board that's right
no it's being done by other members of staff
yeah
so i mean in terms of identifying
so if
the staff the UNK the post
yeah
and what that post case load is everybody can't do that UNK
yeah
but the total numbers of people f e with special needs seen in the division
mm
regardless of who they're seen by that's hard data
mm
and you could then if you wish say well we've got point five of a post and that person saw eighty percent of those or ninety percent or
mm
whatever
mm
erm and if in another division they saw another number erm but their particular post only managed to see twenty percent erm well that tells that the
mm
consumers are not getting specialist services
mm
for example and
mm
there's got to be a UNK
yeah
er i'm quite happy to include the case loads erm of special needs c os
erm
yeah
no i just don't want to exclude anything
no
that people feel are an issue cos together we have to exclude it
it's just finding a way of
well let's put
case loads active
yeah
erm special needs c os yeah
yeah
and i'm not talking about
not the UNK not the
specialists
senior
no
it's the special needs
yes
so not
yeah
senior
yeah
mm
yeah
i mean how we're gonna get all the numbers i don't know but i mean that's a when
i think
we see what people are arguing
yeah
what their people's cases are
i mean i think at the end of the day because we're w going to have to basically in a sense your job i think even though at the moment you're saying you know fine i'm not gonna exclude anything i think it's actually going to be sort of to try and eliminate most of this
i think so yeah
because at the end of the day i think that a although it's quite significant in terms of workload we might be able to address it elsewhere i mean i think the
yeah
special needs thing can be addressed
yeah
in a slightly different way
i think the management thing can be addressed in a different way erm excuse me erm oh i've lost my thread now but oh yeah that's right
yeah
in terms of when you're taking so much into consideration the actual lo loading or weighting of that factor would actually s turn into dr into something very UNK in terms of weighting i think
yes
i mean paul's proposal was to have a spreadsheet of hard data
mm
but we're obviously we've got debate about what really
yes s
is hard data now
to which we add a whole series of other factors that we then kick around and argue over
mm
so we so we distribute the staff based on the hard data and then you make cases based on other factors
yeah
erm and if you and ray make the same case then you and ray have to fight for the
yeah
share of resources if it doesn't apply to any others
but if
mm
everybody makes the same case
yeah
then either we ignore it or we well we'd have to ignore it wouldn't
mm
we
cos we're another four
mm
of staff
mm
so yeah small number of factors in the sheet and then supplementary debate items
mm
and maybe issues that are that are dealt with in a different forum completely but erm
yeah
yeah
right okay
just remind me again whether a goes towards the bottom or
networks links n y b e c work experience
mm
the number of schools in a division erm
yes
y t everything in y t
yeah
c l as clerical to management mileage to schools management time as you said
yeah so all of those things
economy to scale is another one deborah you need a minimum number of staff erm to service a location
yeah
i mean it's interesting i mean cynthia raised that point yesterday to which the answer i mean i'm afraid i have to say th the UNK answer is why are you telling me you need a minimum number of two members of staff at lunch time for a full time office in the centre of town surrounded by bloody phone calls in school buildings when you send one single member of staff aged twenty one
mm
to UNK who if she UNK through a bloody UNK wouldn't be heard by anybody
yeah
you know erm i don't know whether that i mean i think that's going to be another area of considerable debate
mm
how many people
mm
do you need
erm to be honest it's no good saying you need two members of staff every office on health and safety grounds
mm
or consumer satisfaction grounds cos we haven't got 'em
mm yeah
we can't we can't say can't erm really just UNK ourselves like that can we
no
i think it's an interesting
no i don't mind the contradiction but
argument because
yeah
i think you can i i've the same argument has occurred to me in relation to special schools
where there might be a very small number
mm
that almost regardless of the number you've actually got to do a certain amount
you've got to you've got to physically go there two or three times you've got to form the agreement
relationship with the school even if there's only one person there
yeah exactly
erm i think that you know i that had occurred to me in the past
mm
that we should actually look at a ce a minimum
yeah
number of days per institution and then the weighting over and above that is on the number of pupils mm
f for number of pupils yeah
what's a m i mean we could easily say it's
i don't think it's
you know it's go you could easily say it's a minimum of three days
yeah
just to introduce yourself meet the staff
that's right that's right
start the agreement and finish the agreement
yeah
and that is including
i think in terms of schools it only really applies to special schools i think once y even in some of the small UNK once you get over about forty or fifty then you're gonna have enough contacts
yeah
anyway
yes
yeah
erm to keep the thing going
but
yeah
certainly with some of the UNK especially where the numbers UNK so much from
yeah
year to year
mm
to maintain the relationship
yeah and of course you know when you've got a specialist school that is one site special education needs pupils nursery primary secondary
mm
all in one school
mm
erm that causes problems as well
mind you more for the governors but hard luck
so all of these are the factors that
yeah
people have come up with
i'm gonna simply list every single factor
yeah
on a single sheet i hope yeah
provide
yeah
a UNK glass
i will UNK those which i believe are s the simple raw data that paul referred to and the remainder are the
mm
you know the supplementary debate items
mm
but which have to come with numerical evidence
yeah
yeah
so really if we did agree that any of those supplementary factors were going to be significant
and they'd only be significant if we were expecting a significant UNK anyway
yeah
erm then we would actually go have to go away from that meeting on the nineteenth and c and come back with that information
yeah
for you to process
well unless i ask you beforehand you know
yes
i circulate this beforehand
yes
yeah
so we come prepared
which would be the best thing
yes
one of the other things you talked about briefly yesterday cynthia and i was er cynthia believes that northern division operates in a UNK different way to other divisions
mm
and sh there are a number of reasons that she believes that
erm but we were also looking i mean we were looking at you know how many staff you need a minimum number of staff economies of scale
now i d in our debate we had separately actually come up with very similar f processes
erm which was to audit what staff were required to run a division in a month of four weeks
mm
or a statistical month i mean a month of four weeks is probably easier
erm so we were saying for example and this is what we we'd actually come up with the five days of the week and the three categories of staff i mean i've just obviously put erm c l as are in either c l or e o really
mhm
i mean they're c o really in terms of grading and what
this in terms of th er the careers centres rather than in
yeah
terms of servicing schools or anything like that it isn't
n no everything
oh it's everything
yeah
ooh god right
so oh no sorry this was in centres
yeah
yeah
to staff the north northallerton office
mm
the way the standards require it to be we need the following numbers of staff
and we had to do it over a week and over a month because some weeks you do things that don't do
yes
the previous week
erm UNK richmond UNK and in the whole and that's a hundred percent
mm
erm and then see how many we'd got
you know
mm
you need that
mm
and how many we'd actually got
mm
erm and part of the UNK always gonna be there's part time staff who
mm
for a variety of reasons only work certain days
generally speaking those days are agreed by the member of UNK needs rather than the organizations interviewed
or they're historical and you can't change them yes
or historical yeah
erm or they're related to attendance at meetings you know er no
mm
good saying your job is tuesday and friday
mm
but actually we have a meeting every f every monday
mm
afternoon
mm
so i mean we've got more people in on UNK
mm
not because that's the best day for them to be in to do their work er it's not erm but because that's when the meeting is
yeah well we had we had to abandon that we UNK we brought all our employment officers in on a friday erm and we just couldn't staff the office the rest of the week you see
yeah i know
it's gone by the board and i have to confess we've not had a
i think a meeting of
me proper meeting for a long time
an hour a week meeting is means that there's not adequate communication
mm
in the office doesn't
mm
it
i i'm going to have to have more than one meeting and let people say you've got to come to one or the other and have them at different times during the week
yes
i mean i there is actually an argument for having one meeting everybody knows when it is and where it is and if people feel they're being left out or not b getting informed they should make the case that i am
mm
not being informed
or if
mm
it's evident that they're not informed because they're not doing what they're required to do
mm
erm they we have make sure they get n get told
but
yeah
we can't have
yeah
i can't ha i can't function on
UNK everybody comes in for an hour
we've got certain mi amount of erm the factor where people will say well i i'll swap that week because there's a meeting
yeah
i'll come in the morning instead or whatever erm but quite often it means if they're coming in they say well i'll be in town anyway i'll come in for that hour
yeah
th they're building up UNK which
yeah
has got to be taken off at some other time erm
b and one of the issues that we're talking about is operational matters not all of which is a matter for open debate so
mm
they're there to be informed
mm
of a management decision
yeah
mm
erm so as it's not an open debate to produce a decision very often and it will be less so i imagine erm they don't need to be there to listen to this debate
so they need to be there t to hear the answer
and the method that we're going to use
well those that are there can do that and contribute to some extent
those that aren't will have the minutes yeah
mm
or clear instructions that are
in you come
oh
that's better
here
here
come here
who's making all the noise
is it you
you shouting
there you are
are you shouting
well what can i do for you today
oh
well is the results of th that x ray in
i was away getting my hand x UNK
clear as a bell
is it
mhm
yeah
it's a UNK kind of thing
is it
yeah
i'm afraid
er
so
well i need another prescription for
yes
doctor see about this hair of mine it's just not coming back in
it's not coming back in
no
and i feel it's getting really thin
i mean
is that right
i have took UNK before i mean i thought maybe
mhm
it was because it was the wee one but that's her
aha
fourteen months so i mean it should be
oh aye
showing as wee bit er of improvement
be alright
yeah
but i mean i it's not
and that bit there's completely bald
to there
right
and this bit here at the top is kind of starting to go
right
get you over to the specialist and see what's
and i'm beginning to get a wee bit worried about it you know
er now
but sh er well UNK
are you ne are you ne are you need are you al you alright
aye
my voice
excuse me
you're not needing the pink ones
what
the wee pink
the wee pink ones no i've still got cos i've only taken
diamond shaped ones
still got some of them
is it two a day
two a day
that's right
aye

bye
this is old history project tape number two of mr of ipswich in suffolk
my name is the date is the second of march nineteen eighty seven
this is interview number five of ipswich docks
do you remember anything happening during the war down the docks
yes we had er ships wh we they call erm these liberty ships come in from america loaded with bombs and when they moved them up there well they call them down here they call them liberty ships and er the bombs were loaded so they used to erm put all timber between each layer of bombs and they had proper UNK who would fix all these and when the dockers went down they put these bombs out cos they weren't UNK the UNK were in the fore end of the ship right down the lower hull and erm the bombs were loaded into open trucks loaded into well the dockers they thought it was dangerous cos we had the fire brigade that's the fire service down there and standing by with the fire engines and dockers they wanted the they want a shilling i think it was a shilling a day extra well a shilling extra something like that and there they got it the shilling or extra pound cos us crane drivers we weren't on the same par as them so we asked for a shilling
oh no we couldn't up in the crane the dockers on the ground they wouldn't give it to us right we say we ain't gonna take any more out they we got the shilling
you got it
yeah we got it and another time you see when we wer when we used to be crane drivers when we first started crane driving the job for a crane driver was to do anything you were a crane driver but if your crane wanted painting you would paint it yourself chip to paint it
if a UNK you got to help the dockers down the hold if you ain't got the crane driving to do you had to go in the warehouse if there ain't nothing to do
but course now the present day they don't do none of that they drive the crane and only the crane they don't even clean the crane
and you actually had to maintain your own
and we had to maintain our own crane
crane paint it
paint it yeah chip and paint off the top of the UNK
what
chip and paint up the top of the UNK
chip it
yeah chip all the rust off
oh i see
and red lead it and then used to be off the top of the UNK
well you got on the cranes down there you go up fifty feet and then you had to go up another fifty feet to your top of your UNK
so you can say you're about one hundred and five feet up in the air
needed a head for heights
and you never had no safety belts or nothing just stand there and paint and stand on a piece of angle if you only want the laugh out of it cos the cranes down there are the swan lift cranes
yeah and y
what do you mean by swan lift cranes
well the UNK the UNK went up and then it came down like that well that swan neck on the UNK that used to be what they call level oven cos as y as you lift your crane out so this part would come up
the end
the end would come up and keep your load level on the ground you see otherwise if you were a straight UNK they'd come down and further you come down the further the lower your load get
oh that was a lovely crane
otherwise what they got some of the latest cranes out down there you had to come off the barrel go up the UNK come down again then up again
why was that
well cos that's to keep the level oven you see what they call a level oven crane but the swan neck crane that was one wire right from the barrel right over to your load
so the UNK was UNK
that's right yes yeah that bit that was just like what they call a swan neck just like the swan and that was like that and so it kept me at load level they were built by and some of the best cranes i've ever known on the dock
what were they used mainly for
they were they were for UNK stuff out for and stone cold general cargo anything
what sort of UNK came in though
