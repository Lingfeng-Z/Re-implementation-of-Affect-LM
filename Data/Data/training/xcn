oh we used to have UNK and sulphur UNK coal UNK you name it anything general cargo we've had loaded everything even dead bodies we sent there was one young one young person he got UNK up the coast there and they and he had to go back to holland and they brought that from out the warehouse and put it on the UNK of our ship his coffin they sent that back and they erm export er pigs to poland all live pigs UNK pigs
how were they loaded
into these just a UNK and they used to get the old pigs and they used to shove 'em in there shove the trap down and they used to load them on the ships they went back to poland
did anybody travel with them to look after them
oh yes they were all fed properly looked after alright but they all they told me they were all UNK but i doubt cos i don't know whether that's the truth but they reckon in poland when things were bad when they UNK them they'd make some excuse that one of these pigs got out and run away and course they used to catch it er somewhere they used to catch it and that was their fee then
for food
yeah they would let the UNK it we used to danish foods and cos we used to have a danish er we used to have erm polish ship come in one week and an english ship come in the next week and the bacon was just pigs were all killed wrapped in UNK and tied with string and they used to be laid in the hold like that
well after you discharged the ship cos all the blood was there and erm they used to have to wash them holds all out then and this bacon was put on open lorries and taken to london put in the UNK
now today cos they all and all come over in container UNK containers
how did they keep it cool on the boat
pardon
how did they keep it cool on the boat
well they UNK like UNK the hold the hold was UNK but after handling the smell was re terrible
was it
yeah
did you ever have any of the bacon
no i didn't no
never could fancy it never could fancy it
i know some people did but no
see during the war we had we had a lot of er UNK down here and they were all in these UNK fishing UNK that's all they were and they used to go UNK off the coast from here to UNK and then and UNK and UNK they had theirs they used to like meet and cos they used to be out four days UNK and in four days
cos they used to come in here for water and UNK you see
water and
UNK coal they all coal furnace you see and we er they'd come in and we used to fill them up with coal whatever they wanted lot of that went over the side coal beautiful coal that was
how did it go over the side
well when you had your grab you used to lower it on the deck of the deck of the erm UNK and when you open your grab that much a lot of it hold up in the grab you see you couldn't get so of course when you did take your grab up lot of it went over the side
did they get charged for that
oh no ch that was government money weren't it
government
all government money and when my father was after the after the war he had a little old dredger little grab dredger and they went along the quay dredging it all up and er course they took so much out the hole UNK it all good coal again
what they done ooh they had one or two bags of that
yeah
what other UNK would you have to UNK as a crane driver
crane driver television tubes light UNK do you know these UNK er they used to come er we used t they used to be made here they used to be sent over to holland and the brass bit used to be put in and the element inside and they used to go over there in cardboard boxes all loose and there used to be hundreds of them broken they didn't they didn't worry about it as long as they reckon that as long as they get twenty five percent a hold they were satisfied and they were just in ordinary boxes no paper in or nothing just all loose
and they went over just to be fitted with the
just fitted with the brass that was that was
all stuff cos then we they imported a lot of er UNK and erm all different television stuff and we had a lot of beer come in from erm germany lot of beer come the that stuff that's a dutch beer
i can't think of the name of the other german beer but the roll on roll UNK be out in the dock cos we had a roll on roll off in the dock at all
when did that come into use
well i would say er about ten year ago cos i was UNK then UNK and erm i used to go up there and i was very friendly with the old UNK there
i was going to ask you about your crane driving how long were you a crane driver
well i was a crane driver from nineteen thirty two till i went UNK what time would that be oh about nineteen fifty five i reckon
now UNK what did you have to do as a UNK
well i used to do what you're doing see you're in charge of loading the ship see but they did first of all they we had er we had a foreman UNK then we had and then erm we had the UNK and the dockers they went away on these courses down to ones they used to go to southampton and some went to hull but when they came back they called theirselves UNK so course our harbourmaster he say that's not right they're UNK well you gotta be all called UNK so captain come to me he said what are we gonna call you
i decided we better call you chief foreman UNK and that's what they call me chief foreman so that's what they call 'em today chief foreman UNK
and what did that involve
involve me i used to get out in the morning get up in the morning and be down there at six see how many ships and see how many what i want so many dockers on each ship sometimes they'd want say six sometimes eight
there might be another house foreman want a man who would stand on the house and they want a UNK so i'd go all these men for these different ships that was my job being chief foreman UNK
where would you draw these men from
from the from the pool see there used to be a there used to be a pool near lock gates that's where they used to be
one time that used to be further in the dock and i used to be let the erm the manager know the pool manager cos at one time before the war dockers were erm casual and when the war started then they thought UNK right we're gonna make er dockers more or less permanent so they all come under the ipswich dock commission then
instead of having they had to come through the dock commission all of the men they wanted so and so men for that boat they used to come through to me
before that though and had their own men
had their own men
UNK the boats
UNK the boats yes
they
they were employed directly by
that's right but they all came
they used to work say one week and have about a month off or go on the dole for a month
so then what happened was did the dock commission say you can't have your own men any more
that's right they had to go on a UNK
run by the dock commission
run by the dock commission
see the dockers then all got together and they said right so many men for that job so many for that job and that didn't matter who they were they had to their job all the way round the dock
whether they wanted to go on that job or not
whether they want to go or not they take their turn and the employer had to pay a percentage into the pool what those men earned so when those men hadn't work at all they drew their money from the national dock labour board
is this where the national dock labour board came into existence
that's how they come into existence yes he was a man what introduced that
when was this
oh that's er i would say about nineteen forty roughly i'd say about nineteen forty that came in might have been before that
before that then if they were ill
they get nothing
could they not get any welfare benefit
no
no they get nothing they'd get all they went on the dole well they used to get they used to get erm say yeah well you would get welfare benefit what we call the club you go on the club and you see used t i my apparently had a private club you could have both you see you had the private club and you got so much from the government the national health
the dockers even today see they're still got the still got the erm national dock labour board but now the employers wanna do away with it
do they
they wanna do away with that now making these men redundant
now they're not doing so much that many thousands of pounds that lot 'em took it some didn't
but they'll still need men won't they
they'll still need men yes
they can't do away with them altogether
they won't do away with them no but cos they they're trying to do away with the national dock labour board and come back to the old system
what just the having UNK again
UNK or employing their own men what they want i suppose
why did the work why was the work so casual was it because boats
well you could never you could never rely on UNK cos one time you'd get a lot of UNK and the next time you might be six weeks and get no UNK so who's gonna pay them their money
mm
that's the reason they brought in this here UNK the docks
but why did the dock commission decide to make it compulsory for the men to be employed by them and not by the firm
well no this was this was a government thing
that was the government
it was a government thing it wasn't the dock commission
see they said UNK the employer has gotta be the dock commission
they haven't gotta be or
no of the port is the dock commission
and what was the reaction to the dock authority over this
oh they didn't mind
they didn't mind
oh they didn't mind they were getting their money they were getting paid for when they were going home
see they used to get the they used t what they call they used to report for work at say quarter past seven in the morning and then they be at work at half past seven but now of course they don't now they i think they start about eight o'clock now
if there's no work for 'em they can go home for the day
and they get paid
and they get paid they say about used to used to be seven and six pence something like that but er course today that's different altogether
so really that was an improvement for the dockers wasn't it
oh goodness yes
dock paying for them
that was yes
big improvement
so when you say you used to go up to the pool
the pool is where everyone used to collect
that's right yeah
what would you do then
i'd i would go through to the pool man and say right i want so many men for the UNK i want six men for purpose
cliff quay i want four men south west quay on the coal boat for boat
i want eight men on a coal boat at quay
he'd send them then he every dock was numbered from one to hundred and thirty and he'd say UNK number one so and so number five so and so and of course when they come back to the pool they'd go on the end of the UNK
see so after men finished they would there'd be a steady UNK all the time
so they all have to be quite UNK
yeah they can do anything
carrying timber making timber carrying bags or today
none of it
did any of them ever resent having to do particular jobs
some yeah some did
oh yes i know one man there now well he's so dumb he'd rather go down the hold than he would do marking the pencil and paper
course he can't do pencil and paper
he's so thick you know he'll say right i'll go down the hold i'll do the UNK what they call UNK he'll do that loading these UNK or bags rather than him standing there and say well ten bags in that sling put ten down he couldn't do that so he'd rather go down the hold that's happened
did you prefer being a UNK to driving the crane
oh yes i did oh yes it was more of a job it was
in what way
i had more responsibility
you u use your brain a bit more see now if er they used to come to me my brother was one he'd come to me and he'd say right i've got a heavy lift so will you come up here and sling it for me but we had to put the UNK round the heavy lift say i say right i'll come up and another time we had a railway carriage come down like that'll be shipped abroad old railway carriage
well we had er we took out all the gear for that so i knew a lot being a crane driver i'd know what gear i wanted but a lot of these UNK what are on there now they were lorry drivers and they ain't got a clue what they do so there part of my job meant i'd go round and give advice
oh i see now you would draw the men you need UNK and go off and get the job done
that's right yes
see like erm l lorries and all like that UNK i mean i UNK we used to load the small ones and er we used to have two bars go underneath with a bit of wood on top and we used to have one hand on one end while they cos that was a damn nuisance
so i thought in my wisdom i thought there was easier way than that wh at one bar and i had one rope come under the draw bar with a tow bar so i said right one bit of rope one bar so all the UNK gotta do now is take the bar out take the rope off that was alright and you could stow 'em on the on the deck
they were all happy about that
and the dock commission didn't mind you changing the
more i did i never got anything for but that was easy for the dockers and easy for me
mm
i mean one time for gear then they don't we don't make slice ropes at one time
they don't slice 'em now
and you had to that yourself
we had to do that the UNK had to do that my first of UNK
make rope UNK
we used to get a collar of rope UNK rope put it on to a truck and used to stretch it out first and then cut off the lengths
we always stretched the rope first before you UNK it
and what was that used for
well for UNK getting bags out of the hold see the whole job was so interesting when you were doing these jobs that was interesting all the time
did that take you on to different boats from
pardon
did that take you on to different boats from
oh goodness yes
different parts of the world
i used to no i only went away on er we only went to UNK once that's all
i had to go over there just to see how dockers worked over there to see if i could improve it here well i couldn't because dockers wouldn't do what they were doing in holland
why was that
well they had one man in the hold and they used to have a UNK lift in the hold in holland with one man and he could do that job and they sent one man ashore well over here we had four men in the hold and two men ashore
well the dockers wouldn't have it here
no had to keep this four men instead of two
why wouldn't they
they wouldn't do it no
why
oh well er doing away with four men weren't it
mm
you see well they were employing two over in holland we were employing six
have things changed these days
oh they changed on account of all containers you see
yes
so eventually the they had to give in the end
oh they do yes well because nowadays because they got more men on each job now than they really want
i mean that there's half of them go down the dock now they don't do anything
don't they
no but they get the money for it
in the early days back to the early days what sort of boats would come into ipswich docks
would they be sailing or steam
er
going back to
UNK
your early days down the docks
UNK well we had one or two sailing ships in my early days come up but the majority are steam
what sort of sailing ships were they
well three UNK four UNK ships
but we didn't have many of them we only had about two or three come up and they came from australia
did they
for a week and th that in the holds then they were all that was we was UNK sacks what they used to call erm and they used to bring 'em out of the hold on a on a UNK and put them on the scale and weigh 'em and that's what they used to call catch weights
catch weights
catch weights so don't matters what it was but that man who was weighing them he got no brains if one was UNK and go down the next one gotta be UNK and he'd take that off that and put it on that he was so quick wh that's what he was a good UNK they were good men then
did you say
job they ever done
that was the only thing he ever did
that's the only thing he ever done to go and catch weight on all wire
catch or UNK
catch weights
k e
no i think you'd call it a c
catch
catch yes
c a t c h
yeah
catch weight
catch weights
and it was up to him to adjust the weight
adjust the weight from one to the other one sack to the other
would they be UNK quickly
well pretty fair because then they used to go down UNK bay and where they used to er the dock was in the hold that was all loose grain and they used to put four UNK to the so they used a UNK skip like that wh which was a wooden one with a handle each side and they'd go into the wheat
was that about two foot four
that's right and they'd do into the wheat and they'd on they'd UNK off one UNK had a big sack there they hold her in they had this one they build one in he'd go one in he'd go one and he'd go one four UNK of the corn and they used to tow it up UNK it out on the scale and they used to have a little old hand UNK like that with a handle on take a little out or put a little in and then them men down the hold them ones then he'd do so many on the left and they'd change over he'd do that way
they never kept the same place twice
why d why did they change over
well that was a lot easier i mean you'd get used to doing one way and that man so that's the reason they changed over so it was more equal
mm stop the shoulders UNK i would think
well it used to be carried on the back and
they'd carry the sack on their back
on the back the UNK yes
the UNK
the corn
do you know what the equivalent of is today
not now i don't no
no i don't perhaps the children
i don't
much the same now erm what do you call it now in that big all the rest of it now well
i mean looking at a book and see the distance between in there they give you the distance between leeds ipswich leicester and scotland and then you come to kilometres and
that's right
that's hard job to find out what to do it is for me any rate
mm
i'm too getting too old for that
the grain that came in was that heading for the mills
that all that's all for the grain and then of course we used to import a lot at UNK
UNK beans they'd be about that length they used to be just like a brown UNK they were dry
who imported those
er they used to import that
do you know what they used them for
UNK beans they used to be animal feed i think
mm
and there's children going to school yeah that be lovely used to eat this UNK
was it sweet
well it was in a sense
you take this erm that's like that's like er corn UNK
i've known when they used to deal with the UNK what they call the UNK mill that's er down at erm UNK mill down near the lock gates when they were making this here which were like corn UNK for the for the animals and they were dropped like this be nice and warm and
you were allowed in the dock with children
yeah well that was all open you see that was all open
it still is today isn't it
it is still open today it ain't in some docks
no
no but it is in the fish dock
oh dear oh dear
no the experience has been very good you know going through life all that time
what sort of changes are you aware of in the dock
changes
over the years
oh dear well i could say er work has got a lot easier for a start a lot easier and they ain't as they ain't as there ain't so much night work as there used to be
i mean er scrap iron i mean i've done that erm where we've loaded scrap iron ships but they don't do none of that now and when you load scrap iron put so much in on the floor and then dockers would pull it apart and then there'd then mean you gotta go and pull a lot of that scrap iron out load that off well that the UNK would say
do you want a couple of hours overtime tonight
so we'd go and work a couple of hours overtime or all night the scrap iron
it all depends on the scrap merchant like they used to send a lot of scrap iron erm from ipswich to germany just before the war well they used to send they reckon they send to UNK
mm
and then try and ship again into germany
that's what they reckon they used to do but he i mean he was an old UNK he was but he was he was to the germans
did that stop then during the war
pardon
that stopped obviously during the war
that stopped oh yes and the last the last erm scrap iron we loaded was er i think the japanese they bought the ships these old tr old tramps they bought them
tramps
tramps yeah old car
why did you call them the tramp ship
well they was an old cargo boat that weren't like a naval boat they don't call it now they don't call a naval boat a tramp well the other ones cos they're faster and th the old tramp tramps it was like an old tramp on the road and erm because we used to go very slow well th the japanese after the war they bought these old ships up we loaded them with scrap iron and they took the whole lot over to japan and cut the whole ship up scrap iron
do you know we had UNK of UNK of til tins all pressed together as big as that machine yeah and they'd dump into the ship and they used to have UNK put 'em into a net and these er UNK of tins any old tins they used to find used to go in there we used to tip 'em we used to tip them into the hold they cut the ship right up and that that's what we're getting back in motor cars now
shouldn't be a bit surprised and the amount of er stuff that used to come from er these UNK places in the army
cor there was boxes of brand new tools come down there UNK and they used to be the like these like a big UNK well they used to have couple of all with erm UNK up with erm like UNK paper over 'em bag 'em up into the holds guns there was guns what done with the guns they hit the er just near the barrel or the trigger th they used to UNK them out so they couldn't use 'em but they all went in the ships bombs or little UNK they used to find in there all scrap iron
and this was all being shipped out of the dock
shipped out of to japan
they went to
mm
and i reckon we now getting them back into motor cars
motor cars
shouldn't be a bit surprised
when you were talking earlier on about the bombs and the UNK coming in where were they stored at the docks or were they
no they right away
they went straight off
yes straight off yeah
where would they go to
i don't know where they went to these UNK or not i should think so
mm
cos i mean they were they were they had so many you know that was a lot
were there are lot
oh cos i mean they use today they haven't got these what they call are common users on the railway now
a common user was er just an open truck with two doors one each side and they used to put a UNK over the top
and then was is the general way of transport
oh yes on the railway oh yes it was
was the railway used a lot for that
eh
was the railway used a lot for that
oh it was then yes now it ain't that's not used once a week now cos you got all these containers see it's still the railway and felixstowe cos you got these here big freight trailer go on now
the engines that pulled the trucks were they steam
yes steam then they got over to diesel
mm so it sounded quite a dangerous place to be with cranes moving about and trains all over the place
yes
oh yeah i mean you take now the erm you could say nineteen twenty six bloke i remember an old union bloke he was on the railway and er when they cleaned the fire out cos he used to get all the out and er these here firemen on cool it with a that's when they first started to UNK the docks and he said well they er he said waste that he said when nationalization come in well there was a lot more wasted then after that
was there
yes
so when was it nationalized
oh i don't know just wouldn't know just after the war or during the war yeah during the war UNK the railways
mm
yes now it's al all back the same way again now
now the boatmen they used to erm the name the family of a name of and the old man the grandfather his name was and then they had three sons who were boatmen one was called arthur john one had a UNK of UNK the other one's name was george and they used to er some of them at times used to row from the lock gates out to the UNK together to get a boat so they made sure of UNK that boat in at er in the dock or at cliff quay and course they used to get the captain of the ship to sign er a bill and they used to take that to the to the shipping agent and then he'd pay 'em the money
course they got away with income tax out of that because they weren't they weren't much erm to do with income tax that time i mean my tax at that time of the year was about at that time was about four pound a year when i was erm when i was working and you only paid income tax once a year
it weren't it weren't pay as you earn then
how did they collect it once a year
well they used to send you th they used to get the returns from your employer and then they'd send you the demand note in so then
put that to one side did you
so you had to put that to one side
do you think anybody ever spent too much
that's in the oh a lot of people did oh yes lot of people spent the money but i was one of the fortunate ones i had a little bit left because i mean i was er i was very lucky myself i mean i had a decent job at that time from time i left school and when i was on the dredging plant i mean you take er in nineteen twenty five when er a UNK left school his money was about ten shillings a week as an UNK boy but i was one of the fortunate being a cabin boy on the dredger i was getting thirty five shillings a week which was a lot of money and then after a few months they i they wanted another deck hand so of course i went on there on four pound a week and then i was well off
that was that was what the crew were getting four pound a week and course my father that time he done away with a cabin boy so i had to do more or less two jobs see if i weren't working on deck i'd go down and clean the UNK and that's how that's how we kept the money going course then after a few years when they got to the finish about nineteen thirty one then the harbourmaster turned round and he UNK reduced our wages five shillings a week so we were getting three pound fifteen a week
that was three pound fifteen shillings wasn't it
three pound fifteen shillings yeah and that's how that's how the work went at that time but as i say these boatmen erm they used t they used to sit down on lock gates day in and day out and didn't have a ship to come in but i've kno known them to row down the river at high tide or it's before high tide and there'd be another erm there'd be other boatmen there one was called he went down he used to go down and get 'em going there used to be a race between these two families or the and the first one got the boat the first one UNK it in you see or wh what we call UNK in moor UNK the ship up that was
did they actually have to bring it up the estuary
what they yes what they done they used to have a large long pull with a hook on and attached to a rope and as the ship was coming up to the river they would throw this here pole on to a ship with a hook and then pay the rope out and then get UNK up to the quay the ship wouldn't stop for them to pick them up pick that boat
the boat would tow them
yes the st the er cargo boat would tow the small boat cos the small boat was only about twelve foot long twelve to sixteen feet all different sizes UNK boats then
but the UNK job was to moor the
to moor the ship up into th the quay
ship
so they used to know how to get there before
that's right yes
the only people what did have a motor in that at that particular time was the harbourmaster of UNK mill cos they always used to call er one bloke down there who used to moor the ships up at UNK bay and er th he used to get a UNK from the ipswich dock commission and all he w all he had to do was make sure that was clear of for shipping if there was a UNK in the way he'd go and tell them to move and he was what the we used to call him UNK mill harbourmaster
his name was er his name
then after him they had an a fella come from i think he finished up as UNK mill harbourmaster whether they got one now i don't know
and he would organize the boats in just in UNK bay and
he would he'd UNK ships up in UNK bay and that's when yeah he had a motor boat then to do that job
who would pay him
well the agent that be either or any agent who the ship belonged to see they'd get through no doubt they'd get through to the merchants and er they'd find out who the agent is and once they knew the agents well it was plain sailing wasn't it
mm so they were all
so tha at that time i mean they might get as much as three pound for UNK one ship up
really
but that had to be shared between the number of men
exactly oh yes that was shared between the men what erm there used to be two men so they'd get er share the three pound between them or five pound whatever it was
and did they must have had lean times if they sat around and waited for a boat one didn't come in some days may be
they didn't get anything at all
but they all sat down there waiting
all sat down there waiting for a for a ship to come in
i knew men old he was a chain smoker he always used to smoke UNK and as one went out he'd light the other one er ou on it he wouldn't use matches no he'd light one cigarette off the other
would have been cheaper to have used matches
it would have done but he used to be what we called a proper chain smoker oh he must have smoked hundreds of UNK in a week must have been hundreds that was his life
and did they have any other form of income other than
no they might be on the dole or what they used to call the board of UNK something like that
so they looked forward to a boat coming in
they looked they looked forward to a boat coming in
i mean i know in my time when i was a crane driver if they if one of them didn't turn up UNK down at cliff quay they'd come along to a crane driver and they'd say take a rope for us will you
cos they used t what they used to do in the small boat they used to UNK so much in the then they'd row to the quay and then the they'd run ashore UNK past the line and pull a river and put the UNK for 'em and then cos they'd turn round they might give us a quid for a drink you see
oh i see
so then they'd be about three pound or four pound in pocket and that's how they that's how we used to help one another but once they get one rope ashore they could do it the job see but of course there's no boatmen today now they call UNK boatmen but there ain't one of the buggers going in a boat i don't suppose they could row a boat now
they still they still moor them though do they
they s moor them but they're employed by the ipswich port authority the boatmen these other men weren't
so they had to the they were purely working for themselves
i mean the man the man what introduced that i think er was captain the deputy harbourmaster i think he introduced that
when was that approximately
oh that was approximately about erm well i'm talking about now in my time it must be over twenty year ago when he introduced that and the simple reason was there was an argument between the deputy harbourmaster and the boatmen which are the cos they used t it all happened over a ship called used to be a UNK used to run here regular and that used to discharge so much coal at cliff quay then it used to go into the dock at UNK quay and finish UNK because it used to bring two or three different lots of coal it was a four hold ship she had four holds and there'd be one hold for the chemical works and perhaps there'd be three holds for and that se
wh what happened over that one then you said th
well cos i letting the ships go and they that was a night time and course i don't know what happened over the argument but anyhow these boatmen they lost their job they n never been happened since cos the then the dock commission took over the erm UNK the ships in come under ipswich dock commission
were they paid just for tying the boats up or for bringing them up the estuary as well
no just for tying the boats up that's all
tying them up but when they went out to the end of the estuary that was just a case of get there first to get the job
oh yes i mean if they were going out to let go of the ropes
oh would they they'd have to
yes they'd get paid twice oh for letting 'em go and UNK 'em in i mean when a ship was swinging there's somebody i mean when a ship was swinging at cliff quay there's somebody gotta let go of the erm the spring what they're swinging on
the
when the ship was swinging round they'd go down the river th that here rope was still on the UNK so to throw it off
oh i see
when the ship was swinging round and that's what they do UNK still do that today
if the ship was leaving the port the boatmen have gotta be there to let go of the ropes
but they're now employed by the i p a
they're employed now by the i p a now so they're on a regular basis th boatmen today what they call boatmen today as i say they're not boatmen they're just UNK i call it
did the boatmen more or less live with their boats
oh no the boatmen they used to g they used to be go home one stay there the other lot others go home they knew within reason when the ship was due
oh i see but th they live in the dock area
well as i say dock area they might live about half a mile away that was all
so they could hear a boat coming in
they'd hear it th they wouldn't erm they'd know through the agent when the ships were coming they used to make it their business to go and find out you see but today th they even got telephones on the houses now so they can call 'em out
so just go down there as and when they're needed
there was there was no telephones then i mean t
must have been a bit UNK for you
oh it was yes i mean y when you take now erm er a UNK i mean and he like today well they ring up i mean today i know the ipswich port authority they lay the phone on the houses and they pay for it for 'em
do they
see so if th if they get time off and they want extra men they phone 'em up or somebody with a boat got bloke in the erm radio tower cos you got a radio tower on the dock now which every ship that come into port or leave the port have to go through the radio tower and that man's employed twenty four hours a day seven days a week
i think it's about i don't know whether it's three or four these men in the radio tower which at that day cos you'd never had a radio tower
how did they used to get the messages in then that they were coming in
pardon
how did they get the message down to the port here that a boat would be coming in
what years ago
mm
well because they used to know through the agent and of course them would have to hang row down the river and hang about
and would hang about for two or thr i mean when i was on the dredger them men would st they would come aboard the dredger and wait there do nothing until the boat came up the river
and they'd come on your dredger and wait with you
and they'd come up and wait them but i'd make them a cup of coffee or a cup of cocoa or something like that there weren't coffee then cos we couldn't afford coffee we used to have cocoa or make them a UNK of tea
it's the other way round now UNK more expensive than coffee
yeah it is yeah that's right that's what used to happen yeah
were the agents based at the dock
oh no they were based in the town at buildings used to be at the buildings
then they
mm buildings where's that
well that's at the top of
oh i know it yes
and
yes
their office used to be there now they got a place on the dock
near the lock gates
were they the only agent or were there other agents
no there's they were they were called but they were agents for their own ships
mm were they on the dock
and they were on the dock
these ones up in the town did the boatmen used to have to go up the town to find
oh yes yeah the UNK the UNK would go up the town cos every time a ship used to come in they got they got to take the their papers up to the agent what the papers were i don't really know might be a manifest or something like that what they used to do i mean then you had erm and you had different agents now there's more agents than ever now
there's so many different things changed today as well it's impossible really to erm keep up with it now today i would think
would you say it's better
well i would say it's yes better cos mean with th with th these erm containers you see now i mean we had about say ten years ago we had a man here he used to deal with the all general cargo all loose cargo from UNK and all the UNK ports but course now you got the trouble there now that's a that's a cargo that's what's fell away
going back to the agents up in the town the boatmen to get information about a ship coming in they would have to go up to the town
they would have to go up to the town yes
and find out
and find out yes
so was there very often a race up to the town to get there first
no i think they'd got to a point where you know if you if you were about erm they made sure they were the first ones there like the and they i think they more or less recognized by the merchants they were the boatmen
yeah in the know
in the in the know in my time and right
were there any other rival boatmen people trying to get in on the scene
oh yes they i say there was one man and the they used to try and get in if they could
was there any erm aggression between them
no never no
they just
i mean at that time say perhaps go in the pub the or the or the i mean there used to be so many pubs round the er the dock area then i mean you take the and erm then there used to be the erm there was all them pubs round the dock then UNK one or two more but i can't re oh the was another one
and they were situated on the dock
they were all situated on the dock and the is now what they call the
they call it now they just er they just made into er erm another pub a posh pub
oh yes i saw that in the paper
yeah
in the evening star
well it used to be that's where the that's where the used to be
and the used a little further past the and then there was another one further up near UNK well i can't remember the name of that
i can't cos they used to use that a lot
i mean men at the dockers that day they used to drink and drink heavy
did they
they did i mean the UNK at that time of day he'd take a UNK o beer into work with him
in a in the old stone jar
they were allowed to drink at work
oh yes there weren't no argument about that if they didn't they won't do the bloody work
they wouldn't i mean they were old men
bet it was UNK work anyway wasn't it
yeah that was i mean them men were working like we was talking about a little while ago about head bags
oh yes what's a head bag
see but we had a head bag where they used to fold a sack in half or put one part through the other and put over the head
a lot o lot of these here dockers used to erm have 'em made out of UNK
and why did they do that
and tha when they were carrying er sacks of er UNK corn anything like that
for a bit of UNK or protection
no it used to be just the sacks stop the dust and go down the back and i've known the time what er when they needed a regular gang of dockers if they went to work on er on er monday morning with a dirty head bag on made of UNK they'd have to buy the beer cos they had if they ain't got a clean head bag on or a cl clean UNK there used to be a little old UNK they used to put on just to keep the dust out the hair and all like that
did they make these themselves
they made them themselves or the wives did
yeah and it was their tradition was it that if one turned up with a dirty
if one turned up with a dirty one they have to buy the beer that's how they used to be
then course then they used to hav when the man stood in green i knew a fella named which we was talking about a little while ago and he had a pair of lady's stockings which he used to put over his shoes to stop the grain going in and some of these people in the and they used to have erm like er string soles with like UNK boots and they used to tie them on tight
string soles
string soles
wh
well they used to be like er used t as you used to UNK your hair they'd UNK a bit o rope and they'd make a sole out of that
why did they make soles of it
well the they'd then they'd UNK it on to the UNK or the firm would do it for 'em
well why did they do it
well they were a lot easier UNK
that's what they used to have f for grain
for walking in the grain
walking in the grain yes
i mean once you get er in the say you get on in grain and you got leather shoes on well you'd roll but th when you got when you got rope these rope soles cos they used to grip on the grain they wouldn't slip about
and they made them themselves
and well they some of them made them themselves some of them they were supplied by the merchant
mm
lot o think a lot of them were made supplied by the merchant and they were made properly by the erm you can say sh you can say er any UNK perhaps or they'd be a factory what made so many pairs like
when they when they stopped using them do you think anybody kept them as
oh goodness i don't think i think they stopped using them during the war and i UNK see that used to be like the UNK the UNK you always used to have UNK they used to have wooden soles did the UNK and then they used to have erm like a steel bar underneath or round the sole
why was that
and that well th well that was cos there used to be all hot UNK you know like coke red hot coke and they always had UNK then with leather tops
to protect the feet
yes an i mean and i mean in winter time a wooden sole and a UNK they wer they were nice and warm cos i mean you only used to polish 'em you used to put oil on them
did you
i mean i bought one or two pair of UNK when i was on the dredger and we'd take the UNK iron piece off underneath that's just like a shoe what a horse have like go round the
oh yeah
they use t they used to put th the band round the bottom of the wooden shoe
what on the front or the back
no UNK right under on the sole
on the sole
yeah right on the sole and cos we used to take them off the iron and put a bit of leather on and UNK the UNK with UNK foot oil and they were really lovely and warm in the winter
did many people wear UNK
oh yeah a lot of people lot of people wore UNK then
working on the dock
working on the dock yeah
i mean the they're a lot better than other shoes
what sort of people wore them
anybody pair of UNK from the UNK
mm
cos they use t they used to supply them
they supplied them
they supplied them t to their employees cos if they got an old pair they want to wear they'd UNK another one for about five bob
oh i see they'd put in for a new pair and sell the old pair
they would yes
that's what used to happen
but where did the UNK get them from do you know
no i don't know they were made by some factory
they weren't made locally
oh i sh i suppose they might have been but where they were made i cos i mean you get like they used to b they used to deal in all shoes no doubt they got them from them
i believe they still do trade don't they
i mean yeah somebody just retired cos is down on the now that's where is
were they trading round the dock area
no i don't know no co cos they ha they had a shop in i mean that's not far from the docks
did the did the port supply you with any protective clothing at all
the port they didn't supply you with anything my father was captain of the dredger dredging plant and they didn't even supply him with a hat
now they get everything
that's the truth that is
so you had to buy your own stuff then
you had to buy your own stuff i bought a pair of UNK boots and they were all made with leather and he and i used to put UNK foot oil on them and i could roll them down just like a b just like a boot
they were so s the leather was so soft and they didn't put nails in the soles they put wooden pegs
to hold the soles on
wooden pegs in your sole they used to drill 'em and they used to put wooden and them wooden pegs would n they'd never come out cos if you put nails in the nails would rust
what was this because you were standing in water a lot
that's right yes and th the corporation had to sewage out four ways to s supply 'em
i think that's where they got the idea and they used to be all leather UNK boots
was that the salt water
salt water
rust them
and was taken out o the they don't do they don't do the work now they used to do and years gone by
i mean i've seen men work underneath the sewage and now of course that's all UNK mechanical
where was the sewer UNK
sewer UNK was down at erm earth point near the power station is now and th and the
yeah and the sewage is still down there
and that still comes out the same place
that's still down there just so that was all UNK mechanical me
further down the river then
no sewage UNK is just the other side of the power station that's where it is
in the UNK days what did they used to have to do down there
there i mean in the older days they used to have a li little railway and they used t used more or less take all the sewage on to his land and there used to be couple little trucks where you tip over and they'd be one down and one up on and he old he used to used to be his put on his land
what UNK
UNK
they weren't such thing as er UNK what there is today liquid UNK none like that there was all human UNK
he used to u used to use tons and tons of that at the sewer UNK
was on the UNK
was it
no is near the where the is now
mm
where the is that's where used to be
what they had a railway run down from there
and they used t they used to have a little they used to have a railway from the sewer UNK a little one narrow one there used to be as i say used to have a machine up the top of the hill and they used to pull one down and one up
to the farm
farm yes that's how they used to do it
were they the only people that used to use it like that
that's about the only people that i know of and then cos later years i would say that they used to cart so much into the erm into the other farms round here
i mean i've known lorries to go down and get out the human manure
did they
from there and now course they got shipped out and then they used to be a ship as well used to take it to sea called the
did they
go from ipswich
used to go from ipswich they used to be the number one and they had the number two and the number two she got blown up in UNK harbour
what during the war
during the war second world war number two
was she carrying anything at the time
yeah she was
yeah i know i don't know whether she was going out or coming in but they got one there now and i think they th the one they got there now i don't know whether the corporation that's theirs or whether that's put out to contract and i think that's put out to contract now
what th they still take it do they
oh yes they oh yes yeah it's all pumped in and pumped out now
mm
how was it put in the UNK days
well that was p that's was through the tube i suppose
i know what when we were dredging down there we used to have er what we call our safe chains and when we were first dredging down there you'd put your chain in hands were all purple
purple
all purple
why
that was the mud cos they used to put so much sewage into the river
w why did it make it purple
and course that used t that used to go down on the bed and when you pulled that be there so many years your hands all went purple and that'd be days before that went off
days
did you eat your sandwiches
yeah true yeah
yes yo your hands used to be purple an and the brass work on the dredger cos we had we had a little bit of brass work they all used to turn green and to clean it used to turn green
they used to say the brass is on the other side of the river used t
well yeah th well that used to turn green tell you that now
and it was all to do with the sewage
all to do with the s i mean th the dock commission they claimed a lot of money off the corporation i think over that cos they
did they
they came down with a lot o little bottles and they filled all them bottles up with the mud and they took 'em away and UNK analyzed 'em and proved that it was erm human manure you see
contaminated
sewage
wasn't that how
well i suppose it was then but course at that time of day well what we used to suffer with you suffer with diphtheria and UNK fever and yo you don't hear that today do you
no that's all gone now
you don't hear UNK fever diphtheria like that
that's all gone done away with
i suppose in that way it's an improvement isn't it
oh it is an improvement oh yes
definite i mean there's not the sewage go in the river now i don't think anyway
cos that was about that must have been about erm er i'd say time about yes i should say about nineteen thirty four and they built a pipeline out from the sewer UNK and they put two UNK out there and they reckon that the water when it's UNK just to go into the river was really clean water
when you say UNK what do you mean by that
well they like little they were like little concrete stages they was two and the they were in the river off this side they were this side of the hall bridge
and what did they do
but they wanted to protect this here erm the pipeline what went into the channel
oh to stop the ships from
that's right yes
going over to it i see
when you were talking about your dredging earlier on you used to take th the soil that you dredged up in the mud in your dredger out t employ the UNK out to sea
how did you dispose of it
well the point was you see we had a dumb hopper the dumb hopper was UNK by an old tug they had to tow that dumb hopper to sea what was called dumb cos they ain't got no engines and so that was UNK to sea and then course the er the dumb hopper ha had four UNK hand UNK and then they cos they had the chains on the but the steam hopper
what are the
the are on the side of the hold
now the sides of the hold and the chains used go down they didn't have wires they had chains go down and with a big ring on the top and then when you'd the door out knock the pin out and the door would drop down the mud and cos the ship would come up because she got two side tanks on er a tank each side to bring the ship out of the water
now
what with water from the tank
just air was in the tanks the hot water in sea weren't it
mm true
so if y if you if you er what did happen
i mean if you fill a fill a tank with water that's gonna sink and now the steam hopper had a strong back on
a strong back
a strong back which was er say a what we call a back in the centre of the ship and course the d n th the steam hopper could UNK their own doors up by the steam UNK
they could put the hook in there and they could lower doors away so there's no need for the cos many a time in the dumb hopper when you knock that pin out they go down with the force and it'd break and it'd break the er the chain the chain link
then we had to then fiddle about and get the chain up with a big pole and UNK that up and we always knew that if a dumb hopper come back and they'd what we used to call they'd lost a door one of the doors used to break used to be about i would say erm eight doors in the hold separate doors and if one of them broke they'd fiddle about with a big what we would call a pole with a hook on trying to get hold of the chain and we'd see that there pole sticking up out of the hold we knew they lost a door so what they used to do they used to leave with the dredger and we'd finish that off before we load it had to
what you had to fix the door
we had to fix the door then of course the with the big tow on the other dumb hopper to sea
UNK
could you fix the door from inside or fr or did you have to do it from outside
no you have to you'd do it in the middle in the hold not in the middle of the hold on the side of the hold where your where your air tank was
once you've got that you could fiddle around with that and we used to lower a station down tie the end we'd do the best we could to do it
we'd always get one we never lost one yet
and course they were on hinges the doors on er the hinges on in the centre hole under the water and course you always knew where then to where to fit what we used to call fish for th fish for the chain
so with the pole
with the pole and a big hook on
and how did
and when we got and once we got that then
i don't know
we'd tie we'd tie a wire round the pole and UNK that up you see so far but you couldn't pull the chain up
so you UNK it up by UNK
we UNK it up on hand UNK yes
that's how the work used to be
cos we used to swear like hell if they'd lost a door
made a lot of work for you
that made work for us
and you say these doors were in the water
the d doors were in the water right low they were they were low say you wouldn't have had say about three foot of water in the hold
because once the ship come up that's still a certain amount of water in the hold which that must be cos then once you UNK your door up then of course you load your ship again and then cos your ship was going down the more mud you put in course mud is heavier than water
yes
that's why i reckon we got a river bed because erm they say mud is heavier than water
mm
was there a lot of mud on the river bed
pardon
was there a lot of mud on the river bed
oh goodness yes there's mud there was like cliff quay you had you had your mud and when you come to chalk and further down the river you come to UNK near al near the UNK and further down you come to peat then you come to green clay then you come to UNK you c you start to dredge UNK again UNK mill you'd dredge UNK and then right away down to the sea you'd dredge UNK
where was the peat
peat was al UNK
did they use it for anything
and when we and when we were dredging that up that used to be all like er UNK of trees and you could i mean you could see it when they come up it was very light
i mean you could never load er you could never load a hopper down to its UNK mark with peat that was so light and cos you couldn't put any more in so you used to have to take it to sea perhaps we well you would call it half loaded
yeah
bu but your hopper was full
but with only half the weight on there
and only half the weight
so when you had peat on were your doors in the water then
oh yes
the hopper door
yes they were in the water
cos they we yeah
they were right on the bottom of the boat
they were on the bottom of the boat you see
we when you say on the bottom sort of was the bottom put on the side slightly
no cos e on the bottom of the ship used to have your a your UNK of your boat so that is in the centre of the ship
yes
so therefore then your doors were connected by hinges to the UNK and from the UNK to the UNK that's where your door was so that'd swing on the UNK and then your chains were fixed to the other end of the door and you UNK that up on your UNK
mm
then put the pin in then you could load your hopper
yes
wonder who designed it
pardon
i wonder who designed it
well i don't know that must have been some clever fella to do it didn't he
like there is today i mean things are altered when you get a ship now when you get the dredger what was in the east anglia daily times er yesterday where a ship open in half so th they load it with a grab and that go to sea and ship open in half drop it down so there's no doors
there again you see they can still UNK out the air tanks keep it UNK
to keep it clear of the water when they empty it now
yeah
yes
moving on from the dredger back to when you were a UNK you used to sort out the different work for the for the men where did you used to UNK first thing in the morning
well i used to have me own office down at cliff quay
whereabouts was that
that was at er was near factory
and would all the men come to your office
no they'd go to the pool manager
and where was the
the pool manager what lo he at the finish where he is now he's at the lock gates
do they still meet there today
and they still meet there today and they get er
is it a covered building or do they just meet outside
er no there's a covered building and he UNK the men right away quarter past seven in the morning
in your days did they have the building then
oh yes they that was further in t that was further in the dock
whereabouts was that
and that pool manager wasn't employed there's a pool manager now but he only give the information to the national dock labour board
mm
but the man what was pool manager is employed by the i p a now
mm
whe where did in your day where was the pool
the pool was just UNK just beside the UNK office just a little further where it is now cos what we had what we call the yard that's where the UNK workshops was the UNK shop which is still there and then little further up th up the UNK east there was the pool place for the national dock labour board
oh the national dock labour board is still there isn't it
that's still there yes
oh i know where you mean
that he'd do that in the morning as a little part time job for 'em and all he'd do is erm the pool manager which is at lock gates he know what ships come in the day before and he really know the man and then in the morning they'd say well so and so ship has arrived but perhaps he might know it then he'd send he'd know what men to send and this cos i used to get the latest information they didn't worry him they worried me about UNK latest information and of course we knew what ships was due for the next day so we knew what allocation we wanted
did you ever have not enough work for the number of men you had
oh goodness yes they have today
today i mean they i mean when you take years and years ago when there used to be man handling everything same as timber i mean we had about three hundred dockers then
good many then
yeah three hundred now today you only got hundred and thirty because they the manual work
that's all mechanical you see
when you had too many men for the jobs that needed doing did the men get paid
they get paid through the national dock labour board
what they call stand by money
stand by
what they call stand by mo they do today they still guarantee a day's it ain't much mind you but they still get guaranteed so much a day
on flat rate
flat rate
and then they got more if they worked
if they got they got UNK or they got th the they get either UNK or they get so much for the job so much an UNK rate for the job
was there a time when they didn't get paid if there was no work
well before the national dock labour board
mm
see he was the man what brought in UNK during the war
mm
that's when you had a UNK government and erm then course he they UNK the docks then and course now ther one or two docks the they're putting 'em making 'em redundant because i said there's not the manual work today that's like london liverpool
see dockers are only protected when they say they go on strike they're only protecting their own jobs in my opinion
they're protecting their own jobs
why should we have bloody machines doing work when human beings should be doing it
i mean a machine d well they do they do carry timber but you gotta have the men there haven't you
that's true yes
i mean y when th i mean a gang on a timber boat they'd be ten men and one UNK man and that's eleven men
UNK man
ha er a man on the UNK t to tell the crane driver what to do or where to go well you w you would have four men in the hold making up UNK of timber
then you would have six men ashore that carry it away and stack it but course now today they don't do that
that's come already in lengths already UNK so all the dock you got you ain't got so many dockers there
so you just need your crane driver really to un to UNK the
that's all you want the crane driver and about three or four dockers that's what you want instead of eleven dockers
when you said they used to carry it away to stack it on dock
they used to stack it on the quay
on the quay
yeah
and then course that used to be different er used to be different size timber two by sixes four by twos inch by one er inch by ou i mean inch
inch by two and you had to tell these dockers what size it was and they'd take it out of that particular stack
mm and then what happened
and then after that when the ship was finished then they used to sort that all out the timber different sizes then y and then or were there their own people to stack the timber and when they UNK it they UNK it and they used to put UNK between each layer of timber and that was to season the timber
oh what to let the air through
let the air through
mm
but now they don't even do that
what happens to it now
that's all UNK up and that's why half the bloody stuff is rotten
before you get it
didn't last very long
well tha that is so today
was everything that was UNK off the boats UNK on the quay
not everything
i mean we import but we imported once erm like lemon peel and orange peel
what is that
in barrels
now that was er it was er or they were oranges what had been cut in half and they had the centre taken out so it was just the orange peel and that was pressed into these barrels filled with water and that was then brought up on to the quay left on the quay and that used to go to
every so often they'd come down and they'd take the bung out and put more water in
why did they do that
that was your UNK peel
UNK peel
UNK peel what you eat
cakes you we that's lemon peel and that's how all these oranges were cut in halves UNK out the orange and then all put in one bit in the other
why did they keep adding water
well to keep it all keep this UNK peel UNK well keep the peel UNK
i mean once or twice when we UNK it the beer barrel break and when they be surprised you'd never get it back together again
never
cos they s cos that's compressed in these barrels and that was all done abroad and once these barrels broke well you couldn't do nothing about it but we never they never there was none of that wasted never
they always used to cart it away i suppose to wash it and use it
did they
that was UNK peel
we had i think we had about two ships of that that's all
yeah
did you ever get any UNK that split or broken
oh goodness yes
yeah i mean they even wool we had begin th f beginning the war
wool
wool we had big UNK of wool come in and once wool was packed together and UNK that was heavy
did it ever break open
some of it did yes
the UNK break cos they never used to worry about it
what happened to it then
i don't know they used to cart it away
i mean er down the dock now they got a one big warehouse there now
in my time they erm the sugar UNK sugar UNK
we UNK that now you don't see so much sugar UNK now
i think that's animal feed
yes it is
sugar UNK
well y it always used to be UNK down at come from er UNK and UNK on the dock
from the sugar UNK factory
from the sugar UNK factory
cos i mean sugar UNK was very light
mm it was dried wasn't it
yeah dried that's just like little pallets
yeah
that's what it used to be
and who did they used to export that for
well we loaded one ship for america and we put so much in
but when stuff came down the dock to people off on to a boat would that be stored in a warehouse first and then go on to the boat or would it be
no they come with the lorries and we'd load it direct
direct
direct the same as erm UNK coming in a lot of lorries would come down there and get the UNK different say merchants different farmers they used to go through the agent and they'd buy so much off the agent this different UNK if couldn't supply it what they wanted
so the men had to be there at the right time you had t
oh well you you'd be waiting
so it all had to be organized really didn't it
oh it did yes
to make it work
yes
you had different companies do the do the job so you used to get say i mean th you get a receiver for that cargo well it perhaps he got so much for receiving that cargo then that was his job then to allocate it to different people but he cos that was another job for him which you don't do now
there ain't UNK now
how do they work it now
how they work i don't know
how they work it now
i don't know
things have altered so much now
so i years ago then there was a lot of smaller jobs for a lot more people really
oh yes
see i me so many agents you got a lot of agents today now so
you do not mind my taking this method of answering your letter and i hope that you i did not put you to too much trouble to locate a recorder to listen to the tape i am just too lazy to write it all down and think that what i have to say i can put it better in words than what i can on paper i'll let you do that part
the first questions that you brought up was if possible i would be very grateful to you for a brief description of the two raids to UNK pole ninth of october in UNK tenth of october nineteen forty three
to go back to the UNK one on the ninth of october nineteen forty three i have to state that when our crew arrived in england we went to er through school at UNK for a couple of weeks then we were assigned to the ninety second bomb group and they wanna be sure we fit in
at that time the UNK and UNK starting going on missions because evidently they were short so by the time the UNK mission came around the UNK and the and the er UNK had missions under their belt so this was to be my first mission
i flew as co pilot we had a UNK pilot who would be aeroplane commander the rest of the crew was green or also on their first mission
so that on er if you look at the crew picture this is the crew that flew the first mission to UNK poland except UNK the second man from the left is he did not go i flew the co pilot position
the trip to UNK poland to me was a remarkable one by the eighth UNK because of the distance involved and the location of the target that was hit in the daytime
i feel sure that the german UNK must have looked at it especially the leaders and saw where the eighth UNK hit and seeing what we did and gave them some thought and consideration actually with our bomb group going in we had no fighter attacks on the way in over the target we had UNK but we did not have air opposition then on the way back we crossed the danish UNK and i think of course by this time the UNK knew we were coming back that way and they had the fighters up there and this was our first time being on this mission that we saw air to air combat with the fighters against the flying UNK and in our UNK in our guns there every fifth bullet was a UNK and it was amazing to me that as the german fighters came in it looked like just a UNK of UNK going out but they were able to get in there knock down a b seventeen and leave it seemed UNK it almost seemed impossible to me that a fighter could go through that many UNK and escape UNK
evidently i did not see fighters go down that day but i know they did but this was a first realization as if there was somebody up there to kill me and i guess this is the point at which you realize that you are going to kill them before they kill you and all of a sudden we are in combat all our lives and we take a complete change in outlook from everything because up to now everything had been practise and training just for this except we did not have that realization that they are there to kill us who's gonna be killed first
i sent you the articles that i had in my UNK from UNK on october tenth i am looking now at the ones from UNK poland on october ninth and its headlines port UNK hit poland and prussia with vast damage caused by UNK raid on four targets deep in the east UNK german plane plants are UNK great weekend UNK and UNK get it again
underneath that i have another article to which was kicked out sometime later but i have it in here it says raid on UNK would surprise to UNK to say refugees in UNK tell how the non germans UNK in the streets but the two refugees eye witnesses to the american bombing attack on UNK october ninth reported here that the raid caught the germans by surprise and that non german workers stood in the streets and UNK terrific destruction
the refugees provided this picture of the attack which occurred with UNK thrust yet made into europe by britain based american UNK
the germans thought UNK might be bombed but not UNK since the latter is a polish city
germans were UNK walking in the streets when the alarm sounded but they didn't take it seriously and failed to go to air raid UNK
they came as a UNK surprise to them when two hundred american planes came over the city clearly visible in the UNK sky the italians kept UNK in two camps because of fascist and non fascist fleet ran around UNK trying to get fog machines working trying to UNK the target but the fog prevented UNK in the harbour for putting up an effective anti aircraft UNK
the UNK came in from two different sides of the harbour and from the direction and
five small war UNK and one larger vessels were UNK by the bomb hits on a dry dock
three coal boats and three UNK were sunk
the biggest coal crane and UNK machinery as well as six were damaged
the terrific bomb blast UNK every window in UNK
headquarters for the UNK and police were UNK
the germans announced only one hundred and eighty casualties but there were at least twelve hundred german military personnel and six hundred civilians including one hundred and twenty UNK
so this was quite a mission which i believe has not been adequately covered in the history and was a UNK of things to come and like i say we got through that mission without any damage our UNK got to shoot at the first german fighters and we were an experienced crew with one mission under our belt
the next day we went to UNK
now the mission to UNK was with the crew that you have pictures have the picture of as you look at the picture from left to right standing in the back is or i should say and his home town was UNK he was a waste UNK
the second man from the left to the right is his home was the third man was a UNK and his name is his home town was UNK and he was the oldest man on the crew
the fourth man in is from new york city he was the UNK and engineer of the crew he is now UNK
the fifth man is he was a UNK and UNK and flew in the and the man UNK on the right standing is from UNK c h u a l a r california he was a waste UNK for two waste UNK on the each end of the standing group
UNK left to right of course there's myself and i was from new UNK at that time
second man in is and he was from UNK texas er he only flew a few missions with me in training i'd had another co pilot and er i had checked the co pilot i had when the crew was organized out so he could go back through and come as er as a plane commander with a crew
joined us just as we were ready to go overseas he had just come out of er flight school and of course his heart was set on being a fighter pilot and here he became a co pilot so he was a very disappointed man and he did not stand up well in combat so there weren't too many missions about five and i UNK him off the crew and wouldn't fly with him any more and got then other co pilots to fly with me from our UNK
and the third man UNK the UNK who was from UNK m i l f o r d UNK and the last man is and he was from UNK d e k a l b UNK
now the thing about this crew and the crews that you were talking about from the hundredth bomb group the i guess the most famous crew from the hundred bomb group is with the roses UNK now our crews were at the same time
and myself or as he was better known came through b seventeen transition school at in UNK together and where the crews were formed so that the names in the army of course are worked UNK so everybody on my crew is trained with everybody on crew and their last name is just ahead erm in the UNK in the class that they were in so that my UNK came from the same school the same navigation class as
the same way with the UNK waste UNK radio operators engineers and all the UNK so that our crews were all UNK crew and my crew were UNK from the minute we were formed right on through i guess you might say the rest of our lives here even though we have not UNK together since the war but i have talked to on the phone one time when i was in new york city
the er other thing about our crew was that er one time there i guess after was the only one that got back and they had to get him back on flying service
he flew to our base the reason there all of his crew members to visit with all of my crew members
then one time after we've had a rough mission and trying to get back on flying status UNK we flew over to your hundredth bomb group field and this did the there with crew
once again each man visited with his own UNK that they'd gone through training with here in the states so we feel very much attached to the hundredth bomb group and
of course this picture was taken at UNK right before we went overseas to start our bombing missions so that the aeroplane behind us course doesn't have a name was one that was used for training
so when we got overseas course we flew with the ninety second bomb group the three two six UNK and er all we were pretty well into our missions i would say about six seven eight
when a new plane came in and they assigned it to our crew it being the principle crew and we got to name it and we named our plane UNK i do have some later pictures but er it taken in front of the plane of the crew that i was flying with at that time and the ground crew in front of UNK
but this is the crew and the picture that flew to UNK on the tenth of october of forty three and we had nothing out of the ordinary to report about that mission and that was the UNK mission the day before it certainly stands out on our minds because of the length of it and then of course the next one on the fourteenth of october to UNK which changed our lives
i don't know if you have the book by is the history of the ninety second group and in case you don't have it i would just bring in about these two missions
on october ninth the ninety second group UNK in the eighth UNK longest mission to assault the harbour area at UNK poland on the western side of the UNK twenty one aircraft led by took off at eight hundred hours and twenty returned ten and a half hours later
the aircraft by second lieutenant failed to return victim of savage enemy fighter attacks
the following mission to UNK on october tenth but ninety two ninety second planes leading the division
excuse me failure to combat when commanding officer directed the attack flying
twenty aircraft was UNK and sixteen attacked
covered the town in returning crews claimed it wiped out
photographs made after the attack on the german naval base at UNK showed the five hundred and fifty foot UNK burning UNK three other ships in the harbour were left burning and dock railway yards and workshops hit
that was directly
i was just checking here in from the book by and i was looking at the chapter here on roses UNK and er and it was on the mission to UNK here that er third combat mission once a day for three days' running was to UNK it was this ill UNK mission that made the reputation as the bloody hundredth and of course this is the one that he only came back from
they also see that on page hundred and ninety nine they have a picture here of crew of UNK and i was just getting about these names to mind his radio UNK name was mine was
nobody must have been his UNK mine was and my UNK was and i see his would have been
his flight engineer must have been mine was
that was very interesting and i thought a good write up of and the things that he did there to survive the world war two and of course i go back to when the crews were formed and we flew together training at UNK texas and at er UNK and then from there went overseas we went to er UNK and picked up new planes in UNK and it was we went to UNK area
now it was there that we became separated i developed a very bad throat and could not fly just before we were ready to leave for overseas as in his crew and the other crews that were there went on whereas i got held back and of course the way i feel about it is that week that i got held back saved my life
i hope this little UNK of news about the crews that were formed and especially the ones of UNK because that is what you're writing about since he was the only one back from the hundredth bomb group but how well we knew him in training since the two crews trained together and of course the flying part of it and myself have UNK our flying with our co pilots we used to just the two of us go up and we would actually fly a circle around one plane over another so one plane was and the other plane would fly circles around it and keeping up with it and this calls for close UNK between the pilot and the co pilot because as you're keen and went into view and then of course we switched roles and i would become the leader and he'd fly circles around me training with his co pilot
then of course the there were area combat missions area missions but these had nothing to do er with the work training i think that and i did and in developing of our crews so that we were able to survive and of course er our mission that we thought that would probably be the same as was on the fourteenth when we went to UNK and we made it back and not only that but we got back to england we'd manage on about the third pass to get in to this one field and there was another plane trying to get in and they went up and UNK out and after we were eating our supper here they brought the men in the fields er where they on the UNK field where they had landed the never got in so they went up and set the plane on automatic pilot and UNK out because they couldn't land the plane but we managed to take them out and i think there was the extra good flying training and i did together that made us able to survive the savage attacks that we had he had it on the UNK mission i had it on the UNK mission
so now that's about all i have on these two missions for you and i hope this will be of some help and er be only too glad to hear from you
you can continue on with this tape
go on i tell you what why don't you flip it over and start on the other side even though it says this side done this is an old tape from a UNK and er we were afraid to use it in our work but i think the UNK alright on it you flip it over and where it says this side down put that side up and use the other half of the tape and let me hear your comments back
because if you will have a had to get a recorder to listen to this side so you might as well put something on the other side and send it to me but of course there is no rush and in return you'd be showing you take off anything or any part that you care to use
come in
good morning
hello doctor
now stranger what can we do for you this morning
a long time
a number of years
aye it's a long number of years
you've got spots
mhm
i was told it was chicken UNK but i haven't
mhm
been to a doctor
aye
i've had this for over a fortnight
did it just come on all of a sudden
i think what happened it started on my legs here
right
oh UNK me
now for a while before i went to i went to
that's turned into
right
it's okay
we'll get that cleared for you
i thought it was
yeah
like that
no
four or five days and it should all be starting to
i hope it's not turning
a UNK there's a UNK that UNK about in the air and if it gets onto the skin when it's broken
it
was it
was it originally
well it looks as though it could well have been
originally chicken UNK
like chicken UNK
yeah
but that's all it takes it's just the skin to get broken and underneath the skin and it just UNK and it's
and you haven't seen my arms
same
alright
okay
my arms are really bad
let's get that sorted for you
it was chicken UNK and i'm saying to myself it's very UNK
what about is that UNK
yes
that's UNK as well
and the funny thing was i've
mm
only been off my work for about er seven days
i was at my work for a couple of days
mhm
when this started
yeah
so i must have passed it on
aye
UNK isn't nearly as easy to pass on as chicken UNK
in fact it's really you have to be living in the same house as somebody who's
i was ask asking myself
aye
you you've got to be using that same UNK you know that sort of thing
aha
you know actually mo all more or less direct contact
aha
before you can pick it up
mhm
so there's no terrible worry in that way that you've passed on to anybody
and that i wouldn't worry about that
get that thing
ah you could get it anywhere i mean even see the likes of that wee cut in the back of my hand
aha
well it could start off in that
just
see i always wondered because er it seemed awfully slow in spreading it was there
that's right
and a couple of days with nothing happening i'm saying well at least it's started clearing up but then
and then it moved somewhere else
it moved somewhere else and i'm saying i'm looking at it
that's right
the only place i've not got it is my UNK and my chest
right down the front
it had nowhere to go
aye
and it started on my back quite a bit three of four days ago well it's not just as bad but my arms are real bad
right
let's see if we can get you turned into a human being
oh dear and i'm saying to myself it was chicken UNK
aye but
i don't think i've heard of that UNK doctor to be honest
yeah
it's years and
it used to be quite a common thing
yes
correct
aye i remember
ah but it's y you still see it i mean we still see it about once or twice every week
mhm
but i mean it used to be every day
aye
we used to see it
so it all cleared up okay

when the skin when we ju move around in the bed the skin cracks open
oh that's it
it's all UNK here
aye
mhm
and the same with the UNK bits

this is interview number five of ipswich docks
before we talk about your working life at ipswich docks could you tell me where you were born
well i was born at
and erm i went to school at then at the later part of my life i went to UNK and then i left only for four months and went to er work for an UNK at ten shillings a week
i worked for a month then i went to the UNK and cleaners and i came home to ipswich in the on the easter time and i started work as a UNK on the dredger at ipswich at thirty five shillings a week for fi sixty six and a half hours a week starting from monday morning at six o'clock to six o'clock monday night

were there any houses about
pardon
were there any houses about
oh yes they start just start to build the er this estate
what estate is this
well this is well they call this the

did you catch many rabbits
oh yeah plenty and we caught them all but we weren't allowed to keep them
why not
no well we used to kill them with a stick but of course they used to lay the rabbits out at that time to see how many they caught cos that was a little bit of UNK for the farm labourers they used to buy a rabbit for sixpence then they go up to UNK for a rabbit
now today i suppose they are about eighty pence something like that
so they didn't mind you catching them
well they didn't mind catching them that these here UNK they come on more or less at the finish of the harvest over the field with the guns what was left

thank you
my father come to see me at one holiday and the easter time he see something happen and they didn't like him and cos all my as cabin boy
so you came straight back to ipswich
come straight back to ipswich
and you then started work
i started work on the dredger
mm what did your what did your father do when you were a child
pardon
what was your father's occupation
oh he was on the river he was always connected with the river my father and in the first world war they UNK the dredger from here to UNK and er he was he was in the army but he was connected to the inland water transport and cos they were dredging out the harbour at UNK
i have known him to come home he's had a weekend off with a UNK full of fish beautiful fish he used to bring home cos no sooner on the train and right home
mm
and they all come home lovely and fresh UNK and different types of fish
and that all used to end up on your dinner plate
that did yes
was your father a UNK then
he was a UNK yes see he was on the river first then he went on the dredger and course that's before my time and that was during the first world war he was on he was at UNK
course then he finished they finished dredging at night on at nineteen thirty two cos they said it was costing too much the did and erm they were building some new cranes down there so i said to my father and he was very friendly with the harbourmaster he said erm was there any chance of getting one of them cranes so when he went and saw the harbourmaster he said no he said the boy don't know nothing about electricity either so he said no nor did no other buggers he said they didn't know anything about it so he got the job
he didn't want to know anything he wanted to drive the crane so he give me a start
so when you started at the dock you started as what
i started as a cabin boy on the dredger
what did that involve
well that erm keeping the UNK fire which i let out several times
was it a coal fire
coal fire and er UNK the cabin out like that UNK water and soft soap
when you let the fire out did you get into trouble
yeah i just UNK at my father did well i said getting up at six o'clock in the morning every day and then go to work till six at night cos during the day i get tired so i use to lay down on his UNK then he'd lift his little hat a way up and he'd say er bloody UNK out
cos he'd want a cup of tea
so you cooked on the fire as well
yeah cooked we done everything on the fire
mm
yeah old UNK stove UNK oven just like the old fashioned oven it was so you had your full UNK and used to UNK in the oven and of course you cook on the top and you had about five different rings cos the fire is to put the UNK in the UNK to make the heat go round the oven
you used to cook all your own meals on that
do all our own meals yes my mother she used to mix up to say that we want er UNK pudding and erm she had mixed up ready and put the cloth on top and all i got to do is just boil the water and just stick it in
that was handy then
she used to make me a UNK the old UNK and anything like that my mother would make for us
you never went hungry on board then
never went hungry no my mother always have a good always used to have a good table very good we were a very lucky family anybody used to come in our house on a weekend they always thought there was a party every weekend
well my father was earning a good money
i mean women men in the warehouse they were on about two UNK a week
now my father was earning five pounds seven and six twelve and six a week so there was a big difference in money weren't there and then you see be that list when they finished dredging he had to drop right back two pounds thirteen a week
what else did you do just as a cabin boy
what else if i have to go and relieve er if i want er to only work down the cabin and it come to meal times cos we carried on dredging from six in the morning we do al all the UNK round cos they eat on the dredger they used to eat three UNK four UNK on the dredger cos they'd UNK the dredger across the river and back again wo when they come to meal times i used to have to go on and relieve the man what was driving that UNK and i used t cos the er UNK coming round the barrel of the UNK they used to UNK and i used to have a handle to knock them clear
why did you have to knock them clear
well if you didn't there'd be so much change on the bail that they all start to fall off and there'd be all one big UNK cos that and as chain coming down that used to come right down into the chain UNK to the bottom of the ships
what was the chain UNK
well a chain UNK is where all the spare chain used to like UNK up
so it came in and it went round
round the barrel about three times round the barrel then right down into the chain UNK but if you kept let it ride what we used to call let it ride well now it get so big then you have to run it all off cos you had one lever that's what you had and the steam valve could have all UNK
all the machinery was
all steam
operated by steam
all re even the engine room was steam cos you had the bucket depth of dredging on that ladder was thirty six feet that's what dredger can go down so far with the buckets going round and they used to dredge about thirty six feet
actually go down and thirty six foot of water
down yes
dredge down
could do yes
what do you mean by the ladder
the ladder is where the buckets er run on you see that's the ladder like that from what they call the top UNK what used to be the top UNK used to have five sides
what do you mean by UNK
well a UNK is where they the buckets used to go over the top and empty into a UNK into the hopper and er went cos it was on a continual chain you see cos you had a bucket two links a bucket two links a bucket two links all the way round and that's how you used to dredge all the time round and round and round and that's how it went over to the top UNK cos you had a bottom UNK on this layer and a top UNK otherwise you couldn't dredge otherwise and that top UNK i am certain it had five sides to it because at one at one time you'd tip a bucket on one then you'd get two lengths so it kept the UNK more or less equal all the way round the wear and tear of it
and so that would you lower the ladder into the water
yeah you'd lower that down
my father used to have what they call a lead line that used to be a wire with a all marked with feet and UNK on and sound and
so you had to
and then when you dredged across again cos you used t you always went er you always had er say every foot he had with a piece of UNK in the wire
UNK
UNK yes
what's UNK
well that's like er UNK rope that's what it was and er used to put a piece through the wire every foot and when you come to six feet there'd be a piece of leather cut in cut one piece of leather
then you had this next UNK the second UNK had the leather cut in two and then have different colours at every feet as well
and this so these were attached to what
just a bit of wire
just a piece of wire
and of course he used have it in his hand in a UNK and he used to top it over the side with a big lead weight on and that and he he'd know how much deep the er river was
was that recognised tools
pardon
what that a recognised tool for judging the depth
oh yes you out of that yes
see and then in the finish they went on the wire they went to chain
and how did they use chains
well they chain just the same way just marks on it and
was there any benefit in changing over to chain
well i think there's the stretching of it you see i mean wire w after a certain time it would stretch a bit
yes
where a chain wouldn't that'd wear a little bit but not too much
so as a cabin boy you had to relieve
i had to relieve the other deck hands for their meals and i started cleaning their cabin out as well
did they all have their own UNK
well they had one big long one they did
and you had to clean
and i had to clean them and i had to get a bucket of water and UNK it down with a hard UNK and
i used to go down the villages
into the villages
yeah
what are the villages
the villages are at the bottom of the ship
cos then you come to your floor and then your sides used to go up villages on a ship
and was the water there to go down into the villages
yes cos they usually all water underneath there and that used to be pumped out every so often the engine room would pump all that out and to heat any water up the UNK there used to be a small pump what used to pump the fresh water into the boiler and i used to have a piece of er copper off that and just turn the steam on a little bit put it into a bucket of cold water and then instead of driving the pump that'd go into the er bucket and heat the water and boil it
and that was your own UNK was it
yes
but the UNK they used to be er two UNK we had two of them UNK we had the er one called the
hello girl yes please a dozen yeah er no i don't think so no i don't think so mate no yeah are you on holiday this week
oh well might have perhaps will you have a spare day no i want to go out for a meal no but i been home but at dinner time just
yeah alright yeah i mean if your car's in you can take mine do it a bit of good
right oh see you later
cheerio
that's john me boy he's a UNK down the erm down the dock he got a weeks holiday this week so i took me other boy and me daughter out last week and erm we'd left her with dogs so i said we'd take them out one day perhaps when he get his holiday
oh i see so you are going out with him later on
yeah he'll see what his wife say
you say he's a UNK
he's a UNK
actually handling the cargo
well he drive these they don they don't handle much now
they erm what they do they drive these big UNK now with these lorries so that they plant all these erm forty foot UNK with er with er erm with a container on and place them on the ship
so they load the ships down there now
oh like the roll on roll off
roll on exactly yeah
UNK
that's right yeah
it's a lot easier now isn't it
oh it is a lot easier cos that all they have to do is run on drop 'em come off again
going back to your life as cabin boy what other duties did you have to perform
on the
well shipping angus so you know when the UNK go on er creeping ahead see we used to have er what we call the head wire there used to be a wire which was all stretched out say about half a mile and what you s and erm and all according what erm how much mud you were dredging for the depth of water and then my father would give the signal to say right cos on the on the head wire used to have a pull we call the pulls and they were like er a UNK piece off the wheel and he'd say five pulls ahead and we'd say one two three four five right and we went ahead with it and then when we were dredging UNK you see used to UNK you never went ahead with it not all the time you c you went UNK across the river and erm once you got ahead your side chains they moving up cos you got so far ahead th that the side chains weren't much good to you so you had to then move your side chains so you got a little off the mud in an old boat and then re further up the river
you say pick your UNK up in an old boat
yes
you see well the point was when you pick 'em up erm we had a UNK we had a big boat what we called UNK boat a very heavy boat and that used to have a wooden so therefore we used to pull it up by hand and pull it UNK on a little barrel with a hand power that's what we used to do and once we got the anchor in board we'd pull the chain in by hand and then UNK it again right on to the mud and on the anchor again
so you actually had to go on to a smaller boat
smaller boat yes
go up and get the anchor
that's right
and pull it in to the small boat
pull it in to the small boat lay it on a box and then we'd pull the chain in by hand and then we'd UNK it further up the river
why did you do that
well i mean if you er if your chain was going too far UNK you might pull the dredger UNK too much so gotta keep your chain up the river that's what you go got to do all the time
so that was your job as well
that was my that was part of our job
wasn't that hard work
that was hard work all the time my hands my hands used to chap on the backs used to chap hands and that was only i was over the wind i wind and er when i used to scrub the cabin out which was with washing UNK and soft soap and when you went along cos that was you get you get erm ordinary washing UNK on the back of your hands and they didn't supply anything then
the UNK mission wouldn't supply you with water boots we had to supply our own now today they supply them with everything even UNK i think nearly now
what was the wages like
our wages
as a cabin boy
well i got thirty five shillings a week and i was doing six UNK twelve hours a day from monday till friday and twelve and a half on a saturday
and how old were you
fourteen years old
was that good money for a fourteen year old
that was good wages then
apprentice boys in th in the UNK were only getting five shillings a week
apprentice boy my mate he er our friend dead and gone he's a good UNK that runs er UNK yet erm that's all he got was five shillings a week after er no seven year's apprenticeship
so you were on really good money
so i was earning good money
do you think that's why they asked you to buy your own protective clothing or was that normal
unclear get to buy your own i er didn't have rubber boots i had big leather boots up to me UNK that's what i bought and that leather then they didn't have nails in the shoes in the in the bottom they had wooden pegs so that the your leather was held by wooden pegs and the and the leather at that time were the UNK boots you could roll them right the way down
were they specially made
specially made yes
did you have them made in ipswich
no we bought them all UNK well they used to come round with this not UNK stuff but all new stuff and he used to go round the dock selling different er water boot socks and UNK and he dealer
how did he get round the docks
oh he used to have his UNK go round
what bicycle with a box on
yes never had a motor car then nobody had a motor car then only the harbourmaster and he had a little old austin UNK the harbourmaster did but other duty harbourmaster he had a motorbike and UNK
he used to go to work on UNK
he lived in at that time just over the road er down the road here and then something went wrong during the war that was over my father and er cos matter of fact when my father come off the dredger erm the harbourmaster wanted to give him er he give him the push and turned round and he said my father name was
that was his UNK and er he went into the office and he told the harbourmaster he said if you don't employ back again he said i'm off and out and he took me father back again
he got his job back
he got his job back you see and erm
do you know why he was called
no i don't no that was just a UNK they give him for years ago matter of fact i the other day i was walking up and he called me so i took me father's name you see UNK that was
extraordinary isn't it
and me other UNK me other uncle he was called
so the UNK followed on really
that followed on right through the family but my boys they haven't got that name cos they older they old all gone now old doctors and that
going back to the man with the UNK
did he come round every week
oh yes that was his living unclear
so he was er
anybody want anything he was there his name was and he used to run up like er UNK he was you'd pay at the most ten shillings down about two and six a week something like that
what credit
yes so that's he was round after his money every week
oh i see and got wh what sort of things did he sell
i mean he sell anything in the clothes line anything
i know these boots we bought off him they were three pound twelve and six they were
i mean they were lovely boots i mean a pair of water boots three pounds twelve and six and we used to put them er make 'em soft we used to do them over with text oil
that was like er what you call a UNK oil they call is text that's some UNK erm oil i think out of the house and cos they used to used to rub that in and you could them down lovely
also made them UNK as well
UNK as well yes
with the oil in them unclear
yes
did you have to wear any other sort of special clothing
we when we were dredging we were dredging now from cliff quay and er used to get all this er grey mud and erm and the chalk and when we used to dredge we got down to chalk er more or less the depth we wanted to go and anybody dredging down there today if they dredge the chalk at cliff quay that's the depth of water you want and erm then we dredged erm just below erm and then we went to UNK we were dredging peat
UNK well you got UNK one side and you got UNK on the other and we were dredging up
in that peat there used to be UNK teeth everything parts of the jaw horns what we were dredging up then we went further down to erm UNK reach that's just before the UNK and we were dredging all green clay
green clay
green clay we were dredging and sometimes you know that wouldn't leave the bucket
the clay wouldn't UNK you couldn't clear the buckets so we used to what we had a UNK tool that was like a spade but that was er that was er narrow at one end the spade at the bottom end was a bit narrow so you could cut th cut the clay out of out the buckets and that was a hard job too
that was difficult
yes
was it your job to do that
well that was that was the UNK job you see cos you used to have they used to be erm they used to be the master of the ship my father and they would still have a mate he's dead and gone and there was myself one side on the UNK side on a UNK and we had two men right UNK on the after UNK and they used to have to look after three chains
cos you had a UNK chain and two side chains
because you had to have the UNK anchor to keep the buckets off the face of what you was dredging cos if you didn't your UNK go ahead too much and er you had big problems there and you wouldn't be able to dredge
did your dredger have a name
just the
that was just the yeah dredger and th the tug was called er nine UNK the ninety
then after that they bought another tug called then they had another one called the that was a diesel tug
what were the other UNK
er steam
steam
and they sorry
cos the reason they er done away with the steam UNK and had a diesel because a diesel you could start up and er when the dredging finished they tipped the tug at ipswich and er if they want they one of the big ships up the river cos then they could start the diesel up quite right away whereby a steam tug you a fire there all the time
i mean a steam tug you got to have coal and you got to have the old boiler old boiler you got to heat that up for the steam cos that didn't pay then
that was a that was a tug
did the steam always work with the dredger
yes
what was that to move her about
well no that's to we had two what they call two dumb UNK the UNK and the UNK and those dumb UNK had to be UNK to sea and t take
what do y what do you mean by dumb hopper
dumb UNK well they ain't got any part everything was hand
and why did you have them
well that's a that's a thing of that particular day at that time th and life erm and then they get what they call they bought a steam hopper so the steam hopper would say could get to sea quicker in half the time the dumb UNK could and so we were UNK all the time there used to be one dumb hopper go to sea one steam hopper and we'd be loading the other dumb hopper and then th course the steam hopper would be back in half the time we'd that and that's how we rotate day to day
by the hopper you mean carrying the soil
carrying all the soil to sea
oh erm it was dumped at sea was it
yeah it was dumped at sea off the UNK light erm UNK
they used to have an imaginary light er an imaginary mark from UNK to UNK on the UNK and er the men who bought the UNK they would take notice every time that hopper went out there they'd see when they were dumping cos if that was if they were a bit UNK some of the boys they'd dump a bit short of the dumping ground that's what used to happen cos they'd report them then to UNK will report them to harbourmaster at ipswich then there'd be a
and who would get into trouble for that
well the UNK of the hopper he get into trouble for that cos he should have gone out to the dumping ground
and did that often happen
oh no that didn't and cos they got a good job i mean five pound seven and six a week a UNK earnings
the mate used to get erm on the dredger the tug and the two dumb UNK or the dumb UNK they used to get four pound five shillings a week and erm and my father got five pound twelve and six and then it went so long we were given near the end of the dredger and er in the UNK wisdom he cut us all down five shillings a week so we get three pound fifteen shillings
why did he cut you down
well cos they were getting short of money
when was this then
this be about nineteen twenty nine
wh why were they getting short of money
well cos th the government had allowed them so much i suppose and erm that was costing them so much on wages and that so they had to cut them down on wages
so this was a particular project just to river
that's right and er at that year that er time we had a drop of five shillings a week and he had an increase of fifty pound a year
harbourmaster did
how did that go down
not very good
that's what he got that was little UNK
were there any problems because of that
no we couldn't say nothing because i mean that was a time when you had a good job then unemployment was just the same in the nineteen thirties
i mean nineteen thirty one was a bad time for employment
so this job was coming to an end about this time
that was yeah that finished in nineteen thirty two
you were all a bit concerned i suppose
we were yes cos that's when i went on to the crane driving in for a crane and got it you see that's why i finished up as a crane driver until i went UNK
so go going back to the dredging did you eventually take over from your father on the dredger
no my father he finished his dredging harbourmaster and that's when they finished dredging then
what else did you have to do on the dredger
well anything what was going anything change the buckets on the that used to be every saturday afternoons they used to be home
we used to work there from half past twelve till five o'clock at night taking the bucket out and put another bucket in because the buckets what they used to call the UNK what were connected to the links they used to wear and we used to have to take them one of them out and used to have a big chain go right the way round and bring the bring the buckets backwards and they used to UNK up all the all the pins what used to go through the buckets in the in the links so we took them out and then they used to go up to the dock and br they put new UNK in
used to bring them up to the dock
used to bring them up to the dock
and put them in a boat and bring them back
put them up in a boat yeah
they used to cos they'd put a couple in the old anchor boat what we weren't using it put a couple in there and they'd tow 'em up to the dock
how would you get them into the boat because they must have been heavy
well we had a old wooden crane aboard the dredger that was all hand power that's just the old wooden UNK and when they got up to the up to the dock they had a cos they had a crane paint with it or a steam crane
and they used to come up to the maintenance workshop
maintenance workshop and be done that used to be the job for the fitters and blacksmiths
did you have to wait for it to be done
no cos we always had so many spare buckets you see
oh you carried spares
how large were the buckets
i would say they be about erm three feet across
that's i'd say three feet across
and how deep
oh about erm three feet deep i reckon they were i mean to load up er eight hundred tonnes which we average these UNK out at er we were getting a good soil we'd load up eight hundred tonne in an hour and a half to two hours between hour and a half to two hours we'd be loaded that's all depend on what you was dredging you might be interested in and go quicker if you were dredging UNK that's be alright you'd if you dredged peat well that hopper would be full but it wouldn't be half lo it'd be half loaded you see be half way down to the UNK mark
so much lighter
that's lighter stuff
if you er dredged UNK did you used to dump the UNK
yes that used to but sometimes they used to bring it up the river and they use a lot the UNK we er did dredge for erm for the first part of cliff quay used it when they built that
you remember cliff quay being developed
i remember it yes
well before i went to UNK my father was dredging the first part of the quay at six hundred feet what we call a six hundred feet the first part and er i used to take his dinner down because he'd he wouldn't have anything cooked aboard the ship
why was that
i don't know but he wouldn't he wouldn't have it cooked aboard there my mother used to cook it for him and i'd UNK down in an ordinary shopping basket in two UNK there'd be vegetables in one and his pudding and UNK in the other and i used to take that down for him and he used to come ashore and he used to then go and have it
that UNK that weren't far from to er cliff quay do it in about ten minutes on your bike
how did you get out to the boat
well they used to have a little UNK boat and come after it he used to get one of the lads while they come ashore and got his dinner
did they take you back or just the dinner
no they just t they just take the dinner back
did you used to want to go over
oh i i'd gone over several times oh yes
excuse me
i got UNK at many a time i did
well i tell you what i was doing i was in the UNK of the boat coming ashore with one UNK in the UNK of the boat i was like hell you know and i was standing on the UNK
on the
on the seats we'll call it on the seats of the UNK boat i was standing on that and my father said to me when i got aboard don't do that no more he said cos he say if that UNK what we call the UNK come out of that UNK hole he said you'll go over the side and the boat will go away from you he said you'll be bloody well UNK which was right never forgot it never
now it was the truth i mean when you UNK the boat they call that UNK they usually do a figure of eight with one UNK and a figure of eight that's how you do that that's a hard job to keep that into that here hole at the back of the boat because
where was the hole then
the hole on the UNK of the boat see you got your boat come round like that
from a point erm
from the point down to the UNK of the boat and then there was a hole in there like that cut out of the wood
just like your u shaped
that's right and put your UNK in that and you UNK you had to come down every time and many a time UNK learn that UNK will come out but once you got the UNK of it you could do it one hand cos you was cutting down all the time like that's what it was
so you were in fact going backwards the boat was going forward
that's right yeah that's right you was back to where you were going
did you ever have any accidents
no i UNK one hand like that
but you used to get in trouble for standing on the seats
for standing on the on the seats you see which i mean my father was right he'd got the experience to know that several men had been UNK like that
what else did you get in trouble for
oh nothing else no nothing else well we daren't because i mean my father was so strict you know you gotta do as your told
on the dredger what other jobs would you have to do in the way of maintenance you said you had to repair the buckets
buckets well every night time when we finished dredging you had to wash down wash the UNK down cos i mean that the UNK used to be covered in mud and UNK so all we had then was an old draw bucket on a bit of rope over the side there weren't no UNK then we used to the bucket and then we used to swing all the mud back in there in the river
just wash the UNK down
so you used to put the drop the bucket down the side
yes on a bit on a bit of rope
then haul it back up
haul it back up then chuck it down on the deck
and scrub your UNK after
scrub the UNK clean
where was the mud coming from falling out the bucket
co fall out the bucket you see on the when they over the top UNK that'd UNK on into the UNK there used to be a UNK take it right into the harbour
when that gone down they used to UNK cos that used to come underneath the buckets and our cabin UNK was facing that and many a time that'd come right down the cabin the mud
actually fall down inside the
that would i mean that'd UNK down there
so it was quite messy on board
oh that was messy you're telling me was messy i've known cups of tea you put a cup of tea on there the other cup of tea was there well we never used to have UNK couldn't afford them that'd be there a UNK of tea and that'd move like that off the table that'd come cos the dredger was shaking so much
actually UNK the whole boat
that UNK the whole boat that would do
was it noisy
noisy UNK row
and you liked working on there
oh i really enjoyed it yes
really enjoyed working there
became a way of life for you
pardon
i would have thought it became a way of life
well i think it was i mean that erm we when you dredge from the causeway i'd say near the UNK office and we dredged all the way to UNK bay just below UNK and that UNK bay was that's a place where they had and that's where the big ships used to moor then and they used to get be UNK like all grain goods and that used to be loaded into UNK by hand and then when it goes so light they used to the fish with about three thousand grain in 'em and then they used to fill them up in the dock on the same method
how long did it take you to dredge that length
well we dredged them from nineteen twenty five to nineteen thirty two
and you were dredging all the while
all the time yes apart from say about six weeks used to come in the winter to repair the do maintenance on the dredger and then the old harbourmaster would say right we should have been here for six weeks he come after a month he'd say paint the cover the rust up he said and bugger off out again
start dredging see he wanted to get the job done
i know that on sunday i was on the watch this weekend and there was so much ice on the river our anchor boat which is all made of wood that's UNK up alongside the dredger and when i went along and got that was about twelve o'clock in the mid day
that was half full of water and the ice had cut through the wood flow down the river cos the water was coming in like hell and er cos one thing i had to do about it had like a chain in the in th in the boat so we pulled the chain out i pulled the chain out first and go just got the erm hull just above water so i bail the boat out with a bucket chuck it down the side right quick
that's how i saved the boat then
otherwise it'd er fill right up down to the side the top of the boat that was on a sunday
were you working this particular sunday
well i was on watch weekend watch you see
what was weekend watch
well i went to work on the saturday morning at six and we were dredging until half past twelve then we would then do repairs till five o'clock at night and then five o'clock at night when the other crew had gone home when i start to stay there then from five o'clock saturday night till monday morning six o'clock all the time just to keep watch on the dredger i used to sleep mind you during part of the time and erm used to have a big old UNK stove down the cabin and make good fire
when you say UNK stove
well that was what they call it UNK stove used to be a big stove and that ain't got no UNK in they had er they used to feed it from the top
what with
coal and then UNK down to the bottom and that's when you open the little door for the UNK to go up and they UNK they call them UNK stove
is that what kept you warm
that what kept us warm
i didn't sleep in my father's UNK i used to sleep on the table i er had an old flock UNK that's what i had an old flock UNK and a flock UNK
why did you sleep on the table
well the was right near the fire
see we had a fire right in the middle of the cabin and i used to chuck this here er flock UNK on the table and the blankets over the old flock UNK and go to sleep that way
what were you keeping watch for while you were on board
well we had to keep somebody on watch in case there was any damage say the ship was up the river and a chain broke or they hit you so you had to put your navigation lights up and to put navigation lights up we had UNK lamps we had a red and a white one they should have been six foot apart they never were they was about three foot
why was that
well that's the quickest way to do it we used to hang one below the other on the dredger be put up at UNK and we used to take 'em down early in the morning but you always had you always had erm navigation lights up must
so this was part of the job at the weekend
that was part of your job as a UNK you have to all the little UNK lamps that's all they were sometimes they'd keep UNK and sometimes they wouldn't they'd go out but there was there was never much erm work at night times on the river might be an old barge
i remember one time er these UNK old UNK when you used to come up there they ain't got any engine in 'em at all because now they got UNK in 'em but erm at that time i was asleep one night and er these UNK had been up they'd been down the engine room cos the engine room and the stoke hall was all in one and th and then i was so sound asleep they'd filled the sacks up with coal and took them up over the and took the only thing they did do they didn't take the shovel they'd used cos they bought their shovel from off the barge and they left that downhill that's how they'd pinched the coal
it didn't make any difference to me
they actually came aboard and pinched your coal
they'd pinched the coal and that didn't make any difference to me because it weren't my coal
did you have any coal left after that
oh yeah we had plenty of coal plenty of coal
i didn't mind them taking any coal
and you were asleep while they did it
but i was asleep while the while they took it
but then you gained their shovel anyway
gained their shovel
cos their shovel was different to ours but that weren't any good to us cos that was er cos what they used to trim grain with now a grain shovel was made of tin and cos our UNK what they used to feed the boiler with were all steel UNK
so that wasn't strong enough to shovel coal
they weren't any good to shovel UNK no is to give it away again
did wha did that usually happen come aboard and steel
oh very often yeah very often
now we used to clean the bottom up cos used to be a big boiler in the dredger and erm we used to close down every six weeks which they used to call blow the boiler down that mean that they open the valve and the heat used to take all the water into the river so er that used to be blown down friday night come saturday morning we'd start at six o'clock and chip all the fur off inside the boiler cos the boiler was made with all and what we call the crown that used to be the two UNK cos they're double the big boiler were a double furnace and we had to chip all that fur off them well it used to take us now from six o'clock in the morning or say seven when we got there had to go down the tug and er go down the tug and erm then we go aboard and strip off
you didn't want any clothes on you put a pair of trousers on that's all you want and a little old thin shirt and chip all this stuff off the what we call the crown
was it hot in there
that was hot yes and th in between there used to be that's where your furnace used to go in and come back and up out the UNK and that they put them the in there to heat the water quick you see and yet they ought to be they had to be UNK out with a what they call a slice cos they used to get UNK up and we used to give them nineteen and sixpence for that to fill the boiler up again we had t used to have take UNK and they used to have to come up to get fresh water into the anchor boat and we used to pump it up by hand into the boiler
everything was done by hand
everything was done by hand
everything
when you got water when you came up to the docks to get water where would you obtain that from
well they usually out of the er UNK on the quay cos the UNK on the quay there used to be a water main a the water main used to go along there and we used to put so much water into the boat and now we come down and used to pump that out and then go back after some more
was that a UNK available for the use of all the steam boats
UNK yes that was oh yes
were there many UNK
oh yes on cliff quay
you get i reckon you get one about every fifty yards something like that
maybe less than that
you've still got 'em round the dock now
where are they now
on the edge of the quay
do they still work
they still work i they've got there used to be one man er employed to erm give these er boats water fresh water drinking water
what would
what would he be called what was what
he just call him the UNK
UNK
the UNK and he had he had a clock on top of his UNK to say how much water the boat taken
soon did they soon take up enough he used to go on board with his book and get it signed by the mate or the er captain of the ship
and is do you know how much they were charged
i don't know but an ordinary barge used to have a little wooden UNK and he want to have a little tank they put a fixed charge on of two and six pence that's what they done
even if he had a small pond
if he had a small pond it used to be was two and sixpence that's all they used to charge but of course the other boats now the boats that used to come from UNK they wouldn't fill up there and they were dutch boats they wouldn't fill up in water out of the UNK in UNK they always wait until they come to ipswich and got fresh water
why was that
well it was better than what theirs was cos theirs come out of the UNK
which wasn't very clean
weren't very clean and er course ipswich UNK all nice fresh water they always filled up with fresh water at ipswich the dutch boats which was the we had three boats there they used to be the ipswich progress and ipswich UNK
they had them three boats and then they used to take do away with the small boats and they had one big one the ipswich erm UNK progress something like that
what did they do
they used to bring all general cargo from UNK to ipswich
wh when was this
oh about erm let me see about ten years ago
oh you're going back ten years
yeah about ten years that's all
going back to when you were on watch on the dredger over the weekends did it ever feel lonely
well we had er th there always used to be one man aboard the dumb hopper wh they used to leave there for monday morning and they used to p him a man with him
with me there but he'd be aboard the dumb hopper and i'd be aboard the dredger and i remember one man he turned round his name was ex naval man he was and er i went round on the sunday morning and he didn't speak to me on the saturday
i went to him on the sunday morning i said morning charlie he said morning and i said ni i said UNK charlie he say UNK and that's the only thing he said to me all the weekend
that's true
yeah
he used t he used t he used to take about half a dozen bottles of beer on the saturday morning with him and that's where he used to be in his in his UNK and he wouldn't move out that UNK all the time
he wasn't a UNK
oh he weren't no
UNK charlie i always remember him ex naval man
so how did you fill in your time
eh
how did you fill in your time
just sit there and do anything do a bit of fishing
fishing
yeah you could fish in the river then
what sort of fish did you used to get
small little UNK and UNK
did you eat them
yes
you used to cook them on board
cook them on board
i know i went i got some UNK once and that was in bay they were lovely UNK and i put 'em in a bucket and er didn't think and now i used to put some flour in with 'em
if you put flour with 'em with the UNK they used to make 'em nice and fat and tender
why because they feed on it
they're feeding on this here on this flour
anyhow the next morning i got up they were all over the deck they UNK out of the bloody bucket
they UNK out the bucket all over the deck
that my first experience of catching UNK
how did you catch the UNK
well you had a ho used to have a UNK net a and that used to be a re like with a UNK
that used to be with er a piece of net in and across the top used to have two piece of wire one way and two piece the other and you catch a UNK open the UNK open and they used to put the UNK between there and the UNK used to feed on the UNK and then when you pulled it out they all went to the bottom of the net
clever
that's how we used to catch the fish like that
earlier on you were talking about erm the dredger bringing up fish or you your father
oh yes we use cos when you're dredging you see when the UNK came in the mud UNK always go in the mud in the winter time you don't many UNK out they go in the mud and when you're dredging and they're going into the hopper cos they used to get UNK and they used to swim round right down the top of the water and they used to come up to the side and if they come up to the side you could have your knife and just come here cos they were UNK pick 'em out
what you lean over
no well there weren't much to see if your hopper was full you ain't got far to go cos they only come about a foot off side you see you could just UNK down there and catch 'em
did everybody take fish
well there were them what could get 'em
they won't be interest to someone
something go a hang whether they had cut the fish or not
where was the best place for bringing up fish on the river
i reckon the best place is UNK mill cos that was a lot cleaner see your river now cos that's UNK now and er all you get in the river now is you get UNK or UNK that's what you get
at that time i mean i have known when my when i was a dredger and they used t we used to clean the bottom i have known er UNK on the bottom used to feed on be on the side of the ship good UNK but of course there used to be UNK
mm
UNK down at UNK mill there used to be UNK well thousands millions of them UNK and the ships used to come round from the UNK from colchester area come round stay round the UNK mill about a fortnight and they used to have what they call a well in their boat and they used to have fill up little sacks like a sand bag of UNK and take them round there and UNK them
now there's no there's no er UNK in the river today
there are UNK gone down the river and they kill them all off
where do the UNK come from
UNK factory down here
what on the dock
yeah cliff quay
when was that built
oh was built oh that was built nineteen thirty odd
mm
and course they used to dump further down the there
not in my time but they used to be all UNK off there used to be a lot of UNK
now they're all gone round the colchester area
cos they're finished they call them the UNK beds
when you were on the watch for the weekend did you used to get extra payment for that
ten shillings from saturday morning from when they when the men left off at half past four on a saturday till six o'clock monday morning we got ten shillings and if and if we were on watch on th on the night time cos we used to do one watch one week and one night one week and two nights next cos there used to be the mate and erm three more sailors used to take turns well there was only four nights so the man who done the monday night they done the friday night
so he got two nights in one week and the others done the monday tuesday wednesday thursday
that's how they used to work around all the time
so it was watched all the while like that
you got to have a UNK all the time on the dredger
did anything ever go wrong when you were on watch
no never
no
the boats coming up would have passed if you were down the river
any boat coming up would have come fairly close wouldn't it
that would do but they should ease down when they come past but they didn't they never took no notice
didn't they
oh no my father stand aboard there when we have been dredging you know and they come up there at speed and he stood there and he UNK at that part of if call them all the crazy buggers my father
but they never took any notice
yes there was one pilot down there his name was george and er my father was in one sunday and he said to my father he said he say you only think you know the river
cos he'd report there was a there weren't enough water inside the place so he said to my father say to him he'd say er don't you tell me all thick he'd say i dredge the bloody river he say
you keep in the channel he say you the ground and that was the truth too
he went out the channel went on the boat
how wide was the channel
well it was all different UNK
the UNK part i think is what they call near the just below the that's er what they call that's not in the book now
hall point they dunno where that
is that hall point
hall point that was called
h a double l
and then you had one at UNK now they've got erm the in there in that book now well that was called point one or two of the old names are there like UNK park lodge and the river in foxes bottom
where was foxes bottom
foxes bottom was just below UNK opposite bay
going away from ipswich
on going away from ipswich on yes on the UNK side
cos you got UNK the other side right opposite UNK
the cat house where was that
the cat house well that's at the cat house that's UNK that's where the house used to be where in er time erm that's where they used to put a cat in the window for the smokers
what a real cat
i dunno whether it was a real cat i don't think so as a matter of fact i was just finished reading the book which is interesting tell you all about the river
why did they put the cat in the window
well smokers all clear or not i don't know but th that even mentioned in that book UNK reach and that talk about the UNK farm where was cos that was all walking about all these UNK at that time but the book i the history i thought about don't seem the same in the book now
so you used to dredge all that length right the way down
all that length yeah
right up from in the dock
right to the dock yes
right the way through
yeah what we call a new cut we dredge right opposite the UNK office and we dredged all and we used to do that tide time had to work at ti UNK when it's high tide cos that otherwise there weren't any water there at all
that's when the erm the pleasure boats used to run from there the suffolk and the norfolk them they were erm they were sharp both ends the suffolk and the norfolk
sharp both ends
yeah well they got they were they were sharp both ends they weren't ain't got no UNK them UNK they were UNK boats so there you got one they had a rudder each end so they had to keep one rudder shut and the other one used to steer
that was the old rail roll railway boats suffolk and the norfolk
where did they go from
they went from er the new cut near the UNK office the stations are still there a lot of on there now
then you had the city of rochester that was another boat after the war that used to run from
there used to be three the essex the suffolk and the norfolk and the suffolk had two UNK and the er the norfolk had one UNK
where did they go to
and they used to run from here to UNK felixstowe that used to be their run all run by the you could you could get a bus oh you could go down go on them boats and you go to UNK felixstowe and then get off at felixstowe and come on the bus if you wanted to
and these were pleasure
that was all pleasure boats
pleasure boats but people could use them for just getting around anywhere
yes yeah there used there used to be one go down another one used to be coming up
was this every day
every day
what di what did they charge for a trip
oh goodness be about one and UNK
to go to UNK
to go to UNK yes they erm the salvation army once a year that's where they used to go on their for their treat
they used to go from here to UNK
all people that went to the salvation army in they always used to have their treat there other church always used to go to felixstowe that used to cost us UNK to go to felixstowe on the train
on the train
yeah felixstowe
why did they bother going
and at one erm they was er the other one was the UNK church hall used to go to felixstowe but the er the other one the memorial hall down the bottom of down er that was just off er down there we they couldn't afford to go to felixstowe so we went on UNK down here that's what we had then
when you say UNK down here where do you mean
well that's near UNK that's where the there is a football pitch down the bottom of cliff lane
oh that's down by the dock
that's right there's a that used to be an old UNK that's all it used to be course now they've got a nice football pitch on it now
is that place now
place
that's their football pitch
that's their football pitch there
going back to dredging
you talked about the new cut
yes well the new cut you see years ago they used to be the entrance to the dock
cos if you g if anybody go down there now they could see where what we call the pier head so ships had to go up there and turn in to the lock gate
now the lock gates are right the river so they can come up straight in previous they used to have to go up the river there new cut and then turn into the dock
so there were no lock gates originally
there were no lock no lock gates this end
no that's a long while before my time
did you have to do any dredging up there
yeah we done dredging up there
we just UNK it off
when did they put the new
the new lock gates
yeah
oh goodness knows i mean that them gates have been renewed and i remember them being renewed these gates what they got there now
they must have been renewed somewhere about the erm i would say roughly round about nineteen twenty seven twenty eight and that's been renewed as lock gates cos they took 'em out and they had a big crane come from UNK to lift them up and er things do now well that's surprising what they do now
i mean that i known these people down here now have the old dredger what they got here now
they fix it up with wires and they got so far and as the tide rise cos the ship come up and they take 'em out and take 'em to the dock take 'em out with a heavy crane
mm
see lot of these jobs are done by the tide say you take a ship now what's been sunk in the river at low tide they'll put the wires underneath make them fast to the ships and when the tide when the t tide rise out come the ship and they can take it where they want to
how many feet does the tide rise down at this dock
about roughly round about er twelve feet in the river
i in the river
and rise and fall about twelve feet they tell you in that new book you've got there the rise and fall
how deep did you used to dredge it out
well we dredged it alongside of cliff quay that was twenty eight feet of water at low tide that was that's what they guarantee apart from what they call and then two UNK off two ships was laying that'd be at twenty eight feet then that would rise ten feet below what they call cos all in metres now
what's a UNK
a UNK is what that takes
whatever the tide states at the lock gates the ri the channel is dredged ten feet below that
ten feet deeper
and who used to work all this out your father
no the harbourmaster used to do that
he'd tell him he'd get his orders from the office cos the deputy harbourmaster he would go down all the sound he sound in river and see what wanted taken out then he'd say to my father i'll dredge at so and so UNK below UNK and UNK what they used to do they used to my father what he'd do he'd put UNK on the mud a short stake and a long stake on account of the tide and he'd make an imaginary on that stake then he'd go ashore at UNK phone up what have you got on your UNK the fella might say it's ten feet well he'd say right we'll make that twenty feet so that's er that's what he used to work on to dredge the river
used to dredge the channel out how wide did the channel have to be
all different UNK
what why different UNK
well i don't know that's just enough room for a ship to get up
i mean the UNK part of the river i would say is er where hall bridge is that's the UNK part
and how wide is that
well could be about seventy five yards i think that's to see that
and you did this with a three foot wide bucket
yes
so it must have taken a long while
yes surprising it's surprising how fa far you went ahead
i mean seven years continual dredging for seven years apart from a month they in dock and you were taking out eight hundred tonne every hopper load and some days you were doing five loads and sometimes four loads was a lot of mud we dumped so much mud out at erm near the UNK now you would think they would level UNK off wouldn't you and if they didn't that up
what they have to do have to go further off now when they are dredging now they have to go further off into the sea north sea
why did it build up
well cos at er there weren't enough tide to take it away i mean you ta you get clay well that's solid and the amount of stuff i was dredge they use and use it now we're not the only ones got it they got people from UNK people from felixstowe they were all dumping out there
that UNK up again then doesn't it when you dredged it up
and that UNK up and tha cos the you get the UNK well i think it UNK up about three feet in about three years that weren't much and the course to come up now
with dredged up pieces of rocks bigger than that erm machine bigger than yes that one yeah
bigger than the UNK
yeah bigger than that
what's that about three foot by two foot
yes
and you've dredged up pieces of rock
and we'd dredge 'em up and they and they used to pick 'em up on a bucket go in there pick 'em on a bucket and of course instead of them going over the UNK into the harbour we used to have to put a chain round and 'em off cos if not they'd have gone over them UNK and damaged the UNK
er what sort of just ordinary
well they've got them all outside the erm lock gates now
up on the shore what we dredged up
do they
yeah
outside the lock gates
outside the lock gates just as you go into th into near the erm customs hut the customs place near the lock gates all the rock now is what we dredged up years and years ago
i didn't know that
yeah
just sit there
that's still there now cos they used to take it up there and dump it when it weren't any good
did you often dredge rock up
oh goodness yes wh we if we dredged up we'd have a say a piece of on deck we used to land them on deck until we got room so we came up at upper dock
there might be a UNK come along and he'd want a UNK so he'd say to my father can you fix us up yes get an old bit of chain and put round put some wooden UNK in UNK 'em up that's his that's his UNK he'd take it somewhere in the river have it dumped put a UNK on it that was that's like his anchor
so that was quite handy then
handy that was a lit little bit of did it
UNK of the job
yeah
certainly had
you spoke earlier about dredging teeth and bones up of animals
whereabouts were they dredged up
preston
at preston
out of the peat
now er clay pipes we used to dredge up and they got dredged up down opposite UNK and they were a long pipe but cos the stem a lot of them had been broken off and wh how they got down there nobody know i think they used to be like in UNK with the ships i think
like there weren't any old boys on there they used to wash 'em out you know and clean them up then smoke 'em
an old clay pipe
did they really
then you used to be able to buy clay pipes i don't think you could today
no
but er a lot of 'em used to erm use used to smoke 'em
they used to come up with the dredging spoil
with the dredger yes
we ca we dredged some off erm halfway to the by the near UNK
what happened to the bones and the teeth you collected
the teeth there used to be a man come down about once every three months and er where he came from i don't know
whether he come from this or not but erm we were dredging the west bank cos er the kind of ship we got there then were the big UNK and there weren't enough room for them to swing round so we had to dredge part of the bank out to make the swinging UNK and erm there we dredged a bone up about that size
what was that about
and
four foot
yeah that's a big and my and that stuck out the bucket like that well going over the top we had a UNK over the top UNK to stop the flashing so my father stopped thinking that was a bit of wood and were gonna break the top of the UNK so he stop and out and UNK it and found that was this bone and i think if my memory serve me right that's in the fleet museum now
you don't know what it came off
no they reckon that was an elephant i don't know so the UNK went
all we see all different bits of bone
what else did you get
lot of sewage but the sewage
that was terrible that was cos that's where a lot of their stuff was dumped in the river at one time cos now that's all taken to sea
did any of the teeth and the bones erm
like a UNK like a UNK jaw
a whole jaw
yeah a whole jaw
you part of the horn you dredged them up cos you used t the only thing we saw taken out then this old fella used to come down from the museum or whatever he was and he used to be pleased he'd stay there all day and pick up them all
did you get many
good few
do you know if they still dredge them up these days or
oh i think they do
mm
see well th the dredger they get now the little dredger they got now that should hold about four hundred ton
the mud they put out now there is lucky if they put two hundred ton in and that's only had by grab and course they'd make a hole there then course that fill up again
that's how they do dredging now
they make the hole
yeah wh when the grab go in you see them that's making a hole isn't it
mm
and course then the sides UNK in again and that's the idea they can keep it down level or try to
so is that a better way of doing it
no the only i would say personally i would say the best dredging method is buckets because you can you can keep a level you could keep a level with a UNK dredger but not a ground dredger unless like UNK out the hole
er in hole that's like that and you're UNK out well you're only making a hole and fill in again but they into that one place don't they
like down at the erm when i was crane driving we used to have ships coming from UNK with UNK in and then there be a another part there was sulphur then they used to be erm there's green UNK what we used to call
green UNK
green UNK
what's that
well that's a he very heavy stuff that's a er is er like er erm oh a heavy little lead
is it a metal
er a well i don't know i feel that th there used to be something in that used to burn it up now what they call their top site and when they burned it they took all the acid out of it and there used to be all yellow stuff come out the UNK and that when they finished burn that was always red and the germans used to come after that before the war second world war they used to come after that and they used to reckon they make UNK but now you done something else different with it and they use i tell you we used to give it the name of green UNK or UNK
UNK
UNK yeah
do you remember the second world war at the docks
what it was like
yes i was a crane driver then
you moved on from being on the dredger
no i was made off
i moved off the dredger in nineteen thirty two and i was crane driving from nineteen thirty two till after the war
why did you finish on the dredger
well cos they finished they ain't got enough money
so they
they packed the and sold it
so this was the dock commission
yes dock commission sold the dredger they sold the UNK and then last the steam hopper went from here to UNK and what they done at UNK they on the UNK see a big hopper what we call hopper number three they put a crane on there and use it t as a hopper then and
and did they continue dredging
and the dredger went to erm hull that's where it went to br be broken up
who did the dredging after that then
well the
they're a big they're a big dredging company from london
if they want their dredging done they got them people in which cost a lot more money
that seems a bit odd really that they paid
right yeah it does i mean there were that's how things went
was that er erm a depressing time at the docks
that was yes
at nineteen thirty two
that was because i mean you take now the dredging company what they call the in their UNK they used to have erm a square and in halves that used to be a blue and a yellow
that was our marking all our ships used to have the blue and er i think blue and yellow in the square cos they hired these the people who do er you know suppose hire them off now would be the erm the dutch people cos they're the people what er they deal in all that type of thing big dredging that's how UNK was built
by dredging
by dredging
UNK land
why was times bad in nineteen thirty two for the dock
pardon
why were times bad for the dock in nineteen thirty two
well that's one of those things like it is today you see unemployment and new trade coming in and all the rest of that
why wasn't the trade coming in
people didn't want it weren't the money about investments i suppose
so from there you moved on to being a crane driver
i went crane driving
mm what did that involve
well the first crane i drove was a was only at that so i was stuck on one of them and i had to sling me grab all the time and this bridge come round and miss the bridge and go over it and rush it down to the hold
was that difficult
it was difficult cos you only had what they we call the UNK behind me and i used to work that and i used to be
turn the crane round one way then the other and he got on the same lever but today they got cos they got big lovely cranes where they stand there with four UNK four controls they've got and it goes up and down
and the UNK goes up and down quite easily
i see what sort of crane did you call them the new ones
these are UNK cranes
loving
UNK
UNK
l u f i n g
they're the modern ones
they're the modern ones UNK cranes
the old cranes sounded quite dangerous
they were yes well you could swing them UNK out and come the wire still
were there ever any accidents with them
oh goodness yes
what
i done plenty of damage
you did
i got threatened with the sack once
what did you do
well i went through a UNK bridge broke the wheel up top i did cos you at that time see how things improve all the time now UNK and all that is that's thirty five feet long
mine was only twenty feet long the one i was driving twenty feet long UNK
now on that twenty feet long now i'm up about say you can say anything like about fifteen feet up in the in the air might be less than that and then you got twenty feet up like that well then there used to be wire and used to have a big wheel in top which you couldn't go over the top and with a wire then i used to have a sling chain my main hook and that was thirteen foot long and you take th that and on working on top of the lorry see you got to be so careful and there's men working on that lorry as well course i broke the wheel
what happened
they got a new one they had another then they had another idea then they came round and had erm had turned round and said right they done away with part of the wire and they got another big wheel so you can go right over the top next time they done away with the big hook so you could UNK your chain on to the wire then you could go right over the top and then they get the old short chains like that
thirteen foot six they got little short chains like a lot better
did you get into trouble for breaking
trouble yeah trouble i got put off for a fortnight on the dole then he i was on the dole for a week and er he cos at that time you had to appear in front of the erm what they call the court of UNK at the labour exchange that was their committee
you had to appear in front of them well this i'd been off for a week and the old harbourmaster old he sent for me and he said erm you can start work tomorrow as i
right i said i'll start tomorrow morning i go to the labour this afternoon court of UNK
yes he said i should go and he wouldn't come cos he ain't got no answer to it you see anyway i went and i started back the next morning he called me back
that one alright
was it usual to be stood off if you did something wrong for the
oh goodness yes for the damage and you had to go in front of the harbourmaster
this was the ipswich dock commission
ipswich dock commission UNK dear
and they would generally stand you off work for a while that was your punishment
that's punishment yeah they would either do that or there was one driver down there he broke a wheel that weren't his fault and he had to pay for it he had to go in the office like i did once
i had to go in the office every friday night and i was only earning about two pounds seventeen and six a week and they use and deputy harbourmaster captain he say how much you earned this week he say three pound i'm asking you four he say well they'd take it off you and er you'd be paying it now takes about six months and he old harbourmaster see you about the quay he said
want you in the office and he'd give it all back again
did he really
he only done they only done that to learn you a lesson
yeah
dear oh dear cos he weren't allowed he weren't allowed to stop money cos that's against the law to pay for damages
didn't they ever get caught out then
no he daren't say anything cos if you got you said anything you got the bloody sack
did you have any union
pardon
did you have any union
oh yeah i had a union
and didn't the union question why they were taking money
no well i did old erm what's his name now UNK dear there was one old boy he well he union on this court of UNK and er cos we got to hear of it
somebody said well the UNK not coming i said right go back to work and that's the time i that's the time when we had the first baby and erm that's the first one we lost and anyhow they put me off for a fortnight and erm i went down to i say go up the board of UNK that was like the d h s but a little bit lower and i just start to buy this house soon as i said to this bloke he live in the council house over here this bloke what was interviewing me
where do you live i say oh you're buying your own house
i said yeah just started course if i'd have paid money off i said lived on it you see
mm
and there be twenty eight shillings a week that's all i allowed him and because that was even better than labour money and so the day they i had to keep that they stopped all me labour so cos i had the money you see
they stopped that
they stopped it see so i didn't gain anything out of it me mates at work they made a collection for me in their way
did the union act for you at this particular time then
oh they did yes oh yes
what i was wondering was when you said that the dock stopped the money for payment for damages they'd paid it back to you
didn't the union question why they
no none of that union didn't know we were paying
because i knew the fella that done the damage before i did the same thing he said to me he say you carry on you'll get it back
and so you never told the union
so i didn't tell the union
how much
so he say they'll give it to you back so that's what they done they give me money back cos they'd already give him back his you see
yeah
were there ever any strikes at the docks
oh goodness yeah but now they even today i mean they have a strike and that's settled just like that
is it
yes goodness
was it not settled quickly before
when you were there
no it weren't not when a general strike in nineteen twenty six that was a bad one
that's when everybody came out together was it
everybody come out yes
well were there ever any strikes that have just affected the docks
no not really
i mean i've known little strikes there last about a couple of days and they all got over it
they always used to give way to 'em
what would what would they have been over
anything more money that was the main thing more money
and they wouldn't last that long
no cos you had see they these big people they didn't wanna be into it they same getting their money like and they didn't want strikes
they al always used to all used to finish up down here any rate
alright give 'em it
didn't that encourage more strikes though
no it didn't no the people th the dockers were pretty reasonable they were now i will say that dockers pretty reasonable
that's what i say to a lot of people today they UNK about dockers but they're only fighting for their rights
that's all
mm
i mean lot of my children go over the limit but erm they UNK up too much
but in general that was er
that was er
give and take
give and take was yes
cos there's some they used to be carrying timber down the dock all one length and what already UNK already UNK for 'em and the way it cost the way it go put the wires on me for sure now and there ain't much to let now
you mention a little while ago
who were
they were tim timber merchants
they used to saw timber down for UNK and that they had er place in hull and a place in ipswich
that was
where were they UNK on the dock
they were down at cliff quay
they were that's where is now
cos they sold out the that's all now and i think came from UNK they used they used to have a big place at UNK and we came through the other week and er i see their sheds are nearly all empty now there
what at the UNK
at UNK
but as i say there ain't er there ain't the timber used to what there used to be
down at there was one ship down there that six weeks move
what was what were you UNK
timber that were all loose timber that was during the war six weeks six weeks that took to UNK that ship
that's a long while isn't it
that was yeah
that always used to be a fortnight to three weeks to UNK a ship but this one ship that was called i remember that was called the lovely ship and that had been bombed that had a bomb drop right on the
course and the bomb gone on the broke the UNK and that and that had gone so far you know that timber that has UNK the timber all more or less all together
al all the cargo inside was damaged
yeah
where did this happen in the channel
in the channel well it was coming over i suppose from america
did you have many boats coming in bomb damaged
yes we had one or two we had one coal boat come in damaged
that's ideal
ah there's a top on it
that's alright

aye
good
i dunno er are you taking blood cos i've doctor to see this afternoon
er it's UNK to me i mean i'm totally UNK
i mean if maybe it'd be better if he does it UNK because he
oh i was
aye
i was UNK no i'm no being UNK
no
it's just
i'm just thinking
he'll cos he'll see the results then
aye
and there's less chance of them getting lost because if we send it over to UNK and it comes back here it goes to doctor you know how he's all over the place
and he's doing it all day seeing
clinic
as he's got strathclyde and he's got er
aye
UNK as well
may be better if he does it this afternoon pal
well that's
for you know for the sake of getting the stuff all in the right place at the right
aye
time
aye
but urine test absolutely fine no problem there at all young UNK
that's smashing
got a wee bit of reaction to the UNK and the penicillin mind
oh right aye
er normally UNK
right
i'm drinking water and tea
that's okay
that's alright
anything
coffee
anything at all
but that's about the most i had
i started off at the s at the start i was er i was getting mouth UNK and then well i didn't get them to the UNK that i got them with the UNK
that's
er
funny cos UNK i've been s i've certainly been using it for years and years and years with different folk fo er for something completely different
aha
i mean it didn't come for come out for arthritis
arthritis no
it came out for something else
and i've used it oh for about thirty odd years
i never found anybody with any trouble ever having any trouble with it
and yet when folk got it for their arthritis okay
yeah
there's no trouble with er with the UNK
aye
so there should be no problem
yeah that's right
UNK problems and er i was having UNK problems UNK in my mouth
mhm
that's right
and i was quite amazed
eh
oh aye
i was quite amazed
but er if you
said you know
aye
but er i was away for a week there i only came back on saturday
good
er
did you get to
i was away up er UNK it's between UNK and UNK
it's not my part of the world at all
it's beautiful
don't know it i don't know it is it
oh
oh right
right aye
oh
so my w UNK and i had a wee break
peace and quiet
aye we we've been having a lot of trouble with the people next door and er
mhm
it it's really quite amazing
oh
i can believe it
erm trouble with neighbours is
well it's
not unusual in
i hardly think that i'm able to run about UNK doors at four o'clock in the morning
it's i'm up a
i haven't seen you too often
i'm up against the six UNK and a five foot ten wife
aha
er and you know
having a that's what it's
that's right that's right
thanks
okay
UNK
right
bye
right
so that's the charter mark we're going for it again but i don't think the impact will be you know the main impact was last time
i put on that your newsletter that i sent round in york er to tell staff we were going for it again so you know th
start wearing your UNK
start wearing your UNK yes keep up UNK
right
mrs UNK
the next yeah that's right yeah
i put keep on keeping up UNK or something yeah
UNK
bids for f various funding there are three issues on that came up at c s m t
erm the t q m one which is the er you know the quality
mhm
training quality workshops
we've actually been successful in that again because we've got last year i think we got six thousand pounds and this year we've been told we can have eighty percent of the same again
so yeah
very good
so erm you know a fair chunk of money again and er yeah
the first two years
alan's already had initial discussions with a few of us and with graham about what the next stage should be erm but that's really not been UNK yet
but there will obviously be sort of an ongoing training and so on because i know that in some ways i think it's been very mixed and i qu i put
it is mixed
it on the agenda and i'd quite like to talk about it today
but erm i think really at the end of the day staff have only really had just that one day workshop
mhm
some of which went better than others
mm
and you can't expect a lot to achieve a lot from just
mm
one day
mm
and i think it's finding
people's perceptions of those one days are so different
aren't they
it's really strange isn't it
mm
the way UNK talks i think i must have been at something else
i know
i know
but i've heard two people
yes
that went to the same one talking differently
mm
oh yeah
it's r really quite UNK but
i think i think one of the important things about that and perhaps it ne needs building in somewhere else and i know it's extra time is UNK staff
yeah
yes
when they've been on courses
mm
because i've spoken to staff who thought it was awful but when UNK to them about it
mm
they have they have got something out of it
yeah
and certain parts of it were useful and perhaps it wasn't so bad after all
mm
once you'd discussed it with them
mm
but there were certain elements that remained in their in their mind
yeah
that spoilt the course or were not relevant and they'd forgotten about the relevant bits
mm yes yeah
yeah remember the parts
yeah
yeah
good points
but i think perhaps it's no it's not only with that course i th think it's lots of other anyway haven't you
yeah with other training as well yeah we are in yeah
yeah
we occasionally get forms through but er there
mm
doesn't seem to be a set system at the moment whereby you know we
mm
should be sitting down with staff who've been on courses
mm yeah alan's very keen to promote that
tendency if you talk about it you'd be honest but to write it on a form you'd be
exactly
i wasn't scared
the other thing is to talk it over with your line manager so that if you've picked something up you want to implement yourself back at in the workplace then
yes
you've got support to do that you're not UNK on your own
yeah
yeah
really
and if you've told someone else i'm going to change my work practices in this way and it's been supported then is it it's more difficult to forget about it
no
isn't it really
yeah
so i mean alan's very keen on it cos it's all to do with investors in people and so on so er i mean what we really need is somebody centrally like a proper training officer
mm
that's right mm
with time to really get issues like that under way
that's right
but erm w we haven't got that so anyway something
kevin shall we get
yes kevin
i'll do it
you'd like to do it yeah
mm
erm the second lost me bit
oh here it is
the second bid issue is the careers service branch development fund which is the one that's available every year but we originally had jane 's project the f e project and so erm now this year the bids have been asked to be on certain subject areas
and er we were quite fortunate in this cos i went had to go to a meeting in sheffield and i hadn't realized in advance but at this meeting the people at the meeting were asked to give recommendations as to what priorities should be given in terms of UNK the bids
so i came away with this sort of inside information
ah
of what was going to be favoured
erm it sort of UNK a bit on poor er ray because he'd actually written up a bid er for us to do which was about investors in people to actually h appoint somebody to control that process which would take on board all of the training and
mm
quality issues and
mm
so on
but at this meeting i went to people there felt very strongly that services should not be awarded funding to go for investors in people
because if services
should be doing it
were doing it on their own two feet
yeah
then you know why should it be seen as a UNK for them to that and services that hadn't been bothered to do that be given money
mm
erm and also it was felt that the i p was quite well structured and that there was potentially less to learn from a service
mm
implementing that than something that was a little bit more innovative
so i had to come back and sort of say to ray you know if we go for that bid it's not likely to be supported erm so we what we'd done is a different bid which still includes investors but it's a bit broader than that
and what it's actually to do is to do with this national standards and indicators that have been written for the careers service
and that really they're to do with they cover all aspects of the work that we currently carry out
but when they were originally written erm i think it were f seen as fairly low key but now they've taken assumed a much greater importance in terms of them being the actual service specification for the new careers services under the employment legislation
erm and so the project we've put forward is that we will trial some of these indicators to see whether they work to see what they tell us erm and therefore we would hopefully be able to improve these indicators so that we think that they're much better in order to er sort of shape the performance for the future services
but i don't know whether we'll get it or not
we've been quite lucky cos we got the
mm
management to put money
have been lucky
and you know it's a case of whether you believe that we're in favour because we got this money and therefore we're likely to get
more or whether we're out of favour
especially as paul's making us fairly unpopular with all this the success he's having in lobbying
mm
which you know alan and i were saying we were a bit concerned about because he's doing i such a good job i think on the lobbying that north yorkshire are not going to be flavour of the month in terms of ministers or senior civil servants
civil servants
really
mm
but anyway
double UNK
mm
yeah
it is yeah
when is there a date when the bids will be announced
probably but i don't know when it is
you don't know when it is
no
no i don't know when they're making decisions the deadline for them being in was the end of the financial year
right
and one of the criteria that derek said that they would be supporting bids were for ones that would start at the beginning of may
tt
right
so
come under
yeah
come under
and in fact we said that we would be able to start it on the at the beginning of may even though we knew we wouldn't we thought we'd say that
just nod in agreement
yeah
so you know nothing might come of that but if it does erm i would be very keen to actually er the plan was to second a member of c s m t for six months to do it and i would be very keen to do it i must admit
erm but we'll have to wait and see
erm the third one is we've got a small amount of money out of think again it's out of UNK and but it's n y t e c have got hold of it and it's to do with further development of the careers service tech partnership but it's only a few thousand it's a very small n amount compared i mean the bid that we've put in for this standards and indicators is more like sort of thirty thousand
but erm the one on the er for the partnership is only in the region of about four or five thousand
and i think what paul wants to spend that on is bringing erm in some external consultant to actually look at models for the future how to develop our current partnership model
mm
into something where
mm
the board are executive and decision making
mm
rather than advisory
so somebody like erm
i can't think of the names you know these
pete
mm
pete that sort of thing
mm
er and of course erm roger 's quite keen on that idea as
mm
well and he's the one that'll make the decision i think cos he's got hold of the money
so
mm
i think that's what that'll be spent on
you see it's quite nice that erm some money is coming in from outside but i don i think ideally it's not really being spent on what our top priorities would
mm
be but i think it's just a case of taking advantage of what there is available
that's right yeah
to see what benefit we can get out of that really
there's always a danger that you've it's a fine balance between it creating more work so it actually causes more problems
but i think certainly the one on standards and indicators is so central to everything we do and
mm
are going to be doing under the new contract think you could only learn from that really
erm links with n y t e c was the next thing on the agenda just to report back that jane and paul have had a long meeting with roger and helen from the tech
i think it was really because paul felt that everything was going really well with the partnership board and he'd been erm putting a lot of work in with people like erm from scarborough and john and er other people who are on the board but he'd rather been UNK building up a really good working relationship with n y t e c
so he decided he needed to invest some time in that
and erm they had a obviously a very productive meeting and it they didn't say a lot about it but overall they said that really roger and helen now had a much better understanding of the direction we wanted to go in the future and were pretty supportive of it really
and certainly
on to the point of wanting to bail out and contract
right
bid for a contract to run a careers service on their own
yeah
or anything like that
mm
which i understand another er local tech are actually doing
erm we talked about the y t guarantee
erm but that's all a bit depressing cos talk about the y t guarantee
that's what he talked about at the s w g isn't it
yes it is
is it
yeah on the tenth of may there's s w g
hmm
and that's one of the main topics of conversation and a representative of n y t e c will be there
so it's from a guarantee point of view rather than how to compile the UNK
well
unfortunately not
well it won't be
no but i think it will focus on why there are UNK still between the offices erm
n y t e c
yeah but i think what w jane is going to do is invite somebody from n y t e c to join us later so that we have chance to get our act together
mm
and er paper over cracks before they come
yeah so
so you're all singing the same song
yeah
same key
that's right exactly yeah
so er i'm actually going to go to that meeting jane asked if you know there's anybody i really invited anyone from c s m t to go
so i thought as we've still got the biggest guarantee i would go to it
erm have you decided which one of you are coming or are you both coming or
UNK going to go
UNK gonna go but i haven't had a chance to talk to her about it yet again
okay
right great
yeah di diane was off sick earlier in the week so
yeah
right
and not been in much since she came back
yeah i've still been working though
erm
you haven't been in the office is what i mean in the centre
thank you
in the centre
centre
yeah
you've been in the centre of things
you're always in the centre of things
centre of things but not in the centre here
staffing issues
really that wasn't actually dis the staffing issues themselves weren't discussed but just to UNK on what the situation is with the staffing issues and what's meant by that
about a third of our staff have got temporary contracts
most of which i know some of them have already come to an end like UNK e s
mm
f contract er and the other e o e s f contracts have come to an end
but there are quite a few contracts which are still temporary most of them go to the end of june
erm one or two people are temporary UNK extend beyond that like er UNK for example in t v e i contract which goes to the end of august
mm
but de it's been done deliberately that other contracts extend to end of june because we knew that by round about mid may we would know what our financial situation was in that what i understand are termed out turn figures for the our pre the previous financial year will have been erm audited as a result of the end of the financial year
so we'll know whether we're in the black red or where
mhm
we are
and obviously it'll be very dependent on how much money we've got as to what our UNK staffing establishment will be
so obviously no one who's got an establishment contract will be affected from the first of july but really everyone who's on a temporary contract those contracts are very much in the UNK pot and we've got a meeting on the nineteenth of may s an extra c s m t meeting to say right this is how much money we've got these are the people with temporary contracts but the third and most important factor really is this is a new assessment of the workload of every office and whereas in the past careers officer establishment has been based exclusively on year eleven figures and other staffing has been based on pretty arbitrary factors of historical nature
mm
and what m s u had to say when they reviewed us
mm
er we're hoping now that we will be able to take into account a much broader range of factors
so keith has been doing a lot of work erm and putting on a database information about office traffic y t occupancy
mm
f e sixth form year eleven independent schools special needs
he's taken all of those factors into consideration
it started to get out of proportion in that he ray has been talking to him about the impact of the summer season in scarborough in terms of how long it takes his staff to get from a to b
tt oh
people have been talking to him about sickness and that if an office has erm people that are off sick a lot more than another office they're at a disadvantage
oh no
tt
and it's got er really absolutely
that's silly
totally ridiculous erm so you know i said to keith well you know alright york races better put that in and a you know i started getting
mm
a bit sort of UNK about it
yes
and
mm
i hope that when we meet on the nineteenth alan or paul will immediately knock all that on the head
er
mm
and we've got the bridge in selby of course
of course yes
yes the bridge
mm
should be worth half a careers officer
i mean obviously i hope the decisions will go my way because keith has actually argued in the past that we should UNK f e because he says it's impossible to fairly take account of that and what he means is there's no f e formulae in northallerton so he knows that if f e is excluded northallerton will be at a major UNK
will lose out mm
mm
disadvantage you see
erm so i really don't know i mean i tt in a sense i sort of feel that justice would be that our division would come out reasonably well from these discussions
yeah
because i think that when you look at year eleven we're at a disadvantage
mhm
because other things oh one other thing that i was particularly keen that was taken into consideration is applications for training
for y t
mm
because w in an analysis of that this division does getting on fo i think it was forty seven percent of
mm
those
whereas our year eleven figures are thirty five percent
mm
so you can see what i mean that these additional
yeah
things
yeah
it just gives us that extra bit of loading
yeah
in terms of erm time
it's different time groups
hmm
unless a formula can be worked out if you put all this stuff in unless a formula can be worked out i mean you might as well just to year eleven full stop
i know
but it's
each yeah
the same with the information UNK isn't it
yes that's right
in that if sh the case load UNK got here of two offices and a large number of schools compared with
northallerton
northallerton
yes
mm
and yet they've got the same amount of time
mm
and it's not right is it
i mean it's
no
no
i'm not surprised that our offices are in a mess
no
because she's just not got the time
yeah
no that's right that's right
w with her having to be out at all the schools and everything
yeah
i it was interesting actually because i mean nor northallerton is the e is the office at risk in a sense because when they get a fourth of anything theirs is relatively more and ours is relatively less
less
scarborough and harrogate are pretty even and they're also very close to being a quarter
mhm
of things
mm
erm so if we gained it would be at the expense of northallerton erm and when i made this point well i didn't make this point i made the point about york being under UNK because
mm
we're more than a quarter
erm you know and credit to cynthia she was the one that immediately thought spoke up agreeing with me
mm
erm and but at the same time she is the one that always has seems to have more to say about staffing problems
cos it's sub offices
and difficulty in coping with it there yeah
this is the difficult thing how do we take account of the sub offices of erm scarborough and northallerton
at the end of the day there's tadcaster
yeah
and we've got two full time offices
that's right
they're talking about five offices as opposed to three
mhm
erm
and we run UNK in the summer
yeah i know
yes
yes
i told keith about that
office in easingwold as well
we have to go into easingwold
well i don't think we have because i don't think it's been included in the programme this year
last year
but the van
every week
haven't got any staff to do it this we managed to do it last year
cos it
cath says it wasn't worth it
if you're looking at that we maintain three point centres
yeah
mm
during the year don't we because
yes
UNK is open
that's right keith said that he certainly would take that into consideration
i said i'd let him know the total number of contact days or whatever with UNK over the period so that is something i need to get from you bill
so you can imagine the sort of conversations we're gonna have when ray and cynthia are talking about the distances between things and i'm going to be saying you know if i want to go from UNK to tech house it can take me at least half an hour
yeah
exactly yeah
it takes jane no longer than that to come from UNK
that's right
mm
but tt i'm not looking forward to it
but you know i'm
no you can't put travel time in can you
cos
no
UNK got its own problems on that hasn't it
no yeah that's right
in that they're all
mm
whether it's distance or congestion
and like you say our bridge does make a big difference
it does
you can get back from york in quarter of an hour and then you can be sat there for
yeah
you know twenty minutes
yeah
half an hour
yeah
cynthia also admitted that maybe if they really had got staffing problems they would actually have to look at whether they did keep maintaining the sub offices that they were
and that you know look at the traffic very seriously and see whether it was UNK or not and that maybe greater use of the mobile
mm
but you would go there less frequently
which is based in northallerton anyway
yeah
mm
mm
but the thing i keep coming back to when i look at the figures is that northallerton is only a third bigger than selby
UNK getting fed up of me saying this
no i was only thinking that when you talk about
yeah
northallerton when you think of the traffic that goes through richmond it's nearly as high as what goes through
yeah
northallerton
yeah
mm
yeah
so there can't be much going on in UNK and UNK
no
no cynthia said that last line didn't she
no she said that that's why last line of yeah
but you see you still have to have a person there while we're
that's right
still maintaining the offices
that's right
and er
you might end up down to once a week if it's twice or whatever
yeah
you know
mm
but we're looking to open full time
mm
gone on
th it was being looked at one point
mm
along with whitby being full time and certainly whitby traffic has increased enormously since they've got their new office
i've seen it from the outside it's quite erm
yeah it's lovely
but then if you at it UNK it's n there's hardly anybody
well
goes into the UNK office i can remember that from when it was my responsibility
this is going to be an interesting meeting alan says it will be over by two thirty because he's organized for some training to happen then on er disciplinary issues
requested by
personnel training
personnel training requested by divisional manager west
i'm just wondering whether one or two things that's come down recently on discipline
disciplinary sorry
just to sort of tear off on that
got him worried now
do you mean how you mean how to how to discipline
procedures
procedures
procedures
internal discipline you again
mm
there's been a lot of stuff come down from county
as opposed to complaints from outside
oh yeah
yeah no staffing
staffing
and sickness as well if you're looking at
yeah
counselling for sickness
excuse me
erm alison from the job centre is on the phone and i asked her if it was urgent and she said fairly urgent it's regards to the article
to do with article
erm it's concerning the photograph and she just wondered if you had anything in mind for the photograph or if you wanted to leave it up to the press
tt erm i did wonder if this might happen actually i couldn't remember whether they wanted a photograph or not
cath can you ever remember whether we've had a photograph taken at the recruitment fair
don't think so
i don't
no i haven't seen a picture
seen two possible but
when the p cos the press have been there i mean they ha they had their own stand they've not taken a photograph have they
oh
no i don't think so
that on the left did they have a photograph of it
try and think about the initial one when the lord mayor opened it
tt you see the press might have something they're actually taking part in the event that the erm
right
the erm article is about
right
a is she on still on at the moment
yes she's still on at the phone
yeah UNK i'll come and have a word with her
yeah it's okay
greater york aren't we
yeah
i mean then we didn't even go into UNK we stopped there
yeah
erm
you'd have UNK and UNK
you wouldn't have easingwold or tadcaster though
it would it would
it wouldn't be a bad thing would it
no
it would it would be bigger though wouldn't it
than it was
anyway
hmm
interesting
where was i up to
j b been doing staffing
oh that's right
oh yeah the
i think er actually
other thing about
yeah the other thing on staffing tt which is a related but in a sense i'm trying to keep it as something of a separate issue and that is to do with the amount of management time
i've started to talk to alan about what i see as a lack of management time erm in this division
erm but i must say that i know the view of erm both ray and cynthia is that they have a lack of management time in relation to the other two divisions because they don't have the assistant divisional manager post
so it's yet another argument that you know everybody's got their legitimate view on and erm at the end of the day there's actually likely to be less money in the pot rather than more
mm
and i really don't know
mm
what's going to be the outcome of some of this
mm
but anyway so the meeting's on the nineteenth of may we'll finish at two thirty
can i just say that that's the day before the c s m t that i'm going to so how does it
mm it is yes
link into that meeting
because i don't think we'll have made any decisions by two thirty
so you'll think he'll just flow into the next day's
so it'll be continuous at the c s m t the next day
right
and you see paul won't be present at the i don't think UNK be present at the meeting on the nineteenth i think alan will chair that
right
so that what we will have to do is make our recommendations to paul the following day
so we'd have to go through it the next day anyway
do you want me to come on the nineteenth as well
so
cos that seems to be the day when the arguments and discussions may be er set
yes it is rather yes no i can't get you in to that one
but y you'll be there on the twentieth
i could just turn up and say oh am i a day too early
shame to go back i'll stay today as well
you'll have to be play it very carefully on the er on the thursday and not look as if you yeah
you can nod what you do is you when you nod
ah but
i'll kick you under the table or something
yeah
yes
two kicks to shut up and one kick to speak
yes
oh
so we shall see
we haven't got er i mean obviously a lot of the staff that are on these temporary contracts are from the adult team
mm
and er that is obviously going to contract because you'll have seen the note that went round saying that you know we haven't got as much money for that next year
mm
what ab you know the posts that we've got funded through y t on action plans
yeah
is that is any news is that just gonna continue at the moment what's happening there
jane's been talking to paul about it and he's being very non committal because of this y t s t m review
right
you see
but he's hopeful that it will continue
so they that funds the best part of a careers officer
mm i see
and that has been integrated across a county into the establishment which is why i'm sort of saying
mm
you know we should have more than just
we've never had half of that in the past
we h we did prior to the m s u review
and when m s u did their review that post just got
yeah
integrated across the county
it shouldn't have done because it was extra funding it should have been left out but they made
yeah
a mistake and included it in
oh right
so but
mm
you see there's clear evidence on that because the number of action plans that are completed
mhm
mm
yes still
erm jane gave me the figures and as i say this division is about forty seven percent
but following on from that number of second and thirds and fourths that are done
exactly
well one assumes that pattern
and you know i mean
oh yes i see what you mean
yeah
that the load is more than just the initial action of my division
probably do a fourth
yeah
you know the second time
yeah
but if you do it in twenty three you're talking about doing
that's right yeah
you know whatever
but the UNK
mm
are the same but i see the point that you're making is that the workload isn't just the initial action plan
action plan
yeah
not at all i mean they can be done in three times
that's right
mhm
yeah
five in some cases
are they
yeah i was going to say a few are aren't they
that's worth mentioning isn't it
well this is another thing i raised with keith that i
yeah but they only pay for the first one
yeah
has the time in that division has to put in
but there isn't adequate funding for
yeah but that was proportional you could proportion it
yeah but UNK
across the county wouldn't it
still
you need to it needs to be based on initial one because that's
yes
where the funding is
but what i'm saying is the more you do of first ones the more you'll do a second ones
oh that's right yes
yes
but the UNK be the same
but it's still proportional isn't it
yeah
yeah is that my pen by the way
it is not it was given to me by a nice gentleman from napier college doing
oh he
c e t
plays this trick cath don't fall for it
no i had one like that i really liked that and it just looked like that
you probably had one like that i've got about twenty in the c UNK at home
he retired after the last c e t and he gave me all his pens and stuff
alright okay
plus they've changed the name it's not a UNK any more
yeah that's
yes quite a lot of them
redundant
he's liaison officer for the UNK he's not at
which UNK was it
napier
oh well
which is a good idea
oh i know the man you mean now
yes
nice man yes
such a UNK
erm anyway back to the er what we were talking about
sorry about that
oh yes i know what i was going to say something else i mentioned to keith was that one of the UNK members of staff that we've got in many ways i think is UNK
and that she you know her since she's taken on this special needs and i think before with UNK as well that this special needs role has really UNK
mm
and that i wouldn't be adverse i know it means you know you if you put s some extra into one thing you've got to take it away from somewhere else but i would be quite happy to see them look at special needs and whether we actually need even more careers officer time for that
mm i think the thing with that was it was to some extent UNK before wasn't it
mm
because UNK could be flexible with a wide e p
yes
that's right
and do it
yes
yeah
as required
yes
whereas UNK
more definite commitments
she can't be as flexible
or if you had a person that was just half time maybe doing it
mm
but it's been really hard for her to UNK
there is the er the other way of looking at this that you can either change the er sort of c o balance or you can give her some clerical time because if she can identify clerical work i mean like diane
mm
erm who helps UNK helps jackie
yeah
erm used to help UNK a little bit
mm does she no longer help UNK
and i was trying to explore this i haven't had time to explore
mm
this to see whether diane can help UNK as well cos if UNK said fine i can then start identifying some of my work which i can then tr train diane up to do you know phone calls and stuff and things
yeah
which will really take a lot of time
mm
well it makes sense cos it must be UNK
well that's right
and so we could possibly you know
just increase UNK time a little bit which would really help UNK
mm
and that may be the answer
mm
i'm not sure
UNK section is i don't know how fair it is but a lot of the pressure that was previously on steve and before him on margaret has actually gone to UNK post
yeah
mm
mm and a lot of the pressure
because it's the peripheral thing isn't it
it's the
it's the follow up it's the phone calling
yeah
and the follow up of cases
yeah
that needs to be time consuming
it's jackie now in a sense that it's a bit easier for her to s to say this client is definitely mine i this client clearly has a special need whereas UNK dealing with the peripheral ones
mm
have they got a problem or not
yeah and it's more the job UNK side
yes
than the
follow up
that's right
th than the f e side
mm
yeah
so
what do you think UNK
cos you have been involved with special needs here
hmm
and i mean i know UNK has had difficulty in having much of an input in this office
yeah i don't know really sue i mean er i'm not sure it's
difficult to say how it's changed really
the thing is that it in this office we tend to pick 'em up between UNK and myself really
yeah
because of the experience
mm
here
that's right
that UNK does the spot in the college
mm
erm
th that's another thing you see i don't really know what work is done in selby
mm
to be honest
no
cos they're mainly in college
because never any contact
it's rarely that UNK i don't think i've ever seen UNK in here
mm
th i mean she might have been in and out of
she just pops in to pick units up but
she just pops in to pick units up basically
but erm so it's difficult to know exactly what's happening now and unless i see it in the office
but it's like the residential school ones like from and places like that
they actually make an appointment for well i've seen 'em
yeah
because they're returning to the area
they
what's available in the area so i've seen them
that's right yeah
erm so i don't think there is a the role required in the selby area in the same sense and
no
i think one of the things we need to look at when we look at case loads is whether UNK is the appropriate person to be dealing with the college
i think we've mentioned this before
mm yes yeah
erm and i've already sounded julie out about that
we've got to find ways of reducing UNK workload next year
yeah
definitely
but she's got to UNK a few things herself
that's part of the problem really
that's true cos i've er
she's always been an UNK hard working careers officer
yes
and there's no getting away from it
yeah
doing more UNK expected of her
yeah
mm
erm i just get this feeling you know one would expect that year eleven is a reasonable way of working out what the sort of workload is and you would think that special needs would actually be something that really related quite nicely
mm
to year eleven but i just seem to get the feeling that we
do they give extra weighting for special needs
yes we our
wh what
funding is on a
three times
three to one ratio yes
you see when steve used to erm come down to selby i mean there were there were occasions when i used to go into the college with him and sit in on some of his interviews
mm
so that when the kids left th they knew who i was
right
and he used to come in here and if it if y t or jobs you know whatever it was going to be they all come in and they knew who steve is
yes
and that's going back sort of three
yes
three years or so
but that probably stopped when i started going in didn't it
yes yeah
and we've not actually invested that time back in
that's right yeah
er
what about jackie does she come down here at all
now and again she came in the other day to meet a
