yes she does
young lad to interview him
mm
it's UNK very occasionally
it's occasionally mm
it's very occasionally it's normally to see a one off
yes
yeah
cos she showed up a lot of them show tendency at home or er say some of the ones she's just asked us to see in the office anyway
and she got to school
in fact
and actually wanted there's one and two at UNK i know that she's
and there's one that we're picking up which UNK gonna go to a case conference next week social services
erm who was one of hers who returned to the area is in UNK at the moment
mm
but he's due to come out
th the big growth area in this seems to be have been the post sixteen the f e special needs cos that's UNK biggest problem in york two really big
mm
c p v e courses
mm
but part of that problem is that i don't think the course tutors do perhaps as much as they might i mean they do nowhere near as much as shirley does
shirley
in
mm
selby
and it's difficult you know where we're having to make fill gaps that really aren't ours to fill
mm
in a sense
yes
but UNK can't do her job properly unless she actually does that
that's right
er anyway
moving on just a couple more things were on this agenda
it's twenty to twelve erm y d p just really erm having now come to an end
keith obviously is still continuing because s again some money was found to keep his to keep paying him for another few months
i'm not sure exactly what he is doing erm
isn't he investigating erm
training projects
training projects
i think he could be yeah
yeah i know that was part of his
yeah
erm he's actually reporting to the may c s m t about the y d p presenting his final report
that should be interesting
on the y d p
so
erm
i don't know what will happen to him when his money runs out
mm
erm
mm
mm
i don't want to say anything about this at all
just bite your tongue UNK
because if i say anything i'm just keeping quiet here
well i think that it's a shame that the y d p did come to an end really because i mean i know there are a lot of problems with it but i think that keith was doing a fairly good job of trying to resolve some of them
yes
and that we do training credits are going to come
mm
and everybody seems to keep UNK their head in the sa well when i say everybody i mean the tech particularly are UNK their head in the sand they don't seem to want to invest anything in preparing for they're called youth credits now aren't they
erm but before we know it they will be on top of us
mm
but the th when we had the y d p conference at scarborough UNK was saying that the government was looking at career education
and the way she was talking it looked like they were gon they were going to put some more and invest some time money
ah
into careers education in the in the schools er
did it
in UNK of training credits
erm because people were saying you know the y d p's coming to an end but
yeah
you know what next
yeah
but she'd already partially answered that question by saying
right
yeah okay it's being looked at
i mean whether they decide to do anything
mm
on it is another matter
can i just ask you what date is it for training credits starting
it's ninety six
yeah
they actually
but that is the leaving that is the th that date is the
for school UNK
school UNK that leave in ninety six
ninety six will actually have training credits
yeah so unless you've started doing something
ninety five
from at least the previous september
ninety four
yeah
in fact yes it's ninety four isn't it
cos you're actually preparing for the credits bef the year the academic year before aren't you
and is it just i mean does training credits just go through year eleven or is there preparation work in year ten for it
that depends on i mean talking about action planning and
contract with the government
at that stage i suppose won't it
i depend on how they decide to fund you
whether you're funded on year eleven or year ten
yeah or post sixteen which seems to be the flavour of the month at the moment because of the high drop out
which seems a but cock UNK somehow to me
mhm
mm
there's a lot of unknown at the moment
so we're in ninety three ninety four we've got about a year and a bit before we actually have to start really doing something
that i mean they're setting up the county working a county working group again aren't they
yeah
er
i was just trying work out when robert left school and whether he would be the first lot but he won't be
mm
ah no little UNK pigs
just trying to work it out in my head he'd be
mm
leaving ninety five
year nine now
so he'd just make it
so it must be the year more before
yeah
if he's year nine now
yeah
yeah it's a it's an l e a wide working group isn't it
hmm
that paul is actually on himself i think
yes
is this national then
oh and it's l e a tech
mm
isn't it
is it
yes it
all go together then they'll be some sort of erm
well yeah but you see that the trouble is they've been now two if not three pilot phases
phases yeah
and there can't be that many authorities left that aren't already involved
so i don't think there will be a big national impact it'll just be the last few people coming in at the tail end
well there's only sort of erm i mean who else is round here doing it
i mean bradford went for the initial
bradford yeah and UNK their
recent recruitment was for that wasn't it
that's what
mm
got a job after
i mean my impression is that the resource has come in on this i mean extra staffing i mean you need it you can't do it without
well they put
actually there's money coming in this
yeah they put additional money in on the pilots but
yeah
whether they'll actually put additional money in
when it becomes
that's right
yeah
you usually get more money to pilot something you see
mm
like t v e i
yes
mm
the earlier stages of something
yeah
because once it's it happens erm it sort of it becomes law doesn't it really
because if it's written into reforms and so on
then you know if you've got to do it they're not going to actually give you any more resources to do it because you can't say no
that's what the teachers are talking about at the moment aren't they
the national curriculum
mm
same sort of thing
should never gone back to blanket
have blanket interviewing now haven't we
well there's a lot of
there is a lot of there are a lot of things that are pointing to this at the moment
erm there's a one of the other things on any other business that i was just gonna come to was a UNK survey that is being carried out nationally
alan and i spent all morning on wednesday trying to complete this survey questionnaire that ask questions about erm how much time do careers officers in north yorkshire spend for example teaching careers lessons
we decided to put that none of our careers officers spend any time teaching careers lessons that we deliver guidance through classroom situations and things like this but we do not teach careers
erm because we realized it was politically loaded that
mm
you know you send a form back that says we teach careers lessons immediately you're told right you can stop doing that that's not your job to do that
mm so you have to really be careful with
oh yes but this questionnaire was absolutely incredible and every service nationally and wales and ireland have been asked to complete it
scotland seem to have got away with it at the moment
erm
right
the questions like ev everything that you've got to say how much time is spent on it and then how much does that cost you
and it's really to provide according to derek it's to provide the secretary of state with some ideas of UNK of if she decides the new careers services to run careers UNK she would make that part of the specification and she would know how much that was likely to cost her
mm
so she's really sort of getting her plans together her information base together to
are you er who have you got then
okay who is it
get real
okay
cos i've got one tonight haven't i
anywhere you wanna sit lads
next to each other ideally should
moving around now
right
where you gonna go my seat
so who's gonna go first out of you two
yeah i'll go first
right
give us your form then er and in your own time and your own pace
just gonna get a quick little UNK
just a quick UNK i dunno what page it's on
that would be a good UNK for you
no it's alright i've got that in my head okay i'll it's alright hi mike
UNK
how you doing
very well thank you
okay
all we've been through this evening
yes
are you quite happy with it
yes quite interesting yes
quite interesting
and you're happy ah right
yes
okay right that's good
do you remember when i said er as we were going through i said there were one or two things that you perhaps could help me with
yes you did mention that yes
yeah
well i'm as a matter of fact before that i actually said that er this all this that i am doing on your behalf is completely free of charge
you did
i did didn't i
yes
well it's a bit of a lie actually er there's a fee involved in all the preparation and all the work i've done er and what do you think the UNK worth
how much do you think it's worth
well i don't know you didn't mention this earlier did you
er that's true as i said i UNK a little bit i failed to tell you the cost of the fee
how much do you think it's worth
well i don't know
you don't know
alright let me tell you it's not actual money the help will come in the form of er recommendations
ah yes
yeah
er i would appreciate it very much indeed mike if er you know you could recommend me to one or two people you know open minded like yourself who i can sit with take a couple of er half an hour of their time like i've done with you show them what the services are
well i don't think i know anybody that would be interested really
yeah
erm as we were going through and we talked about a will you said there there's somebody you knew who would be able to you know who you'd like to carry out your wishes if you were not here to carry them out yourself er i think it was it er john
oh yes
yeah
you know have you got his phone number
er yes okay i can give you that yes
great that's okay right and is your is your brother in law
yes my brother in law yes
right and does he live locally
yes but i'm not sure i think i'd rather phone him first if
ah in fact i'd appreciate that very much indeed mike i in fact
i'll tell you give him a ring tell him that you've given me his the telephone number and he should expect that i'll give him a call in the next week
okay then yes okay then
that's terrific
okay
erm is there anyone else er as open minded as your brother in law
no i can't think of anybody at the moment
you can't think
you play cricket don't you
i've been known to have the odd game yes
right and er
er there's about twelve other guys
right
course naturally as in the service this cost this for yourself
perhaps er they could take up services
the guys you play cricket with what are their names
you want all twelve do you
i wouldn't mind
i'm a greedy person as you can see look at the size of me
i i'll speak to them first and i'll er when you come back with some details i i'll let you know then
sure so at least you'll know when i come back i'm gonna ask you thank you very much indeed
okay
okay
i thought you were a bit UNK
so did i
prospect erm and also at the beginning there y i you did it in your own way not following the script er that may be well be previous experience you know that
yeah
you you're relying on but you didn't really sort of go back and say i mean i would use a phrase like erm you know regards to planning your future i'm sure you found that of benefit to you tonight and get re and actually dig a bit deeper in that and say what was it in the in that actual form that
interest in your eyes
that was the one that interested you most
yeah i was just looking for a memory UNK here i just couldn't remember what it was
erm i didn't get anywhere that you actually reminded the prospect erm or pe potential client here why you're actually asking for referrals
yeah
if he if he was open minded i think he's happy with
open minded
he's happy er said are you happy with all the preparation that we've done
you didn't remind him t by not using the script you didn't
yeah
get into the point that like earlier on in the conversation
i actually found it i know me and you have discussed this earlier on and i didn't find it i found it confusing to be honest with you
you did
yeah i found that you suddenly put
you suddenly put me on the spot asking me for money
yeah
that threw me completely
i don't know where you got i mean is that previous where you worked previously
no that's it i mean look er the UNK this
yeah
you get it's that er in a normal UNK piece yeah i open my okay it's not an abbey life
right
set piece
yeah the only thing
no it's
right
so i walked in his house or her house or their house you know and i've said to them blah but this is what it's all about
yeah
yeah
there's no fee involved it's a completely free service all i'm here to really do today is to have a chat with you find out what you're interested in and see if we can situation is that alright
pursue all that pursue all that sunday yeah
right
yeah but is that alright so he'll say yeah it's alright
i mean i thought you felt uncomfortable mike
i thought you felt uncomfortable
i did
yeah
yeah
okay fair enough that's the feeling but you the first bit i'm UNK the
yeah i mean i'm trying to give you a score here
he's trying to justify it
yeah so yeah ah you're alright so you'll say yeah course i'm alright there's no fee so eventually i get to the point where i said look i did say there's no fee involved but i'd i that's a bit of a lie because there is a fee for all the work i'm er but it comes in the form of referrals in the form of recommendation not actual money
no
you know i asked you to commit yourself how much do you think it's worth for me to do all this kind of work and he's you're confused because you think i'm actually talking about money and i take the weight off your shoulders by saying no it's not actually money it's in the form of two or three names people open minded like yourself who i can sit down and discuss the whole situation with
yes yeah all that all that part was okay erm but from the point of view of the script th that we'd asked you to learn last night y you didn't do that now that may well work for you the way you're actually doing it but from a training point of view we we're trying to look that you're actually following the script there
erm so on that one that's you didn't use any UNK the belief in the way you asked i think that came out i was trying to be a prospective client rather than be the trainer cos i could see that mike was uncomfortable and i was trying to well okay how would i well i think yeah there was a belief that you had there i think he was er reasonably UNK mike to your response
yes
all be it wasn't well th the response and you didn't actually you mentioned his brother didn't you
yeah
at the time
he gave me his phone number
but again see again cos we're not following the actual script the picking up and UNK people mentioned in earlier conversations which you would've done if UNK gone back to the planning the future
yeah if i
mm
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen you've got fourteen which actually still gives you would still actually give you an a in the real world
right where's okay that's gonna be a c stick that in your UNK when you go back in
alright boss
okay mike it's over to you now then to
right
to your situation now so imagine you've done the old planning of the future like we said yeah
when i said to you earlier erm there's several ways in which you can help me now the main way you can help me is erm is er the way i do the way i prefer to do business is by personal recommendations and you've seen the service that i can give you you've seen we've been through your personal situation your financial situation have you found that of benefit
mhm
you have
yeah
and that's you found it of interest to you
yeah
right now what i'd like to do now is ask you for some of your some names of friends of yours who i could go through the same process with them and establish their financial security for them too
can you think of anybody UNK
you mentioned earlier you work with is it you work with
er yeah
yeah
could you would you like to give me his number
well i don't actually have his er telephone number
okay can i contact him your place of work
yeah you can
yeah
cos you've got the telephone number
we also was discussing earlier on that er you play squash
er i don't actually it's er cricket
it's cricket is it
yeah
right
erm have you got any er people there from the cricket team that i could er contact
yeah i know er one or two persons
yeah
you mentioned one was steve was it
yes
it was steve yeah
steve
yeah steve
mm
good
and his phone number
er yeah he's a good mate actually
i does he is he a UNK or a or what
he's a bit of an all UNK
he's a bit of an all UNK
is he any good is he better than you
he's a bit of a
quite good is he
yeah that's good
you also mentioned that you're erm you're involved in UNK is this right
no i'm not
yes you are
okay then er right fine
that's it
oh
that's it
well you didn't actually revisit planning the future properly
no
right
erm remind er and again your phraseology mike like well can you think of anybody
yes i re i said that and i realized that i'd said it and i shouldn't have done
th that
yeah
you know you
yeah i
er whereas if you had said positively that i'm sure you can think of a number of
i asked him a question and he could answer no
yes
but i realized i'd said it so i tried to dig myself out the hole
right well you didn't actually get any objections so you UNK handled them you didn't mention about the prospect contacting the referrals prior to the being made er at the end you did actually bring up didn't you about the UNK is he a UNK then said he was a erm said he was a er all UNK so you know i'll give you that
you did actually say that i only work on yeah
alright okay
the idea of finding out about the UNK was what he did in the cricket team so that when i mentioned that i could say
i don't i don't think there was a lot of belief in the way you were actually asking mike
i've got scripts no
enthusiastic well because of above no
alright not use UNK show belief in the way he or she asks for recommendations
going first which is probably not the best thing to do be UNK you were reasonably UNK
pick up and UNK names mentioned earlier well you did it cos you
when asking for name and telephone number eye contact alright there
you i mean you weren't UNK enough i didn't think
no probably not
yeah but again i think it all goes back to the script doesn't it
that's right but i've also got a thing about being UNK you see
well sorry UNK i mean we got push not what's the what's the not UNK not the right word i'm looking for erm asking in a confident manner
yeah
that was missing right
but the confidence comes with practice
with practice yeah
practice
ten which would actually give you a b in normal circumstances but as you know we're only allowed to give you a c right and there's a few notes in there as well did i'll tick your box on your one
do what
er i dunno which box is that
at the front on the front
at the top
requires further on the job training
what c
i've ticked c have i
at in the four boxes at the top
yeah
i've ticked
yeah
right okay then
alright okay lads erm first is always the most difficult as i think you'd appreciate
yeah
if you wanna sit in on another couple of guys
there's a queue formed there's a queue right okay
now don't forget because these boys have forgotten it you've gotta make sure you mention the planning your future document
yeah
gonna revisit it and it's standard cos it all hinges if you look at that script what happens next all hinges on what you've actually got on there right
who wants to go first then
i'll go first
alright give us your give us your seat then and i'll
cheers
fine now just imagine i'm not here now for a moment
okay
erm so you can see actually from this fact find from the planning the future document there are there was there is a particular interest to you erm are you are you quite happy with the figures er sorry was it erm was it that you were more or less interested in
was that the er particular interest
yeah er cover was the one that after we'd been through the document i did find of be of particular interest
yeah
because er it's obviously gonna fill a gap in my financial planning that i'd not thought about in the past so i did find it particularly helpful
y you're quite happy how we achieved those figures
yeah
you you're quite happy
yes i thought the explanation was er was pretty good and clear and i was happy with the way the er the UNK worked out
that's good i'm pleased about that
erm yeah i did mention earlier actually there was one or two ways that you could perhaps help me er one was erm i hope i'd like to think that obviously my service has been of value to you erm i'd also like to think that you can perhaps recommend me to people you know er you did actually mention earlier erm was it peter you work with was it
peter who works yeah i don't know whether
yeah peter yeah
i'm too happy about sort of passing on er you know UNK names and addresses er i don't think it's really appropriate
yeah that's okay it's just er i mean i would like to feel you would introduce me if they actually knocked on the door and came in this evening otherwise they'd think wouldn't you i mean
well i s yeah i suppose i suppose i would when you put it like that yes
and so it's peter from
that's right peter he's er he just started work in my department about three or four weeks ago yes
and was it peter
peter
that's right
peter
peter that's
and does he actually have a home telephone number or so can i
er i'm not too sure where he lives cos he just i think he's just new to the town but if you give him a ring erm on the 's phone number and use the
right
same extension you used to contact me originally that would find him
okay that that's great
i would like to think you could perhaps mention to peter if you see him in the next couple of days i don't know whether he pops into the office but we it would be nice if you could if you could mention
our meeting and
i'll probably see him er back at the office tomorrow i will mention it to him when i see him
yeah you could certainly point out the areas that have been of interest to you and perhaps i could follow up with a phone call to er to peter in the
oh certainly
next couple of days
yeah
er jim across the road is it jim you play on a thursday so
that's right
yes
yes certainly give you his er
right
phone number yes
thanks that's great
it's er i'll just i'll just get my little book out and i'll tell you what it is
right
it's er UNK three four five six seven
great that's smashing
also the same if you're playing football with jim on thursday you could also just mention to i'll leave you a couple of these er these leaflets which do explain a lot of the areas we've covered tonight erm perhaps you could give one to peter or
yes i'll er
try
i'll do that if i remember
yeah that's okay
erm
does erm does judy i know your wife she goes to UNK class doesn't she
she goes to the
she does yeah
classes yeah
do you think she knows er do you think she er i know she did mention the girl kate she goes to UNK with does she pick her up
she did didn't she
that's right she picks her up cos you're out on wednesday night
so yeah do you think i could er perhaps get erm the number for kate
yeah well
i'm sure she'd be interested i think she has children i think doesn't she
certainly when my wife comes back in i'll er i'll mention it to her and i'll get her to give you a ring
that's great well you've got my number and you can always contact me that would
yes
would be great
okay that's very kind of you thanks very much
that's good so thanks very much john i'll leave you now
thank you john it's been a pleasure
thanks very much for
thanks very much
terrific except for one think you didn't actually ask for the client to contact the referrals prior to the approach being made number five
i did
i said could you mention it to him
you didn't
yes he did asked er i said er i'll be
i'll be seeing him when i go back to work in the morning
that's right
said perhaps can you mention it to him mention
yeah sorry you're right you're right
okay
erm number one asking for the completion had been worthwhile very good there reminded er john why yeah that was excellent thought you handled the objection well you know about if the person walked through that was good everything else was tick erm sound pretty enthusiastic there that little extra note excellent voice quite enthusiasm again controlled but not appear too UNK it was very controlled
i think so yes
erm you know i put down here that you're a natural
very fair
i can only give you a c
tell me john i'm pleased that we've er we've managed to get business completed this evening i think it's gone very well i'm sure you agree er do you think that er did you find the exercise of completing that planning the future document was of benefit to you
yes er i did er i think my wife and i both agreed that er the was quite
was that the ar was that the area that you felt was of the most of er benefit to you
yeah certainly
why was that specifically do you think
well that just er to be honest with you i mean after looking at it we couldn't believe it really that amount of people could be affected by that we obviously thought it wouldn't happen to us but after seeing that at the age we are i really think it's a super plan and i'm sure we'll feel a lot better
it is quite surprising how many of my particular clients do take out that particular plan and they do tend to mention the same type of er of benefits that y that er that you just mentioned there it is er i think it is a good plan UNK appreciated
tell me when we when we s started our discussion of the planning the future document i did say that er there was one or two things you could do for me and er one of those of course was to ask you if you could during the course of our discussion if any names came to mind anybody who you would find that you could er you could recommend me to or can refer to me to if in fact you found our discussions were of benefit
mm
and in fact you did mention erm
i can't think of yeah well i can't really think of any at the moment yeah
well actually you did mention er chris at er at where you work i think you said
that's right chris yeah
i think you said he'd just moved into the area recently
he has yeah he lives in er now i believe yeah
does he
is that in UNK
it is yeah
have you do you have
er
have his phone number handy
i don't think i've got his home phone number but you can certainly ring him at work er
if i contacted him on the same number that i contacted you
yeah you could you could perhaps get him on that yes
and that was
yes that was that was UNK
great thanks very much
i think you also mentioned that you play you play a fair bit of football as well john
i do actually yeah i play for on a on a thursday night yeah
yeah i used to play a lot of football when i was a young guy like you
yeah
it's a good sport isn't it
oh it's great i love it i like keeping fit you know
and you did mention that you were particularly UNK with the goalkeeper alan i can't recall his
yeah
his surname what was that
oh yeah it was er
i think it was alan
alan yeah
is that
it is yeah
any idea what his phone number is
er i can certainly get it for you cos i've got most of the UNK phone numbers er in case any of the games are cancelled yes it's er
great smashing
those people whose names you've just you've given me their details from could i ask you er if the next time you see them if it's within the next few days or certainly erm if you could over the next day or two give them a ring just to let them know that i do intend to contact them i'll probably contact them within the next week or so
yeah sure i
is that okay
yeah no problem i'll see peter at work i'll pr er i will mention to him about it cos i was very impressed with yes certainly i'll mention it to him and er alan if he's if there's a game on saturday yes i'll i could mention it to him
oh that's great
and if you're er with you intending to ring them you know it's er
yes cos what i mean obviously in the in the type of business that i do you can see yourself a very personal business
yeah
and i do prefer to work on the er on a personal recommendations or referrals basis because that actually allows me to UNK most of my time to my current clients without having to go out cold calling and looking for people
yes
it is a sort of a beneficial way of doing business both for myself and for my clients so is that okay
yeah that's great yeah
erm when you see erm alan john erm if you see them over the next day or two if i can just give you this er these little leaflets
yeah
that do explain a little bit about abbey life products and also have a copy of as well erm they might find that of help before i give them a call
yeah oh certainly yeah that's no problem
okay good erm i think that's probably gonna be sufficient for tonight john
yes
i think er well i think we've managed to er to complete our business er very nicely i hope you're very satisfied
that'll do you that'll do you that'll do you
right okay good very good the objections cos you tried to UNK one in there very early on but john actually overcome it quite good
erm everything as i say okay yeah g er on knowing your script yeah good didn't erm UNK at all and also very good john at the old active listening sales type people we tend to rabbit and not listen and it's a fault
yeah
because you can actually learn more by listening than you can
i know
by actually talking
er all very good stay in control excellent very polished erm yeah y you'd be worth an a but you've only got c
great
i felt that to be er UNK now i mean how excited can they be about
with this well erm i was er after the first two years when i didn't get a referred lead or recommendation cos i had this fear in my mind that if i asked for names they'd actually not give them and that they would actually then cancel the policy they'd taken out with me i actually thought that
mm
but if you think about it if you've done a good job you've done a good presentation done a good fact find and they buy then they should be very happy at that moment in time and er it was stupid because that is the right time to actually ask
i would say it's perfect because
that's the perfect time and i had this sort of doubt in my mind erm then i was fortunate i learnt a co a very good UNK presentation for getting referred leads and once i started to actually ask cos that's all it comes down to erm then i was getting three four in the end i was being quite clever and saying look if you just restrict them to three then i'll give them the same good service i reckon i've given you this service
mm
by saying restrict them to three you get the best three they can think of
mm
you usually get the fourth and the fifth as well but i did actually only say three but alright
as it's you i will take another one
mm
erm and it actually came out like that quite UNK
yeah
it wasn't but it came out quite UNK erm no i it's the only way to work er but y you know it's here it's your attitude i mean
you've gotta think
you've gotta think er think it was like erm one of the guys was saying oh i've got a real problem getting the names i said well how do you ask and he said well look i'm in the people business john but i don't suppose you know anybody do you
no and he wasn't er he said see they say it all the time i said well of course they do it's the phraseology you're using
mm
i'm in the people business but i don't suppose you know anybody do you you're bound to get a no
mm
what would you say is a fair percentage of referrals and actual cold calling would you say for an associate
you know
well probably in your early days you'll probably do a mix but if y the quicker you can get to only work and even to the extent i mean i went out and bought my own book that had personal recommendations on the front and i would actually show that and say look john the only way i actually work while i get everything ready you might like to look through because it's the only way i work i purely work on a personal recommendation basis and that enables me to get quality clients like yourself erm and i can UNK time to you rather than have to go out looking for people to tell my story to
mm
i use my clients to actually me expand my business which i means i can give you more of my time
mhm
and this shows if you give the book out at the end and then what'll the guy say you wanna give it out at the beginning UNK the seed that this is the only way you work you're now thinking well this guy's gonna be asking me for recommendations at some stage during the hour together
yeah it seems a nice little idea there's a nice black bag with
yeah
personal recommendations
well i've got a red i got a red book out of UNK and i had one of my clients was a printer so i got him to put it in the gold
yeah
UNK my name and
yeah for the sake of what it cost me a fiver probably a UNK these days speculate to accumulate
mm
so yeah
does this go in with erm
yeah that goes in your UNK now
same place as the other one
yeah
cheers
yeah just imagine i'm not here
got your forms
yeah
who wants to go first
who's going first
i do
alright well in that case you keep
i'm the client am i
so you've got a guideline as to what you are if you need it
don't forget the old planning the future revisit it
right
make the point you know i'm sure you found this useful what particular area was the one that excited you the most yeah
aha
erm do you think that the erm planning your future that we've gone through this evening was er was of value to you
i'm sorry
right start again
do you think the er the planning your future that we've gone through this evening was of er particular value to you
yeah i th yeah i think it was i was a bit UNK before came round to er be UNK surprised
a lot of my best clients say that actually
er which area do you think you found the most interesting
er well the pension planning
why was that
well i thought i was adequately provided for the er future but obviously i'm not i'll have to bump that up a little bit
i want to enjoy life when i retire
indeed
keep up the golf
well you remember er when we sat down this evening i said there was a couple of ways that you could help me one of these ways was that er you might be able to introduce me to one or two of your friends and i can run through the same ideas with them
er tell me you work with a chap called chris
yeah
er would you mind introducing me to him
do you have his phone number
er well yeah i don't know i don't really know whether he'd er like me to be handing it out
mhm
mhm
well look
too happy with that er
i can understand you saying that
i think erm what we what i'd really like to do is if i could get in touch with him and give him the chance to make up his own mind er then he could decide whether or not he would like to have a chat with me and i'd just run a few ideas by him just as you've done without any pressure er and he can make his own decisions
erm
whereabouts is he
do you have his phone number
er yeah go on then it's er
great well thanks for that
now what's erm what sort of age is chris
he's about thirty three i think
aha
and he does the same job as you
yeah same department in fact
is he married
no he's living with someone
has he er got any family
no
no
right okay i'll get in touch with him thank you
you also said you played squash regularly erm there was a chap david you mentioned that er you play quite regularly er i'd like to get in touch with him as well if i could
er well yeah i suppose so why not
great
it's er
okay thanks for that
maybe erm
you have to be careful with dave he's a little bit er UNK at times
is he
yeah
and i don't
i'll only
want him coming back to me
well i tell you what
if he says no you know i don't want you pushing him
yeah right
well maybe you could have a quick word with him first and i could give you a call and then erm
i won't be playing squash with him for about another what four or five days so it's next wednesday
mhm okay well
and so if you leave it till after that and
so you'll give me a call on thursday then
yeah
yeah okay give me a call and er if he's quite happy i'll give him a call
well thanks very much for that dave i'll look forward to seeing you in the near future
okay thanks er thanks
okay you covered all that okay yeah erm i think the objection bit you could've been a bit better on that one erm cos that was quite a sort of bad one well you're not too sure about sort of giving his name or his telephone number out
mm
you might've er i mean you did it right it could've been a bit stronger though a bit more punch to it er punch isn't the right word erm you know well okay look what i'm really asking for dave is your help you know when people ask you to help what would you normally do you'd help wouldn't you
yeah
i mean for example if they walked in the room right now i'm sure you'd introduce me so i'm really saying is look can you give me a telephone number i'll give them a chat and in fact by the way if you do see him within the next couple of days or so please give him a shout let me know that you've been quite excited about some of the ideas that i've shown you this evening i wanna do the same thing for him you know nothing gained nothing UNK nothing lost
yeah
right
yeah
okay good
with me
mm
see it's difficult but then that's but it's only practice
mm
and don't forget all next week you'll be doing the planning the future bit as well
mm
okay do you wanna get yours back then and then we'll do
right jim we've gone through the er planning the future form there this evening erm what do you think of it
any benefit there for you
yeah sure
interest
mhm
well any particular area that we've looked at the five key areas we looked at there if you remember
erm definitely savings that's something that er i never really thought about it's shown me a way to get some money together to buy a boat which would be nice
your boat yes you're a bit of a sailing man
er you remember earlier this evening i said there was two ways you could help me
aha
one of them you already have you've er given me some good information for this fact find you've helped me fill it in
aha
the second one was that er if you found er my service helpful to be of benefit to you you'd feel free to recommend me to some of your friends and colleagues
now earlier this evening you mentioned chris who you er play squash with and what i'd
yeah
you to do is er give me his telephone number so that i er contact him offer the same service to him as i have to you
yeah certainly i would do but i must admit i don't really like er giving people's phone numbers out i don't know how he'd react to you know somebody ringing him up and
well how did you react when i called you
you know
i'm here i've provided that service
it's just an opportunity to meet and that's all i'm asking for
you know he'll decide for himself whether he
yeah fair enough
services
i thought it would be er
i mean if he called round here now you'd introduce me wouldn't you
mhm
just throw a blanket over my head and pretend i was a UNK
absolutely by all means okay his number his
and do you have his address at all as well
yeah it's erm
okay
is chris married or children
yeah he's married and he's got one little boy who's about three i think
yeah
mhm
does his wife work as well do you know
erm
also there's dave that er you work with
yeah
erm
well i suppose
i'd like to see him as well if possible so do you have his number
well erm but er i don't actually probably the best thing is just to er call at the office
okay that's er the same number as yourself
yeah
and same extension
erm no he's erm
right
you don't have his home address at all by any chance do you
no i don't really know him outside of work to be honest
okay that's fair enough
we have a few UNK occasionally but
that was erm what was his surname
it's erm er
open minded type of character
he certainly is
have to keep our fingers crossed
er who else do you know that er may be interested in this service
well any other friends family brothers sisters
well i can't really think of anybody
neighbours
no
do you know anybody who's got married lately
had a child
erm
it's er just offering a service er i really think it's a class act to use an expression
mhm
you know you cover all the areas five areas there
mhm
plan your future
er well
there's people that you know people take it up with me
there's the girl next door she's just had a baby
i believe everybody should be given this opportunity whether they take it or not is up to them
the girl next door
yeah
what do they call her
er UNK
UNK and er she's married i presume
no she's single actually she lives her parents' house
oh i see
does she work then or
er i think she does a bit of part time i'm not really sure what she does she comes and goes she probably works in an old UNK home or something she has a uniform
right i'll give her a call
do you know her telephone number
no i don't you probably i don't sh she i know she's a bit hard up she's not on the phone you'd probably be better off just
do you think she'll object if i er just give a knock on the door on my way out there
would you object
no not at all no
okay i'll do that if you don't mind
mhm
er anybody else
er no can't think of anybody
i'll tell you what anyway jim i'm coming back next week to er give you a few answers coming out of this fact find so
mhm
if you wouldn't mind in the meantime if you could think of a few names you know as you're going about your daily business
no well i'll think about it yeah
pleased to have those
and that's it for this evening so i'll look forward to seeing you next week then okay
okay
thanks a lot jim
well you've been very helpful er
smashing
right doug erm there's a couple of points there really erm like you got the guy and you said who else do you know why not paint a picture you know erm like for example jim the people i do business with are between twenty five and thirty five they're usually married buying their own home
probably got possibly got children you know
mm
who do you know who actually fits that description
whereas who else do you know and a little bit later it's well anybody else it's er vague isn't it
yeah
and they c er and you won't get a response apart from that
i mean i think i mentioned like friends family er brothers sisters
yeah but it wasn't done in a in an enthusiastic manner it was like a sort of well who do you know like friend family that sort of thing and at the beginning i thought you was a bit more positive but i thought when you were UNK the planning the future that might have been nerves right at the beginning of the session you then relaxed and your pace all UNK down excellent at reminding er jim picked up referrals mentioned earlier handled the objection okay don't remember you asking jim to contact them beforehand don't think you did jim did he
er
mm
i don't think he did so it's the only one you missed out probably find the video that's not applicable but yeah
erm you yeah you did actually you were good and it was a nice pace you know it was a relaxed you know
mm yeah
er that was good
friendly enthusiastic yeah didn't use any UNK erm the link was there the attention to the client's responses that was good i was saying to erm th that sales people tend to be a bit sort of more rabbit than UNK down you know that they're
yeah
but you've got a very nice way of actually listening and you'll actually learn far more about people by listening than actually talking so erm i found that quite picked up and UNK areas contact er eye contact that was good stayed in control not too UNK yeah
you're worth an a mate but you're only gonna get a c
okay we'll have our next two in
are we free to er run away now
well i think we'll actually do a bit of a UNK yeah we should be finished
right
i think some of the lads have gone
have they
well one definitely has er
oh er j david has he
football
oh that's right yeah
UNK brian
thanks for seeing me this evening er
you haven't gotta do it on me
oh sorry
i'm well i'm the fly on the wall
don't forget yeah give us whoever's gonna go first
oh right
er who's going first
i don't mind
ian
i don't mind
shall i go first
yeah you go first
oh right i'm
in that case you give me your form keep hold of it
right
i don't mind i'm not here i'm just a fly on the wall like
erm but don't forget to like if you look at the beginning number one you've gotta make a big thing on planning the future
yeah
i mean i'm gonna try and give the first two guys and er mike who came in they didn't do very well cos they didn't actually mention that bit and it didn't flow from then on you've gotta make the point you know did you find that er well not did you that's bad phraseology i'm sure you found this beneficial which of the areas of the five tonight actually interest you the most do that bit and then go in with the fact that you actually mentioned earlier on that you do work on a recommendation basis
when you when you say that brian i mean you you're talking about at the end of the planning the future after you UNK
is that correct or
yes
well you don't want us to UNK
no don't do it just assume all that stuff that's been done
yeah
so you just wanna revisit it and say oh i'm sure you found this document has been really useful this evening and out of those five areas we discussed you might wanna UNK it a bit which was the one that excited you the most and that's your retirement savings you know
right
not been for anything else yet
yeah
and then you can pick it up from there
right okay
alright
right
well ian we've finished the completion of the document erm the planning your future document now which of those five areas did you find interesting
i thought helping to er increase me pension and was very good
right
okay well as i said previously what i'm gonna do is go away and then i'll prepare some figures for you and perhaps i'll come and see you next week okay
erm what i said to you earlier was that er at the very beginning where you could help me was if you found this of value to you this service that i've just provided erm perhaps you could erm th there might be er some friends of yours that er you might find that this might be of beneficial to
now you
mentioned chris earlier i believe
oh aye yeah
erm the fella that you work with
yes
erm y have you his
i don't
er have wou i believe this chris might be interested in this er have you got his telephone number where i can contact him
yeah why do you think that
well i what i would like to er erm sorry i've gotta stop
go on go on go on
erm
cos you were doing great up until that point and then you left yourself
yeah i know but
wide open and that's where you got
i i'm
the response you got
that's right yeah
er well er the reason is i believe that i think you mentioned earlier that chris is er in the same line of trade as you
and as you mentioned about the pension side which you was interested in on the planning the future i feel
oh yeah
that chris might be this might help chris
yeah
erm
yeah have his number yeah
like to say er if you'd like to ring you could ring him i'll ring him next week
mhm
and if you'd like to ring him first and
oh i'll see him at work and i'll obviously we'll talk about
okay
yeah
so er
yeah his UNK whatever
right okay erm is there anyone that members of the family that erm that might like appreciate the service
erm
perhaps your m mum and dad or brothers and sisters
yeah me brother might be of interest now he's
okay
yeah i mean i'll give you his number
yeah
and your brother's
right
and his telephone UNK whatever
right okay
and is there anyone you know that has just recently got married cos these are areas that obviously
yeah erm
really help people
no at the moment all my friends have been married a few years erm next time you come and er
right that's lovely ian anyway thanks very much for seeing me this evening erm well as i say i'll go away and prepare some figures and then i'll see you what say wednesday next week
yeah
er in the meantime i may ring chris up er and
yes no problem
see if i can be of help to him
mm
okay thanks very much
thanks
you may ring chris up
you will ring chris up
i will ring chris up right er i lost track of it halfway erm you know it was but er
so i just
and you got your points in i mean you asked whether it was worthwhile you did that very well actually er and you were good on reminding the prospect why you were actually asking for recommendations probably a little bit weak after that point although you did you picked up again there were there were points we're looking for you did pick up referrals mentioned earlier
the objections we didn't re didn't really get the i you were doing that first of all and then you UNK and started again
yeah that's right
and it UNK quite nicely and you didn't actually give any objections or any
he wasn't supposed to give me any objections
i wasn't
well you
no er we just done it naturally actually it was just er
yeah i mean you coped be er you came across as very natural you knew your script er friendly enthusiastic yeah no UNK belief was there UNK to UNK responses yeah picked up the names mentioned earlier eye contact when yeah er that
qui
quietly confident i would say
yeah i feel brian i mean you know you said we'd gotta be natural it's all very well reading from a script but at the end of the day it's natural that comes across
that's the guideline you put your own phraseology and
yes
your own UNK on it
yeah
right
okay that's you'd better hang on to that one and i'll
yeah
oh can i put a c on the front
tick c for me tick c
i'll tick c
yeah
er requires further on the job training
yeah
that's what
we can't give you more than that
yeah do i do i throw in objections or
well i mean if he's very good you probably won't be able to
right okay
erm david we've just obviously completed a plan of your future we just looked at areas which we
yeah
we both felt you need to highlight erm can i ask you which of the areas you felt particular interest in
yeah i was very interested in the savings plan actually i i'm not very good at saving and i believe that could be a help
i i'm not looking to put a l put a large amount of money away but that's i'm interested in that
yeah
ah right that's good
earlier we mentioned that erm there were a couple of areas which if i was helpful to you could possibly help me and one was obviously
best advice i could give to you
right
the other point was obviously people that you may know which may be able to help me in my business people you feel this information obviously it was of interest to you
yeah i found it very interesting
erm
yeah
but would obviously be beneficial to them and
yeah
you mentioned er john erm
yeah john
bit of golf with
that's right yeah
erm
yeah right what i'll do i'm i can a i'll see i'm seeing john saturday and i'll mention to him
right
could i have his telephone number and give him a ring
him a ring
right
john and what's his surname
er it's john
right
erm
telephone number whatever
address yeah
right and you mentioned your brother as well cos he's a guy
right yeah my brother he could be interested
aha
erm yeah i'll certainly
right
and obviously people
yeah
you feel would
yeah i i'm not sure at this stage but they might they might be able to benefit yeah
great
erm anybody else
erm well there's some other guys i play golf with er fred perhaps i'll mention it to him as well
right
do you have his
give him
number at all
i don't know his number UNK but i
well i'll see you next i'll see you next week
yeah
cos i'll come back and see you so
right yeah okay
erm er if there's anybody who you feel erm next door or who have recently been married cos it's obviously a great help to people who have just recently been married
er actually my UNK just recently been married er then again i don't know her phone number at this present time but i'll perhaps i'll perhaps er
well what i'll do is next week i'll
yeah
erm
right
watch the dog round me UNK
ah right i like dogs so that'll be alright
because she's got a big UNK
and erm good thank you very much indeed and i look forward to seeing you next week
yeah okay thanks very much
good ian
i was i was a good client wasn't i
yeah
yeah but the way he was asking again it was it was a natural flow
yeah that's right
there was no there was no pressure there at all was there
yeah that's right
and he'd actually confirmed that you found it useful and he had mentioned earlier on there were one or two ways that you could actually help him
yeah
it was a na if you do it if you follow those two first parts right the rest of it almost slots into place
very good ian erm excellent voice remind the prospect as to why you were gonna be asking and i thought you were very good there erm i in fact you were that good that you were actually offered to contact before you even asked
yeah
you had the offer to contact these people for him erm the video doesn't apply
at the end of the day
yeah
he's very enthusiastic er superb on that i thought erm kept on asking i've put here you actually ended up with five names
i didn't
mm
i had i had five names here that would give you sixteen you're worth an a but i'm afraid
you've only got a c
you've only got a c
alright ian good
i should imagine when you go out and do it it's er it's a lot easier in a sense cos you
this is the UNK one
yeah
but as long as you follow the guidelines that are there
yeah
you're there
yeah
has everybody else been done
oh right
yeah fine give us your form
now i'm not here alright
yeah okay
but don't forget to revisit planning the future
to re
revisit the planning the fu the fact UNK okay so that the sort of phraseology will be well i'm sure you found this a very worthwhile exercise
yeah
incidentally er jim which of the areas was of particular you know interest to you
mm
paint us a picture yeah
alright
okay jim well we've been through the erm the planning your future exercise
mhm
and er erm and we discussed it fully and i've been noting the points down you know but what in particular was of interest to you on that er on that on those discussions
er i think it was the er the pension really
the pension
mhm
why in particular the pension
well it was something that you hear a lot about it and er i've never done anything about it and it's cos i'm starting to think towards the future and it's gonna be nice to know that i'm gonna have a pound or two to go and do what i want when i retire
fine
right we'll do something on that for you and erm
mhm
see what we can do and we can arrange that that's no problem
yeah good
do you remember earlier this evening when we was erm talking of going through erm i said there were ways that perhaps you might be able to help me erm
mm
help you er you mentioned your brother john and his family
yeah
erm i'm sure that i could be of some help to them
aha
i'd like to contact them have you can you give me their number
erm yeah i can give you their number it's erm
yeah let me just write that down
okay it's erm i dunno i dunno how they'll feel about you phoning them up though to be honest with you
well would you perhaps like to give them a ring to say what i spoke about today then i'll give them a ring say if you could ring them tomorrow then i'll ring them er tomorrow evening a as well and then perhaps i can you know they you've given them the ground work to actually er for me to ring as well and then i can discuss with him and arrange an appointment to go and see him is that okay
yeah i should think so
oh good okay
oh talking about th that sort of thing er i think you mentioned the UNK club is that right
yeah that's right i go every tuesday night
oh do you
oh that's good
er is it erm a large club many members
erm i think there's probably about twenty odd members with ten people who are there every week
oh they're there every week
mm
oh erm i'm sure er who do you think will perhaps be of benefit erm for me to talk to them as well you know to discuss this with them
i don't really know
erm well perhaps you wou would you er let me perhaps er well not let me but perhaps i could ring a few of erm those people just to have a chat with them and perhaps put you know talk about the er planning your future exercise with them as well could you would you give me some numbers please
yes sure i've actually got erm a list here of erm all the members of the club
a list
oh that's fine
oh that will be splendid er well thanks for that that's er that's great obviously
mhm
erm er going on from there erm who else would you think would be interested there's obviously relatives friends anybody like that with a wedding erm soon or
er
can you think of anybody like that perhaps who might be interested i mean because you know we cover for weddings and er
actually sue this friend er sue she's getting married
is she
yeah
mm
yeah
er sue
super mhm telephone number
erm er i can't remember but if you ring UNK you know
oh UNK in norwich yeah
she works there
ask for sue yeah that'll be great
if you see her in the meantime obviously mention
sure we we're going over there at the weekend actually give them a ring next week
yeah well i'll give them a ring say early next week
mm
and if you can have a word with them i'd be grateful that just lays the foundation for me to talk to them and er and to go and see them
well that's splendid
you know we've got mortgage and everything like that
mhm
thanks for that information anyway
that's okay
well thanks for the names erm and er what i'll do is i've got this video i'll leave that with you and your wife
mhm
have a look at that
aha
and er i would like to make an appointment to come and see you er again next week to talk over this mortgage and to go into it a bit more
right
okay
fine
yeah
so then perhaps if you'd like to take a look at the video in that in the meantime
mhm
erm then erm what i'll do i'll pick it up next week and that will obviously show you a bit more about abbey life and any of your friends or anybody you think might like to look at the video erm you know just to give them an insight people you mentioned erm to me that you perhaps know you'd like to pass the video on to them to have a look erm and if er you've got my number and if you want to ring me then i can get some more videos if you think other people might be interested i'm quite happy to pass them on to you as well okay
yeah okay bill
yeah well thanks jim it's been lovely meeting you and i i've enjoyed the evening erm and enjoyed thanks for the tea and we've been through
that's alright
we've been through everything erm everything possible on the fact find er on sorry planning your future and i think er you know you you've helped me
alright bill UNK excellent
apart from a little UNK half way through when er when you threw in a bit of an objection you UNK a bit no very good excellent
erm you know i liked the way you actually confirmed the pension as a number one priority i thought that was good
yes you reminded erm er jim about the er asking why you asked for recommendations UNK handled the objections UNK erm i'd actually put video not available but you brought it in so you've got a cross here and it's got yes you yes it was
i'll give you that erm but a very nice quiet sort of controlled enthusiasm bill
very good with searching questions
mm
you know you sort of you were there i am as a trainer you were sort of digging away there getting a bit more information out about people
excellent voice i mean worth an a bill brilliant if you do that but i mean i'm not i know speaking to sort of charles and tom and alan they say that sort of recommendation referrals in norwich are very difficult but i think if you do it the right way
mm
mm
i don't see why it should be
yeah
right do you wanna grab another couple of guys and send them in and i'll er
thanks brian
will do
sort them out
is that all
i think that's it brian
that's it is it
oh well we'll go back in the other room
i think exercise completed brian
is it
oh good
yeah
good
well we'll just arrange for the er
councillor
i'm actually concerned that if we did anybody know about this issue earlier on because i think this has been going on for quite some time erm probably over the last two years and if anyone did know then why didn't they address it before and if anyone didn't know why not
certainly i i've been aware for a while now that there have been problems at UNK general in terms of break ins erm not just specifically with the UNK but with also the community room er there and certainly i i've been engaged in making one or two suggestions about how security measures could be improved
erm including discussing with officers the possibility of fitting security erm er forgotten the word UNK erm to the actual the actual building itself
some of the er that measure is not actually effective or not possible in the context of the facility er i think there's been a search for measures which will be effective and er erm that's what the efforts gone in to finding an effective way of preventing it
more than that i really just can't say
call upon councillor
getting increasingly frustrated on the subject of other things UNK and that i've been concerned to hear since i've been requested this question and er it was briefly reported in the cambridge evening news last night that they they've had almost continuous telephone calls today complaining erm which shows the public as i thought of my own experience er are very concerned about this and would like to erm first of all bring it to the council's attention and do regard as serious and ask the chair if there is a proper investigation will be made into the way the council UNK this subject
erm ironically after i wrote erm the letter was typed on monday erm to mr the only lights that have been fixed since are the ones at the end of my street and the next street not as i complained about ones on the main road erm there's an example that's been going on for many months where a problem an acknowledged problem of access existed which was the reason for delay but that as i understand it has been overcome some time ago now and it's still there this is a group of seven lights together the lot erm these lights are still out they're not in my ward in fact they're just
er i understand there was problem because of the computer breakdown which caused a certain record to be lost but then i discover that there is no copy of man manual copy of orders sent to the contractors for repairs kept so that having lost the computer record the council do not know what lights have been reported to contractor for repair and then find out the basic clients
number seventeen mr mayor er councillor is making speech
to the chair reasons for my concern here and reason for my asking her whether she will now agree to a full investigation of this service at to be conducted by councillors and for the council to be satisfied that the service can be put right
just in the nick
are you satisfied
all the members here will know that i have recently erm sent out a circular letter expressing my concern as to where the system doesn't seem to be working properly and asking for your help and cooperation in giving me information on just exactly where it is falling down
er i thought it extremely UNK of councillor instead of responding to my letter he goes to the press and starts complaining this doesn't seem to me the way to sort out the problem at all and i am equally aware of the problem er and if it only helps me get some facts together then it will strengthen my arm getting things sorted out
there are some problems that have erm had come to light recently
apparently erm the UNK software which controls the issues of orders to UNK er contractor has a fault er last been erm spotted and so that it can be sorted out and er there's going to be some reorganisation of the way in which erm UNK are handled in the department
i'm hoping that this might lead to an improvement but i still please ask you all to keep me in touch with where things are going wrong so that they can be put right
thank you councillor
mr mayor point of councillor letter came to me after i'd already written which she will be aware long period
but erm i don't still don't see from this how we're going to look at the underlying systems because it's the system that concerns me
we don't have we don't have a way of identifying reports and getting them fixed
i mean the w the UNK crossing case started with when i was a councillor before nineteen eighty eight an and it's a difficult one to detect but if you haven't occasionally come back late at night and there's no traffic that you can spot it because no vehicle d detect vehicles when there aren't any
but that i've been reporting that fault regularly five years ago it's still there today
something is breaking down in our maintenance system and it is at the clients side
got fifteen seconds left to put your supplementary question
councillor to councillor
councillor do you think that you as the chairman of the UNK charter UNK working party of the UNK charter where it was generally agreed that whenever possible letters should be replied to or at least acknowledged within five to ten working days
could you please give some indication as to when you're likely to respond to the letter sent to you on the twelve of the first nineteen ninety three
about the su the pr your reported proposal for a supermarket on the m eleven roundabout and also you see the commitment as confined to the officers only
yes okay replied to various of your constituents and have conducted a UNK discussion on this matter with councillor jane and recorded in the cambridge evening news i'm sorry i haven't replied right
that's pretty
do you see it as a commitment for councillors as opposed to necessary just for officers
thank you chair
i hope councillor hasn't been UNK about this question because i think she should have had adequate warning erm the cycling part of working party was agreed by city board on the ninth of on the seventh of december is to come to an end and such work has er relates to cycling within a new transport working party
can she please tell us when this UNK will take place and when the new transport working party will be UNK
will she agree that in fact no rationale was offered for the end of the cycling working er party other than the desire to reduce committees
does she agree that in fact this action is UNK to the other participating agencies of the cycling working party
the county council cambridge and district council could friends of the earth
this committee working party with a small budget has nonetheless through sharing funding with these other agencies has had it UNK pump UNK achievement of er creating a very successful project throughout the city over a number of years
does she agree that this non controversial form has a er essential role to continue er in cambridge and that erm the issues of safety environment and the promotion of low cost schemes is something that must be preserved
yes i know you'll have to with me
erm yes the cycle work working party has been very successful i er experiment and it has been much appreciated not only by people in the city but by the other parties that have taken part in it
er we looked at it as you know when we were considering reorganisation of committees and i think this is perhaps one of the few things to come out of all that
it has only been met twice this year the budget is quite small for the amount of work we can continue to do is quite small er it's quite possible that it would only need to meet once a year in future so it would be sensible to combine it with other non policy and traffic matters as a working party
this doesn't mean to say that we can't invite other people to a special once a year meeting of this transportation working party to deal with cycle issues
i think what we will do erm certainly a lot of concern was expressed at the last meeting that this er forum should die er but i don't think it will i think it is very simple to set aside one meeting a year UNK it to cycles and invite the same people who have coming from the party
does she agree that there's something UNK in er i certainly agree successful experiment it bringing to an end because it's a successful experiment er clearly the policy is only to continue with unsuccessful experiments
er yes i agree the funding that we provide at the moment seventeen thousand i think er i in we've already committed erm for wh for the coming year is small but it is because of the example because er people who wish to m er erm promote cycling schemes and cycling policies within south UNK within the county council can identify the example that we have been setting that UNK budget aimed at cycling have been er directed this way and have been spent UNK sensibly by cycling working parties
then this will not happen as we know a transport working group is going to be er a controversial area where it will cease to be the operation that we have had in the past from the county
it is coming to an end in may it is not coming to an end in practice
we can now go to the second choice question
first of all councillor is lucky enough to get two UNK at his cherry
well i must say mr mayor i was UNK assured by the answer that councillor gave earlier on about the er UNK efforts the council is making to improve the security at the UNK cash point as i now gather it's called
erm i'm slightly more concerned though about security in this building and in some of our other main buildings and it brought it home very UNK to me and i'm sure to all members of the board when we arrived at our meeting a few weeks ago and spent er over two hours standing we didn't stay out more or less standing out in the street and
and it did bring it home to me that we have got a major security problem in this building and in our other UNK buildings and quite frankly the ease with which anybody can come into this building at virtually any time of the day or evening UNK me
when i go to other er council buildings er throughout the area they've all got these little er UNK locks and people have got cards to get in and out with
now i understand er that you know we are providing public service here and we have got allow for public access but the cost of the council of having all its officers outside of this building for over er two hours must have been absolutely horrendous and i would have thought this would be an area where improving security ought to be a high priority so what are you going to do about it
councillor
thank you mr mayor
i'm pleased to be able to answer my very first oral question
UNK
i mean as councillor is aware in trying to move around this building there have been some changes in use of UNK locks on some of the doors
i think it fair to say you can't actually list you can't actually put preventative measures on UNK bomb UNK
somebody rings up and says there's a bomb that doesn't matter how much security you've got you've obviously got to clear the building
having said that i mean i think there has been obviously some concern about some security measures other than terrorist or so called terrorist threats in relation to staff personal security in the building which is why we've actually moved towards more one stop per section area so there are limits to where the public are actually free to move around the building
i would hope over the next few years we actually do move towards increasing towards that but i think we will have some severe difficulties particularly with the planning department where large numbers of members of the public do visit the area
but in the view of the action the event that took place with the bomb scare there are s there are some reviews of security measures being undertaken
i cannot say any more than that
i appreciate mr mayor that you can't stop bomb UNK
er but i say it i was just using that as an example of how it brought it home to me how easy it is to get in
the other evening when we had our group meetings you can just walk in that side door you can go virtually anywhere in this building UNK because we can't have security guards all over the place
there is no reason whatsoever why those doors should be left open after five o'clock
there ought to be a system er to allow limited access at least outside of normal hours yes they're called keys
and i'm disappointed that councillor is talking about a matter of years before we get something done about this
we want something done about it in a matter of weeks and months and not years
in fact to relation to one stop shops i was talking about years in relation to the new security i was not
erm i think it fair to say that if you'd asked more or less to the next meeting and probably sub committee would be quite acceptable and i would thank you for drawing it to our to our attention
it's quite a reasonable request
i trust you will be happy
councillor
thank you mr mayor
we've still got time have we
we've only three minutes left
right
so you
very quickly then mr mayor
earlier this year or was it last year i received this marvellous booklet
it consists of odd pages with some figures on and a load of pie charts
my estimate says that each copy of this cost in excess of two pounds fifty
i have no idea how many were produced but i would ask you mr mayor whether you feel that this expenditure was money well spent
yes UNK councillor i can advise you that in fact it did cost considerably in excess of two pounds fifty it cost four pounds and sixty one pence each
as you will see they
they are the colour of the leader of the council's shirt and as such as such i would have said cheap at half the price
and i indeed i'm not exactly high UNK they are not exactly high tech what they do is they
a substantial amount of information which is necessary and which indeed was asked for by members of your i believe at a previous oral question time erm as to the number that were printed you may be shocked to know that one hundred copies were made which means that the total cost of this i think you will agree very worthwhile public information was four hundred and sixty one pounds and twenty one pence
you i don't think mr mayor you answered my question
do you think it was money well spent
oh yes i did answer your question it is
it is information which is vital to any councillor who is trying to go through the analysis of cost centre by cost centre of the UNK of this council and as such it's vital that this information is available to us not only by UNK through all the relevant minutes and in er minutes of committees that have taken place but UNK together in one place for us all and members of the public to be able to get access to it
it is as councillor said one of the costs of democracy as such money very well spent
now we turn to the notices of motion
before we do before we do given that it's just coming up to ten thirty could i ask somebody to propose suspension of standing orders
mr mayor we don't UNK standing orders we book them
ah
that simple thank you very much
would somebody please propose in accordance with standing orders that we should extend our proceedings beyond ten thirty
yes
thank you
can i see those in favour of so doing yes thank you and those against call upon councillor to move the motion on public sector homes
thank you mr mayor
we bring this motion for the council tonight as committed as anybody in this chamber to social housing
in fact it's because of that very commitment mr mayor that we are so keen to see it used properly and effectively
social housing should be just that
it should be housing designed to meet a social need directed towards those with no other means no other option of getting a roof over their head
it should not mr mayor definitely not be used simply as an easy option for those who could manage quite happily to provide for themselves either UNK or buying in the private sector but instead choose to let the state provide
it is ludicrous that the council should UNK with public money my money your money someone's housing provision UNK if they are quite able to stand on their own two feet
it is particularly true if by so UNK you are UNK a would be tenant who is UNK in possibly far greater need of that self same provision
our concern then mr mayor is to see social housing used correctly for those in greatest need and this leads us to the conclusion that means testing is the best way to ensure is positive discrimination in favour of people in such need
if i might turn briefly to see how such a scheme might possibly work
i would recommend that officers might visit south council where the scheme in fact
works extremely well
amongst points they might like to consider are the fact that the scheme is very simple to operate and extremely cheap
what happens for a simple is that on first application you bring your financial details to the interview references are taken up naturally in confidence and you are then allocated a place or not if you meet financial criteria
the procedure is carried out once again when you reach the top of the list
if you don't provide the information you are simply not allowed on the housing list
if i might secondly mr mayor address some of the concerns that have been expressed and no doubt will doubt be expressed later on
this is a good time to start this scheme because in a recession it's even more important that those in the greatest need get the most help
means testing mr mayor is undoubtedly UNK
nobody in any sector public or private should offer benefits unless for a good reason
the public should no more offer a subsidy of this kind using public money without checking if the UNK actually requires it or anybody else besides means testing is nothing new there are plenty of other benefits that are already means tested right across the board
in the press on tuesday mr mayor this motion was described as a UNK of conservative UNK and a re a return to victorian era
yep
if it's mean mr mayor to put those in greatest need first i'm happy to plead guilty
if it is mean to be prudent how public money is spent guilty again and finally if it is mean not to UNK those who can quite stand on their own two feet i'm quite happy to send myself down
i will continue mr mayor that it is not UNK it is practical caring conservative policy to ensure that this happens
he said that with a straight face
it is mr mayor it is mr mayor the labour group who should lead the victorian era and entertain the of the twentieth century
it is labour who rather than UNK into their UNK at the mere mention of the phrase means testing should wake up adapt adjust and welcome change
in conclusion mr mayor i repeat social housing to be effective should be for those in greatest need not an easy option
this motion sets out to address that issue and i hope it will gain all party support
i beg to move
i reserve my right
standing order seven i move that the motion in financial implications and those in favour of dealing with it tonight please show
councillor
thank you very much mr mayor
is the tape recorder still on because i have a word that is
describes this motion i won't use it but it UNK with UNK
it's interesting this isn't it we've moved away somewhat from the old tory philosophy of erm freedom of choice
we're not going to have people are not going to have the choice about whether they buy a house or rent privately or wish to be on the council housing list we're going to force them off
what this is mr mayor an attempt by the conservatives to create UNK to create UNK for the unemployed and the low paid and the forthcoming victims of your UNK welfare schemes i think is the likely likelihood of this
what he's talking about and this is the same erm same councillor who was talking about living UNK side by side those that have are buying them those that are UNK them but what he's actually saying is well i'm actually very sorry but if you haven't a job if you haven't an income or you're income is so low just go over there and stay away from us decent chaps with lots of cash
we don't want to live with you
we don't want you getting on the council housing list UNK it up because you've got a job and a bit of money we want council houses to create UNK we don't want people in an in employment people with money to have council houses
you're just talking about as i've said UNK creation
what i wish erm mr mayor because councillor tries this erm tory party central office philosophy time after time after time
i wish they would actually give him a w an award and councillor the same award for services to tory party policy above and beyond the call of duty
this needs throwing out mr mayor it's rubbish
councillor
i thank you mr mayor erm well what a load of co UNK balls er
this motion really addresses a problem that doesn't exist it's a UNK sort of problem
something like seventy five percent or sixty six or seventy five percent of the of the units which we actually let of the houses that we actually let go to homeless families you know it is a complete fiction to suggest or even try and suggest as this does that somehow or other houses are being allocated willy UNK to people who have massive resources who could go out and buy or rent in the private sector
the private rented sector as you should be well aware is in fact declining quite rapidly in this country and no measure that the government has so far taken has managed to UNK reverse that trend
the real issue over time i actually think is UNK of housing which relates directly not to some sort of magic UNK of any sort but relates to the supply of housing the supply of housing both in the public and in the private sector and it is the supply side of housing where this government has fallen down
i mean i've got figures here produced by shelter probably some sort of UNK left labour party front like the l g i o or somebody like that
turn to the public sector in say in nineteen eighty nine only twenty two thousand units were actually twenty two thousand units actually completed
you don't actually address the problems of lack of UNK this lack of supply by limiting access to what exists
the real question is increasing the supply and that is something that your government has no interest in
you have UNK over an absolute the increase in homelessness which is quite UNK
the number of people that i hear saying things such as i don't remember stepping over people in the street five years ago and it's true in this city i don't actually remember doing that not with the frequency with which it happens today and your government and your party has no record to shout about absolutely none
now we have tried to be a pragmatic and innovative authority
we've managed to avoid the use of overtime we have tried our best to ensure a decent supply of social housing but always against the odds always against the tide of what is going on in our economy and in the housing UNK in the housing market
council housing public sector housing equity share housing indeed even private sector build if encouraged would lead to a ra a range of housing that is affordable for different people at different points in their life
we are interested in the notion of UNK not in the notion of means testing and we recognise UNK that the public sector provides an opportunity for people
this is something which i don't think registers with the conservatives
it provides an opportunity to get out of the private rented sector
i personally and i'm sure it goes for many here have spent a long time in the private rented sector and if the opportunity existed to get into council housing we would have taken it
because you are very often dealing with the situation where you are personally very UNK
you have six months time you could be out of the accommodation that you're in
you're afraid to ask you landlord for a repair because if you do are you setting yourself up for a rent increase
alright
you're afraid to ask perhaps for i mean i've lived in a house with a landlord the landlord turned the heating down turned the water heating off on occasions because we were using too much hot water between about four or five of us
decent affordable public sector housing provides opportunities for wide ranges of people in our country and your government does nothing to promote the right to rent the ability to get into decent housing where people otherwise would have no such chance
because they'll never be able to afford even equity share accommodation and it'll be difficult to afford anything more than that
i find it UNK that you try to promote the measure which doesn't even begin to address the basic problem of housing
councillor
thank you mr mayor
this motion especially from the that says to instruct the officers to investigate a simple method of means testing
there is no simple method of means testing
means testing does involve officials digging very deeply into people's you have people spend your monies
obviously the UNK and seconder of this motion do not remember what this scheme meant to people in the forties when it was UNK and UNK and a great UNK into their private lives and i do feel mr mayor that as it was a it was UNK and UNK in the forties it will be no less UNK and UNK in the nineties
hear
councillor joy
thank you mr mayor
erm amendment that need to be made to this words housing waiting list we in fact no longer have a standard housing waiting list but have a housing needs register erm that says a great deal about the system that we have is that it's judged on people's housing need and not on their income
erm i hope that will be changed
er another thing that we need to consider is that sixty percent at least of our tenants are on benefits and that hardly speaks of people income in any way trying to get round the system
i think this could be very UNK
we're also going to consider that cambridge does have very high housing costs in terms of mortgages and that in the city whereas it may be reasonable in other areas for people to be able to have the opportunity to buy
but the cost of housing in the city means that it is beyond them particularly if they're on their own young single people
you need far more capital to get you going in a place like cambridge that you perhaps do in peterborough where some houses can still be bought for around thirty thousand and that needs to be borne in mind
i also wonder how the system UNK with changes to people's incomes er many people particularly in recession we heard that unemployment in cambridge is now approaching ten percent and if you've been turned down by the council your council housing on your means test are you really going to go back to them at a time when you may be under a lot of stress with unemployment to have your circumstances UNK i very much doubt whether people do go back
we know from the housing benefit system that there is a backlog of cases i think hundred and a quite a considerable number of people of where people are having problems producing wage receipts and evidence of income now and one UNK to think of the burden that will be putting on the letting section by erm UNK yet another system o of this kind erm i think people we know that people are wary already of applying for benefits because of means testing and i think that there's that it would simply UNK people who really are in need from coming forward
i think the fact that housing need register not a waiting list and i therefore ask you to reject er this motion tonight
councillor
thank you mr mayor
there er there used to be a time when it was fairly easy to predict what tory motions would say
they tended to say the same thing as the government erm but recently tory motions in this council have started to say the opposite of the government f for reasons which remain UNK to me and this is just another example
now this motion does not seem to understand government housing policy so let me explain government housing policy i don't agree with all of it but this is the policy bit
government housing policy as we found tonight when we voted on the rates is to bring public sector rents into line with private sector rents
then the government says there'll be a level private and public sector and it won't matter that we sh someone we which sector people go for
in order to deal with the problem of means the government says we provide housing benefits and the subsidy this is the government speaking the subsidy goes into the demand it goes into benefit there'll be no subsidy left if the government has its way on the supply side
no i think this policy is UNK just from on practical grounds because er experience shows that demand side owner subsidies do not increase the supply housing erm which
in theory they do but in practice they never have
nevertheless going back to the way the system works in practice you still have housing benefit
what housing benefit does because its available for public sector tenants and for private sector tenants
is it in effect UNK in terms of means the people applying for housing so there is no need for a means test for potential tenants because they all have in housing terms the same means i do you understand this i mean it's vitally important you understand this just to see why this motion is UNK
there is no difference in needs for potential tenants
they have the same means and that's what housing benefit is meant to do
that is why selection for housing is based on housing need not on financial need that's the point that's why you do it according to housing need not for money because the money side has been UNK
i hope that's clear enough for it moves the motion to withdraw the motion
councillor
thank you mr mayor
i think that many of the points i wanted to bring forward and some that i didn't know about
are erm have been made i'd like to simply to say i think two things
one of the most common question of the last weeks are we yes last weeks sunday visiting that i was involved with in my ward was from people who were UNK not about means testing because that is not the word that it was about but about something that is on the same kind of sphere and that was about whether erm east gates which decided to be their own managers would also be able to their own tenants and keep the ones that were less suitable away from the ones that knew that they were suitable
now why's that relevant
it's relevant because at a time when i lived through the means test the one that the real one er then that would have been a very serious point because you could switch and turn and twist the means test in such a way that people would be continually at a disadvantage and the nearest i can think of what the effect of that was living in a very working town a very industrial working town and it was nothing like as bad as the one in london more recently was the homelessness of cardboard boxes cities in london
now i know there was no means test there but there were other things there causing that
if you want really to get that in every town and city and country have a means test
councillor
mr mayor i think we owe a debt of UNK to councillor this evening because the sort of motions he's been putting forward has effectively united the progressive forces
and made one i think realise yet again why one is in politics and what it is that we you know on progressive UNK politics actually stand for
i'd like to put one simple note and i think it'll have to be simple for him to understand it but i would like to put one simple notion to him and that is that there is great merit in having public services sharing by people from all social classes
for example with education it'll be a terrible thing for education if the middle classes continue to contract out in the way that they are so we have a divorced system of independent education quite separate from the state system
when that happens then the some of the most effective voices on behalf of the state system will be silent they'll have no interest in preserving the best features of the state education system
the same is true of the health service the more the private health UNK the UNK private health welfare comes in the less chance there is of people who are who are UNK and people who count in british society start speaking up with the rest of us and saying come on we we've got a common interest and a common stake in this service and we want the best po for everybody and the same will start happening in housing if you get your way
you really must withdraw this motion
erm councillor
there i was talking to people asleep this morning and i woke to the UNK of talking on the radio
i must say to those of you who tend we had nice interview
subject i sometimes wonder if sometimes the tory politicians are like jehovah's witnesses really they sort of set out into battle and say go out and convert these people we're gonna UNK the door on them
and i think there is this kind of elements this kind of testing battle go and defend ye UNK
give rise to the we rise to the UNK
i mean there are some conservatives who do actually believe in the social welfare of the but there are also i'm sure there are large numbers who actually know what vicious UNK there is behind a lot of the other measures of social control that have gone on in this country since consensus was in nineteen seventy nine er you actually realise what a tragedy it is in this area
i actually i intend to believe you actually have been sent by the jehovah's witness to defend the UNK it's a kind of like a and i y'know i'm sorry but i don't really think this actually deserves that
councillor
thank you mr mayor i i'll be very brief because i think that there have been a number of very good points made from all sides of the chamber tonight and i think really er councillor er touched on the thing that worried me so much about the creation of UNK
if we're to take this motion seriously erm the tories are suggesting that council housing should be restricted to those in mo most in need
now on the face of that that's seems fairly sensible y'know if somebody is in need we ought to be doing something about it
but what happens to those families when they've been housed and they gradually improve their position do we send our officers down and say ah you've got some money in the bank now you're not in need get out of this council house we're gonna give it to somebody else
this is what they're really trying to do this is the UNK path behind the tory policy
is actually to UNK the p poor and to drive them in into a s an under and this is part of their philosophy that they've been following since nineteen seventy nine under mrs thatcher
and this is just a continuation of that prejudice against those that appear to be living off the state and not UNK their existence and i think it doesn't deserve the time that we've spent on it tonight
thank you councillor
thank you mr mayor
earlier this evening at the tory twins were recommending to read the city council funding handbook i would also like to recommend that they also learn something about tory housing policy
for one final nail in the conservative coffin
about means testing in general the problem with means test is that they are a rather UNK and very crude form of taxation
they UNK people who are earning money the UNK people for saving money
now what is the point of saving money if you're in a job and you're worried about being made redundant when if you become redundant you are UNK for housing benefit because you've been saving money
means test create poverty UNK
they mean they make it in many situations make it UNK of people to try and found jobs
of course that's so hard they don't make it UNK for people to find jobs that they don't declare their income so that means test would encourage the black economy
now as we saw at the last council meeting where a very right and proper and honest and law UNK council and we don't want to create a situation in which people are encouraged to break the law
to conclude i think that we should go along rather than hope sort of an aspect of conservative philosophy which is that people should be encouraged to earn money and they should be encouraged to save money and that therefore in this case this means proposing this conservative motion though i hope they will actually have the common sense to withdraw it
erm councillor
well i actually must have read completely different to anybody else from what i've been hearing erm the way i looked at it the situation that we have locally compared with what david was saying about the national erm what government are doing nationally and the situation we have here in cambridge city
i'd like the people of cambridge city to know that we do care about the people that are in dire situations financially and that we realise we have got a problem in housing in the city and that maybe we should be saying no matter what 's going on nationally that locally we want to UNK our social housing towards those people that we feel are financially less off and in more unfortunate situations erm get UNK creation has been mentioned and i wouldn't consider council houses to be UNK
that and we've had this in the past where i would say that people that live in UNK north and south probably do earn less and live in houses that probably are don't have as big gardens and things like that so the UNK the nature of the is that they probably do earn less money erm but i don't consider those to be UNK at all
and so i they're not agree with you so this surely isn't a situation that has arisen or will arise
we've got a problem now w we have to try and s split that between our problems here in the city and what will happen in the future and what the government will intend to do about the problem
the problem we've got at the moment is that we have a lack of housing if you like and we should surely put UNK those houses for those people most in need
i wouldn't like to try and say you you're not good enough go away and live somewhere else i think that's
you might not but i bet he would
terrible thing to suggest and anybody who thinks that i think has got the wrong idea of this motion
i think this motion is addressing the problem of cambridge city and that the people that we feel we should be erm UNK in so much as they need the housing
let's try and at this moment in time we're talking about now not the future
let's try and aim it in their direction
i think that we should support this motion on my understanding of it
councillor i i'm speaking on it
i think i think that's you're just in the wrong i think because you're UNK are all elsewhere but what is actually being proposed is every bit as vicious as what each of the members of both the other groups have said
that is the effect of it
i only want to tackle two things
one thing because it's crucial in what was originally proposed in this motion and it's the lie that public sector housing local authority housing is UNK in preference to private sector housing
if you read any report that comes out from the government any report that comes out from shelter you will find that in fact private sector housing your house my house our houses are UNK twice as much by this government than so called public
interest tax relief it's m i d a s right so let's not start talking about the benefit of public sector housing and to show the financial UNK of what's actually been proposed if you understand the government regulation about the ring fencing o of the housing revenue account and the way in which housing benefit is now having to be UNK by those other council house tenants then what's actually going to happen when your poor people UNK those houses those public sector houses and they need the housing benefit that david's been talking about
because it's going to raise your government p a p r because there is absolutely nobody left in local authority housing who's able to pay it because they'll all be on housing benefit
so financial effect of what we're saying is completely incompetent
hear
councillor debt
thank you very much i think er councillor said that in er tory erm motions goes against er conservative er national policy but what it does identify is a very worrying sub text to the tory policies of the moment because w means testing for UNK for housing welfare has gone back to the worst aspects of the nineteen thirties politics basically
th this company must be in a bloody sight worse a mess than we thought and the government are not letting us know this is what they're look for are UNK and they they're
councillor
i'd just like to say that only conservatives could actually put need in one paragraph and slip straight into financial in the next and i assume they're talking about the same thing
yeah
well i can't remember having so many councillors have all spoken at one evening
as the chair
it goes seconded then back to the chair again
councillor
i will because mr mayor i think that councillor started off his response to this by talking about UNK and a lot of differences between the better off and the worst off and i the feeling i got from his speech was that what he was actually driving at was he was attempting to UNK the class distinction that the labour party have been so bound up with over the years
right erm UNK ha have been mentioned by er a number of people
the what we are proposing will by no means create UNK or anything else within the housing stock any more than today's policies are doing anyway
the other aspect mr mayor that i that i want t to dwell on is the thing about housing benefits themselves there's been a lot of talk by a lot of speakers about benefits and er means testing in the years gone by and well okay i'll give councillor a few more years than i have i don't remember the forties because i was born towards the end of them but y'know maybe that happened
but there are still today a large number of means tested benefits
erm income support housing benefit family credits maternity expenses cold weather payment there's a whole host of means tested benefits which most people here will probably believe are reasonable to be means tested
you that you can't have an income support policy if you don't means test because everybody will have some in that case and th there is there is another point that erm that er that certain erm highly UNK members of the liberal party have er mentioned
and that is that councillors referred councillors referred to the fact that means testing would generate a poverty trap
it isn't means testing UNK the poverty trap it is the benefits that UNK the poverty trap
so i think mr mayor that although this debate has erm raised people's erm eye a little i do believe that most of the people here have got the wrong end of the stick in what was being proposed right
we are proposing that those that have
those that have substantial incomes should not be in a position to take up houses that might otherwise be allocated to those on a lower income and mr mayor i as a result of this i feel that i would urge this council although i suspect i shall be unsuccessful in supporting this motion
at least he got one thing right
thank you mr mayor
i must say one thing
one of the great advantages of the UNK of councillor and councillor to this council is in fact because of the motions which i have to say even nine times out of ten i don't agree with a word of or even ninety nine times out of a hundred i don't agree with a word of what have we been talking about this last three quarters of an hour housing yeah
what we have done is raised housing what this sort of debate does is raise housing high on our agenda and that's a good thing don't let us forget that
everybody's taken part in this debate tonight and i for one am extremely pleased about that
housing is vitally important to us all
it's one of the most basic needs we all have is to have a roof over our heads
having said that i'll try and speak to this
most of the points i think have been well accurately made and i don't want to stand here making them perhaps less well wrapped and less well less UNK
i think that er the point was brought out very recently i can't remember even by whom of the fact that in the first paragraph it says the most UNK in our society and further on it says for those in most financial need
financial need is not the same thing as housing need
what we are in the business of doing is providing people with houses who are in housing need
financial status can change overnight we all know that
so what happens if you have just supposing you went down to a crazy way o of means testing
today i haven't got a job i get a house tomorrow i have a job
my financial status has changed overnight what happens
that's the sp the UNK of this particular thing
what doesn't change so fast is housing need
if your living with your in laws and you're having a baby and you want a house or if you have a baby and then you have another baby and you're still living with your in laws housing need hasn't changed it just grows
we have on our a as councillor er erm was saying must earlier on her piece sixty six to seventy five percent of people housed are homeless anyway and will be housed because of that situation
people on our needs register are not swimming in cash they're not people who think i shall have a UNK number here i'll go and get myself housed by the local authority
everybody unless they've been had their head in the ground for the last thirteen years know damn well that they're not going to get housed off the needs register particularly quickly and they only go to people who are most unable to be housed by any other means are going to bother even to put their names on the needs register
we already have a very sophisticated way of assessing housing need
housing need and we do it and people come to the top of that register and get housed because of dire housing need nothing to do with financial status
in any event i think i put this to you financial status okay so you've got a job and you've got er a reasonable income what financial status straightforward thing that financial status doesn't say what your UNK are
you might be divorced and have all of family to keep
you might have UNK parents who you support and god knows how much other UNK which are hidden and then you have to go down that road and say that you're going to look at financial status you're going to have to say and exactly what are all of your UNK in and now down going to get real unpleasant UNK into people's business
horrible and i'm i lived quite happily for long enough to remember certainly means testing and my parents
who would have UNK sh UNK at the very thought that we are even considering such a time in this day and age
i think erm most of the points as i've said before have probably been made and i don't want to make them any more but i would just make one other when we're talking about means tested it's interesting that you're advocating means testing in that way
i think somebody mentioned mortgage interest tax relief that isn't means tested as far as i am aware
means test the right to buy
erm i would say to you er please vote this motion down thanks very much
councillor you have the right to reply
thank you mr mayor
there's been an awful lot of discussion about this particular motion and i shan't attempt cos we haven't got till three o'clock in the morning i don't think to answer all the points
i will just perhaps tackle one or two of them i think
firstly the price about the points sorry councillor made about getting housing
that's complete and absolute nonsense
the whole point of this thing is that as i said in my speech about UNK transfer is that people should mix as much as possible
if we were in fact to promote UNK transfer that would happen a great deal more than it does currently
secondly councillor i take your point sixty percent or so of people are on are erm sixty six p i deferred your great knowledge
there are still people who are waiting on the list for seven years plus for a house
you also said that the government sh should do more supply housing
this year you have the option of using a right to buy receipts to build more housing and yet you are turning it down
if there was ever a more golden opportunity to do that and you are UNK it i've never seen it i never see it through a golden opportunity for that
councillor it'll be UNK certainly i've no doubt about that it'll be positively UNK for those in greatest need i have no problem with that
most importantly perhaps it is quite clearly a nonsense to suggest that this scheme could be introduced UNK for council tenants
that i that is completely UNK for all for all sorts of reasons it would be UNK unfair on council tenants to throw them out of their house
nobody's suggesting we do that would be a ludicrous situation
finally mr mayor i might just take issue with councillor
it is an extraordinary assumption that only people with money are UNK councillor perhaps we should introduce an UNK test as a way of getting a council house
if you're so keen to see people who are as you as you say UNK and a go in council houses it does seem an extraordinary argument to say that those people are automatically not in need it seems very UNK argument
i appreciate obviously tonight we have are not gonna carried today but nonetheless it is something that we believe in very firmly and i hope we have the opportunity to try and persuade you otherwise at some other time
thank you
those in favour of the motion please show
those against
thirty nine against thank you very much
sixteen councillors i take it that you
unfortunately council leaders have to leave
erm i apologise first of all mr mayor er for the second meeting in a row dealing with traffic matters affecting high to full council
erm i hope that i won't UNK the council for too long i'm sure that this motion er won't be controversial
the closure of causeway mr mayor is scheduled to be implemented with the completion of southern relief road erm if after a public enquiry that road is actually approved
in this motion i have actually requesting that the closure be brought forward in order to relieve what is a dangerous traffic situation at the corner of causeway and
the problem simply mr mayor is that during the morning peak period traffic enters the city via causeway going erm i think erm this traffic that's coming over the is joined by local traffic from roads leading off causeway and the result of that is that er on many occasions er we get a long UNK of traffic er waiting to turn right at the junction of causeway and road
turn right into er what is a very busy er road in any event at that time but that the dangers is that many drivers are becoming UNK with waiting their turn in the queue and what they're doing is driving down on the wrong side of the road in order to UNK a little back road that's a service road which runs alongside road and leads into UNK avenue
residents in the service road not surprisingly are complaining that excessive speeds are used er by these vehicles using this UNK run and this is causing a danger to children going to the local school at that time of the day
these particular residents the ones that live in the service road are campaigning for the service road to be closed but not surprisingly the residents who live aren't keen on that er road closure because that would affect their use that route at other times other than the morning peak
what has happened because this problem has been recognised is that the police are having to go down there on a regular basis and actually stop people doing this stupid manoeuvre
er because obviously they are putting UNK coming in the opposite direction er in er great danger and i feel that before too long we're gonna have a head on UNK er which is going to end up with serious injuries
the traffic engineers are well aware of this problem and i and er other tory councillors have been er in contact with our officers and the trans traffic engineers at the and the engineers er insist that the only answer is to narrow causeway by physically putting in er road UNK measures
er this will obviously stop people driving on the wrong side of the road but it certainly won't or it won't prevent the excessive use of this service road which is very narrow indeed
the simple fact of the matter mr mayor is that vehicles coming in have got a very er simple alternative route and when they come down the hill they can turn left go by the golf course knows very well go round the roundabout and go round the roundabout and come in alright they've got to join a queue there but they're in a queue anyway
this would be much safer than the dangerous right hand turn and the dangerous manoeuvre of UNK vehicles on the wrong side of the road
because there is this UNK between what the officers wanted to do and what the residents find acceptable the only way i can get this matter resolved is for the council to refer the possible closure to the committee so that the committee can consider all the facts er in the light of the advice of the officers erm and i therefore beg to move this
i would like to say i'm deeply grateful to councillor elaine who wrote a wonderful letter to the director of transportation which has formed the basis of my speech
she sums it up well
i'll second that
under standing order seven nine o
thank you councillor i rule that the motion has no material financial implications
those in favour of dealing with it tonight please show councillor
earlier this evening graham i thought you erm made a complaint about the number of reports that are coming to committee er but it's not for that reason that i wanted to dispose of this motion now erm but there are other reasons
i do UNK with the problem that the local residents have there but i dare say closing off the road wouldn't be a very good idea but it is something that only the county council can do and the county council have said that they will not do this in advance of the southern relief road being built so i think that really is simply
er i did say
er you said you've had a erm contact with discussions with the officers over this and certainly i've spoken to them a an they this is the case
but they tell me that they have put forward two possible solutions
one which would be closing off the slip road to hills road oh he mentioned it did he
and the other one er the alternative would be to narrow the section of causeway
erm but these things could be done without going to committees without any problem whatsoever if we just have this experiment to see how it works
er i gather that the last letter that had from you dated the twenty fourth of november in which you say that you will get back as quite soon to decide whether you want to apply for one of these erm ways of dealing with the problem or not
erm i also suspect that one solution is erm not very satisfactory to one group of people and the other solution is not very satisfactory to another group of people and of course er since we are coming up to an election don't want to UNK either group of people
to get the local residents to decide which of these measures er me m measures they would like to try erm an and try it out since the other way forward is just a non starter
erm perhaps councillor would wish to put a question under response time
councillor
thank you chair
cou councillor has said most of things gonna say
i do have some sympathy for cou councillor i do know this area and i do know the traffic problems there and we do really in the long term need to do something about it
my problem is that as everybody knows that the southern relief road is going to public inquiry
this authority is taking a somewhat different view to that public inquiry than the erm the highways authority er after UNK hill er erm so i think if we were to take a decision tonight it could affect our position at the public inquiry UNK er and i would not want us to get into that situation so i think to some extent er councillor timing on this motions is wrong and we shouldn't be er discussing it now
that is not to say that i haven't got sympathy for the problem that he's faced with
councillor
thank you mr mayor
er i think councillor has made the case for the motion which he has put before us which is simply for a report to the environment committee which would deal with the tactical if that's the right that's just been raised by councillor
there's clearly a problem any ward councillor who brings out t that sort of thing which is non trivial to this council er for the reasons he has it seems to me deserves er to be supported unless there's a very strong case against it and i don't worth considering and that's what i shall vote worth co you don't
hear
you know i would seriously like to UNK with councillor he makes a very important point
i think if ward councillors bring a map of have no whatsoever
they it is brought forward on safety factors and i think that is a matter that should be considered by committee whatever political persuasion er i do use this road er regularly mr mayor er i live there i an indeed one of the people if you like er UNK
but my colleague has brought it forward on a matter of safety
it is true causeway because of the situation that exists we do have people driving on the wrong side of the road
they drive on the wrong side of the road for some considerable distance which actually UNK me i'm sitting there UNK in the queue and someone comes UNK by on the right er without any sight of the traffic coming the other way er interestingly we did have the police er have had the police up there monitoring the situation
there was two of them w wi with a range rover the other morning er with all sorts of notices and the following morning they had a UNK er hidden behind the hedge as it were er that seemed to obviously put things right for a couple of days
i said good morning to them of course
erm but i would say it does indicate the er UNK of it
apparently it has er this substantial police presence and so on
so to get back to the serious matter mr mayor if i may
my colleague promoting this on safety grounds er is absolutely right er i really do feel the southern relief road issue where indeed works causeway will be closed in the proposals er is one thing
whether the southern relief road goes ahead or it doesn't er is really not er pertinent with the moment
if it goes ahead it UNK the problems but let's suppose it doesn't go ahead
erm then obviously we've still go to address this problem
if it does go ahead the proposals to close it will be somewhat late so why don't we look at them now
so the southern relief road isn't really pertinent to the to the argument
there is a local problem of some substance the police have been there it is a matter because of circumstances people driving on the wrong side of the road it's certainly dangerous conditions er and i think it's reasonable to er take up councillor the this is the practical problem the committee could look at tonight
thank you erm councillor
well i'm sorry i'm still i still think we should throw it out because simply because i don't think you're putting forward i don't think that the motion er proposes the right solution to the problem
i would suggest er i wha i have three suggestions or two suggestions to make
you could i er it seems to me that body that you should go to with this is the joint sub
because the county has to make a decision on the road closure so therefore it should go to rather than
or else you can try one of the one of the solutions that has already been suggested by the officers
councillor
i think perhaps the council will now see why i'm getting so frustrated and it's because we've been talking about this for over twelve months
i can't agree a solution with our officers that is acceptable to the residents i represent and i put it to this council to try and get something done about it and all i get from the chairman of the committee is the officer's comments pushed back down my throat
i do think er councillor that you have got a duty to listen to all sides of the argument and not just repeat willy UNK what the officers tell you
that is not the way that we should be running this council
all we're asking for as i think perhaps the council will knock it down anyway in all the letters they've written you don't
get to councillor it is it is the procedures of the council that you are perfectly entitled to go to the committee itself and place this on the agenda for the committee
in that respect it seems to me that it is not something that is necessary to come through the full procedure of the council in order for you to do and i thought that would deal er establish
erm i hope that is at least of some help erm in dealing with a resolution to this problem
could we see those in favour of the motion and those against
eighteen against
i think we'll
have it again please those in favour of the motion nineteen
nineteen
and those against
are you voting
hang on and i'll tell you
nineteen
on the UNK on the UNK casting vote i vote this in favour of the motion
i call upon councillor to bring this motion
thank you mr mayor
erm we are i will be er as brief as i possibly can be on this one
erm clearly we are in a room full of people who have a more than marginal interest in the political process erm and that goes for your boundaries of cambridge city councils er remit and clearly contains also to parliamentary methods erm i'm trying not to be desperately UNK about this i don't expect anybody erm but a phrase has been used earlier this evening from another quarter about if it's not broke don't fix it erm the boundary commission have looked at the boundaries of the cambridge city constituency have found that it is up to ninety nine percent of the right and proper er number of UNK
it has changed relatively
people have just about got used to the new structure and it seems to me that it would UNK us all to leave well alone
i'm feel that it is the remit of this council or indeed other district councils to talk about the whole of the county of UNK particularly when they start UNK around with issues well outside their own geographical area
i can see that perhaps if they want to have a er they may feel they need to stray into other boundaries but i did feel that when i read what huntingdon district council proposed which was if you like to completely re drawing the electoral map for the entire county i wasn't actually looking at something that was designed to deal with the interests of the citizens of huntingdon district council i was looking at the straightforward political proposal which would be far better to come from a political party than from a district council
what i'm arguing for tonight is that given that we've relatively recent boundary change the people have just about got used to it so by and large er it doesn't seem to have huge numbers of UNK as far as the city is concerned and that we are now very close as close as is possible to the norm for the average constituency size that we actually endorse the boundary commissions proposals and leave well alone and the second part of the motion merely says to a neighbouring authority y'know please in some senses be UNK about not to suddenly decide to UNK your UNK into something way beyond your it's not just a couple of parishes on the south boundary a couple of parishes from the north of their but actually way to our area but what UNK i can only see as a rather UNK er
well we'll begin the parish council er with apologies
we have apologies from m john UNK
and apologies from mrs UNK the other district councillor
have you got the minutes of the previous meeting
are you happy that i sign these er mr
yes
good
thank you
and have you any matters arising from these minutes
er i should say that er we will be discussing four lane er and any planning UNK erm things
i attended the last charity meeting on the thirtieth of november
thank you
erm
the thirtieth of november
yeah
i have here a copy of the committee which was formed that night and also a copy of the minutes i'll give each councillor one and then they can read it at their leisure instead of me taking up the whole meeting
thank you
okay
do you want to give them now or do it at the end
give them now if you like
can i just say that in getting them i think erm the er lands charity trustees are not actually obliged to report to us and UNK doing this as a matter of sort of courtesy really because we appointed him erm but erm i think it's a subject that could well be called on for one of these sort of regular little important at the a g m erm
it could be one of those
erm to look over the year and
any are those
no just one of each
one for each
there's a free sheet
two sheets
thank you
and i gather there will be another meeting shortly
the first of february
good evening
UNK ross of land development
ah good evening come in we've er we've only just started on the parish council so er
i can't
well er yo as a member of the public you will be invited to speak you know where i ask you to come in thank you
erm can we have the UNK report

quiz
quiz
and this time we hope it'll be different so erm
where is it happening
it's here
erm here
here
eight o'clock second of february
in the chapel there
yes i think we may be using the because the opposing team always bring a lot of people and we never have any supporters somehow so erm er we're very pleased if people who sort of spread that about a bit
erm after the last meeting erm i wrote to mr UNK of UNK sherwood about the er electoral role they er draft one with one or two amendments i also wrote back to the nottinghamshire valuation tribunal who asked us for er maps and centres of our population which we couldn't supply also wrote to the services erm which will supply er UNK erm bungalow on poor lane UNK them of our interest off poor lane erm and also to erm footpaths off this to mr jones about the same thing because poor lane is public footpath erm subsequently i spoke to him on the telephone and erm he advised us that erm they have an interest in it erm have received from notts county council a little booklet which
i think everybody's had that
you've all had one
right
you've had one
i don't think so
parish council conference so which some people attended on the eighth of november i received the minutes yesterday erm i don't know if anybody's interested are you john
yes i was up there at that time
one minute
er had a press release er about the temporary closure of graves lane which actually is just about i think finished now
yes it's done
yeah that's right erm there is to be a public transport conference and at UNK on wednesday the ninth of november and there's erm
february
sorry
you never get to them on time
ninth of february i'm not a governors meeting
you've got a governors meeting yeah
i'll pass round the agenda and then you can pass it round when we've had a look er county link just information from notts county council erm who'd like to see
highways department with it's usual highways briefing that comes every month erm a UNK or a booklet about highways in winter we ought to put around
also had further letter from notts county council about nottinghamshire minerals local plan asking us again if we have any representations to make i think it was decided at a previous meeting that we did not erm colin williamson production of development and planning at UNK and sherwood district council it's proposal to run seminars for parish councils on planning policies law and procedures and we would like to know erm whether erm we would be interested in attending and how many people would wish he has earmarked temporarily twenty eighth of march which is a monday as a possible date at town hall so if er if you think that would be something that you would be erm interested in going to the topics erm are really i think things that came up at the parish council's conference the questions about planning about the rules and the policies and the procedures etcetera the erm and visitors were talking last thing for sixth of december for five minutes and the discussion for half an hour to three quarters UNK at half past seven so er if anyone's interested in attending that
are you interested john
this guy wants some numbers some ideas
well yes probably because i had the job of proposing that at the
oh right
i wouldn't mind going
would you like to go anne yeah what about you arnold
i'd have thought those two would be enough
well anybody can go i mean it's just you know i'll say two then
i'd be interested yes
mm
put those two then
right okay
that's a monday is it
that's a monday at the moment monday the twenty eighth that's anne and john
just as many people they can manage with that in
is it at UNK hall UNK
yeah seven thirty thought it would be
what's it called
erm well it's just a seminar about planning at the moment i shall get further information about it on nearer the time erm a change in who would pay our or get our vat UNK claim from doesn't change an address basically and er a request from sam stewart whose erm a UNK er a county councillor er something which i really can't actually erm help him with he wants to know the whole of our parish council meetings date for nineteen ninety four but i mean this is something we fix as we go along so i really don't think that i can help him by that and i'm sending him that erm
can i ask if they if he says er why he wants to know this people intend to come or
i don't know
could i help please chairman sam stewart is the county councillor that covers the south ward that
yes
i do but for the county council
mm
and if you've got any problems with highways at i mean a lot of the things you discuss are county council matters
yes they
in fact i've
highways and that sort of thing and he does go to UNK and he does go to oxford and back and really all you need do is just send him you needn't send him the minutes here you just send him the notice of the meeting
mm
his address i you've got his address presumably
oh yes but he wants them for the whole of the year you see which is impossible
yeah well tell him you'll put him in his diary i would have thought if you'd just sent him the notes to each meeting he would come if he would if he could and if he can't he can't
well i think that's a good idea if we have something with that nature
well are you happy that he UNK over time i mean we can easily do that
i'm not particularly because i'm not
well no i'm asking you if
what would you like us to let the county council know when our meetings our
well it would be
i think it's said it if there's anything on UNK to the county council like highway matters then it could be useful but i mean if it just there's no point in him sitting here to discuss planning applications because that UNK
there's the district council as well
i do differ with that in some respects in that er until we've arranged the agenda we're not always sure whether there will be specifically highway matters er and er i must confess although not on the agenda very often highway matters are things that do get commented on er but er none the less it's just the principle i mean er it's a bit difficult to start saying well do we send it because we have particular things er or
what's the problem with sending one in each time
well this is what i'm asking i mean do you want one sent over arnold
well he is as entitled to come as anybody else
yes
provided he knows when it is i mean and those who aren't going to get a county council for much longer may as well er
well having said that there is a notice board that he can look at you know
well i mean i take the view that if we are going to erm have something on the agenda i can telephone his secretary i can write to him anytime which i'm quite willing to do i cannot see the point in sending things through the post at twenty five p a time when we shall never see the man and if he comes here
but surely this is just one sheet with the agenda on
mm
it wouldn't warrant you know send it second class weight
well i mean i agree it still costs twenty five p
not if you send it second class
you won't see much of him because
no that's right
he doesn't have very much time
he's a very busy man
as mr UNK says the county council are on their way out
peter are you sure
wo would you like to try it for the next year or few meetings
well can i propose we try it for the next three meetings and
three meetings okay
see if something that could be useful or it could not you never know
are you happy with that
yes
okay then
has the fella said when he left the note
i can't see why not
closing time if everyone don't want them if you want them you can't get them
that's right thought so
ian er have we decided whose going to this er
to the erm meeting
the meeting on
yes this one
transport
transport
anybody
it's on the erm the ninth of february
what day is that
that's a whole day one isn't it
er wednesday
that's a whole day
yeah it is actually that's the UNK it's the whole day and most people are working aren't they
can i think about that one
yeah okay
on the what date
well look i'll leave you with this and if you if you want to go post that
sign it in that okay
does anyone else want to
no
er well you
on my own
you keep looking
think i might know about it do you
well i mean i've been to one to a meeting they had in manchester a few years ago UNK been to some
i've been to
mm
yeah
that's right
but er all day i agree is a rather a
big commitment
well we'll have a look at it
especially if UNK with me
well i'll see what i can help you out i'll try
a circular letter erm the UNK company asking if we have any works that we need doing i don't think we do erm UNK and lawn cutting and everything
c are they a private company
yeah
or are they part of the
yes
county council department
no just private people trying to get work
erm newark and sherwood district council er UNK a customer comments procedure erm whereby you can write or ring or anything at all that you think would improve their services or anything suitable or anything like that and there are details about it there er with erm a flow chart erm what the action that will be taken if their clients have a look at that one of them's just to receive public comments about their performance i suppose it's to do with er
can you comment on that phil
anything from you mr curtis
well not really mr chairman
planning applications and er items relating to poor lane er and also the traffic on station road later on er i think it's rather complicated to talk about all of these at one go because i know er different members of the public have come for different reasons and perhaps for the moment i'll not ask for any comments about mr UNK proposals on poor lane er nor er comments about station road er but i will ask you if you want to refer to planning applications er we have three planning applications one is to extend the car park behind the pub one is for a change of plan to one of the houses on the development adjacent to us er and the third one is er the plans submitted by grant development at UNK erm i suspect most comments will be about the last er perhaps i should ask first if anybody wants to make any comments about proposals behind the UNK in or at chapel cottage site does anybody er in the public want to mention those erm well we will go on to the one at UNK then and you're mr walker
i'm derek walker michael UNK
and
michael UNK
michael
UNK
d i f i n
UNK
erm have come from grant development erm i think the views er of people who live in the village will be pretty UNK er put and i believe can i ask with the exception of mr bust and possibly mr pool have you er three gentleman seen the plans to which we are referring
i have
are you mr
they've both seen
yes but i mean i know you've er lived in the area er so erm perhaps i should invite mr walker or mr UNK to make a if you look wish to bear in mind that we have seen the plans
yeah
er we can clear the table if you wish to point anything out to us erm or if you prefer to er to wait and hear what
can i er take the opportunity to clear up some technical sort of er technical points to do with the plans however probably UNK the first one erm in the er letter copy of the letter that you sent to the er planning authority erm and you mentioned one plan being erm handed it doesn't say actually it didn't specify which house or which is the proper way it should be handled but in the small plan showing the site and the position of the houses the attached er garage on the house on plot number two that's the one erm you notice the bridge this end one is shown on the right but in the detailed plan of the house it's shown on the left now
now it's
it should be on the left
hang on
we assume it's the one on the right there
it's to be on the right the layout plan mr bradford is correct the house type is just purely the elevation the
yes
whole thing will be handed single storey garage is alongside each individual house
yes well that well that's is that is that what other people have understood
so the garage at whoever the front the garage will be on the right yes
yes
yeah
adjacent to the existing terraced house
yes so in fact the plan that of the house is a kind of a like a mirror image in fact what
true
a er yeah
and then there's into the open plan as well
and there will be in fact a right into the
oh is it
i believe when we
you just actually give him the distance
there's at least a metre
at least a metre yes
the footpath round the garage
yeah
and the other thing i was going to ask was you that you've UNK on the planning application
yes
erm
which often takes some time
if you're successful on this er current application you won't but erm supposing this application were to be turned down by the planning authority er that you were successful upon the appeal on the first one you would actually proceed according to the plan that was submitted at the first one
at the moment
yes
yes
right is there anything er or would you like to just listen to what people have got
well y yes by all means yes sounds appropriate
yes
chairman can ask through you whether
yes mr
are departments will be given an opportunity of explaining precisely what their development does for the village
er they may not be able to answer that precisely mr bradford
well i
but er we can go and ask them yes
i mean okay what have they
if you feel that er do you feel it's an asset to the village
what you're
i personally feel it's better than what's there now at the moment it's also UNK on a site which is now UNK for housing anyway in the district plan erm it is providing true good quality houses in the area we personally feel that it's better than what's being proposed alongside here
we feel it would be better for the village
you can't see what you what's there now though but you will see the new ones
no i think he's referring to chapel you're referring
yes
to these three here
these three along here
oh these three here i know mm
i mean if anybody wan wants to see the quality i would er UNK one and two are UNK two and one at er UNK er ben UNK the same
you have got some at UNK
yes
yes and er you have to hurry to see plot two because if people move in late on tuesday but erm we can see that monitor development it er we are we are a quality builder we're not a UNK
they'll be easier to find in UNK if we
yes
went down
straight opposite the pub yeah
be alright wouldn't it
UNK inn
is there anything else mr bradford about er
well they may be quality builders mr chairman but i'm not sure that it happen has any relevance to this discussion we're talking about a planning application
oh yes but you just asked what benefit they thought they brought to the village
the only benefits that seem to have been suggested is that their proposals are better than what's there at the moment er grant developments must be aware that there is a an approval a current planning approval for the development of that site which is a development to retain the existing bungalow and develop the existing bungalow and to build a house in the rear
i think to be er i think it is more correct to say that there was an outline planning application for an additional dwelling on that site er in addition to the bungalow that is there and i think that is the situation and all subsequent planning applications have been refused
yes
er that is slightly different in that an outline planning consent er is not is precisely what it says it is not a detail of the type of dwelling that is going on it but it you're quite correct in that the planning precedent has been put that site is adequate for two dwellings and i don't think UNK that er at least not so far
is there anybody else er wants
what i want to dispute mr chairman is the type and the nature of dwellings which are being developed on the site
er no er oh yes exactly yes
erm i mean i think if we're wishing to analyse the application i think we must consider what it doesn't do for the village and i think there are a number of aspects that have to be considered erm first of all as a village and i've heard in this very parish council that the UNK view made that there is a need for small village accommodation this development certainly does not provide that we've also expressed a view that it would be nice to retain the existing bungalow because that is small village accommodation and although it only has a very limited history again it would be nice to retain it as an integral part of the village
the application does nothing to retain the existing trees on the site it was a it is a mature garden with some mature trees and all those trees are to be removed it certainly doesn't do anything to retain the rural character of the na of the village and certainly doesn't enhance the character of the adjoining small er rural cottages i in fact it would be it could be argued that it damages the rural environment because the development is such that it is more suited for an urban development almost a city centre because the comment has been made that there is only about a metre between the dwellings and indeed there is only a metre between the dwellings and the adjoining boundaries surely there is a need for screening it is in a in a very prominent position it can be seen clearly as you enter the village from the UNK area the present proposal doesn't provide sufficient room for screening and like the screen which is adjacent to this building which are set well back from the road and provide an opportunity for screening the single access to the site and the fact that the UNK to these two properties is completely taken up with UNK and with vehicle access doesn't even provide an opportunity to screen
i can't say that er their intention and i think mr grant mr UNK will er confirm that t to retain or probably UNK the existing external hedge to the property
well no we intend all of this
er and er yes in as far as where the excess access isn't
yes
needed
that's right
there'll only be a small section of the hedge that would come down just
yes
to give access in
yes
is it the same access point
yes
the access they are UNK
is that an
between UNK lane and mr UNK
exactly the same place
that's right yes
chairman if you are if you
goes out that one
yes
are at all familiar with that end of the village you will recognize that there are three points of access one of which is mr UNK and as you quite rightly point out is the UNK track among them
er excuse me there is no access from the UNK track er and mr UNK
onto the road
onto the road
er mr UNK access was er given er by personal consent from mr UNK so their access is directly onto the road
yes there will be three points of access onto the road one from mr UNK property one from the development by grant construction and another one from the UNK track
there will but
these are all
yes thank you yes
the external on the road
yes i
a very dangerous corner
i take your point
respect in order to ensure that there is adequate UNK from a single point of access from this dual property it will be necessary to remove a considerable amount of existing hedge to the front of that property it's almost inevitable that it will have to come down because it's necessary from the UNK display point of view now that will mean that the whole of these properties are clearly visible from the road and a major part of the present UNK will have to come down in short this proposal doesn't do a great deal for the village in fact as far as the residents of that end of the village are concerned it does a great deal of damage to the village i
right
would suggest that the only reason for this application is one of profit there has been no attempt to recognize or implement the views of the village in terms of the type of accommodation which is required i would suspect that it's grant UNK intention to develop this site and then walk away and leave the UNK to suffer the consequences
well thank you mr bradford
i was going to grant development have come here er because they are interested in our views er i think as far as the access goes i take your point that UNK is required but i would imagine that the highways department will have UNK what is required as they have indeed for the development next door er where the hedge the present hedge is going to be er set back erm i can't tell you whether what UNK has been made perhaps these two gentlemen
i think i think i think on the er planning report when we went to the last planning committee when the refusal was made highways said the access was okay
yes
as it is
as it is
i believe it is yes
because in fact with the road being on the bend cos actual UNK
it's on the other side of the bend
is seen but er
well they're expecting at least two cars
it it's right that this should be brought up anyway mr
i can confirm chairman that the district council of course consult the county council on access to all applications
yes good
and the county council didn't raise no objection
good
that may be so chairman but with these two four bedroom houses there could be another six to eight cars coming out of that entrance
mm
onto that bend
mm
i was there forty years right i've seen every accident on that bend i've had my house as a first aid post a dozen times until we did something in this committee to sort that corner out
yes
and now we get more traffic on it
well it
i don't agree with another half a dozen or eight cars coming out of that
well there won't be that many cars off two houses but i would also like to add
well you're having double garages included
yeah
there's al already one at UNK
not a in building
there's already one at UNK actually just let me finish and you can make your point
yeah go on
you're talking also about extending the car park at the pub just down the road so you're going to be increasing traffic into that pub
cars coming round that corner could hit a stationary vehicle
excuse me we're on another subject but i will put you in the clear
i can get you an appointment on that
i will put you in the clear on the car park at the pub it's was originally it's going back to as it originally was it was the car park and all they're doing now is UNK back to what it was ten years ago
er can i make a point
if the planning application as the gentleman in the rear says er went through with a cottage and a house he'd have exactly the same
it did
er traffic
no
no
what you haven't
not with two houses one cottage doesn't make the same amount
well
if
you're going instead of six cars you're going to have four or five
yes i mean we're well
i mean there's not going to be that much different
if they were smaller properties it is possible there would be some less traffic
it wouldn't be there the house and the garage would get a four bedroomed house anyway
i mean they're family houses aren't they
yes
so the point mr UNK making is there's two families in already
at the cottage
in the bungalow
yes
there's another house
if that one remained and then another house built alongside there would be still two houses
i don't see the what i'm saying
yes
is i don't see that the excess er access problem has a problem holding up with the highways authority as far as this UNK concerned
yes
i mean i
it is if you live in the village
i can see
sorry
it is if you live in the village
yes
i live in a village as well and i mean they i've got the same
well i excuse me i would ask you to come on that corner at five o'clock at night and at half past eight between half past eight and nine in the morning and see what speed they all come round alright
but er this is a highways erm matter
no it's alright it's alright to put these houses up and down
ca can i just do that then with yes excuse me kevin i think we UNK that one we can see there's there a lot will obviously be increased er traffic er from the site er and it it's clear that the bigger the houses the more likely there is we'd have increased traffic
now whether this is significant er obviously it's significant to people who live here er and who witness it erm er whether from a legal or highway point of view we aren't able to judge probably er does mr UNK or mr UNK wish to show them
yes i'd just like to emphasize the point of the last er refusal which i've got a copy here would be over bearing out of scale with the adjacent residential property detrimental to the amenity of adjacent occupiers and i see no i know we're not talking about an appeal at this stage we're talking about another application i personally see no change whatsoever to the circumstances in which the last application was refused these properties totally out of proportion and totally UNK and UNK for that entrance to the village
yes
er we have in the east end of the village including the pub the farm and various other properties a certain type of properties that elevation a certain sympathetic er amenity and these buildings i heard the word mentioned earlier i live in the country i could live in the town it doesn't matter where i live but these are not the sort of properties in my opinion that should be put on this particular site er and they're totally all our own UNK and plans of height and they are totally and utterly out of proportion and out of scale with the present day entrance to the village and whilst we're not talking totally and utterly about looks if you come down into the village they are going to be totally over UNK particularly in the in the actual in this situation of no hedges and that kind of thing
yes
and they'd be a UNK on the landscape to put it UNK
yes that's it yes
and what i concern myself with now is that this sort of thing is becoming too obvious in the area this kind of development this kind of an UNK in villages looking for somebody's got to make a stand against it er and i hope that we shall in this parish council
thank you yes
for the UNK totally out of keeping
can i make a comment on that and that the these houses are and oh ev er we have been into consultation with UNK sherwood district council since we er since the first application
yes
most of the changes that have been made to those houses have been er erm at the request of UNK sherwood district council they the they lifted the room pitch we had a lower one they wanted a higher one erm and you know erm all basically erm the although they counted it as a change since application
yeah
and we have done everything that everything they've requested
er i mean am i correct to
that's the request of the planning officers
yes
not the members
yes
because the members had not yet seen the site
i'm sorry the planning officer
yes the planning officer
perhaps that
make a statement mr chairman the planning officers last night would actually i believe approve the application
they recommended approval
unfortunately the planning committee in considering it turned it down
yes
and i'm sorry i have very little confidence in them and the opinion of the planning officers at newark district council
i believe it's a different planning officer dealing with this application than from the last one but er
well all right i haven't got tremendous amount of confidence in their opinions but that's all
but er i mean i believe er perhaps these gentlemen can put me right that in fact the UNK the present plans that have been put in are very similar to the original plans before they were amended er in consultation with the
er the first yes
with the officers
yes
erm and er i don't know who was responsible for this whether it was mr bradford or whether it was
it was
er and whether these were the original or were these the original ones mr bradford
i can't see chairman what drawing you're showing
that UNK provided it have you
it was off your drawing yes
and i've just UNK it then it's
er which of course does show the relative height of the new houses against
i want to make the fact that these are in fact the wrong way round
we know
yeah we know
well i'm just
you just need some of the worst
i'm just referring to the to the
if you think that's unreasonable now that single storey is there
yes
yes
move it that way
but you see this is what er i think er
it's too high
that people are UNK to it's the height
they're UNK to the height
you see
er i hate to argue
now if you go for something reasonable say a bungalow and a house you'd have no problems
is mr walker saying chairman that the district council planning officers are asking for this higher roof but
yes
chairman this is not unusual the planners approach is that traditionally erm buildings in this area have erm UNK roofs which require a steep pitch
mm
that can be seen from er the bungalow almost directly opposite and er it's almost a traditional requirement that they ask for steep pitches
mm
i accept that there is a mixture of houses at this end of the village
the whole point is chairman the planning officers both at the site inspection and when it was discussed er they were under no UNK that it was the height of the building which had been objected to actually
yes that's right yes
i mean that was made UNK clear by mr UNK who represented the parish council at the site meeting whe when er one of the senior planning officers was present so it's an absolute nonsense if they've gone and encouraged the developers to go for an even higher roof line
well i only have er comments
can i just mention that the reason why some of the older properties in this village has UNK pitched roofs is not because they're UNK now because originally they were erm UNK and the UNK needs a very steep pitch and particularly when there's a erm a UNK end higher than the UNK it's where there was a UNK roof originally but most of the older properties in this village are only one room wide so you can't get a very big roof on no matter how steep it is the proposed houses here are in fact virtually sort of two rooms wide aren't they so that means they are wide at the UNK i would personally have thought that erm they could have been pitched a bit less
er mr UNK do you want to say anything
i always have UNK
you know below the shadow of both the next two properties we shall we shall you know just have a brick wall and if they just shifted the garage to one end and as far as i'm concerned it's an excuse for them to put up the power that is
yes
you know the houses that have just got one wall and a little or a garage which is higher than just about as high as i think
yes
can i just
well of course they are behind the line of your house i mean but even so it's sort of erm
can i ask the applicants please is a if the location the actual UNK of the present houses is any further erm away from the road and the originally proposed
well have you got a copy of the plan then
yeah we have yes
if you
look at the plan a minute and i'll show you on the plan
i can't remember the original plan
where are they going to put the drains in
there's a sewer
where
in the road
what between the houses
i had the impression
a little bit
isn't that going to come out and join that one from UNK lane
oh no
from the plans that i've seen there's no change from what they originally planned
you're correct
you're actually right mr UNK
you know
you then have the terraced cottage on the site there
yes
you then have a hedge and there's a metre or a metre and a half that way then you've got the single trees
i mean i've stood on our bridge and looked down
yes
er this i should get
they'd be very UNK about it wouldn't they really
exactly we got used to them haven't we
it's the angle of the road isn't it
that's it
yes you do you look right at it
but surely the size of that house you've probably got people with at least two if not three cars probably
well it it's true isn't it
you've got a small UNK
and has that changed at all
that one's the same
that one's the same
yes
so it's this one that you've changed
yes
it's this one
thank you
erm er i'll close it at two but perhaps i could ask the applicants erm i mean i appreciate that obviously erm it er it economy in obviously in what you're doing but i think it would be fairly obviously to i mean it's been stated that residents nearby would prefer either two bungalows or a house and a bungalow and i think er that certainly erm new developments adjacent to where you are proposing these are in fact all bungalows er with the exception of the mill which of course has been there a long time er all those on that side of the road both those two built and those two proposed are a bungalow or a semi bungalow er and so erm you can see that obviously it is that the height of these buildings it is erm causing the offence largely erm i think i mean obviously you will want to main you know UNK your er development but whether er a scheme with two bungalows that they wouldn't be four bedroomed bungalows because there wouldn't be room for two of the four two four bedroomed bungalows erm
quite what i mean at the there's one following behind the site of the other
yes
that we've got i is that a four bedroomed detached house
no
the one that's planned
yes
it's a bungalow
that one
yes er it could be a four bedroomed bungalow i'm not sure i can't remember now
but that is right behind it the stream and
that is behind your plot yes
will not be in any way shape or form detrimental to
it is of course a lot lower
this is a
yes
it's a bungalow it's going to be UNK and it's going to be right at the back there's going to be no er
i'm er
problem at all
but whatever is put there is going to be a four bedroomed house in the garden of the of the cottage which is erm going to be very much the same as the plot one there anyway isn't it
i think basically what people are trying to say that two huge houses is UNK very UNK erm it would be a lot easier to accept one larger dwelling and the smaller property you know one
i can understand that yes
can you understand what i'm trying to get at
yes obviously yes
i mean mr chairman it may just say honestly i mean this is among ourselves from the commercial point of view there's no doubt about it i'm in the grocery trade the more you get on a lorry when you deliver you get every single
yes well i mean i think i think it's fairly clear that we can appreciate
but er this is obviously the answer for profit
yes
and i don't dispute that at all but we're not here i hope making planning decisions
yes
based upon a profit bottom line for grant development we're here looking at the planning application and all the implications
no i mean i know that is not exactly pertinent to the application that is er in erm i my personal view is that bungalows are practical we have had it stated by one resident that a house and a bungalow would be acceptable erm not that i am er anticipating any other planning develop er applications by these applicants but er would a house of a similar nature to one of these that they have proposed plus a bungalow er would we have as much opposition to this to that as the present ones or you would prefer to defer until you saw it
you're talking about a house on plot one and a bungalow or UNK bungalow on plot two
possibly yes i'm not too
chairman if i may add this add this to the outline application indicating that that's to the rear of the site the mayor
yes
site that deals with a lot of the concerns a lot of the criticisms that we have
yes
it's set far enough back from the road
yes
there is an opportunity of being able to screen it from the UNK direction
this development here as you approach from UNK if you look at the angle of the position on site will be clearly visible and it will create the impression that it is it is one single house because they are so close together they will stick out like a sore thumb
so mr bradford in fact if plot one was a house as proposed to us
but we are not talking terms of plot one and plot two we're simply saying
no but i mean in the ones that they have yes
that the original outline application retain the bungalow and built a house towards the rear of the site
i mean i think it's fairly clear unless somebody was a dedicated er
fix a roof on it could be made into a very attractive rural type property it it's typical of the kind of property which in a village we're dying for
we want small family properties
thank you mr
small starter homes for younger people
well that's what
but there we are we've got something of that nature and it's going to be demolished
yes
it's going to be UNK and we're going to end up with two
small starter homes they would like to put about four smaller starter homes on that site i suppose and then that
that's always a concern at the villages because i live in a town i live in a small town near here erm i've had a lot of dealings in villages and people who live in villages always want to have starter homes but as soon as you put an application in for starter homes there's even more opposition to it as happened down in UNK council threw that one out
you approved three four bedroomed houses behind here er wasn't any opposition then was anybody then saying
can i just
we should have starter homes on there
yes
can i just make a point here the parish council as a body of parish councils did not approve the
UNK idea
yes it did
not originally eric no
it was approved
well there wasn't six now going down to four
yeah we UNK the numbers down but
we were we were not in full agreement and happy with the development
i would think that distance
houses there was very much the same as it the distance between the houses here
i would think if you were felt the area of the houses on that side the area of the houses on the UNK side you would think that one's
yes but you're looking
relatively good
yes but the difference is that i've never seen those houses but i have i can see those
we're looking at extremes with a with a situation here
i thought you can't see them at all can you
you're not looking at it in the same way at all
at that one wrongly i shall come in from UNK you see and you wouldn't see the house this is on there's a twenty foot high hedge all the way along
yes but do you agree your houses are going to be somewhat above that
they're going to be
it's not as it's not as it's not as if they're right in that corner as you come in from er UNK a as mike said there's a twenty foot fe hedge there which is going to be kept
yes
i mean the drawings you showed derek of this proposed street thing which is the wrong way round isn't misleading because you won't see all that
no
might i ask you through the chair
originally you were going to retain some of the trees and build among the trees
well we will retain as many trees as we can
yeah but it's impossible to retain them with two four bedroomed houses now isn't it
you'll have to UNK the lot surely
well you see originally i mean that plan that one there doesn't which has let the bulk of the trees all round there and round this area there's a couple in the UNK as well
that does not happen if this one be put in
what you're going to get two four bedroomed houses and two double garages up and retain some trees in that bit
depending on what kind of yeah
well i find that totally impossible i mean i know that i've been in that plot thousand of times
the experience mr chairman i have of these situations is that trees happen to fall down and hedges happen to get pushed by UNK and at the end of the day because i've seen it in my own village where i was born i'm afraid with all respect to what happens what is actually passed by the planners doesn't actually come to pass because there is always a reason why it can't
so i think that what if they care were listening to UNK words about retaining trees and hedges because trees and hedges have a very clear habit of falling down by accident
yes
and we want to be very careful
the district council of course do have their policies on conservation matters er and er i accept your point er erm
can i just mention that time is getting on and the parish council still hasn't discussed this
yes it is yes
we have other subjects yes
this is not the discussion that we
no erm if there is no more comment from mr poole we don't wish to talk about this
no
so will that do
well i will resume if er in is a parish council we will deal with the orders of planning as they are on the agenda which is a car park and the UNK
would you like us to leave now
it's up to you if you wish to stay you can and if not you can leave
well thanks very much
yes thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
the UNK
mhm
okay
the UNK is to push the car park back half way across the grass er which is er am i correct in saying that it's putting it back where it was
or it's er
yes you are chair
yes
it used to be it used to be UNK
it goes behind
and they UNK it over for a children's pre playground now they want to turn it back and extend the car park
can i just say at this point that erm john will UNK had a word with the UNK and the landlord of the UNK with regards to this application and what the UNK told john was that she and her husband would UNK like to do away with the UNK block garage that is there that is totally out of character and extend the car park way back to the garages but the brewery are UNK that they do what is planned here and do away with some of the
grass yes
and the little trees and that
mm
which they would like to retain
they would UNK like to do away with the garage and i think the UNK said she would just like to mention that as their comment on the application
well down here we've got the UNK doesn't really want it to go through
well no i don't think she's saying that but what she's saying is their thoughts are ideally it would be better to UNK the
come up with
UNK block garage that is there
well if that's the parish council's view then the
see here
obvious thing
is grass
is to recommend refusal
is grass
yes
and then we would have to have another think
and here is grass
wouldn't we
so all this lot is converted it all just
you can't tell them what they're doing you can only determine the application you have before you
is the part behind UNK cottage do people go on that now or is that part of their garden
may i
have you seen this kevin
no
chairman am i am i eligible to make a comment from the floor
er the sort of way in which we're going to recover the
yeah
the figure
yeah
the way we're going to recover it first is on that
right but
so i want to i want to work out what's involved there i'll go at something like twenty per cent so it'll come out about twenty pound fifty something
right
like that
i'll go in at first i'll see how much that's gonna be which is about seven hundred pounds
yeah
and i'll work that into the five per cent and it may reduce the erm period of time to
five months say or four
yeah
months but i'll work it out
yeah
and i'll say to him right okay we'll give you the five per cent r reduction for only eight months of the year
yeah
yeah
but this bearing goes up to this price
and in UNK
yeah
in effect what you're doing is helping us out with the cost that we incurred in getting it and the help that we've done you
right
i've got the price of that product up and also get him his reduction after a period of time
right
yeah
when you're when you're talking about what it's cost us to get him those bearings
right
er the figure is well over a thousand pounds
right
this simple bit is the overtime
mm
the overtime that we worked is about thirty five hours at six pounds an hour
we had three additional UNK
mhm
er those were only the UNK o as a result of breaking something else down and putting this bearing on
yeah
it had nothing to do with s with the UNK involved in splitting the batch
right
okay
okay
so you've got there three a at erm
three
three seven an yeah seven and a half hours
two and a half hours for setup at twenty eight pounds an hour
mm
right so you've got a you've got another hundred and fifty quid there or so
mm
at least
a hundred innit yeah
so then you've got the thing that is not measured which we can't measure is the UNK the cost of the disruption to all the other customers
who who's UNK have been put back
mm
as a result
yeah
and now that is UNK
mm
but it costs
yeah mm
and so erm and if you double the figure that you've got there
mm
you may be getting somewhere near
mm
yeah okay
so
twelve hundred quid
so a thousand twelve hundred quid is the sort of is the sort of minimum figure you
yeah
should be talking about
right
er and when he says well h how the hell do you make that up
well i'll give you the easy bit
that's manufacturing he's not daft
he'll know
yeah
it's gonna cost something like that
yeah
so yeah fine
erm and
yeah i just want to get the emphasis back onto that one first and the products we accepted it and we've got to live with it at some point in time but the longer i can put that off the better
but the majority of the advantage i make i want to be put into the
i would yes i would suggest that when you when you do this five per cent thing erm make your make your
even if it's three per cent
make your price adjustment
make your price adjustment soon
mm
make it now
mm
and say well we'll hold that for five months but then we'll go back to the
yeah
yeah we'll restrict it instead of going into the full year
instead of to the higher price for the end of the year we'll
well instead of doing it
might say well just do it the end of the year
i'll see what i can get from him yeah
right
yeah alright
and er we've then contributed to his cost down
mhm
because over all his situation will be better
yeah
and er we'll have given it him i mean on his on his total cost he'll be down
yeah
right
and we'll have given him a clue for how to budget for next year as well
the e r c one er for this extra UNK that is separate i've got to do that as export so leave that with me
okay that is out
right
that is out the equation it's er one thing i've got to UNK with graham on
right
that will be
i won't get an instant reaction
well i will but it maybe not that er
this is erm the UNK cage
UNK balls
right this is a new thing for experimental work that we're doing for them is it
er well it's not a new thing we've be we've been making UNK ball bearings for a while
yeah
we've have a e r c for about six months now
er we've come to the end of some of the trials
they want to run one up to see what the maximum speed is well of course that's gonna destroy it
yeah
so but they want to do cooking trials as well actual cooking trials
they UNK
yes
at UNK in the new development shop
yeah
so what we've got is another set put through
now you're talking about five hundred quid for the set of three bearings
so i'm saying to graham come on we're helping you are helping us obviously i'm not gonna deny the fact you're helping us with our research
yeah
yeah
but er you know
we've gotta have a sensible price with them
gotta be reasonable with it
so i need some help on that
we're giving him wh if he gives me three or four hundred quid
you've given him one set already have you
or we've used one set at e r c
well and we've used it for well answer is yes but i'm you know it's making sure you get the business
you know come on
if we're gonna be partners it's gotta be equal not er
yeah
so anyway yeah i i've gotta do that with graham
er right okay no problem with that
right steve has offered two per cent whereas before nothing
yeah er last year the budget was thirty k at thirty seven per cent and we actually did forty k at thirty seven per cent
and there is another five and a half k to come in from now that's closed
so there's a bit more business
right
drifting in
so we've got potentially forty five
with that being such a low figure this year tends to be quite UNK
yeah
you know one year's quite low thirty five forty thousand next year sixty five
yeah you tend to get that
yeah
spread
so next year i think is potentially hoping that it's gonna come
whether the recession knocks it back a bit i don't know
but er there is potential for fifty k plus at reasonable margins seven per cent
so you know he's offered two per cent and they're not giving it out to many people
the only reason he's giving it to us is cos he's thinks that we didn't have an increase last year
he's forgotten that we did but i'm not gonna tell him that
er
if w if we did get an
right well
increase last year
actually
well i think
if he knew that he'd turn round and say get lost
i think i think what you what you need to do is to push him
right
if h er how much UNK er what what's the situation at the moment you said three per cent have you
you're gonna go in at th you went for four
i went for four
i went for four he said he said UNK
so i said well come on you've gotta be reasonable with me so i spoke to him last week and he says look you didn't have one last year so i'll give you two
and he says it's more than i've given the others because they did have an increase
he'd forgotten that we did have an increase
the only problem is
well
precision market at the minute is are playing silly buggers
have given me a bit of grief because the they're on a very similar price level now to us
mhm
because they're being supported by
but are coming in they're quoting three or four per cent underneath
er at they're ten per cent underneath and historically a couple of years ago you're talking two or three times the price their prices at one period probably about the mid to late eighties doubled and UNK in price
who's marketing
it's er their part of aren't they
that's what i was thinking
yeah
but their prices now
are they being are they being UNK by
no it's who've called in to yeah andy
he's e he's now you know
so i've got a
well
problem with them
er in so much as i mean i must admit with these increases i appreciate your need to get the extra profits and i'm looking at the ones where i think we can push them to get a bit more
but there are others where you know i'm e i'm very reluctant to get involved
i mean
right
for example
well
we budgeted twenty k at sixty two per cent margin we're actually eighteen at sixty five per cent margin
now you can't screw people like that
no
and let's just let's just go
and they have really
back to
yeah
er how many part numbers do we sell to
sorry
how many part numbers do we sell to
er about twelve
plus standard bearings as well on top of that
right
erm can you push him up on the standard bearings
very doubtful
er the group will buy european rubbish if they have to
right
erm can we can you as part of the discussion can you start off by saying well thank you very much for the call that you gave me last week but erm there's just a couple of sizes i'd like to talk to you about
mhm
what try and get it back on some
and try and squeeze a few back a bit further
yes
okay
yeah
aha
yeah
i'll have a look
see
i'll have a product
the problem is i can't say that at the minute cos i haven't got my print done
i'm having a yearly detailed print done of last year
yeah
john was just running it for me now so i'll pick it up on the way home tonight
you see but i've had to have this run
right
for other reasons i e the industrial stock
yeah
put the onus back on me now to say what of that stock we want to keep before they throw it away
right
yeah
so i've had to have this print run of detailed customer parts by quantity for ninety three
right
yeah unfortunately i've not been able to have it done yet
other people have been jumping in and getting print left right and centre
right but that's coming tonight that
that's coming to then i can start to look in more detail
right well i mean i think that that's the way to that's the way to try and squeeze yeah
try and get a few on others take on
well yes what you've got to try and do is to divide and rule
get the overall number up
yeah
yeah
get the overall number up by erm by er focusing
on a few
okay
and i mean obviously to begin with you don't give away on anything
no
erm and er that's the way er tom
okay thank you
UNK ne UNK
exactly yeah
right so you're gonna try and divide him and rule him
right
just
i've just had a quick word with UNK this is another thing that's come up
on the industrial side i mentioned to steve last year at the end of last year saying look it's coming up to
then i'd be looking after you for both products and what i want to do is have a look at all the standard bearings you take to see if there is potential for a supply
yeah
what he's done is UNK an order through for a six three o eight
yeah
at like half price less than erm a six three o seven that we supply already because it's the price
so i knew this would come up but i didn't realize he'd be jumping onto the UNK that quick
so that the six three o eight was a product that had supplied
had supplied yeah at about four pound eighty i think the price is
yeah well of course
the six three o seven we supply at about nine pounds
so i've got a problem
so why did he come to why did he come to for the six three o seven
because it was one that we were doing with in conjunction with an e p three bearing
special b j seven thousand
or e x p
what and they were matched in some way
well no we had a matched pair of a pair of precision e p bearings UNK at the front
i mean they use a pair of UNK
right
together
right
erm and because they like to keep the same manufacturer on one shaft if they could they took out six three o seven for the back end
well of course part of
ask for an e p three supply it
part of part of the erm part of that issue says that of course all the prices that he's got
tho they've all gone up eight per cent
because prices have gone up eight per cent across the board
right
so the price as was before
doesn't exist it's
is no longer valid
right
now erm we will have to look at the situation with regard to the er all the other ones and we'll do an analysis what are the volumes and so on and what other what other popular UNK bearings
we've got an opportunity to right
are you buying from anybody else because can we do a deal on the whole lot
right that's what i was trying to get
yeah
erm
you see i've got the UNK i mean my initial reaction is i mean i i've got no strong feeling to say we've got to supply product the stuff it's cheaper we make more money sod it
erm
well of course even the product is product
no yeah when it is our product it's a d five if it's d six if it's
but erm i don't care which is what it is
no
to be honest
no
erm but er i have the problem with trying to balance up which way to go
i mean obviously i'd like to sell it all at price levels but there's get away with that
of course you w of course you would of course you would and it may be that what you will have to say is well look erm i gave you the four per cent on the on the precision types and that really has to stay but by the time we by the time we've done all the analysis on the er on the popular UNK it will work out that it is only two per cent
right okay
because of because of the because of the erm er ups and downs that's all
so i
yeah
leave that with me i'll get in contact with steve and i'll try and get this list sorted
where you can be a bit where you think you've got a technical issue to sell
mm
which is on the precision ones
yeah
erm even if it's slightly over UNK
mm
try and push it
yeah okay
where you know that he can go out to the market for a popular UNK bearing and slaughter the old price
yeah
then you've got you've got to beware
yeah sure
but don't give it away for nothing
mm
the thing the thing that you've got to avoid is getting into a situation where you've where you say to him oh well okay
two per cent and then he comes back to you and says but what about this six three o eight
mm
and what about the six three
yeah
o seven come on fellas the six three o UNK gotta be cheaper than the six three o eight
yeah
erm and you get yourself into a into a hole
mm
so i think you've got to open it up by UNK the two bits of business the bit that's special
yeah
and that's going four per cent
the bit which of course basically going eight per cent
right
but if you end up with all the popular UNK business at somewhere around the sort of equivalent price level margin level that you've got that business at
mhm
then you stand a chance in being able to show him nothing more than two per cent
right
do you see what i'm getting at
yeah i know that
but you've actually got you've UNK him there in such a way that he might be prepared to accept that
yeah fine okay
right so i'll get in contact with him and we'll sort that then
erm is one they've been in a very similar position to in so much as UNK forced them to cost down dramatically i mean
yeah
you're talking a third more
they get all they get promised orders right up until a month before switch on time and then it goes
and they really do have problems with getting customers to promise an order for up the line and keep it
yeah
competition turn UNK gonna chop another ten per cent off
erm and the fact that we're making over sixty per cent margin i is good business for us in such okay it's only twenty k but potentially longer term when the recovery comes they're gonna be
UNK bearings
yeah
only UNK bearings
er no it's for er screw support bearings and UNK bearings
there are some s f t twenties and stuff like that as well but those don't show in these figures you see
i've gotta look at them separately cos i haven't got the industrial yet
erm right
so
but basically we s we screw 'em
and we've got you know that is actually a lot lower than it used to be because we they actually caught us charging them three hundred and fifty quid for a bearing that we're now charging them two hundred and fifty quid for
so you can imagine what margin that used to be
i mean we're talking eighty per cent
yeah you start to feel a little uncomfortable
especially knowing what are always in there UNK always on the door cos he lives in UNK
yeah he lives round the corner
yeah he's well in there but not got the business by er trading off
but it's a good technical business to have for other people as well to know about
we deal with we deal with names they're all names to be connected with
yeah what have you said to at the moment
er all i've said is yes i understand your position i'll go away and talk to tom about it
r right have you have you given him a figure have you put a figure on the table at all
no i said four from the letter and it's been left at that
it's four from the letter
it's four from the letter i haven't reduced anything yet
so he he's got four
all he's said is nothing
right
i must admit i'm in that
right
one particularly with the margins on i'm reluctant to
what's his payment terms
thirty days normal
thirty days yeah
right
erm is there anything else that you might be able to get out of him if you concede
not really
erm
is there any other business that
not really no
what do you do where does he get his UNK from
UNK
er we can't compete
can't touch them
never
can we not
no our buying UNK higher than 's selling price sometimes
very difficult
right
have their quality problems that's where you can score over but the prices are very low and tend to pick them up
i quoted for a rolled screw once yeah and my buying price from i'm talking about a year and half ago was higher than 's quoted price for a ground bore screw
it was just so
yeah
mm
have a problem all of their own and i don't intend to drag that into it
i'm happier to stand away and 's going in on friday
mhm
i'm happier to stand back and let him do his bit and i'll do my bit as long as we're talking to each other
yeah as long as we know what the UNK doing
yeah
yeah
but they're prepared to let it stand as the prices are at the moment cos they're under pressure
ah
with their own problems this supply and what have you
ah
apparently if click on one particular size that they can get it from that could wipe out 's business cos as soon as they click one size then UNK be in and wipe the floor with them
that's the impression i'm getting and they're and they're tending to back off
not to invite the er the monitoring in effect the comparison
now with and me it's a different ball game
well
we have this split oh okay
first what do you think i'll do the in a minute that's on the list so
well i think i th i think you may find yourself having to er give way
mm
there
erm you've got to put up a show
oh yeah
and again er if you can
if i get something on one of them to s to look as though i've
right
fought for it
yes
yeah and i have to walk away from the others
yeah and i mean you can you you've got
to use the negotiating technique of come on fella you know i'm gonna get i'm gonna get UNK over if i don't
oh yeah don't worry i do
come away with something
i've already told him i'm gonna get my UNK kicked cos i haven't for eight you see
that's my
yes
there's my strong point straight away
yes
get a bit of sympathy cos i've been asked for eight by you
that's right
and i've already put a letter out saying four so i've had me UNK kicked already
yeah
yeah
yeah
so i'm on the defensive so he's you know he's
right so erm i if you can end up with two or if you can end up with i mean it may be more helpful for him if he gets if he gets a no increase on one size and an increase on the other
and actually
out if him on a UNK size i will do but
yeah
with it being a higher margin i'm very UNK to er rock the cart
what's he doing in the way of development
er chris they don't they tend to i think it's like a lot of people in the u k i mean you've got in the machine tools side but like on the on the side they use UNK
so they run on the oil you know like our h c f machines do on the shop floor
erm but they're in a position on a lot of the things like they use our precision p n p two bearings in their UNK
yeah
you know and things like that and bearings well the p three as we call then support bearings
so you know th they're using the most accurate bearing they can for what they use it for
er on the UNK side you know it's gonna stay the way of the UNK cos of the UNK ab capabilities of it so there's not it's not an area where
new machines coming along
new ideas
they tend to be variations on a theme
UNK they're not gonna change a lot
UNK wheel UNK things like that
right
so get the opportunity for
tom thank you
hello UNK
right yes
aha
right
right that figures
that figures
right
okay yeah
erm we'll be erm er we'll be we'll be going for ten
and i'll er i'll let you know if anything else if anything else comes out of that
okay and that sh we should have in the next day or two
good thanks a lot UNK
bye
so erm yes with er erm er you need to encourage them to er think development
the problem is with that the way they developed has gone towards the UNK
yes
the problem with development on their machines is i can see it going away from normal bearings
right to
so in a way they're looking at the levels we're at now is an accurate level using a high price item
i'd be UNK to push them any f UNK them into a position where they say well you know could we use for the UNK
you know what i mean
well yeah but yeah but there's erm th there's a pay off between cost and accuracy and that's the thing isn't there
erm what a erm have they have they thought about how they're going to get the costs down within their machines
mm
and if so what are they you know what are they doing about it
right
could we could we set up a conversation on that on that subject because we might
yeah
we might be able to help we might be able to generate some ideas between us
yeah
which will help them
okay yeah
you know so that's something that you can give
yeah as a service part of the relationship yeah
erm as a part of the service
erm to emphasize the fact that erm in principle we are we are committed to providing our customers with a service that enables them to be more competitive
but we've got to get them to understand that doesn't mean to say that our prices will always be the lowest
mm
it means to say that if we have the right relationship between us and our customers we get in a design stage
yeah
and we can help them with our bearing experience
mm
engineering bearing experience we can help them choose a bearing which will enable them to be more competitive
mm yeah okay yeah
so i mean that's the sort of atmosphere that we we've got to try and
yeah i know
try and generate
yeah i mean i'm not being cynical but that's very easy to say
it is
anyway
it's easier it's a great deal easier to say than to do
but what you're trying to create in the guy is a bit of a warm feeling
yeah
loyalty is a good thing
and erm
but it only goes so far
yeah er there is a
there is a there is a world of difference between saying those words and giving your opposite number a w a warm feeling
mm
and actually doing anything achieving anything
mm
but i mean one of the things that we've got on with at the moment is that we've been saying for ages you've got to get your you've got to get us involved at design stage
mm
and they've done absolutely bugger all about it
so what have they done
they've designed in a bearing which is UNK expensive
mhm
and if they'd started thinking about it at design stage we could have suggested them another bearing that would do the job and be a lot cheaper
mhm
so but they they've missed it it's too late
yeah
that's the that's the problem
once you've actually designed the piece
mm
you can't go back
tom oh hello arthur good afternoon to you
yes
yes
yes
i signed three times
i'll get him to re UNK it to you
i expect it probably got erm er stuck in the machine or something
yeah okay arthur
see you tomorrow
bye
kim
she's not here
er c carol could you could you organize page two of UNK three page fax
three page fax
yeah he he's sent back er three pages of a fax that he'd received
and it looks as though it's picked up the middle page
okay to where
to UNK
to UNK
air about UNK
about UNK okay
there's one page missing
right okay
right okay
she'd offered two straight away so i'm gonna try and get some more out of her
i take it that is a special bearing i know she's had people look at it i'm gonna try and UNK out how far she's got down that line as to having another source but i don't think she has
the price we sell that at is quite low
really
yeah
but we have budgeted it for eighty five k at thirty six per cent and we achieved a hundred and three at thirty eight
right so er you certainly don't want to be giving in at two per cent unless the volume we're UNK gonna be higher again this year
right she's just put another o order on for about erm a big order
so she says they usually put schedules on for fourteen month for the next ten months twelve months
yeah
so the UNK on so i've got to try and argue the UNK with her
right
erm we budgeted at fifteen k at forty three per cent we did twenty two but only at thirty six per cent cos the product mix changed
yeah
yeah
they sold off their small tools division where we sold some bearings to them
which we made good margins on
that's the w d s small parts now
standard parts
yeah
size
six three o six three o two er fours
erm i've had a word with kevin and he does recognize the fact that we've got to get something
but he this was a week and a half ago and he said give me a couple of weeks i want to have a look at the figures and the mix and have a think about it and i'll come back to you
but he does want to get something sorted before the end of january
so i'll see what he's got to say
right see what he's gonna say erm
that is one where we
er there's not a great value in sales as i say twenty two k but then again how values how valuable is valuable
i don't you know
to me twenty two k
twenty two k twenty two k's worth having
at thirty six per cent margin
certainly
yeah
so you know i mean that's the er so i'll see what kevin comes back to me with first
mm
where are we at with
pain in the UNK
i spoke to today when i was over there just after lunch
he's as confused as i am are an account that you can ne we're never bottom of we used to have a very good relationship through a guy called ray
mhm i knew him
the problem is
liked his golf
right the problem is it was er like a guy called er norman at
they got so close to him and knew him so well that nothing else UNK
when he actually retired it left er
a complete hole
yeah i mean and UNK
and we had the wrong contacts with the wrong people
yeah
at the wrong time
and i said to peter
guess who picked up the account just after that
i said i said to peter and david back in nineteen ninety one i said we've got a big problem
oh don't worry about it UNK see us right
and bloody hell six months later ray UNK and we are left
in nineteen ninety two
right but
yeah
clearly we i mean we're just not
we had a very bad time with ken the buyer at first
yeah
at one point he said david was joking too much and i was too UNK
yeah he did have a good go at us through UNK
erm but it wo oh it was j he's such a UNK
honest i mean everybody we talk to who knows him yeah he really is erm the UNK a bit of skirt he's well in
apparently
the UNK pauline i can't make her out she seems to be fairly u straight organized but it had got to the situation where i mean i didn't like it but it happened we were supplying six months of product and then was supplying six months
mm
there were two sizes seven o two o and seven o one o which is used on the
a pair each end
that we were a joint suppliers of
with the seven two o five bearings on the ball screw the lead screw which were the seven stroke UNK that we used to supply single source that's where the big bulk of our business came from and er a standard e p seven at the other end
a pair of seven two o fives
mm
which was joint source
fortunately one of the good points about losing the seven stroke nine business is that pauline transferred some of the stock of that seven stroke nine bearing on to the other end
cos they were replacing it with a UNK they're transferred that stock onto the other end product number
and it's carried over our list so we've actually picked up the seven two o five now as single source
which is okay that's a nice bit about it
the problem is we're still j joint source on the other two
and that's i had a quick er look through last year's sales and laid out in fact i went through item deliveries and worked them into the months
mm
to get to see when we dropped off
and you could see all ours coming up to about erm may time bang then the gap
obviously when was supplying
and it went to seven months because they did have a UNK in the business so it pushed the quantities back a bit
yeah
erm so it went to seven months and then you could see us switch back on time and we switched back on in about november
so i thought oh that's great we've got the business through till april
pauline rings up last week sent me a fax er with the schedule on and there was the seven o one os were missing off it so i rang up and said you know we've not got any schedule on these two bearings pauline
oh i've just sent the fax to for a hundred pairs
i said well i thought we were supplying now it was our turn to have the half year
oh dear i'm sorry i'll give you the other hundred from for february
well thanks pauline but you've cost me how nay thousand pounds worth of business
and to be honest they i i'm whether they're UNK us along or not i don't know
exactly the same position on
he can't make them out he doesn't know how to handle them
and i must admit with ken is least to blame because he just puts the orders on pauline is the one who schedules it but the UNK is just the UNK
and trying to tie pauline down
and how often does the schedule happen
it comes out every fortnight
i mean we might have an order three hundred but if they don't need any it just shows zero so we're stuck
the problem is
mm
i always said to them i would much prefer to supply fifty per cent of the monthly usage spread it out throughout the year
have half the business with every month
so if they get twenty pairs we get twenty pairs
if they get ten we get ten
every month
yeah
because the six month period that you get which is reflected is coming th through now
yeah
lose contact with really where you are with them
suddenly they come on cos they don't give as much notice they're a pain in the bum
yeah
we try and keep a bit of stock up front so we don't UNK them you know so we've got something to react with
yeah
but it catches us with our UNK down and they go back to and blame us for it
but
certainly
you lose your control over the schedule
by the time it comes for us to switch it on they could say right we want twenty pairs a month at this size don't know what they're using
because it's been that long keeping an eye on them that they could be supplying half the business on our time with and then a hundred per cent the rest of the time
mm
and it's difficult to t tr track it
can you can you try and er erm make some er plea for erm factory stab on the basis of factory stability
i have done
but that erm that we'd actually like so many per month and that enables us to plan the factory
yeah i did it with pauline she actually didn't mind doing it at one point before christmas but it hasn't come about and as she said won't change it won't happen
i think we're stuck with it now
this half year supply business which i don't like at all
and the fact that are four per cent cheaper than us and as soon as i mention and increase he says well if it's dual source we've been told to look at the cheapest source of supply as single source
and then you told me well are saying eight per cent
something like that
er i think i think probably they they're going up a little bit later so
right
so basically what will happen is that they put this order on because they're cheaper at the moment and the next one we shall be cheaper
we'll be if we get our four per cent
if we get our four per cent and they get eight per cent
mm
but
then er then we'll be on a par
do you know that UNK put it up that much
yes
sure
well not are they asking for it but have they got it
because my one fear is saying yes we need four per cent thinking that are gonna go for eight ten or whatever to put us on a par
well
and go in for five
well if
and they're still under us and then they don't create the problem
oh no but if the situation is such that er you what you say is that is the s the six months has now started has it
no not yet officially
not yet
but what she did she sent the fax to them and ordered a hundred pairs
it was only when i rang her up to chase up what had happened to the she says oh dear i've sent it to the wrong one
i can't say you stupid cow
yeah you know you think i put the phone down
but a hundred pairs for how long
h
that's a couple of well actually what it is the there was a hundred ninety and er then we had er she says but i want the hundred off you in february which was this was at the just bef just after christmas
so you're talking a month yeah but you see they may take a hundred in one go and then leave it a month or so
yeah
yeah or two months
i it they're the drop they're take it in isn't the exact requirement
well if
schedule goes like this anyway
if you if you need to do something about it then er in order to secure that order for a hundred then sell them at the old price
mm
oh i've don that that's alright i mean she's given us
yeah
and
the order for them now we've got the fax
oh we have got it
oh yeah got the fax we've got
right
i wasn't
oh right okay
the problem i've got is er i know what i want to do and you told me what are doing so from that i have a good picture of what how i should approach it
but that is everybody being fair
yeah if now but th if i've understood you correctly there's going to be a few months when we don't actually supply anything
we should be getting at least to march all supplied from us now for the next three or four months it should all be from us
right
but what's gonna happen is these little mistakes are happening and are picking it up
oh dear sorry made a mistake yes
mm
er
mm
how do i cope with that
but
you can't the most difficult situation in our job is coping with an incompetent buyer or UNK
i don't think it's incompetent
that's the problem
well
if she was i could accept it
but she isn't
that's why i'm more suspicious than annoyed
you see what i mean
and happening to know that the r the UNK a bit of skirt that ken loves
mm
yeah i'm i don't know how to and i'm not gonna go and say come on ken
you know you have to draw the line at how far you can go but i'm f i'm worried about this account definitely
because i can't i honestly have got a i don't know what's happening
and unfortunately unless can guarantee i mean what i would like to know is what they're gonna charge the what they're charging them now and what they're gonna charge them
so we can suit our prices to get
because if you think about it this is a w this is a danger we may suffer without actually being able to get up
yeah
mm
i'm not saying they would but what i'm saying is if say we're four per cent behind and ken won't give me the exact price
yeah
it's three four five UNK per cent yeah and that isn't gonna be on e the same on every product so
yeah
but say it's four per cent on every size and i want four yeah so i put me four that's eight per cent above a bit above
yeah
and go for eight fine and now i'm on a level playing field
yeah
but is he fifty p in front of me or fifty p behind cos then ken turns
right
round and says right cos you've both had an increase i'm gonna go for the cheapest one
and we've blown it
that is that is always a danger
yes
erm and erm er yes that is
that is a danger what we have to try and remember although it's no great comfort to you is that overall the prize is tremendous
mm
in er i mean even if get their prices up eight per cent and are still under us
mm they've done
then
brilliantly haven't they
you know well they've done brilliantly but the market we've b between us we've got a good for the market
entire market price even though it cost us the business at this point in time
right
and there's always the chance of getting it back at a later stage er but the whole market will have moved up a level
yeah but i don't want to lose seventy UNK worth of business
no now what are the what are the items that are still being bought as precision items
there's er three sizes now that we're down to the seven o one o the seven o two o which are the UNK bearings and then the seven two o five which is the lead screw bearing
seven two o five
yeah
and they're all p
and
p fours
they're all p fours with
yeah
what sort of things i mean they're UNK
they're pairs
they're pairs
yeah
they're pairs of p five
p s p four
p four
yeah e p seven this was
standard normal precision
the seven stroke nine which is what we call a p three yeah it's not but
yeah
we've settled on p three erm the seven two o five one is the one that's been designed out
this seven two o five that's i've written down here
yeah that's a p four
that's one end of the lead screw
right so these ones all stay
yeah they're the present sizes now we're talking about
right
and what prices have we got on those
hang on
i'll go and get the price is you want it
yeah get the get me the prices on those will you
you need an extra pair of hands
these are what i've got on the disks you see
the pricing of it
if i can find it
the seven two o fives twenty six pounds
