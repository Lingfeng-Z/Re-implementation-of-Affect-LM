that's pair as well is it
that's pair yeah
twenty
twenty six
twenty six yeah
the seven o two os are a hundred and nine
yeah
the seven o one os are twenty nine pounds thirty
UNK
that's it
so that seems to be an extraordinary lack of difference between a seven two o five and seven o one o
mm
a mere three pounds
three pound thirty
just historically how the prices have been
yeah
right these are ninety three prices are they
they are ninety three prices yeah
and er at the moment you've asked for four per cent
yeah
from january
yeah
right
i'll get some more information about that
okay
i mean i'm aware of the thing that's what makes me ask you more about that account but i am worried about it and actually in a way are in a very good position
because they can be seen to be playing ball and yet benefit
you know what i mean
mm
so that's what worries me
and you reckon we're four per cent you're about four per cent below
it's about four per cent on each of the prices
but i mean you know obviously UNK not gonna tell me exactly what
if we knew what price were at then it would give me more er confidence to know where we stand and how to go about it
i mean i don't know what the standing is with our knowledge of information but i would like to think that if there is er erm not a hidden agenda but agreement being made at a level that we could share the business
mm
but what i want to do at my present moment is maintain my share of the business
right
i'm not interested in taking it off anybody
no
no that's that is our objective is to maintain the share of business at a higher price level
and erm
i mean even at the risk of probably er the other suppliers making a bit more than us if it means that
it'll be interesting if we could find out erm actually what prices are because if he's a good he would have said exactly the same thing to
oh yeah
mm
and he will have told that erm the prices are four per cent below yours dear boy
but we've always known that they have been below
yeah you've always been told you've always been told that they are
we've always kept the business UNK ray was the buyer
yeah
yeah
and yes i agree he was a good contact to have but he ain't here any more
yes
and it was UNK
and also
and it i mean it doesn't help saying i told you so but i did
unfortunately
tell peter so
yeah well he's gone so don't worry about that
er and erm yeah he's gone too so
why worry about it
erm what er what are our contacts like at a technical level at
okay
how often do we get a technical visit in there
er well it's actually at the technical side is i i've seen before christmas
about the new UNK machine that er we haven't got a er opportunity for business on anywhere
i've tried and they're not interested
what s what sort of bearing was it
it's a small UNK nine UNK and UNK thirteen UNK one
er a single one and a UNK on as a pair a matched pair
and i sent off details with the
a UNK a straight a straight UNK
one straight bearing
yeah
one plain bearing and one UNK bearing
as a pair
what erm
it's reference
sent it all to UNK with all the details broke all the reference
what volumes
two thousand a year
how
two thousand on one and a thousand on the other
has he re UNK on japan
no
can i
yes of course you can
of course cos if
particularly pointed out the UNK bearing and said you know that does the UNK bearings don't you
i said no i didn't
he said they do
they do UNK bearings and it is possible therefore that
mm
somebody somewhere will know
so what i suggest you do is to give erm jerry a ring
yeah okay
cos they won't need to be to p four limits
well give jerry a ring and see if there's anything to offer yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
fine yeah
yeah
so yeah okay i will do yeah
i'll send
ask for his comments i'll use k john cos he's the machine tool man
so i'll use him as my contact
it's best to keep
yeah okay
oh and i've spoken to tony meeting
i'm arranging to go and see him it'll be into next month now when
right
i've had me
good
time off and yeah
yeah
right okay
so could you do something on that worries me
i will see what i can find out
yeah i'm
i'm stuck to be honest
i quoted forty per cent on those screw support sizes last friday
yeah
i UNK him over on his on saturday morning
so we'll see what happens
erm but er what i've just put here is forty per cent margin until price is sorted
we need to
okay
do this visit with roy and get this price list sorted
waiting his reply
right okay
er
you might you might er
cos i did have a word with steve on friday and said have you seen jerry and has he mentioned this
yeah
and steve said no i hadn't heard of it actually
i said well look we intend to fax through to roy saying yes we want to do business with you
yeah
yeah
and erm you know we're waiting for him to come back and say yeah we need to talk
jerry so he said he hadn't seen but he's not necessarily going to
do you do you have direct contract with jerry
mm
why don't you give him a ring
yeah fair enough
and say erm
yeah
you know i'm just off likely to be off for next week and like to get
right
something fixed before i go
yeah okay
right and then he probably ring roy and yeah
you know use that as an excuse
yeah
fine okay
right okay i think that's it then er okay
right
so one's really the one where i need to involve you
basically i if you can
yeah
the rest i'll let you know
i hear
erm i i'm also i also quite
ooh
would like to know what's going on with and
whether actually has any er control over what 's doing in the marketplace
okay yeah
i know it was andy last time and he's a guy so yeah i'll find out
well you find out i might be able to find out to
well yeah okay
erm that was a point i er UNK bearings and i want to take the business off 'em
now with it being we're not gonna look at a high margin straight away cos i know that's a waste of time
er but we can make a reasonable margin including UNK
it's a set of three bearings with a pair of UNK
so you have two bearings in UNK a pair of UNK and a third bearing
and it's their normal machine centre range
they use like about forty pairs a month
yeah
erm sell for about eighty seven pound including UNK so i was gonna go in at about eighty three eighty four but it's the new pricing company so i've got to ask your permission haven't i
it's a new product i'm gonna make reasonable it's about thirty five per cent margin
it's a new product
no it's a new size for us to supply
we've never b
well
historically with what's happened is the design from japan was taken under licence
yeah
and they were based around and designs
yeah
now on the five fifty series for example it's an complete UNK on the twelve thousand UNK yeah
and we get you know so anthony would get that business
because complete UNK come under the precision range of products
yeah
this is something i was trying to get clarified but i don't care really as long as somebody gets it
erm but what happened then is er tended to get the main bearing supply for the normal UNK that manufactured and built
mm
and that was a set of three UNK contact ball bearings and then a n thirty double row roller at the rear
er we're now doing this partnership which was what today was about the new generation UNK
yeah
erm so that's going great i think that's really going well so the new design i think we're well in on
erm the old on that you know took me two years to get the bearings approved and er you know but then having to wait a year and a half cos had a year and a UNK worth of orders on 'em and promised to hold the price for three years is that's what it took for them to use them up er has run out new orders have been put on but i've got the chance of taking the business
er but erm obviously with the thing again i wanted er obviously
what was the
you don't to go to 'em for and they say well you just took the bloody off me i want a cut in me
yeah
this is this is
you know i don't want to be seen to be
this is clearly er erm a situation where erm we must not UNK take business which we have not enjoyed before at a price below
no at a price below the existing suppliers ninety four prices
now when erm you say are supplying at the moment
mhm
yeah
the problem is dave the buyer at is worse than ken
he's a real UNK
yeah
w his last comment
wh what happened is richard was the team section leader dave historically looks after the bearings sales
but he's such a UNK i'm taking him off it
and they're letting him keep linear
cos linear is just consignment stock and you know job there
sally the UNK who's taken over the buying for precision bearings is a great UNK got on great with her and richard
and they want to come and see the factory they want to go to yeah it fell down cos richard was too busy at the end of last year fine get that sorted and i sally was dropped in the crap by right at the end of last year came on five sets of bearings i could've done 'em in two weeks
i said i'll get you in two weeks UNK it's alright to do it they have 'em back in a month
we're alright you know they only way you'll get the business he's like that he talks like that is if you can you know offer a big price saving
that i'm afraid that's one thing you can't do
alright
even if it means that this year yeah
er
from my own point of view i want the business but bearing in mind what's happening i'm asking you before i do anything
erm i
should i let the dust settle first
yes
so i'll leave it
e you either leave it or
if i quote three or four quid underneath he'll consider it and we may get an order in a few months time when the schedule runs out
do you want me just to leave it
i think what you could sensibly say to them is look i gather you've had supply problems with
yeah
yeah
cos i was there when it happened
and s n a look you won't have supply problems with us
mhm
and you could say look what we've done with
yeah
competitors of yours
yeah
competitors of yours wanted bearings in a week we got 'em bearings in a
the problem the problem is that's happened with the design people
yeah
yeah
i have been given roy the UNK the engineering the senior UNK dennis er UNK who's our
mm
he was a development manager i've been giving 'em UNK for the last year and a half saying you are falling behind man
we're up and running with we've got the test rig going new UNK bearings up we're pushing it
yeah
yeah
and it's taken that long for dave to get his UNK in gear and he's a so slow
he's been reluctant to do anything because he's had other things to do
right
but malcolm in the end got him to do something
who are the who's the boss of these erm UNK buyers
richard was the team leader he's the guy for me to work on
i know i could do it
who's his boss
who's his boss
well peter but er
who's peter
peter 's the group er materials manager
but i wouldn't
he's not one that you can lean on
er to wh actually leave it with me because richard 's the guy
and sally is taking over from david it's a UNK period
right
because UNK not she doesn't understand one end of a bearing from another
right
she used to do a bit of part time buying from the accounts department
yeah
she's come down now to take over buying and she thinks UNK a UNK
a UNK
yeah
right
and i can get richard and sally interested
right
but david's sat there at the minute in the background
right
now yes wait
what i need to do is get him out the way
till he's out of the way
right
and suggest to your sally
yeah
that you on one of your visits it would be a very good idea if you sat down with her and the engineering pal
yeah and roy
yes
yeah
and you have a c not necessarily with not necessarily with the boss
no mm
yeah
but just the buyer
mm
and the engineer
right
and s and begin to drive them with a UNK plan
look wh you're in this business for a long time things take an awful long time to happen in this world
mm
mm
you know that i know that
so we've got to get our plans sorted out
i want to help you do that
no UNK new at the job we've been working at this for on the technical front for some time now let's just sit down and work out what we're gonna do
is that alright
yeah
yeah so try and bring those two together
mm
because if you do that and it begins to erm o occur to her and if she's fairly bright
mm she doesn't seem daft yeah
she's not clever cos she's bearings
erm it no
she doesn't seem engineering clever
no
but she's not daft
no but you're gonna help them
yeah
you're going to your object in life is to help her do the job better
right
and explain to her
and by sitting down and having a technical and commercial conversation together
mm
you can sort of chair that
mm
meeting and help her to understand
how much we're helping them through this
and appreciate how much else we can do
and okay if we're a pound or two different
we're forty minutes up the road
yeah
yeah
if we can't e i've had a couple of months of stock on the shelf for 'em
yeah
in fact i must admit i UNK to dave if linear will do consignment stock for why shouldn't we if we're only forty minutes away
but i mean that's the last thing i wanna do but
yeah
but even then we could have consignment stock here in effect cos they're only forty minutes away we could throw 'em in the back of the car and have 'em delivered
well that's what we've got we've got consignment stock here it's on our premises
yeah
so they don't have the problem of
yeah
the hassle of stocking it and so on
yeah
so you know
i've just got this david thing and the thing in the background
i didn't want to UNK on toes
well you've got a lovely you've got a lovely UNK
you've got a lovely opportunity there to sell the non price benefits
yeah
just have a try and h try and set up a c a meeting with this sally and your engineering UNK
yeah okay
and don't talk price at all
no
and than at a later stage go UNK and have a go at sally and remind her of all these good things that you talked about
the problem is we're UNK down on deliveries on standard bearings cos of the balls up about
well okay so you've got to talk
you've got to talk your way through that
it's the precision bearings that's really the prize
i mean that's why
yes
and of course now that er now that we've got the total business beginning to operate as one the chances of letting them down on standard bearings is very much smaller than it ever was before
yeah
the problem the reason we've let her down on standard bearings is because of this UNK
mm
oh yeah
you see it's got nothing to do with the with our
no
competence as a supplier
no
yeah okay
alright
i'll give you something to
i'm going tomorrow morning there anyway cos UNK just given me a call they've got some problems with screw support bearings UNK up but er i'll go over there some time
right
yeah
yeah
so i'll sally
okay is that happiness
right yeah okay
erm just the one's me main concern
i mean the others you know it's what we get and sort of thing
with them it's yeah
mm
erm i'm not happy with them and i don't know how you get round it
knowing what's happening there
well er at the end of the day it may be one that we're gonna we're gonna lose but erm
mm
if it is
okay you can use a p s p as an endowment for mortgage purposes and it works virtually the same if you're arranging a mortgage now for a new client for a new property the chance are you want the mortgage master policy because that does the whole thing for you okay that's what its ideal purpose is
erm where you might use p s p is when you've got a client now who's anticipated buying perhaps something in the future
okay so they're buying now then you want a mortgage master because that's what its purpose is
but you might be talking to a client says but at the moment i've got no need erm or i've got n no intention of buying now but i might be buying in a year or two year's time
this is where a sales idea could come in but for the right reasons it could be good but also for the bad reasons it could be totally wrong
without trying looking very heavily at these type of sales where savings plans have been sold for future mortgages erm the clients are left thinking it's building up money for their for their deposit for their legal fees and it guarantees them a mortgage at sometime in the future
mm
okay now putting both bits aside if we're making sure right okay if we're making sure that the product is being sold for the right reasons i e the client is separately saving for deposit for house moving fees legal fees all the other fees and they could still afford to do this then i believe it's a good thing that you can suggest to your clients
mm
mm
and it's gonna work along the lines of well if we're looking at a typical endowment mortgage yeah normally they run for twenty five years don't they
okay do they do they run for twenty five because we like them to or because we can't afford to pay them any sooner
usually because that's the minimum time we can afford it over
if we can reduce that term at no extra cost surely be an advantage
mm
okay
borrowing the money let's i mean i don't know fifty thousand let's say put a figure on it for a moment
we've got a future perhaps UNK to have a fifty thousand pound mortgage to buy the house the flat or whatever they want in let's say two year's time
if we consider starting the endowment here but presumably gonna run twenty five years in fact you're gonna finish in year twenty three when they borrowed the money aren't they so they've only borrowed the money for twenty three years
mm
mm
what the UNK a month on a fifty thousand pound mortgage
it's three ninety five
about three hundred
three hundred and ninety five
three ninety five
so f four hundred call it
you better
you say that right from the heart
i say that
is that is that gross or net
yeah
so that's nine thousand six hundred your client's not now going to pay isn't it
yeah
yeah
it saved two years UNK at the end of the mortgage because endowments UNK here saving those last two years purely because we started paying in two years before we actually took the mortgage out
yeah
yeah
make sense
do you get a six per cent bonus on a mortgage master as well as the
oh yes
you do right
well they're exactly the same
thank you
what's the technical difference between the two
very little
what is the very little
is it the allocation then
no
no it's the same
yeah i mean there's some slight erm differences when it comes to re mo moving again and that sort of thing
oh
but more of that we can move into the mortgage course
yes right yeah that's the difference isn't it
that's right there's some slight UNK
their guaranteed increases if you move yeah
but
that's the difference
none that would make any difference at this stage for selling it
yeah
but again i emphasize it must be sold in the right situation
case
if the client is putting money for a deposit the savings and legal fees all that separately and they can still afford to do this
yeah
then it's worth looking at the idea
what about somebody who's wanting to top up like say their own their own their in the property already they just want erm an extra top up
right i mean you might find a client whose perhaps taken out a further mortgage for you know some house improvements or something
yes yeah
and they've got now a deficit of life cover there and extra again you take out one of these for it
yeah i've got a client who
do that then
we sold a p s p too
they had a mortgage with the UNK and an endowment for a fixed period of twenty five years
right
after three or four years they thought they might move so we said well take out a p s p cos that provides a savings vehicle and if you do move you can use that as part of the mortgage increase
that's right
they made enquiries from the UNK and they said no we can't accept this savings plan we want a proper endowment policy
so they came running back saying this thing you sold me is a load of rubbish wool UNK say it's not good enough you know what's it all about
so you've got to be very careful
but
when you suggest to them they can buy a house or get a mortgage with it
that's right yes yeah
it goes straight in and they don't forget
what a lot of other societies will today though will not necessarily want policies assigned to them anyway
no quite but they're all
in years gone by it was like ninety nine per cent
sure
of them all wanted this
endowment assigned to them so they would see it they would know it they would check it and they'd be in that position
it's only the odd one isn't it
that's right
that catches you out
nowadays the majority of building societies don't want to know about you know well it's up to you we give you the money
yeah
it's
it's like interest over the mortgage
well p s p's an endowment
that's what i'm saying you can use that
it's a whole life endowment saving
if you were buying a house though we do a mortgage master
if this is something that maybe in the future then you can't use a mortgage master for a for a future house purchase you can use the p s p
is there is there any erm major UNK is there any major difference between as far as in relation to mortgage er protection
is there difference
hold on at the back one question
is there any major between the p s p and the er the mortgage master which would nor normally say to the client well i would recommend in these circumstances that you have the mortgage master because it does
that's extra
the only UNK you have a mortgage master when you're selling the house now
buying a house now
someone just mentioned yeah it just UNK to mind someone just mentioned er the options on moving if you cos
totally different effect
make no difference at this stage the only thing is if you say if you're buying a house now you'll need a mortgage master
yes
if you're not buying it now you can't have a mortgage master so therefore you must have a p s p
mm
right tha that is the only difference yes
there the distinction
and the other question is that you say er building societies aren't actually er UNK on endowments now i mean what
being assigned
not UNK on them being assigned
no
no
okay
i mean basically building societies today are saying well there's your money all we want you to say is that in twenty five years time or earlier you'll be able to pay us back
how you do it is entirely up to you
oh i see
whether that money comes from a pension a p e p off the UNK
mm
they're not really worried as long as they've got it
yeah and if they don't get it they convert into a UNK so UNK lost really
i see
or they take the house back
notice of deposit rather then
i mean they've got UNK in the bricks and UNK haven't they
yes
it's UNK
yes as you say they could always UNK it couldn't they basically
yeah that's right
i mean pick up david's point you know it's
to pick up david's point now if this is the client who's already running the house the mortgage it's you know a few years old they want to take out a further advance for some house improvements or something then obviously they now need more so it might be at this stage we then want a p s p for the remaining you know ten years eleven years twelve years or whatever because they've borrowed some more money from the building society
yeah
and the advantage it would be for the majority of endowments you're gonna find out there for mortgage purposes would not have living UNK attached to them
you know we can add it to this bit
they might even want to you know take out a whole new one
with living insurance as well
it then comes down to UNK
yeah
they'd like their mortgage paid off people had a serious illness or UNK erm heart attack or something before actual maturity
just as a matter of interest graham i was looking at the er the rates yesterday cos i've been paying my mortgage over ten ye over the last eleven years and erm bearing in mind the premiums i've been paying before my endowments would have been er you'd expect to be more recent because i was er young
cheaper then because you were younger
well actually looking at the erm premiums in the book and it worked out that the total i was paying out in endowments if i got the same level of cover under the protected savings plan over twenty five years with living assurance it was it was only working about seven pound more you know
yeah right and you've got all that extra benefit
and i've got all that extra benefit and on er another ten years older
right
erm so
so they're quite UNK priced
so what no if it appeals what i'm saying is if it appeals to me i could imagine it would appeal to a lot of people out there
that's right yes
that's right then again i think that's one of the biggest plans that you can use as your door opener
yeah
yes
you know whether you end up selling it if that is best advice or not
yeah
is irrelevant at this stage
mm
yeah
you just want something come back to the people i was talking originally in the week that
yeah
we make something to get in that UNK their ears up and think yes i want to listen to this guy
mm
yeah
he's got something to offer
mm
yes
okay
i mean this next plan will also take us down that path
whether we actually sell it or not is irrelevant it's the fact that it might just be the hook to get inside someone's house
mm
the question that i would raise with this plan is mr client what bills do you have each month that must be paid no matter what
okay so it's you and your family living in a house
as most of us do
what bills have you got each month that you've gotta pay
mortgage
mortgage or rent firstly yes
council tax
water
utilities
all the variables and UNK
er all the utilities yeah
food
clothes
clothing
maintenance
travel
insurance premiums
etc the list can go on and on and on
there's lots there
actually if you take the if you if you make the long list and then say to the client well now what can you do without
tell me what you don't need you put holidays on it you can buy
a new car for the wife every year you know all these sort of UNK and then say then what can you live without and when you start crossing them out there's only one or two that actually go out
right
we need to be able to have provision to pay all the bills every month
that's right
yeah if your self employed then don't forget there's tax as well
that's right yeah the tax
national insurance and all the other bits that must be paid okay
so what UNK that we're in a position to pay those bills off
our income
income
so from your income that we must have says we can do all those things and have our standard of living
so the question mr client is what happens if that UNK
what bills now don't we have to pay UNK
none
none of them
they all still want paying then
but if you haven't got an income how would you pay them
great difficulty
with great difficulty
mr client if i can rest you assured on that point that we could be in a position whereby you ne you never be without an income do you think that's an important area that we look at
mm
yes
yeah
it would be for you as well wouldn't it
i'd rather UNK on that
okay health master is that the plan that's going to fit the bill
i thought it was the mortgage master
no we've done that
a little concept a little drawing like that if you emphasize the wha the whole plan is about doesn't it
can your client live without an income they've just convinced you that they can't they now want to know about this health master
exactly the same example for selling life assurance to the wife
or living assurance
you know you've got to pay all the bills
but how much do these cost you know and there you go
that's right
i mean different times like tomorrow we actually go through lots of diagrams that we can use
mm
to emphasize certain products
yeah
okay cos it's these little diagrams that get the whole point across
rather you know an hour talking about the actual product
yes
so we call it a p h i policy or not p h one p h i for permanent health insurance that's exactly what it is okay so that's a permanent health insurance policy
who do you think would want one
anybody who
everybody
basically anyone with an income isn't it
yeah
potentially we've got twenty five million people out there with an income
does it cover just housewives
just housewives
well does it does it cover housewives
no they don't work
i tell you it could do
try and tell the housewife they don't work
yeah
walk out there in a straight line
okay so of those twenty five million we'll find some are employed some are self employed yes
mm
which of those two categories you think this would appeal to mainly
self employed
majority well mainly it would be self employed wouldn't it
there's about three and a quarter million of those as and when this slide was made for the self employed
wou would there not be er possibly a conflict of interest there if er for example suppose it was a self employed person
times was hard and he had the advantage over the insurance company of knowing that his profits might be UNK off in the near future and he thinks ah i'll get er i'll take out a permanent health insurance based on my present income to protect seventy five because i know in about three or four years time my income would have gone down to about sixty per cent of what it is so
but you'll be ill at the time isn't it to be able to claim
yeah
so when he's ill he just
based on his last year's er earnings yeah
but we'll deal with how much he can have and the figures etc later on
yes
but either way he's still got to be ill
he's got to be ill that's right
to be able to claim
yeah that's right
i'm taking it out
so does this mean then employed people wouldn't want this contract
no
not at all
certainly not
who was employed before they came here that had erm sickness pay from their employer for any time they were off
oh i have wife
you had your hand up how long would you be paid for if you were off sick
i can't remember but probably six months
six months exactly
nine months yeah
okay
yeah the same yeah
yeah same
six months reducing to fifty per cent after six months
mine was a year
right
what you're finding is depends normally on length of service with a company er but the longer someone's been there i think th the best i've heard and that's what i used to get was sort of six months full salary six months half salary after that it was at company discretion
yeah
okay now the police force the armed services are totally a different ball game because they get very good pay benefits so it's unlikely that we can help those sort of people but of the normal sort of type UNK the best i think you gonna find i think is six months full salary six months half
unless they're sort of directors of their own company things like that then you know it could be an UNK supply of money basically
depending on how much there is in the kitty of course
but
that means there's a lot of people that won't have six months full six months half if might be you know a couple of months full a couple of months half
now if let's say if we took an average of three months full
three months half salary you know someone's got money for at least six months
but who he would had been in a financial problem after three months when it drops to half pay
yeah
yeah
a couple okay after the six months when it stops presumably we're going to be in a position of on state benefits
yes
so even the employed would have a need but it might not be so urgent but it might not be so urgent as the self employed guy whose gonna need money after how long
straight away
straight away isn't it i mean as soon as you stop laying your bricks you stop earning your money basically don't you
out there in the big real world
okay so therefore it's gonna appeal perhaps more so to self employed but even so the employed would still need it
and statistics would tell us that actually twenty five per cent of the work force have some form of income protection which is great news
is it adequate
good question
that we don't know
but just looking at that figure what does that mean positively for us
seventy five per cent don't
seventy five per cent don't have income protection
which is even better news isn't it for us not for them of course
most people won't know they've got it anyway
sorry
most people won't know they've got it anyway
that's right i mean again it's one of those things it's in the benefits package if you work for a company you don't want to know about it until you need to claim
that's right then you realise how little it is
exactly right
i mean people say well there's state benefits
what's the basic state sickness benefit
fifty six pounds ten a week
who can manage on that
yeah that right
okay so looking at numbers of people off work
having a drink innit
how many people do you think if we looked across the country now would we find that were actually claiming sickness or gonna be off erm for sick for up a month for up to one month
how many people do you think we'd find
a lot
oh a lot
five per cent
more than that
which is how many what did you say twenty five million
twenty five million two and a half
a UNK one point two
you're not far off it's about one and a half million the d s tell us could be off work at any time for up a month
UNK
now it's a lot of people it's only a short period of time isn't it one month
mm
mm
now how many of those do you think will still be off after six months
not many
how many is not many i'll put a figure on it
probably five per cent again
thank you
say eighty thousand
no one point two million
one point two million
he's a UNK
UNK
one point two million these are d s statistics
that's a hell of a lot isn't it
still be off after six months
UNK
how many do you think after a year
a million
nine hundred
who said that
they reckon a million people would still be off after a year
now those people even at the best we spoke of six months full six months half are now becoming into a problem area aren't they
mm
that's a hell of a lot of people
it is a lot innit
yes
but it's good though
and again get you thinking
if you're ill off work what's the last thing you want to worry yourself with
money
money problems isn't it
going back to work
going back to work
okay the last thing that's gonna help you get better is worrying about money isn't it
yeah
just give you an idea we've got a selection of current claims here
no need to write these down just for information
got a UNK took a claim out january of eighty nine reasonably low premiums fourteen pound thirty two a month
may eighty nine only four months later having had having had a finger UNK have received monthly benefits from the time of claim up until going back to work of thirteen thousand four hundred and seventy five pounds
jesus
for a finger
no that's right
she what
she got that for a finger what about the
sound levels sorry switch it off
if she's getting that for a finger i'm gonna see mr the american and UNK him a policy
i thought you said mr UNK
company director april eighty seven just under fourteen pound a month premium september eighty nine through chest pains stress and UNK
stress
good excuse innit chest pain
what a UNK
UNK a bit more than stress isn't it
bit of a con
yeah
the friendly doctor
you have to be off for a while to receive that or straight away
yes
depending on we look for details as we go through it
teacher march eighty seven low premiums
lower risk
september ninety two through stress and depression
my god
that one thousand six hundred and ninety five pounds
that's cos she wanted paid
we've got a brick layer
august eighty nine took the policy out
march ninety
here we go
nearly four times as much premium as the teacher received UNK er premium payments of fourteen thousand two hundred
better than laying bricks
he's cracked it
they keep paying us forty quid a month i'm gonna get a nice fourteen and a half grand this year
yeah but you've still gotta be signed off sick
so he's got to have you know doctor's evidence
doctor it hurts
doctor my back hurts here's another twenty quid
okay definition of the plan
what do you think wh what do you think it is
income UNK
non qualifying
non qualifying unit linked
no
no back to the future
yeah
joint life no survivor
non qualifying unit linked life assurance policy providing permanent health insurance benefits now all the other policies we've looked at this week were qualifying weren't they
yes
yes that's the first non qualifying so we'll see some different rules on this anyone like to tell what they the meaning is behind the word permanent in permanent health insurance
you can't take it away
by
up to the selected up to the selected age you can claim as many times
that's right in other words the insurance company can't back out of the contract providing the client is paying his premiums
so we can't decide as regardless of how many times they claim we can't say UNK enough we're not gonna honour the contract any more
okay so once it's signed and accepted the client does their part of the bargain i e pays their premiums then there's no way we can decide to opt out of the contract
so
so therefore they've got it for as long they want it
so they can claim
so they can claim as many times as they as they want
yeah
claim twelve times a year for the next forty years right up until retirement age if they wish
yeah
we can't decide to opt out of the contract
mm
providing the UNK legitimate and they're doing all their bits from their side of the fence keeping the er plan in operation we can't decide we've had enough
which is good news i mean from a client they've got control over whether they keep you going or not
UNK if your a
yes
if it goes if they sort of pay for an excessive size er or what does the company set up their own medical examination or
if we are in any way dubious about the nature of the claim
yeah
then we've got our own medical people or specialists we would call in to say talk to the client's specialist please between the two of you agree that we should be paying this claim or not
otherwise just the doctor's note is sufficient
that's right
but yeah we do get a representative from the client i e his doctor or specialist or whatever and one of our people to talk to each other and then work out who's right and who's wrong
is it
is the premium paid while whilst still claiming
er no
the premiums built in automatically
is it
yeah
don't let anyone
is th is there any ever any situation which i mean i know in most cases you'd obviously accept the er the opinion of the er UNK doctor
but is there any situations where abbey life can UNK the doctor and say we're not happy with this we want to appoint we want to give him a medical with our own doctor
well has just answered over here
our specialist will talk to the client's specialist and between them agree
yeah
who's right
oh yeah no i understood that but i mean i thought could he actually over rule the client's specialist that's all i'm saying
no i mean we're well i don't know
yes
i mean between the two specialists to work out themselves
yeah
and if we're finding that their specialist is UNK
yeah
yes we would do
if our guy doesn't agree they'll say right you know we'll have a look ourselves
right
okay so it covers not only illness but also accident as well
so much money
paid for mine
that's right
so if they're off either due to illness or accident
index linked
yes
that's right discussed why i was asking this question thought there might be a
so do you think then that this policy could only cover people with an income
no
yes
yes
i'd say
no
yes
yes
yes
i'll go with the UNK
no
no because
who without an income then could have one
housewife
housewife
yeah got a picture of wife there
okay imagine she's effectively not earning a UNK income
mm
but if the housewife is unable to perform her duties what's the husband gonna have to do
take out time off work
trade her in for a new model
UNK pair
okay either way it's going to be a drain in the income to bring someone else in
yeah
the husband to have time off work to look after the children
but if he UNK
there's gonna be a loss of income isn't there
but if he UNK
what the UNK pair
if he UNK the UNK pair what happens then
housewife
yeah
yes
that's covered
could be
yes
yes
you've either got to be earning money and you have a health master to match your salary or you can be a housewife
mm interesting
for which there is a pre set
what are the limits
erm plan
is there a limit
yes
on oh thank you
you're welcome
for the housewife there is a pre set maximum limit of five thousand six hundred and forty pounds per annum benefit
depends
five thousand six hundred and forty pounds
oh right
that's the maximum that she can have
five six four o
what's that based on
anything in particular
about a hundred and eighty pound a week
sorry
that's just the figure that abbey have said that's the amount they'll be happy to pay
limiting their risk
yep
yes erm there are very few companies actually offering that sort of cover
that's right
that's right
so it's got a bargaining position
that's right
i mean as you say there's very few companies that offer any form of benefit to housewives they're either working or they're not they have a health master or not
yeah
that's the limit in total pounds then
per year
so
how do they how do they work that out because if they haven't got an income how do they say well you know
well they just say that's the amount you can have
oh you get that's it fixed amount
that's it that's it that's the maximum
fixed amount
that's the maximum depending on the premium
yes if you gotta if you're fully funded on the premiums if you take out
well the premium will be driven by the amount wouldn't it
yeah sure
yeah
so if you take out
if they can afford the premium they can have the amount
yeah right so it's not related no
got ya
okay definition of disability what they've actually got to be to be able to claim is unable to perform any part of their normal occupation
that's why we had the UNK the UNK claiming
mm
for the finger UNK
she was unable to do any particular part of her job
no she was the one that put her finger on the UNK when they tied the UNK you know
and okay unable to perform any part of her normal occupation and they're not doing anything else for which they're paid not following any other UNK occupation okay so definition is unable to perform any part of their normal occupation and they're not following any other UNK employment
it's the same as the p s p wasn't it basically
the of premium and the that's right that's right
erm yes premium yes
so in other words we're saying if they're off sick erm they decide to go out and you know do something else to earn some money then they wouldn't be able to claim under their policy
mm
okay
they'd only normally be happy to do that if they didn't have the policy in the first place wouldn't they
you know if they couldn't go and be a brick layer but they could sit at home and you know stick stamps on envelopes or whatever earn some money then they might have to do that because they haven't got this plan
they've got a health master they're off sick they can claim on the plan
how do they er work that out for a housewife
as regard to sex
housewife has their own definition
ah right
moving UNK on
housewives definition she must be confined to her home or that of a recognised medical institution
so the doctor's definition must say yes she's confined to home because of the UNK whatever it may be or she's actually gone to a recognised medical institution hospital nursing home whatever it may be
so a chopped off UNK not good enough
correct
unless she says she can't open the front door i don't know
okay so it's confined to home or a recognised medical institution
yes it is
just as a matter a matter interest and that
sorry
just as a matter of interest how would that relate to the er claim for the housewife who had a finger UNK
that was the UNK
er UNK rather
oh yes sorry
yes
yes sorry
we're talking about
so they're going off their trolley
okay clear on the two definitions
yeah
normal occupation unable to perform any part of it
not being paid by anybody else and the housewife you know that are not able to leave home or eventually in a hospital
yeah happy on the two
yeah
jolly good
what's the minimum term of a plan
no minimum
no
no set minimum
absolutely wrong
oh dear
ten years
oh
minimum of ten years for a plan
is it ten years
could be maximum
retirement i'd say
of what age
six sixty for female sixty five for male
sixty five regardless bearing in mind we've now offered women the opportunity to earn more money from the year two thousand and ten and not retiring until sixty five
there's equality for you
so anybody male or female could have a plan up until their sixty fifth birthday
so you would take out a plan you wouldn't specify the term necessarily would you
yes you would
you'd write it to UNK with your anticipated retirement age
to retirement age yes yeah
okay now generally you're gonna find i would have thought that you're not going to get many people wanting to retire much below fifty five
yeah
there will be some
okay but again a very small minority
but the actual UNK erm scope if you like can only allow you to write the plans to finish between fifty five and sixty five the client's age
yeah
so if the client says i want to i'm gonna pack up when i'm fifty you write the plan to finish at fifty five
you've got to start it at forty the max you know the last date isn't it
the last date would be yes
yeah
but i mean your looking at a twenty thirty year old now who says i'm gonna be packing up when i'm fifty
yes you actually have to write the plan to fifty five
when he gets to fifty if all is well and he wants to pack up you just cancel the plan
simple as that cos this plan is like a sort of pay as you go type plan i mean you're not building up huge cash reserves that you gonna lose out on by cancelling early
is there any residual value
there is but it's going to be very small
yeah
because all of the money is you is basically to ke provide a level of cover
yeah
it's not like a cover master living assurance where you building up excess cash funds at the same time
mm
okay ninety five per cent of the premium is actually paying for the level of cover
mm
so you'll find when you look at the premiums they are considerably lower than those of the other plans
mm
can for business purposes
it can from in situations where the employer wants to take one on the life of the employee
but subject to the same minimum and maximum criteria
yes
oh yes
sorry was that
just gonna say it is a life assurance policy
normally competitive in er in er
yes
so it does have er
yes it does
you know over about five
how old to have one
seventeen next birthday yeah
seventeen next birthday yeah
lots of people a lot of people start work at sixteen providing they've got an income
seventeen next birthday up to a maximum obviously of fifty five because of the ten year rule to sixty five
seventeen next birthday minimum
fifty five next birthday maximum
but it's non qualified now isn't it
correct
so you don't need the ten year term here
not for qualifying rules no
no that's for building up lumps of cash
it's basically i mean you know who's really gonna want one for less than ten years
yeah
you looking at the majority of clients are all gonna be
to forty or lower i would have thought for this sort of plan the majority
yeah
isn't five years a normal more of a normal for er business purposes
not with ours
no
well that's what i thought yeah
and you'd be right okay the availability we've looked at joint life joint life first claims life of UNK single lives
what sort of benefit would claim be written on
single life
single life
single life only isn't it
because it's one person one contract it's based on me and my salary or the wife as a house wife or house husband of course if the wife's working
house person indeed
house person indeed
away from that one
okay bearing in mind single life does include a life of another and the only time we can use that life for another is the one we mentioned there with where the employer wishes to take a plan on the life of the employee
no key man basically we're looking at there
you got a business partnership wanna protect one of their directors one of their top producers or whatever it may be they can take a plan out on the life of their employee so again marketing here he's looking at companies as well as individuals
they want to protect their individuals who perhaps at the moment they can't afford to pay a salary if the guy's off sick
right sure
this would do it for them wouldn't it
all they've got to pay now is the premium not the price
would it be competitive though
very
about to what sort of numbers you know
pass
ah sorry
ten i would think
competitive to what
well wh
oh yes
from an employer's point of view wouldn't that be er better if they had a key man insurance under something like erm well under a cover master for example because if he was a long term em employer
yeah you'd want you want you want
yeah but that only pays out on death or terminal illness isn't it this is gonna pay out if he's falls off a ladder
you want life assurance
yeah
but from the em from the employers point of view what he stands to lose if that person's away from work i mean all the er UNK gonna lose is his income so if he was doing it this in his own case he would be looking to replace
can you hold on a minute
sorry
he would be looking just to replace his salary whereas to the employer the loss to the employer would be considerably would be considerably more couldn't it
so what would cover master give the employer then
i
if he's off sick
well co cover master would erm would give it would provide it up to the UNK which the er
sum assured
yeah
oh yeah but or yeah no that's right cover master yeah
if i'm an employer and i can't afford to pay you if you're off sick
yeah
a you might not want to come and join my company in the first place
right
b if you're off sick you're not going to get any money
right and also the
but if this contract says you know i can offer you a sickness plan if you're off sick and i'll be giving you money because of it
yeah no i see yeah
yeah
yeah okay
yeah but bearing in mind erm point there as well you'd also need things like cover master living insurance to give a lump sum if the client if that person died
because they might need to bring someone else in to replace them
that's right yes
but this particular UNK obviously outside the scope of cover master
oh yeah
cover master pays out when you die
of course yeah
this pays out when you're off sick
yeah
yeah
make sure you're clear of the distinction between the two
oh yeah i am there sorry i wasn't
yeah ones like that
that's right
ones like
okay minimum premiums much lower as we said than the other two plans because it's not building up cash residual values
twelve pound a month minimum premium or a hundred and twenty if they're paying it annually
and that does include a policy fee
which is
two pound fifty nine
that cover master
do you not get the same benefit for hundred and twenty pound per annum
is it low
yes that's right
if you're paying if you the benefit you want cost twelve pound a month
by paying a hundred and twenty grand you wouldn't get it because you're not paying the equivalent
yeah
yes
worth a try
so if this was my second policy you sold me and i wanted a minimum premium contract how much would the minimum premium be
brilliant
so that's nine sixty yeah remember that little rule spoke about the other day
the client takes out a second application and they want it on minimum premiums they actually get it for eighty per cent of the current value of the minimum premium
what's the what's the minimum time should you an existing policy holder to
no UNK
so providing they're an existing client or this is their second application with you tonight
right oh right
and it's on minimum premiums you've got a little bit of a discount there but again bearing in mind nine pound sixty might not buy them the cover they want
yes if it was something like a housewife if you sold the husband and wife let's say a cover master or living assurance or the husband's health master and the wife now wants a health master then nine pound sixty might be enough to give them the maximum benefit
rather than paying twelve pound for it
what he's got a cover master
any plan
any plan
as i say providing this is the second doesn't matter what the first one was
right
yeah
including pensions
any plan
which was any plan of ours
so they're not getting twelve pounds worth of cover for nine pound sixty
no
no
no again bearing in mind you get pound for pound value whatever you pay in that would dictate what you get out
minimum premium
it's not very many people who would qualify for the minimum premiums
yeah
they're very lo they're young people low levels of cover or indeed a housewife
yeah
because of the very low level of cover
right
so how long do you think someone's gonna be off before we'll actually start paying out
twenty six days
tw or
no
that's what you think so if it was lower than that would you buy one
yeah
four weeks
put four weeks
there are four choices
ah
the earliest of which is four weeks
four weeks
thirteen weeks
there are four choices the client can choose from
again depending on what they've currently got cos again we've got to UNK tail this plan into any current arrangements that they've already got
so if they're play paid by their employer for you know six months full salary they're not gonna want one of these kicking off after four weeks are they
well they might do but they can't
the golden rule of this type of plan in fact there's quite a few the first one i really to want you to just take on board is that you cannot be better off financially by claiming under this policy than you were when you were actually at work
so you couldn't have this plan paying out after four weeks and at the same time you're still getting paid by your employer
it's gonna be one or the other
so we've literally got to UNK tail this into whatever other current arrangements they have including any other p h i they've already got
so this will only come into operation as soon as erm it's completely stopped
correct
so not it doesn't come into operation when their salary drops to half
well again it depends on how you set this plan up
right
cos the client might be in a position of saying well after six months i'm down to half salary so you might have sold this plan to pick up the other half
mm
at the six month stage
right
so they're getting half from the plan and half from their employer
so it can b
so they're not better off are they they're the same
no
so you can be split like that
yes
so they can then increase at the end of fifty two weeks or whatever
yeah i mean because you've got a bit of a difficult position there where you've got the person let's say they're paid their salary six months full then it drops to six months half and after that we know it's gonna go to zero
what the plan can't do erm is i suppose yeah UNK the only way you can deal with that well there's one of two ways you can set the plan up erm for full benefit let's say the salary was twenty thousand so by here you're getting ten so you set the plan up in UNK for the same twenty thousand pounds but at the six month's stage you claim half of it yes and at the twelve month stage you're now claiming the full benefit
all that does mean to the client they're paying the premium for twenty thousand for that period that they'll never ever claim on
yeah
mm
yeah so there's a slight disadvantage there
well that's gonna happen any anyway
the other way you could do is to do two plans
yes one that kicks in at six month's half salary the other one that kicks in at twelve month's on half salary
mm
so you're then paying the right premiums for the right amount of benefits you're going to get
mm
the other one might be more straightforward to do one plan cos you've got one policy fee one policy charge etc so there's that ratio to bear in mind but the other one might be simpler just to have two plans
or if they said well i can manage on that half until the year's UNK and then have one plan kick in at fifty two weeks with the full benefits
make sense
understand and happy
yeah
is it possible to have t erm a split plan then or do you have
the only other way is to do one plan for the full amount and claim half of it at the half way stage and then claim the other half then
but again you know you're paying here premiums for twenty thousand pound but you're only getting ten
mm
mm
so you gotta weigh that up against er doing two plans which you're paying the true cost of the benefits you would get
if you take out two plans do you get a reduced policy charge
yes
oh no not reduced policy charge sorry no
as i say you'd be paying two plans two policy fees two setting up charges administration costs etc so there's all that to be weighed up with the advantages over i've actually got another plan but i can only claim half of it for the first six months
er has it ever been considered on health master because s say for example cover master you can actually split periods and levels of sum assured cos you have the selected period where you'd have it higher
yes
on health master because it's quite a common thing where employees can be on full pay for six months then half for the next six months
would it no not been an idea on something like health master to actually have er a period of six months where you could claim half of the
no it's very difficult with that type of contract because it's something that you'd be paying out monthly
i mean cover master it's very simple say you want yeah it's a hundred thousand arranged for twenty years and then later on
yeah
because this one you could UNK and changing it all the time it's very an administrative nightmare
oh yeah i see yeah okay
on that it would be very difficult
how is er redundancy covered
no
so what if you've got one of these plans out and then your redundant and then your sick
right okay can i deal with that a little bit later on
okay but it doesn't pay out on redundancies it's just a sickness and accident policy
aren't ya
so choice of deferred periods four thirty twenty six fifty two
client's choice depending on their occupation
okay they might ask for a four week deferred period but because of their occupation it says or we say sorry we're not going to give you that
erm whilst i don i accept you don't know what the groups are at this time i'd just like you to make a note of classes of occupation one two and three are the
bless you
is eligible anybody in group four which obviously is a high risk occupation anybody in that group is unable to have a four week deferred period
well they all escaped haven't they
anybody in a four week UNK erm sorry anybody in group four
group four
cannot have four week deferred period so what we're saying is the risk there is too high and there's obviously a greater chance they'll be claiming at a very early stage okay so the client has the choice say apart from the group fours they could be four thirty and twenty six and fifty two but again UNK into what they've already got
also taking into account any other p h i benefits we must do as well
if think i've got this written down wrong classes of occupation one two and three can only have a four week deferred period that's no
yes exactly right
that's right
group fours can't
can only have a four week
no can have four
or thirteen twenty six or fifty two
yeah
it's only classes of occupation one two and three can have a four week
that's right
i've got the order in the wrong place
or it's only class four occupation that can't have a four week
depending which way you're coming round the corner
do what
how many classes are there
ninety nine no there's four
no there's four erm apart from housewife and those that are declined
right
they come into one of four
okay
four main categories
paid on disability and it's payable from the end of the deferred period until the client UNK dies or the policy itself UNK
so it's UNK at the end of the deferred period up until recovery death or the end of the term of the policy how are most people's salaries paid generally
monthly
in arrears or advance
arrears
in arrears
we'll keep this the same then shall we
paid monthly in arrears so let's say self employed guy got a four week deferred plan
he's off sick today from today how long will it be before he gets his first cheque from us
eight weeks
eight weeks
eight weeks
two months
yes cos it's got to go four week deferred then at the end of the four weeks after that he gets his first cheque for that four week period
mm
yes an important point there because we don't want you to go away thinking you can tell your self employed people you gonna have money at the end of four weeks
at the end of four weeks they're eligible to claim shall we say then at the end of that four weeks they can then get a cheque for whatever period they've been off
so it will be actually eight weeks from the day of the illness or accident
is it a case of claiming it immediately er you become sick rather than saying
oh yes
notify us immediately the claim the accident the illness or whatever
yeah
we can then start the deferred period
cos it could be a case of you know waiting twenty six weeks to tell us then we might say right we now start the twenty six weeks deferred
do they have to produce a doctor's note say look i've been off for
chances are we would
be flexible
yes yeah but again as soon as it happens let us know
yeah but with some of them how are you gonna now at the outset whether you're gonna be off work for
you don't know but it's not worth taking the risk of you know being wrong
yeah
you can always say i've had this accident
yeah if it if it's an illness not a simple accident an accident is probably or you've got a rough idea as to how long you gonna be off for
yeah
so
yeah but i mean yes i mean you've got a cold you gonna be off perhaps a couple of weeks
mm
but if it's something you know more serious than then the client should be aware from you that they should be ringing you up at this stage
mm
to say do i need to
you can then perhaps ha have a word with the UNK and say client's off with this what do you thinks likely to happen
mm
don't know let's be aware of it get a letter in writing register er a claim to head office
get a letter in writing that's
are we going to cover the UNK
erm a little bit yes
basically as far as what you need to know at the point of sale yes
is there a guide at all that we can look at
erm it we've covered some of it the rest er again because we're not looking at such large sums you know as cover master for home health checks and things like that erm but basically no
no i mean when we come to it we'll deal with it if you've still got a question then i'll answer that then but basically there's more UNK guide lines with this plan than with any other so you don't really need to worry about that
okay income payable on disability
we said as soon as the disability occurs deferred period kicks in after that will then start setting of the payment
there is one time when the deferred period won't apply
that is on the case of a re occurring disability
so scenario clients been off sick for the last six months with a back problem
six months to a year whatever with a back problem
okay go back to work fully recovered okay if within six months of going back to work they're off again due to the same or related condition as the last claim then we won't install or employ the deferred period we'll treat is as a continuation of the previous claim
so money would be paid out basically from day one makes sense
so if it's the same or related condition the deferred period won't apply and will carry on we'll start paying straight away providing there's a loss of income
does it have a time limit on it
six months
six months
so if within six months of going back to work they're off again
will they still be paid in arrears
still be paid monthly in arrears yes but they qualify from day one not you know four or thirteen weeks later or whatever it may be
it there a certain number of times that can happen or
no irrelevant
that can continue
that can continue so you could be off work for a couple of months go back if within six months you're off again claim go back if within six months you're off again claim go back
right
because it would be er re occurring UNK problem
but it's got to be the same problem
it's got to be the same or related so if it's something new then it will be a whole new claim
but if it's the same or related condition we're saying it's a continuation of the claim rather than stop and start again
but again there must be a loss of income because again there's the rule that you can't be better off by being off work sick
okay on that
re occurring disability
make sure you're aware of that okay for UNK levels for the client we've got three different levels of plan that they can choose from
if you relate it to perhaps to something like car insurance we've got third party third party fire and theft version and then a fully comp version
so there's a cheaper one a middle of the road and a one that's a little bit more expensive
but again you get what you pay for
looking at the level plan which is the basic one base plan and level plan what we're really saying there with that plan whatever you set it up for today
will never ever change unless you change it
so the client wants ten thousand pounds a year with sickness benefit and it costs you know twenty six pounds a month
UNK still be the same figures ten twenty thirty years down the line
unless you change it so whilst it may well represent you know a fair percentage of the client's salary today ten years down the line it's perhaps not gonna represent anywhere near the same percentage
mm
so it would lose pace with inflation
but again it's the cheapest plan and it's a plan that today could be better than having none at all
as far as the client's concerned
but it can be altered as time goes by if a client can afford extra premiums their salary allows them to have extra increases it can be altered but would UNK would possibly want medical UNK for any future increasing
okay so yes it can be altered but we would want more than likely the UNK to go with it
which might be a problem if the client's had ill health in the meantime
but not claimed
not the claim really wouldn't make much difference
right
whether they claimed or not is not gonna change our philosophy that wh w would need medical UNK anyway whether you claimed or not
okay so the level whatever you set up for today will still be that way unless you change it
the middle of the road third party fire and theft is what we call the increasing benefit plan
fully comp doesn't cover UNK cover by the way
so if you smash your glasses it's down to you so let's say we've set a plan up twelve thousand pounds per annum benefit a thousand pounds a month yes
erm all goes well for the first two years no real problems there the client is now had an accident an illness sickness or whatever now needs to claim on the policy
okay so from year two to three how much are they gonna get per month
a thousand pounds a month
a thousand pounds a month that's what we set the plan up for
okay year three to four it's going to increase by the rate of inflation over that year
so we get to the anniversary of the policy not the claim the policy i just UNK my illness with an anniversary but on the anniversary of the policy we'll look at the policy where inflation what's it done over the last twelve months let's say it's gone up by five per cent
so your next year's payments or monthly payments will now reflect that increase in the cost of living
makes sense
so you your policy could change within one month
that's right
i mean if your policy renewal date was december you're off in november you only get one payment at the old rate and the next one's at the UNK rate
right
exactly right well spotted
but it it's on the policy anniversary not the claim anniversary and that will keep happening providing the client is still off
yeah so if he's off again at the end of that year we look at inflation what's it done so it would now go up and it would now be let's say eleven hundred pounds a month
it's an insurability option in effect
in effect that's right
but only as long as the client is off sick
yeah
because what happens as soon as he's go goes back to work it goes back down again to what would be a thousand pounds for any future claims to start with again
so as soon as you stop claiming the policy UNK back to what it was initially
all happy on that
mm
so it's increasing benefit it only goes up whilst you're claiming by the r p i subject to a maximum ten per cent
so if we have galloping inflation of twelve fifteen per cent the most you would get is ten happy on that one
premiums for that will remain level throughout the contract
there will be no increase in premium even though you gonna get an increase in benefits
so it's a better plan than ever also the premiums for this will be higher than the level plan claim but again once they're set they wouldn't increase because your benefits are
sound good
i knew you'd be UNK
yeah not bad
right aren't you
okay so the premiums remain level but the cover potentially will go up on each anniversary whilst i'm off sick subject to the rate of inflation subject to the maximum overall of ten per cent
does that mean the maximum of ten per cent you wouldn't ever get more than the eleven hundred or
no maximum ten per cent in any one year
ten per cent in one year
so if i was off for two or three years then the rate of inflation was high then it would be ten per cent each those years
the fully comp the inflation proof plan let's say we've got a yearly increase of five per cent inflation is doing that throughout the policy
automatically it's staying hopefully if your UNK going up by the rate of inflation this will then be matching your salary year in year out
whether you're claiming or not
whether you're claiming or not
okay last one it only goes up when you are claiming this one goes up even when you're not
so you'll always know that if your UNK gone up by the same level whenever you claim it's gonna be the same percentage as it was today
so even if in ten years twenty years time i put a claim the money i get then will be the same seventy odd per cent of my salary as it would be today
yes make sense
can you increase it in excess of those amounts
there's erm the amount that the plan you have is driven by the client's salary
mm
you can have a percentage of the salary we'll look at in a minute
so it depends on whether your at maximum benefits or not UNK
and when can you do that can you do that at any time
you can increase at any time
if you're not at maximum already
so that is the UNK so wi with this as you say it's only on their second one erm the increasing benefit plan the benefits are only increasing when you're actually claiming
yes
and then once you've claimed it goes back to the original figure
goes back to what it was at the start
so i mean say in about three or four years time you you'd have the same level of cover
that's right
starting point as you've got today then
that's right even though your salary may well have gone up quite a bit more than that
yeah
but then again don't forget on that one premium is remaining level throughout the plan
of course yeah
this one the premium will go up each year to pay for the extra benefits
yeah so your premium will also be doing this
is that all linked
so the r p i there's no maximum on that is there
yeah ten per cent still
is there
benefits yes
but if the premiums went up
no you're still limited each year to a maximum ten per cent increase on the plan
right
so
so the cost of the premiums will altered as well
no well the cost of the premium is dependent
on two UNK two increasing factors
inflation
sorry
inflation
inflation is one of th or yeah not inflation itself but the premium will go up by a the new cost of the benefit what else would it take the new premium rate
no
yes two increasing factors the increasing benefit the UNK gonna go up each year that's gonna cost more money you're now a year older that's gonna cost more money
yeah
so that's in addition to the increase driven by the r p i
the r p i
no it's driven by the increase in r p i isn't it
this has gone up by r p i
yeah
that being the benefit
yeah
yeah because you've now got extra benefit you've now got to increase the premium
so it's i mean let's see you were getting a thousand pound a month you're now gonna get eleven hundred pounds a month
mm
whereas before it cost you twenty pound it's now gonna perhaps cost you twenty one pound
right
it's also got reflect your age so it might be twenty one pound fifty now
right
so at some stage those two lines could meet
erm
due to the age factor on it
er the age factor you could well overtake it
yeah
couldn't it you'll have i mean if you've got a client who's twenty thereabouts the percentage increase for the age is gonna be very low isn't
yeah
somebody who's perhaps forty fifty the percentage increase for the age could be a bit higher
there's the older you are the more it's gonna cost the more risk etc
whereas at a younger age the percentage increase for the age might be you know point one of a per cent
somebody sort of fifty five it might be two or three per cent or more
okay but you're buying more benefits therefore you got to pay for it more
effectively cost of benefit is increasing the r p i
yes well i don't want you to remember that because it's not
oh
no
so there
you never know
so what drives the premium what causes it to go up
benefit
the cost and benefit
the new level of benefit and the new age
yeah
so it's those two factors that would dictate the new premium
yes
mm
happy on that
so can you afford one
no
don't sound like it
just knocked up quickly an example here associate age thirty next birthday running a plan through till age sixty five in this career are you might be retired by then
let us write this down just for information
based on twelve thousand pound benefit for the thirteen week deferred period on the inflation proof plan so it's the best plan you're running it from for thirty years on a thousand pound a month guaranteed income if you're off sick or ill
how much would you pay for that if that were you if you were thirty looking for a thirty year plan guaranteed to keep in line with inflation thousand pounds a month
how much would you pay
about twenty quid
fifteen a month
about twelve pound
i've seen i've seen i've seen
ten UNK a week
ten pound a week
see me later
i'll buy it
nineteen pound twenty three per month
yeah i was close though
fiver a week
five pound a week
five pound a week protects two hundred and fifty pounds a week
question what would you do without your two hundred and fifty pounds a week
mm
not a lot on a fiver
would you could you afford to loose five pound to protect two hundred and fifty
yes
and that actually includes the policy fee as it was of two fifty five so if you take that out you're looking at sixteen pound eighty odd for sort of true cost of that cover
mm
four pound a week
there's a
indeed
and how UNK the
okay so it's not that expensive
again think of what you'd lose if you didn't have one
okay how much can i have that's the question now
UNK
we said earlier did we not that you cannot be better off financially by having claiming under the plan than you did at work
yeah
yes we've got to accept that fact so the benefits we get here are almost going to match your salary
almost
okay first thing we've got to derive we'll do a couple of examples let's have an employed client and self employed because when we start from UNK depending on whether employed or self employed
they're employed we start on their gross salary gross remuneration what makes up an employed person's gross package gross salary
basic
so you got salary basic salary give me a figure
twenty thousand
twenty
twenty thousand okay
what else might this twenty thousand pound UNK have that would be included in his gross package
benefits
benefits and a car
benefits in kind such as
don't know
could be a company car couldn't it
petrol
expense allowance
telephone
private health
health insurance
okay
whatever benefits there are could be UNK uniform whatever add those on top of the salary
let's say we get a figure of erm what three thousand pounds for that
is there a formula for that
yes there is
all on your tax card
sorry what's that last one you've listed down
p h i
b h i
oh p h i sorry yeah
just a moment
yes
will i be try to sell him that
so i didn't
there could scheme benefits within the company
mm
existing company scheme benefits
right yeah UNK up to that yeah
what does his income health insurance
okay so what we're saying we've now arrived at this person's gross salary
that's the figure we want to start from
happy
yeah
yeah
yeah
make sure you add those bits up because he can now really have benefits relating to his benefits in kind which you've forgotten is less money he's gonna get because he was off sick
yeah
okay
can he not still keep his company car though off sick
yes
so that doesn't matter
that's right
but he's now drawing sort of cash benefits because of it or extra cash benefits because of it
is that his bonus
self employed person we want to find their
n r e
n r e what's an n r e
net relevant earnings
net relevant earnings indeed
how do we arrive at that figure
income
gross profit
income less expenses
well if you're not doing any work
okay so let's say that this guy self employed UNK or whatever he's earned twenty five thousand pounds in income
what were his expenses
twenty four thousand
let's say is five so he's got
net relevant earnings of twenty thousand in this example on this and this is one or two situations
mm
where it's not good news to have a low net relevant earnings
mm
you can't have your cake and eat it
we start UNK p h i benefits on your n r e using your example he has only got one thousand a year
yeah
he's not gonna get a lot of sick benefit is he
yeah
what other situation would not help him
mortgage
mortgages
building societies traditionally lend three times your n r e
mm
you've got an n r e of five thousand here's your mortgage of fifteen what do you want live
and pension fund in it as well
second
pension contributions as well another one okay so employed we need to know their gross package self employed we need to work on their net relevant earnings
okay we arrived at those two
the first UNK that we've got to do for p h i benefits is take seventy five per cent of those two figures
so we want seventy five per cent of that
and that's company policy isn't it er
yes
in fact you'll find that's across the board with p h i
yeah
it's not a st a legal statutory thing is it
there is certainly inland revenue limitations in there
right so
is seventy five per cent of salary
so it's sixteen thousand
seventeen two fifty
seventeen two fifty
that's the first equation you must it this way cos any other way will not be accurate
but the first thing you must do once you know the figure take seventy five per cent of it if it's up to forty five thousand and obviously these are
if the client has a salary in excess of forty five thousand you still take the seventy five per cent off the forty five but you could then take a third of whatever is over that forty five
so if your client's salary was fifty thousand for example you'd have seventy five per cent of
sorry
forty five thousand and a third of the other five thousand
happy on that one so you get the higher earners forty five thousand and above whatever's over forty five you can take an extra third of that and add it to what seventy five per cent of forty five is
is there any upper limit
yes
fifty thousand
is it
UNK overall maximum benefit level of fifty thousand pounds so no plan
could be set up in excess of fifty thousand
at the outset
i've gone UNK
so that's er no plan will commence with more than fifty thousand okay what we've now got to take off from these two figures is if there any other permanent health insurance benefits the client's got with any other insurance companies
okay so they've other p h i benefit that must come off of the equation because we otherwise we'll be paying it as well as another insurance company which mean he'll be better off financially by being off work sick yes
that could be a short term accident policy that might pay
p h i
permanent
permanent health insurance that's not sickness and accident which would normally be one or two year contract
yes so
it's totally separate
yeah
okay
what we must then take off is the single person's state invalidity benefit
sorry something
two nine one seven is the this year's current state invalidity benefit single person's
fifty six ten times twenty two
do you no yeah do you always take the lower figure there cos it's a sliding scale isn't it
that right two UNK gone
yeah that's right yeah
yeah so you only ever take
three sorry
yeah from
yes that's what i was thinking
you only ever take that figure
all right then
end of story
am i right in saying cos yo you say obviously we've got to UNK er any other permanent health cover which might
yes
be provided by another insurance company
yes
erm but in that situation erm so i understand yo you'd actually erm
it hasn't UNK up here but i understand that in other cases where you've double insurance from two life companies that two life companies would split the actual benefit fifty so it wouldn't actually be UNK the whole amount would it because abbey life would still ha abbey life would still have to pay
if you found someone that who had you know full cover with us and full cover with someone else
yeah if they had exactly
the chances are we'd pay half each
half each yeah
yes so in which case the client's now got a whole premium split between two companies
two companies
which he's gonna get no benefit
yeah but the main thing is
so there's absolutely no benefit in trying to over insure
no
yourself or this sort of plan
no
cos you're not going to get it
no
happy with th the working out then
arriving at the full salary or net relevant earnings seventy five per cent of that okay if for over forty five thousand you take another third of that as well
that's the first equation
stage two take off any other p h i benefit
stage three take off the single person's state invalidity benefit
whatever the figure is left that's the amount the client can have a health master for
yes reasonably straightforward
so if i asked you to calculate one of your own you'd be able to do it yes
mm
so i'll rub this off
after a coffee break perhaps
yes
what a gentlemen
back here by twelve in fact if you want you can come back in earlier and
we'll talk about something in general if you wish
you've already done it
there's a lot of UNK and UNK going on did everyone have a late night last night
i don't know
i just trying to shake this flu that i feel coming on
went down the UNK last night first time in about three weeks
is it a train from here or is it a tube from here
tube
tube
mm
on this subject that we ought to carry on and
no i'll come to it
do you want to come to it alright
i'll come to it
sorry
ray would you care to start the meeting
okay yes okay meeting commenced with the production UNK of which there are no production UNK today
there are also no packaging UNK
er yesterday on non UNK most of my non UNK i think there are about five outstanding
er with the exception of one that from er which is relative to er UNK sand where
the computer
oh that one's been
sand in the bags instead of sharp sand
what's happened
have they been UNK
is that the er super five litre standard
that's correct yeah
no
no p what peter said was if it hasn't been picked up by the lab and it's an internal problem it can be dealt with internally
so as far as reducing stocks are concerned am i to reduce my figures by
no because the bags have already been you know on the back of the UNK plant time sheet you've already got that those bags have actually been wasted
so that has already been done
so really the non UNK was no need to be
there was no need cos it didn't turn
issued or raised
erm the stocks came off the bag stocks off
so according to peter we've no need to do a non UNK for such as this
when it can be dealt with internally within a couple of days
it's nice to see that it was action anyway and the rest of the
i agree with that
gone through despite
but there is actually some production shortage cos we want four hundred twenty five kilos
well according to UNK this morning that's where i got my information from she said there were no production UNK
from yesterday
but there's one today
we need four hundred er s h m load samples for but it's in s h m bags
we've only got two pallets
and they can't produce them
they can't produce some more tomorrow cos they're on tomorrow
check with rob
loaded today delivered tomorrow
so it's that doesn't UNK now see if we can put the lorry back or see if the
how long does it need to get it done
it won't be ready while tomorrow afternoon
be on stock duty did you say
well there's eighty on stock
we know it's eighty from the stock count but i don't know what the computer says
well we'll have a look that's the simple answer
so we're trying to rearrange the load like
cos it's ten tonne short on the lorry
did erm was mentioned yesterday because we didn't have any of this erm
UNK
UNK
in and that's coming in on friday and i asked jackie yesterday whether she could come in and talk to you she was trying to monday
no she's sorted it out
what she decided to do was produce monday which we agreed to put it in for monday and she would ask them UNK delivery
i was just wondering put that back to the same delivery
well this isn't going direct to er
so and it's part of the three drop load so
no UNK agreed that UNK the UNK goes out
is that lorry going out ten tonne short today then
yes ten tonne short
well i don't know yet we're trying to sort that one out we're trying to either put the load back or get another order to go with it
as i say w plus they're not gonna want that t today are they they're not gonna s they're not gonna use it in
no they're not gonna use it today
well they're not gonna be using it tomorrow when it gets there
but the other one of the is a nine o'clock delivery in the morning you see so the rest of the load must be there you see
the other two drops
yeah
there's obviously a ten tonne drop and two t five tonne drops on the lorry
but we tried this get round that
so do we know why we've got the shortage is it because th
it hasn't been picked up you see has it
production well no
it hasn't been picked up on unless the computer says there's a UNK it may be
yeah there's sufficient stock and that's why it hasn't been picked up
the UNK telling them it's in stock
which suggests we've got a stock problem again then
well when the from UNK stock take anyhow i don't think
well they've been put in now
they've put in now
who's doing production planning at the moment
peter from home apparently
okay
that's it from me
okay
lines one and two well lines one we're having a problem erm with some of the bags
alan come to me yesterday afternoon er and they said the rubber UNK was missing of the end of the UNK that picks the bag up
we put them on and apparently it's making no difference
er i haven't alan this morning to discuss it with him but i will see him
alan's just gone out there actually UNK to have a look
has he
yeah
right
erm tomorrow at nine o'clock i've got coming in to do this UNK drain
i arranged with dick that w bill would be with him for two and a half hours
but having seen bill this morning jack is gonna
no
it's all been UNK
no we've UNK that one
right one's going
oh
no problem you can have him
bill doesn't know yet
we haven't even told brian and bill yet
well that's what i'm saying
but he's arranged
bill bill's coming to me and saying he can't do that
no
it was arranged yesterday and we haven't got round to telling everybody yet
we i agreed with dick well we both agreed that bill would be with you and we'd sort out jack
so we haven't seen anybody yet
we'd previous arranged this for bill to go
then when you asked me if you could have bill for thursday morning
we UNK it
then we had to rearrange it
yeah well it was supposed to be done yesterday wasn't it then jack couldn't
no the car wasn't running
that's right
well yes see so jack we didn't know that's right
no it's all been done
still got bill as previously arranged but we had to find somebody else for jack
cos jack UNK the day we didn't
right
is this the oil out of the drain
yeah
did they did a test on that and they can
yeah they're gonna clean it all out and bring the erm er water erm they're gonna UNK
is that gonna be is that gonna be a recurring problem
or has it been a build up over a ye number of years
this is the first time we've had to do this UNK cos i didn't even know it was in and i don't think dick did
i never knew it was there anyway
been here ten years so
this is the first time this UNK arisen
yeah
yeah
but we still always get problems with drains because of the state of the yard and what materials we've got in the yard
yeah
you know
on the state of the yard did you speak to er lynne
yeah and they they're coming back with the three separate quotes
okay
so erm we should well mick said he'll give me this week anyway
so as soon as i get i'll let you know
erm that's as much as i've got this morning
are you happy with are you
well i am
up to a point because now we've got the go ahead for the new chiller which is ordered erm that's only getting rid of part of the problem
erm because the old plates and the water UNK and UNK in the machine and the UNK still let stuff in
so we don't when he was here last week doing some er alterations on it to go through what he'll actually want to make it all new all the way through
so done it that's got rid of that problem
er and i'll price it all up so another two hundred and sixty quid
sorry what's two what's two hundred and sixty quid
these parts to go on the machine
there's a UNK where the water flows through to cool the bars
yeah
now
they're all UNK up are they or something
they're all UNK up
er you clean 'em out but then again you get it back so
is it lime scale or something
well it is and it it's like UNK and that that's coming out the bottom of the erm tank the water tank
it's dust it's dust
but saying we've got that problem now we've got the problem with that so we're gonna change one part which is the chiller
yes
so alright we're gonna filter the water that goes into that but the stuff inside the pipes and inside the little UNK that through the cooling bars are still got stuff in
well is isn't there isn't there erm c
and the UNK are in there there's a s there's UNK sets in there they've all got it all in
can't you close it through or something or can't you put anything in it that would
well
de scale it
i don't know how you do UNK and that there and it's everything it's a con you know we ought to have kept some and shown you because it is it is i've never seen anything like it myself
it UNK everything up
anyway s to cut a long story short i had a word with stuart to see what it'd cost
he said well we ought to do it
is the two hundred and sixty quid
yeah
and does that resolve the problem
that's new chiller all where your UNK and UNK be clear
does that resolve the problem though
well yes
or are you saying it's UNK the problem today and next month it's gonna be as bad again
no because what we're what we're gonna do now which we haven't got now we're gonna have a sealed tank where no dust can get into it
right
the UNK a sealed unit isn't it
yeah
and it's got the tank in the bottom
and the UNK to that into the machine is gonna have a UNK filter in
so you're UNK it before it goes in the machine and still we're saying why don't we filter it as it comes out the machine before it goes back in the tank
yes
cos you're circulating the water round
right
and it UNK it
and this is what i'm going into
but i mean
it's only say two hundred and sixty quid add it on to the chiller thing
yeah but the point is this
i said that's alright but when you find out what wanted to er to do he said it'd take two days
and i said well we can't two days
so i've been in touch with brian again erm and i said can't you make sure that your blokes can do it in a day
cos i've had a word with them
there's nothing we can do ourselves then it's got to be done by
well we can we can but as i said the two lads who know about it who could do it they said well it might take us two days
then they says anything technical that they don't know about you've got to bring back in
have you got the labour costs on top of that at as well
yeah that's what i'm saying it's gonna take that's that the it's gonna take two days
plus the lost production time
yeah plus lost production
but i said to brian if we can have it say for a saturday and make sure you do it in one day
so coming back to me on that
but you don't i mean you're gonna production anyway by putting the chiller in presumably aren't you
no
no
well you are ten minutes
oh
that's what er
is it because of our hard water in this area do you think or would that machine have been the same anywhere in the country
well if you
no at the moment it's UNK the tank the water tank isn't sealed it's drawing a lot of dust in er we've tried putting a cover over it and everything else and that's what's causing the UNK
as well as the UNK
it's UNK and UNK at the same time
but if you're putting a ch if you're putting this chiller in and don't do the other part
hello
where it all UNK
isn't the UNK gonna go through your new chiller
ah no
the actual UNK that's in there is in the chiller it's in the bottom of the water tank where we're drawing the water from that goes through the cooling system
but that goes through that goes to chiller won't it
that water will go through the chiller
yeah
won't it be pulling up some of that UNK through the chiller and if we don't
that is what's happening now but what i'm saying is put a new chiller in
yeah
that's got rid of the UNK in the tank and everything you put in a complete sealed unit on
okay
but we're not saying is the pipe work and the little UNK if you see the machine you'll understand more
okay
but there is little er flows in the in this pipe work and everything
see you've got to get rid of all that because at the back of your mind you're still saying well i've spent a lot of money still only done part of the job
what is this come to light after the event as it were or did you know that was there when we were UNK the machine
they've known they've known about this for a fair while
well why wasn't this why wasn't this done when we were UNK the machine for goodness sake
it should have been because i put in
it was giving the back
i mean it could have been done if we'd got a go ahead
but nobody come back and give us the go ahead to do it
so you're saying that er this additional two hundred and sixty quid for d replacing those pipes was a separate
no but we're saying that the chiller should have been put on wh
but you've got your chiller but y did you know those pipes were a problem before when you
no y no nobody's thought of it until i stood there and watched it and i says to george the operator i says right we're gonna put a new chiller on here
now we should get rid of the problem but what about the UNK in there
he says well really he says you it could do to be changed
so
and then we had because we got problem on the UNK again
yeah
last week
we got man in and he started clearing it all again
i said when we get a new er new chiller on there that will cut that out
he says yeah but he says you'll still have stuff in these pipes somewhere he said you can blow them out you can do what you like but he said you'll find out you'll get some in
so what's cost of
what's today's cost
today's cost for a fitter
i don't know i don't know this is why i'm waiting for brian to come back
i know what i know what it's cost us for that weekend
yeah what was it costing us for that weekend
it's cost us three and a half thousand pound
of labour
yeah
for one man
two men
hello
some people over charge don't they
three and a half thousand pound for two men for a weekend
yeah
i'll give you a ring
yeah it was all time and a half double time
three and a half thousand pound
for two men for two days
yes
and the chiller and the UNK and everything should all have been done all at the same time
can we send somebody away to and do a course
and then hire him out at weekends
yeah sure
i've got arthur on for you UNK
took out
good morning
it used to get in
yeah
how long have we had that machine
three years
three years
and want to buy one
can't we sell them ours and put in a new one
yeah can't we have a
they're here tomorrow we're gonna treat them and we're gonna suggest
well i certainly am
with a weight UNK next time not a UNK
exactly
that's what we're saying whoever's
yeah
if you have a UNK you've also got to have some sort of weight checks with it haven't you
you can't tell the weight through the volume can you
yeah
it was there could be
yeah
er a weight
yeah
thing added onto it
but it was something like couldn't afford two thousand pounds
that much
and all the hassle
well we laughed at the time didn't we
yeah
not just this place is there
not just this place to look after really
so that's gonna cost another grand then isn't it
it's gonna be eight hundred odd quid for nine hundred pounds for
i can't remember what i can't remember what they charge it is on that bill what they charge for a saturday
it is on that bill and i think it's something like thirty pounds
i've got it down on my desk somewhere
the bill
well i mean it's going to sort of s start shooting up to round about a thousand pound then you'll have to have a word with tom
well that's i was intending to have a word with tom about it
well do that
because it is it's a lot of money
it's a lot of money
okay
but what i say to do is buy a new chiller and get it on and then all summer we'll get this damn problem again
well yes you're just throwing money away aren't you
that's right
yeah
yeah
but i say it should've been it should've been all d i mean everybody's known about this chiller for a long while and it's as i say i mean when was here it was costing a thousand pound a time
mm
to clear all the UNK and that out
you see and it's alright to buy a new chiller it's only half the problem
but i mean if it was costing this sort of money to clear the pipes and so forth out what i fail to understand is if we're having a full UNK of the machine why this wasn't incorporated within it
well yeah
i agree with you
i mean
but it should have it should have been brought
paul introduced a total system there for er maintenance on that machine on a daily weekly and monthly basis
because the machine was so busy just after the time he introduced it the line was never available to do all the checks that were on that and it and UNK got them in a file there
i've got them as well
you've got a file of them
of everything they had to check
and the UNK was one
yeah
and cleaning the UNK was one of the checks
yeah it's yeah
yeah
sorry but it was
but you see this is not the first chiller is it
we've had another UNK you see it's always been the same kind of chiller
yeah but they've been open UNK as opposed to closed UNK before haven't they
the wh the whole point is steve when it comes down to basic facts it should have had a proper sealed unit chiller on it when it was new
where you wouldn't have had any of this problem
this is a case of UNK a wonderful thing
but it was so costly so they said they'd get a second hand one
but i mean the UNK how much was the chiller
two thousand something
two thousand a hundred and fifty pounds
well relative to the price of the machine it's hardly costly is it
yeah but it's been in what
two and a half years now
i mean they knew they knew about the chiller at time cos i think said
anyway you've got your chiller let's price the pipes and let's go on alright
well i've got the price of the pipes it's just the labour
the labour because erm i can't see any point in doing half a job
no
okay
anything else UNK
no th that's all
eric
we've talked
hello
yeah morning
just to remind everyone that er it is the er property insurance inspector's visit today
alright stuart cheers
do we know what time eric
i've no idea at all
i i'll go in i the only information i've got is stuart came into the meeting monday and give us half an hour talk on it
it's the only information i've got
insurance
stuart will ring and let you know he said this morning
he'll let you know when coming round
coming round today isn't he
yes
he's got he's got about two or three visitors today
yes he's ta taking round some japanese investors
is the er is the yard in a good state
the UNK quite good
yeah we did we organize a UNK for today
no
no
you what
no UNK today
no never said UNK to me about
no we didn't know there was a visit there w only this
i only found out about the japanese this morning
oh i didn't know about it but i mean the
we we've had guys out and we've cleaned up some
yeah it's just a little bit UNK that's all
unfortunately
it's a working yard i mean
yeah i mean
yeah i mean we haven't done anything extra special but it is neat
it is neat
and it's tidy
it's tidy
yeah
it's tidy
and people are aware of the insurance inspector coming round
yeah
and you're working on that UNK wrap er areas aren't you saw them there yesterday
yeah
the only other thing is that er i was
we are due for another service and it's this month the yearly service
that they are all up to date and er i'll just do a final check up after the meeting
make sure nobody's let one off and i don't know about it which often happens
and can you ring stuart please when you've finished in this meeting
yeah
mm
er yeah just one other thing pete going through the accident book there's one or two that are coming up with people on the UNK line getting UNK of liquid in their eyes
and one of them has had a day off
which was UNK in the eye and she went to hospital to have her eye UNK and all that
and there was another one as well
is there any possibility they could wear glasses on that line
i know i've asked before
the glasses are in number four they've all been provided but they just whether they don't know that they're there
i will ensure that everyone who's working on that line is issued with a pair of safety glasses
i don't mean UNK i mean just the glasses with the side pieces
yeah we got them
we got twenty didn't we
i will make sure that everybody's issued with them
thank you very much
that's all from me
dick
twenty seven lorries today then pete and i went down to two o'clock on monday
s to see what had been done over there
and really had a good clean up
it was really good
was it
it was four pallets which had fell over near the door which we're gonna get UNK up we'll get those UNK up in time
there's a lot of there in bulk which we're gonna get out on friday
so you can
bulk
bulk
so are
we've got one load of bulk
yeah and
that they're gonna load it the lorries arranged
i've talked to arthur about it he's agreed we can put it on pallets
because at the
has he
end of the day we
you're UNK and the containers
we're gonna UNK containers
isn't that gonna is that gonna slow up the UNK of the containers considerably
it is no it isn't now because w pete said they could have seven people out there so if they get seven people out there
yeah
you've got two UNK so we can have
it does it makes far more sense
we can actually i mean if
these UNK these twenty UNK come we can actually discharge from either end
yeah
straight onto a UNK it wrap it UNK it put it in stack it three high
well i have to pose the question then do we want the
well i'm not sure about the three high yet
well
the UNK that UNK got ordered
well that's alright we need it we shall need it for the
we need it anyway
for the forty UNK anyway
we shall need it for the forty UNK
okay
but we can UNK three men on each and one UNK lift driver
right
b we're going out at ten to have a look at it again to test see how high that UNK lift
will reach
will reach
cos i don't think it'll reach three pallets high
well mark can operate that thing anyway
yeah that's fine
yeah well that's why i asked his
so we're going out well after the meeting to sort that one out we'll try it in there
er
oh it would it would make life so much easier for getting that stuff out later won't it UNK it
yes
well it will
but you don't do you hav UNK will have you got to UNK wrap it at all or will it hold will it will it just sit right on the pallets without falling off
UNK wrap it
you'll have to UNK wrap it won't you
yeah
i mean you won't want much but i mean just to hold it
just to hold it on
yeah
yeah
yeah
so it's now we've got seven people it's gonna make it a lot easier for the first twenty containers which is forty containers in actual fact isn't it
but
we need
back to back
yeah
so we that's going to sort that problem co s we can
forty containers back to back
there's twenty containers
yes
but there's forty boxes isn't there there's forty actual UNK isn't there
cos there's
there's twenty UNK forty containers isn't it
twenty back to back
there's twenty UNK forty
no there's not there's twenty containers
there's twenty foot containers
so it's only ten
it's ten lorries twenty foot containers
oh well that's alright
oh well that's fine that's even better
yeah that's even better but then we're on to the forty UNK so that's even better
yeah
yeah
with you saying twenty i thought there'd be twenty lorries with
so it's only no it's twenty foot containers
oh well that's even better still
erm we'll need to UNK separately the wages on that cost lynne because we'll need to add it to the
no problem
stock value
yeah
otherwise UNK jump up and down like a UNK rabbit
and can we erm hire a UNK
if you need to hire a UNK
we need to hire a UNK it's about a hundred and seventy quid for the week
for the week
yeah okay
that okay can i go ahead
yeah make sure that's added to the UNK to the stock value
but it it'll actually reduce costs later because later on it's just a matter of
calling it in
calling it in
yeah
yeah that's good
seven thousand cubic metres of the damn stuff up at er area
how much
seven thousand one hundred and sixty three cubic metres
can it be mixed with half peat so that it goes to er
so this has all been arranged for friday
have you any idea when the containers are coming in yet
erm
cos the chap norman says he's given a contact there
yeah
for the chap to ring me but he hasn't rung me yet
well you ring him then if you like
yeah
it's erm george
oh i've got his name
yeah
i've got a i've got his name and
yeah
lawrence anyway
that's right yeah
er
i mean the UNK due to come in on friday he UNK it'll get it's the fourth on friday isn't it
the docks on friday
they're due into the docks on into the docks on friday they're due to get customs clearance sort of pretty well immediately apparently and the speed at which they're gonna load these containers is quite UNK
they don't really expect any er any delay erm and they're expecting to start shipping up here on the monday
what i don't know is when on the monday
so you know really you want to tie that up with lawrence
yeah
because you don't want guys out there from eight o'clock in the morning
no
standing around at three o'clock in the afternoon
that's right
waiting for a UNK lorry to turn up
well yeah i don't want to send them
i think we're gonna struggle with the three in a day on the twenty foot
we maybe okay
three lorries a day
yes
mm well it's six containers
yes
norman doesn't think we're gonna do three a day
we
well as long as you as long as you've got the twenty cleared in the week
five days i don't mind
you see wh ideally i'd like to try one to see how gonna take like you know
well why don't you get two for the first day and then and then they're not
well we can get we'll have two
well h we'll have two a day i think that's if you say we can great i mean
oh yeah i mean i'm saying two a day but erm if you can get three a day i'd prefer it because
oh yeah
obviously it's gonna reduce the time of the er
but if i order two
of the of the cost of the guys
that's right
seven guys
yeah
i mean i don't want to enhance the cost of that any more than i have to
no
no
well no but i mean if we limit it to two for the first day and a i mean i shall know by eleven o'clock
it makes far more sense to do two for the first day then you can judge how many you can get through in a day from those two
because
if you have three
charging on you gonna cost an arm and a leg like that's why i was saying that you know we don't want too much to start with
no
er will the forty UNK can they is there a time between 'em or can we just carry straight on with it
no you can't the forty UNK haven't even the we've got a huge problem in sri UNK
the are playing silly buggers
we've paid them for fifty percent of the f o b costs er because they said unless you pay us we won't load
so we paid them it cleared our bank last week and they're still refusing to move the product we don't know why
so it's still sitting in a
i see
still sitting in a
so be quite a time before
it's still sitting in UNK in sri UNK
mm
so
i mean it's gonna i think it's gonna be quite a time delay
well at least we can plan it for the week then
i least we know we're gonna clear the first lot in a week then now don't we
yes yeah
on friday w would it be a good idea cos i don't know what time the UNK but i mean it would be really best if we could set things up
wouldn't it on friday
you'll have to talk to stuart because you've got the hire on a week by week basis
now whether they'll deliver on a friday and not count that as a delivery day i don't know
aye it's yeah it's well i don't know but i think it's it is definitely coming on friday
is it
yeah cos i
i left it with stuart to arrange all that but maybe he's got the hire from friday to friday
people generator was on to me the other day cos we i insisted that it's got two three phase UNK on
but the point is what i'm saying is if we could get that stuff there on friday afternoon and get the UNK set to where you want 'em because i don't know what leads you want the lorry got there on monday morning wants UNK and we're flying about for damn leads we we're gonna be in trouble
well yeah but the beauty is now UNK agreed to let us put it on pallets we can start UNK the containers without the UNK
ah
can't we
these are UNK you're putting on aren't they
white forty UNK yeah
yeah
yeah he says but he didn't want to buy er five by fours
and the thing is we were buying forty UNK we that we were u UNK for the plant when we need 'em
yeah that's okay
er
right
but e so the UNK going on the line on friday afternoon
yeah
at two o'clock
yeah is that one from here
that one from here
yeah
the UNK going in at two o'clock
yeah
so's he can the UNK to get rid of
yeah
if we take some diesel down when we go
yeah
providing we can find some twenty five litre UNK
yeah
so that's the diesel
yeah
well you see the generator will come on a lorry with
so really when he well it obviously wants to be in the place where you want it
yeah
you know
that's what i'm saying you know you've really got to say well the generator can be there
cos once he drops it
yeah
is
well it'd be better really for friday afternoon
mm
i mean really i mean i can't see that before monday
yeah i'll have a word with UNK but i mean he's gonna be that busy today
if he's setting it up if they're not bringing while friday and they set it up give you time to set it up
mm
mm
but we can start working out there on monday morning
without the UNK
without the UNK without the
the generator
generator
can i ask a question
erm this is two isn't it
one
one
two is er
manufacture
they're storage of diesel do they have storage of diesel there
well they've got lorries haven't they i don't know why they have got lorries
hang on that's not
we'd better have gas oil
to take containers from here and leave the containers there
i think that you should have a small amount just what you're using on the day
hello
and fetch it from if al if we're allowed to do that
no just a sec who is it vernon
just a sec
it's vernon
i'll look at the safety aspect
well it's not all that UNK gas oil isn't is it
hello
no
not diesel
be nice to get it from rather than take it from here that's what i was thinking
what i don't see any difference in it actually
cos we've still got to put it in UNK to take it from to one
mm well yeah what is it is it on this UNK
i'll make a note that you mentioned it anyway
er the
i did work for a petrol company
is the er is the space that's gonna be taken up by UNK
yeah
much greater than it would otherwise be if you
yeah
free UNK it
well it all UNK if we can get it three high
yeah i mean there's no UNK on us is there
this UNK three pallets high lifting
er well if it's if it's possible yeah but if it's on your you'll have to UNK your battery
that's why 's going up today
something about the space availability
as long as there's no UNK
erm you'll be surprised
okay
there's a lot of space there is there
there is a lot of space
all the packaging and the gateway stuff and all that
the gateway we're still in the far left hand corner cos he's said he'll move that over the other side
okay
he knows it's got to be kept separate from the other
okay
and then what about the remainder of the old because there's about four thousand cubic metres of that
is the intention to UNK that or to leave it as it is
well erm we'll leave that as it is
leave it as it is
now
but what we could do of course is we put in a time between containers we could always use them to re UNK it
UNK it
yes you could that's a good idea
yeah i mean so as they're not stood there doing nothing
yeah that's an excellent idea
this is the idea wh asked peter mark cos you know and he can control people you know
one of the main concerns that vernon had was the mess that was caused by throwing his words the UNK down and they were breaking open
mhm
erm has that how are we going to address that problem in the future
well we can't because they're that high
you can't
so it's still going to create a mess
it's still gonna create a mess
the pile that's there there's gonna be a certain amount of mess that comes of it
so if he's got that place in a good state it's UNK on us
to keep it
to keep it that way
yes
the area where he's cleared
yes
yes
yeah
i got this clear but you've UNK it up again
no i mean we're actually getting the area just inside the door where there's some quite UNK amount
alright we're actually getting that sorted out straight away and we're gonna sort of step it back if you like
okay
initially
we're gonna make it safe cos when you're the door you can actually walk in the door and get UNK with a lot of UNK i feel so we're gonna make that safe
but by starting at the other end
mm
we're gonna leave it nice and tidy pallets
okay
but it doesn't solve the problem at the other end
no
so anything we're doing now
is for the future
i rang yesterday i said well look we've got the okay to UNK it now and he's quite happy about that
okay
and it UNK the problem once and for all
it does yeah
okay
so everything's going really according to plan
er racking damage UNK who in bay one and two came to me this morning and said the racking that he checks it every morning when he comes at six or wh six seven whenever he starts
he said one of the UNK had been hit and UNK
of the new racking
one of the new racking
now it's pretty obvious one side the fo a UNK has tried to put a UNK in between two and UNK the UNK next to it and it's the UNK dropped down into the racking
right
then he's tried from the other side and he's done the same from the other side
that by putting it in the middle of the other side he UNK the UNK again the opposite side and that also went down in between the UNK and dropped on the UNK below it
fortunately they're both part pallets so they
but when he's put the pallets in the centre of the beam one either side he's hit the racking beam and it's UNK
now nobody's done it now we've got two people in our area and one packing line so i suggest we get them three together now and sort it out as to who done it and if they haven't done it and then wait while the three o'clock UNK comes on see if he's done it
mm
cos there's only four people working there
this is er UNK is it
it's
pardon
that is UNK that's caused this
i mean c can that sort of thing happen by accident or is it just UNK
i could happen by accident pure accident
certainly
but what i'm saying nobody's a
nobody's owned up to it
nobody's owned up to it
so we well all i suggest is we get the three together after the meeting john and our two men and say well look who's done it and if they haven't see the other man when he comes on
as far as the racking UNK concerned has it erm affected the stability of the racking or has it just UNK it i mean is do we need to do anything about it
the UNK have to come out
the UNK have to be changed without a doubt
and what we don't know yet if the back UNK alright
i think the back UNK be alright
he must've UNK it fairly hard to caused that sort of damage
it wouldn't take a very big hit with the mass of a UNK to UNK it in actual fact
wouldn't it
no
is that sort of thing presumably we've got to get the racking people back in to do that have we
well we can change it
we can change it
no we can change them
we
do we have spare racking UNK
no we've got five spare UNK though by changing the design the layout we've got five spare UNK out of the
but it's a horizontal beam you want
but it's the horizontal beam we want
UNK law innit
UNK law
the horizontal beam cost so much
swap for one of your spare UNK
no but
i though of ringing paul today to ask him about what he was gonna do with this other racking
er there's a chap coming to see me tomorrow
oh fine
er a local chap was rung me up yesterday well rang me up
mm
i said no we haven't got any scrap racking
but he put me in touch with a chap who was interested in buying it
so i rang paul and er he's coming up tomorrow he would have come in today had to go to but he's coming in the morning to look at it
fine
it's the same chap as put the racking in the room
oh from er
yeah
knows you quite well
well apparently peter
yeah pete
pete
and he says i understand you've put some new racking in
why didn't steve ring me and tell me he was putting some
i said i don't suppose steve knew at the time
so he said
i don't want to know that he says
eh
i don't want to know that
but he's interested in buying the old racking
is he
but he's not
i thought pete had retired actually mind you sons isn't it
anyway
yes
nothing to do with me
yeah that was all i had to report thank you
thank you peter
we have had a problem for a long period of time now on high UNK
yeah
now contrary to what we'd been informed erm the problem occurred over the last couple of days and having spoken to the ladies in the laboratory the problem hasn't been purely on line five machine
it has been occurring on lines one two and the machine
and it is an ongoing problem
now in the absence of dr and anybody else yesterday er myself ian nick er and one of the lab girls got together we UNK all sorts of different er ways and means of getting round the high UNK that was occurring er vis a vis a multi purpose mix
that was the one that you had the problem with last week wasn't it
yes
it's always appears to be that's the one that's brought to our attention
now whether it's a h because it's a er a home name brand erm and it's not a standard it is brought to our attention there may be something there
we went round various different avenues and to i asked ian and nick to actually change the UNK and decrease the amount of nutrients that were put in a mix
we did that mixed it up
sorry did you get did you get chris 's approval
no i didn't no i didn't
i did a two metre batch
oh okay
okay
a minimal amount
because i couldn't er i mean chris was one minute he was on the phone the next minute you couldn't get hold of him
yeah
but we had to do something
i did this and the actual UNK reading come out at one thousand
now the minimum is supposed to be eight hundred the maximum is supposed to be twelve hundred
and i thought a thousand was a good mean average between them
erm but obviously that was only a two metre mix
i then asked rather than erm wait for er dr to come back er we changed onto a different product which didn't involve UNK but before doing that i asked for ten pallets of to be run off with the UNK mix reduced from two k gs per metre to one point five k gs per metre
and see how that UNK out
and i've had the lab results this morning and they're still high
the UNK is still high
not as high as they have been but they range from thirteen eighty five to fourteen forty
isn't something to do with the with the way it's mixed isn't chris talking about no
erm if we knew the answer and this problem has been going on for nine months
er but it was
an area that we hadn't attempted before
okay we hadn't attempted reducing the UNK
thin ground i think you're on dangerous grounds UNK the UNK aren't you without
yes of co of course i was but i couldn't get hold of dr and i thought well we're gonna have to try it this way anyway at some stage
so
so you've done ten pallets what's happening with that ten UNK
well as soon as we get hold of dr i am sure he will he will clear it as being okay on the UNK readings
okay there's no problem there
or there is a problem because they're slightly high
but not as high as some we have
by the sa at the same time i obtained the lab UNK for the last year
now just going on products off the UNK plant for the last six months i've gone through i've taken i've noted down the number of samples taken each month by month
the total UNK readings for those samples for that month
and divided it by the number of samples taken to give us a mean average
erm and it there's actually a pattern emerging er from october whereby the UNK reading is going higher and higher and higher
erm and then UNK it out over that six seven months
now i'm gonna discuss it with dr who i spoke to y when i spoke to him yesterday assured me he would be in today
er and also tom
so what was the mean average of the UNK from october
october was one thousand one hundred and forty six which is quite near
yeah
to the border line
november was one thousand one hundred and two december was one thousand and eighty seven and january was one thousand two hundred and eighty two
now if we go back to july it was nine hundred and nine
august was nine hundred and ninety one september was nine hundred and seventy six
so it appears that it's increased
is there anything that's fundamental changed with i mean we're using exactly the same UNK
we're using the same UNK
same process
well as far as i'm aware we're using the UNK yes
same process
same process
same raw material suppliers
yes
yes
in erm december in fact we went on to what had happened was early last year the nutrients were changed
yeah
now we'd never had a problem before with high UNK
erm so we asked and asked and asked could we change back to the old nutrients which we did do in the early part of december and lo and behold suddenly there wasn't a problem
everything was being passed
have we gone back to
but it's now going ba no we're still on the trial nutrients
the or
the original old ones
the original nutrients
the original old ones
yes
the original old ones we're still on those but it's
you're still using those but your UNK still going up
yeah
it's still going up again
so that really
have you got any readings from january last year
yes
what was january last year like
er i couldn't tell you off the top of me head i because i was working on it till half past midnight
it's nothing to do nothing to do with the UNK conditions is it
it could be
it seems funny because we reckon when it UNK it's it makes a difference
but when i spoke to dr last week i mean he just held his hands up and said i don't know
okay
what do you want brian
you don't want any white rolls do you
no i want to plug something in there
anyway seeing about that steve
i'm seeing chris about that today but in the absence i did clear it with arthur what i was going to do
oh okay
alright
i explained to him exactly what i was going to do and he said okay
yeah
alright but just this once
okay
erm yes i know i was UNK on dodgy ground but we've got to do something
but it's been so long
okay just that i think if you'd done it on your own
oh no
then i think that might have been
no but it i mean it's just been so long it i said to him can i do this trial and he said and i explained everything about it and he said yes try it
what do we do with all this stuff that's got UNK high UNK i mean is it being what's happening to it
well nine times out of ten we re sample it and it's allowed to go out
but there are occasions when we've had to rip and tip but it's causing a problem
most of it has been
cos we've got thirty five pallets down at street which then has to be
re UNK and it has to be UNK and
but if it's rubbish it's storage for dick it's taking up
once you start pulling pallets to pieces and then you've got to replace the pack what you've t taken off and UNK it again and
hopefully today we'll get an answer because the first eleven samples it said that the UNK up and down up and down
because you you've got something else that's erm each pack is six by five litres
how many packs there are on there
forty two
forty two yeah
forty two packs of six by five litres you go across you take a sample out of a bag and if it's low it's okay if it's high they scrap the UNK
what UNK me is i went into the lab and i said to sharon you know er i said we've still got
well i thought what we UNK what we would have done four fi four five years ago like i mean that would have been stopped and UNK
okay
he's letting all sorts go through at the moment
erm
mainly because when we UNK it again you see through whatever reason you see it's
a lot of times a lot of times it goes back to normal
goes okay
the UNK doesn't stay at a certain level then
well
well it appears to UNK
yeah but eric took one bag and took how many four different samples and got four different readings out of one bag
how can you do that
it's got absolutely nothing to do with the with the erm with the peat
let me say that because we've done a trial with wet peat we did a trial with dry peat
wet and dry exactly the same yeah identical
okay seeing dr
okay and just one th i don't know who's responsible for the area by the washing hose
outside the packing store
just there a in the packing store
the hose is well i mean i somebody could fall over it it's by a fire exit door
somebody could fall over it
er i don't know who's responsible for the area if nobody is i'll get somebody to tidy it up
well yeah it's a it is a yard area
well it's actually inside and
but it's a by a fire exit so and i would assume they're gonna be looking at it anyway
just need to get it sorted
lynne brought it to my attention
well it is it's actually inside that door
i was checking the UNK the insurance man and the fire UNK there and the hose is on the floor like that
it's not outside
no it's inside
it's inside
it's inside the packing door
so this is this is
yeah
we better get it cleared before this lot
we need a UNK or a hook on the wall for them to put the
yeah but at the minute it just comes out the way of the door
the reason why it's inside cos of frost that's why it's inside
yes
but you see the people they just drag it down they don't put it back
mad
and now we've made it a fire door it's made it worse
that's all from me
thank you steve
no
erm dick i walked round the site on friday with er paul and s paul and stuart because paul has been i don't necessarily think this for you i don't know why i said dick then
to everybody i walked round the site with paul and stuart last friday because paul had been UNK to me about erm twenty five k g UNK and the fact that they weren't they weren't properly packed as it were
and i said okay look if i'm gonna say something to anybody i want to have a look show me what you're talking about
so we went to the sixty six shop and i said what's wrong with that UNK beautiful
and we actually then went down and we looked all over the place and there are quite a number of pallets that in fact are not properly UNK
now er they're all hand i take it those twenty fives are they
twenty five k gs
yeah when they're UNK the when they're UNK the UNK yeah
erm
and then we pick from them
you pick from them
the problem would appear to be on people like d k who are the main UNK that unless it's dead square they're complaining about it
that's right
and they're saying they are saying that we're only ones they get pallets like that from
now if you do walk around you'll see that there are quite a number of pallets that you could argue are not well not well UNK on the on the UNK
mm
do is there is there anything we can do about this
yeah well what we do i all d k is double wrapped
we select the pallets then
do you
they must be uniform
they mustn't be out of the UNK of the UNK
we go to no end of trouble to
d k i mean the fee
and it's all the loads have to be signed by UNK and or to say
okay so you do bend over backwards for d k
we do bend over backwards for d k
and what's concerning me about the d k i think we brought it up UNK yesterday it was
yeah
about when they get a load of in
yes
i always insisted it went from
yes
now it's going from er
yes
they're UNK isn't as good as what was
and the UNK certainly isn't which UNK taken up with them anyway
well we're gonna get complaints from d k again if that's the case aren't we
we are
but er we don't send the out of there
you don't send it out of
i think a lot of our problems is caused by outside satellite locations cos we never have any control over what
i think if we if we if we did actually look around long and hard rather than UNK at what we've got out in the yard then it's ever so easy to criticize
i mean it's the world
oh well yes it is
i do think if er if we it strikes me i forgotten what the new guy's name is you've got in charge of the yard what's his name
brian
brian he strikes me as being a guy that will look will do things and will probably get that yard in a good state
we will but it'll take him another probably another three weeks but it's he's getting there
he knows which way he's going
alright all i all i'd ask is that would you erm just mention to him what i've said and that if he believes after discussion with you that there are some pallets which are not in a fit state to send out and they are gonna tip over on a lorry and UNK then they are rejected and pete knows about it and they are they are actually isolated and UNK
i'd rather spend money doing that before they go out than send them out and the bloody things to have to come back again
in fact it wasn't long before it wasn't long before christmas was it we actually got together and i wrote a memo that if there is anything erm before it leaves the plant if the tractor driver or whatever e doesn't like it and it's not acceptable then it goes back to the plant
and a and a memo did go out
re UNK though
yes they will
well you you're not gonna accept it out in the yard
do you remember the memo i sent round
well yeah
i do think we've just got to be self critical about
well that th this is why i put the memo that if it's rejected by the tractor driver who takes that trailer out
yes
then it's you know the plant will do it
oh no i we understand that
i'm saying we have to be self critical
oh of course we do yeah
and er walking round with paul and stuart i saw what they were talking about
you know i couldn't hand on heart say paul stuart you're wrong
now here it i this is what we do this is what it's like it's fine you've got nothing to complain about
i couldn't say that
i had to come back to a degree agreeing with them
there was only a small percentage but it's that small percentage which gives our problem
that's right yes
and so i say for heaven UNK let's all be self critical and not send stuff out because ah it'll be alright that'll probably be accepted
i'd rather not take that risk because
yeah
one of the main concerns with dick is twenty five
hello
yeah
and that was UNK at
we're in a meeting who is it
now i know alan and ray
i'll get then to ring alright
but it's got so much of a slip factor on it
bone meal and it's like bloody walking on ice
yeah
you know
but it has improved now
the ones that come in now are a lot better
okay
but we are conscious of d k
right
we have to do that as well
right just quickly whip through because i'm a bit out of touch with what's go erm nick
he's
nick is UNK
yeah
and he was ill
i don't
sorry
i don't want this UNK
fine
he was ill back november december over christmas through to january
he was cleared by the doctor to come back because he had basically UNK failure
yes
erm i am concerned about his eyesight
he's UNK laser treatment at the minute isn't he
yeah
hello yeah
he's UNK laser treatment but as everybody will point out to you when he's in the UNK and he's operating the computer even with his glasses on he's reading it like this
i am concerned about his eyesight
the chap is very experienced he knows what he's doing and he's he you couldn't ask for a better worker really but yes d i do believe he's got a problem with his eyesight
okay
er
affecting the way job
i'll get back to you in a minute then
just give me a couple of minutes UNK
should he be should he be
yes
re UNK to something else
does he
i'm certainly looking at that trying to f find a hole i mean unfortunately he's a very experienced charge hand
oh i know he is
erm yes er and
okay i'll get back to you in a couple of minutes
thank you
i think we've certainly got to look at him seriously
yeah
and say erm where he would be best used but there have been a couple of errors caused by his bad eyesight
what sort of errors
erm
bulk loads
bulk load a wrong UNK or a not a wrong UNK
no
erm the wrong amount being put onto a bulk order
he couldn't read he assumed it said twenty cubic metres which it usually does
and it said thirty five
yeah so instead of doing thirty five metres he actually only did twenty
i mean as you as you say UNK a long serving and well experienced reliable
and loyal employee
and a loyal employee
yeah
so it's not a case of er UNK the guy no
no definitely not no
i mean that's not in question i just want to know you know try and get a bit of background i had heard there was a possible problem erm and er how bad it was
i it's his eyesight
anything else i mean he's fine
is it condition
well he's actually having treatment for it now in fact he's gone today
apparently they're giving him laser treatment for it
is this likely to improve his eyesight
to it's supposed to do yes
it's supposed to do but i think once his treatment has finished we w then w i we need to get an independent assessment
UNK his
of it yeah
what other sort of job could he do erm that
could he cope as the assistant
rather than the charge hand
i mean we're asking kevin to help him now
i mean kevin is helping him and he's checking a certain amount of his work but obviously he can't be there all the time
no
erm i mean i'm concerned again through his eyesight that i were we to put him as the assistant and put him on a machine that he might just put his hand somewhere and get his hand bloody trapped or whatever with his eyesight
er which concerns me
when's this treatment likely to be finished
i don't know when
i don't know we haven't spoken to his doctor i mean
he's also professor ain't he as well
who
sorry
professor gentleman i was under
and that's for protein as well
oh that's right he's not getting rid of his protein
that's right he's the same as what i was
but it's his eyesight
it's his eyesight that concerns me
this is on is he er on UNK for UNK or is he er
i think he's
oh yeah he does yeah
and everything's alright as i say until this problem with his eyesight
and it's recently
well again we don't know
we don't know because he hasn't said anything
alright but now it is starting it is starting to UNK quite badly because people are now UNK
the fact he's brought a UNK glass in
he's brought a UNK glass in and he's also wearing glasses now
okay
right to be discussed
right i've nothing else
okay got anything else
no thank you
no right thank you gentlemen ladies
right have we got any apologies for absence
yes
yeah they're on the l the list which is er circulating
yes
i think there's five so far
right
er i would like er to welcome you all to tonight
er i would particularly like to welcome john UNK who many of you know
erm i've known john for many years
i can remember delivering er leaflets in UNK
er we were finding out how long it would take us to deliver leaflets in UNK
that'd take us a lot longer now
mm
er but he is the agent for the european elections the liberal democrats agent and he's gonna say a few words about that later on
er thank you all for coming tonight
er i think it's the er i think it's the third general meeting er of the UNK constituency liberal democrats
er i know that there's at least one other attraction tonight especially if you've got sky television or
have a ticket for er UNK park and i know at least one of our members found the attraction of the match too UNK
UNK who by the way would like to come onto the committee sends his apologies
where
it's been a peculiar year a sad year we have lost some loyal members mr williams and john UNK
UNK a liberal member for many years
it was only two years ago however that er bob discovered her and george and she's been an UNK valuable member of the c committee ever since
we have missed her bad badly especially in UNK where she was to organize things and i'm sure er the meeting sends george er our UNK
mm
yeah
nationally however
nationally it has been a UNK time
the party conference was UNK with enthusiasm
there were good debates on racism transport and crime pre prevention
in the latter debate there was not enough emphasis o on the inner cities
home watch schemes are not much good when many of the neighbours are criminals and they UNK the rest
in UNK frank f frankly er actually it's been disappointing
firstly we've had no elections which means that we've had little to focus on
usually after elections we have an UNK in UNK so this year thanks mainly to tom UNK er it's been good that we've managed to maintain our membership
the membership unfortunately have seemed rather passive
a dinner was organized for the euro campaign we sold about ten tickets we had to cancel
we had a room booked for the christmas dinner and we didn't have the courage to go ahead with it because we didn't feel we could sell the tickets
both lost money
we or we are organizing a UNK down on the twelfth of february eight p m tickets five pound fifty
there's been a poor response from members
however we've managed to sell eighty three tickets through sa through various ways and er now every ticket that's sold will make a profit and we need the money
perhaps i'm wrong to blame members perhaps it's the fault of the committee or the chairman
perhaps we need to involve members in er other ways
i feel that we need now new blood on the committee and coupled with the fact that i've done one more year than the constitution says i should i'm not standing for UNK as chairman
we must now look to the future
the tories are in UNK
they promised ta tax cuts they promised to cut crime they promised to look after the environment they promised to improve e education they promised to improve the democratic process they're now the party of careful housekeeping
they deliver nothing
they deliver the opposite
we should replace them as the labour party's main op UNK
we have we have elections to fight we need money we need candidates we need workers and ideas we need help
for the local elections i would like to appeal to you to put your name forward as a candidate
we cannot afford to let the labour party go on UNK cos i feel that the conservatives are struggling for candidates in fact i know they are
please let's get going
right bob the minutes of the last a g m
very good
to you
oh while i'm at it might as well dish out the agendas as well since we've already started
i thought you were gonna say raffle tickets
gonna say i haven't got a UNK
yes they all UNK onto one sheet you see
thank you
here in nineteen sixty two
to fifty nine
you've got a copy from john
oh sorry yeah
i'll have a read
there we are then
i can't read that sort of
do you accept that these are a true record
yes
anybody to second that
alright
what if i propose that that's a true record
yeah
right
seconder
right
all in favour
all right thank you
any matters arising
nothing
there's just one thing if i might add to that
erm we were supposed to have had a guest speaker at the last er a g m and that was the result of the video being shown on its own
might i just point out that he did send his apologies and er he also sent us a donation of twenty pounds
right thank you
mm
that's excellent
it was most welcome
yeah
have we given him a receipt or anything
or acknowledgement or anything
yes
we
excellent
any other matters
right
reports
right
i like this phrase in paragraph eight of the
oh
of the minutes mr chairman
oh what's that
talking about the closing of mines
yeah
and it says the tory government which must which must take responsibility for setting up a UNK of generating companies
beautifully worded
well i c i ca i can die happy now UNK by
by arthur smith
that that's something
not many people have er enjoyed that
can we have an action UNK of that
yes
erm yes er erm er another bit of paper to dish out to have a look at er for those that er are not too familiar with the motorway project which has taken up erm quite a lot of my time
erm i did see i did see you on television
er oh i've been on
oh yeah
not every week
er yeah
er yes erm the these erm UNK two of the effects of the motorway proposals
er the top one er shows erm one or two of the houses which are due to be er demolished er if
corner of UNK avenue are they
row green
er yes
yeah
that's right
er so the er proposed additional motorway would in fact virtually cover the whole of the er site shown in that picture
mm
er the l the lower picture is of the er traffic island er the present traffic island outside the UNK er together with in the middle distance the existing motorway and behind it erm st UNK church and as part of the scheme er that existing motorway would be dug up and moved er to cover the existing island in the UNK roughly up to where that white car or van is
so there'd be two er and then the new motorway would be built er at roughly er ground level as it were er where the existing motorway is but it would be lower and there would be a UNK an UNK built over both motorways to get from the viewpoint to st UNK church
er well er a l a lot of my time has been spent in another context er as secretary of er residents against the motorway which is er an all party thing er but we've er we've also taken some action as er a political party as well in that er fairly early on sixth of july ninety two er we wrote to er nick harvey who is er mp who is our transport spokesman er and we gave him some er initial details er of the scheme er to which he er replied erm reminding us of what we knew already which was the UNK transport UNK policy in application to roads
er at the last conference er both kerry and myself UNK him er and proposed that we er push it a bit further and er the re UNK of that was that we wrote him a much more detailed letter er on whatever date it was er first of november ninety three and we've now had a er a reply er to that er giving us UNK to quote him er w with er a number of er quotations which we'd drafted and put into his mouth so er a all the quotations that we've asked him to approve we can use
now er paddy UNK has also said that anything that nick harvey UNK of er he will approve of so we can quote paddy er the same er at er at some suitable point for example in advance of the may elections
we've also submitted er on your behalf er motions to the er regional conference er and to the er cardiff er federal conference which i UNK referred to as a national conference
er the UNK of that is er that the motion for cardiff conference er has been ruled out er because it's not a national conference it's a federal one so i've got caught out on a UNK there er but we have put in er an amendment to another motion submitted for cardiff er not that one erm a motion submitted er by south west herts er which UNK on the m twenty five
so we've put in erm an amendment to that one to make it include reference to the m sixty two relief road
er i've got the text of those here i don't propose to go through it all now but if anybody er you know wants to have a look at that they're welcome
the regional conference one er since there is a regional transport paper coming up for debate er in which i had er a hand as regional erm policy chairman er the UNK motion er will in fact be taken as a an amendment er to that regional paper which is coming up er at the UNK conference
so we've er we've done i think what we can er as a party about that motorway project and er there will UNK be more to do
so that's the er the motorway thing
i found out er today i don't know whether anybody else has er heard of this that there is a proposal coming er up to er for the isle of man company which owns most of the UNK shopping centre site er to purchase the market hall and er convert it er or whatever er the suggestion is into a supermarket
er the market traders er are up in arms about this and i found them er in the process of trying to get a petition together but it wasn't put together right they were just getting people to sign blank pieces of paper
so er when i found out about this i've equipped them with a er
with a proper petition er and er i have a copy here if er you would like to c circulate it and er sign it
erm
might i just add to that er i have heard that they also want to take over the UNK hall
whether there's any truth in that
yeah the way it was put to me was that the UNK hall would be part of the deal er but that the isle of man company was not particularly enthusiastic about having the er the poison pill of the UNK hall wrapped in with the deal cos it doesn't make money
er so that's as it was told to me by er the th their chairman erm win UNK
e UNK
UNK
UNK is it
mhm
yes
so er no details are available er for what the er isle of man company proposes to do with the market hall or with the UNK hall for that matter
er it seems that the council have known about this for six months er and it's only within the last week or two er that information has got out so it seems to me that that's something that er that we ought to take an interest in
er next there is an item er for kerry
er we have now written to the council about the excess traffic on UNK park road and chapel road caused er by erm the traffic calming measures which have been put on er to UNK road
so all the traffic that used that as a UNK run to get on the east UNK road
is now going er through UNK park road and some of it through chapel road er and those roads are even less suitable for traffic than er for UNK traffic er than UNK road
so that's er been attended to
i think that's
i think that's all i want to report er mr chairman
right
er
i don't know whether it's now is the appropriate time kerry but
go on
could i ask if i if it is appropriate whether bob could elaborate on what the proposals are for the market hall and
yes i've
yeah
only had this UNK on me er today er when i went in to the hall and saw them with a notice and a table collecting signatures
er now it s it seems that the idea is for this isle of man company i think you kn you know the name of it don't you which i've forgotten
it has several UNK
anglo international is one of them
anglo international yes
er well it seems that they've put in a bid to er purchase the th the market place er and as peter said quite rightly apparently wrapped in wi with it er i don't know why but wrapped in with the proposed deal is the er UNK hall
er but nobody could tell me for certain what it was that they intended to use it for er but it was apparently not guaranteed that it would continue to be used er as a market hall
i actually heard that it was going to be used as a food hall
purely a food hall
right
yes
which would then UNK the market traders and i think the i well the UNK was to try and get them into some of the er the vacant lots in within the UNK centre
but when you look at the cost of those units
yes
in comparison with what they would be paying for a market stall then it would be it's way out of their
that's right
their range
so i mean it was it was represented to me er and i felt that there was some logic in it that this company would not be discussing this deal unless it felt it could make money out of it and that money in the end would have to come out of the local people here
yep
right
could i make could i make er erm
sorry
a question
mm
yes UNK
george
it doesn't seem to have
it doesn't
yeah
it doesn't look as though the
yeah
that's right
initiative has come from anglo international
er if part of the package UNK contains something that they don't want
mm
then i would suggest that perhaps UNK council have approached them
erm
it's not impossible because er
well
of this UNK that's apparently surrounded the whole thing
but if UNK hall is part of the package and they would never have volunteered to take on
yeah
UNK hall surely if er if it's something they don't want
i would have thought the mo without knowing anything about it i would have thought the most likely explanation for that is that the property company who own the UNK have suggested to the council that they would like to buy the market hall and the council have been sitting on it and UNK it and some bright UNK has come up with the idea yes you can buy the market hall if you also buy UNK hall
could be
i would have thought that was a more likely erm but er we're obviously we're UNK and it's perhaps
mm
UNK
yes i know
to do so
would you wish me to write to the council and ask them what's going on
if you think there's any chance of a re of a reply i would very certainly
well if they refuse to
reply or reply saying that it's
confidential the then er that's all UNK to the mill as well isn't it
i think it would be a good idea yeah
yes
it looks like a nice er subject for the campaign for may
yes exactly
maybe an open letter in the pre in the press er would be suffice better
well er depending on what we get from the council
aye
as a next step perhaps
yeah
i was thinking
yeah
well you've got to react you've gotta act fairly quickly on that though haven't you
mm
oh yes
you know if you send an open letter you you've gotta do it fairly otherwise somebody else is going to write in and
yeah
erm or i might ri ring
and then you're just UNK to what they've said aren't you
or i might ri ring them up and ask them
yeah ring them up and ask them and then write a letter
yeah
to the paper
yeah
i thought
yes
excellent
good
right er that secretary anything er else on secretary's report
no
er membership secretary
yes well mr chairman members
you will see that er at the last meeting the membership total was a hundred and four
that's rather more than a year ago of course
er it was in october in ninety two
and it followed a general election which of course is always a
yeah
good recruiting period and we had er thirty o thirty one i think it was or thirty four new members who came in at the general election
inevitably we haven't held er they haven't been able to hold up that new members this year and er the main job has been trying to er keep quite a number of the members who were recruited er to the gen following er the general election
several of them were fringe members who we have not been able to keep on to some of them especially in er in little UNK and UNK
mm
where i think we've er lost track of about eight or nine people
so er we're still UNK around a hundred but instead of being four over the hundred the present total is ninety six by my UNK
er we'd UNK like to get it up to three figures again obviously because a amongst other things this affects the number of representatives that we get for conferences and so on
if you get over a hundred you get an extra one there
hopefully we may be able to do that
er ninety three was not a good year for recruiting from the point of view of elections as has already been said because we didn't have any elections and therefore er it wasn't possible to er to UNK and consequently er we were struggling to recruit new members
we did we did manage to recruit nine during the year but we lost er four by death as kerry has mentioned three by removal or one or two elderly people moving into er sheltered or into homes and things like that where they're no longer UNK and there were ten UNK making a total of seventeen that we lost er as against nine new members recruited which meant that we have a UNK have a UNK loss of eight from a hundred and four to the present total of ninety six
what has been er what has been UNK is that a n a number of the people who've come in on the last two or three years or so er are younger people in their er late teens or twenties
er it's been one of my hopes that we might be able to get er a small youth section or youth committee coming er from amongst these people
the latest the latest recruit is a young man of twenty three from UNK
once again we have this problem of keeping in touch with the wing wards UNK and er east it's not all that easy to do but er there are people there who are showing an interest and i hope that we can
obviously with the coming of two elections shortly we have the opportunity to do a lot more canvassing and contact more members of the public and to draw in new members from there
we also have in the area a tremendous number of new houses which have never been contacted by us or for by any political party and i would hope that we might be able to do er something about the area behind the church there is er an area that comes to mind which could well be UNK and i would hope that we might during this year get er some kind of literature out to these places apart from election literature
so at the moment it's ninety six
if anybody can help me help me to get it up to three figures again personal contact could be er very useful in these cases if you come across anybody who you might think we could interest
you don't have to do it just tell me and i'll tell them
right thank you tom thank you for your work again this year especially following up the er members who lapse
i know it's difficult
thank you
er next is treasurer's report
peter
mr chairman er loyal members
erm whilst i've not been able to produce an audited er set of accounts i do have er a set of figures for you erm and as you said at the beginning of your opening er speech mr chairman that erm we had one or two losses during the year those er in actual fact didn't erm affect us in thi this particular financial year as they were aimed at the september december period but therefore they will be reflected in next year's figures not or in the current year's figures or the next annual general meeting's figures
er we started off the year with er a current account balance of two hundred and thirty three pounds ninety four and we ended with two er three hundred and twenty seven pounds twenty nine pence
the deposit account it makes me wonder why we've got money on deposit in a bank
erm we've got we had two hundred and pounds fifteen pence on deposit which has raised us one pound ten pence interest over the year leaving us at two hundred and twenty one pounds twenty five pence
some of the expenditure er some of the income came from erm the cheltenham gold cup which ra actually realized us the sum of ninety four pounds in comparison with twenty fo twenty four pounds the previous year
the president's dinner raised us erm fifty five pounds and a profit on the UNK down of thirty five pounds
and thanks to tom chasing up membership that actually brought us in a hundred and ninety nine pounds seventy er throughout the year
UNK er some of the er higher amounts are printing at ninety pounds fifty cons conference fees at sixty pounds er euro election er donation of twenty five pounds UNK of forty pounds er bank charges which er was a point that i took up with the bank erm mr chairman last december
er they wanted to charge us eighty pence per transaction and after a lot of argument we managed to pin them down er at er ten pounds for the at the rate of two pounds fifty per quarter
er had they got their way every time we put a cheque in or took one out or moved money from one account to another it would have cost us eighty pence which meant that had anybody paid their fees to the er and made the cheque payable to us directly we would have had to bank that cheque and then UNK another cheque er to the appropriate department and that would have cost us one pound sixty for which we'd have got nothing
mm
and that one pound sixty would be eroded erm in the amount that comes back on our erm direct payments from UNK street
erm we have we had in this particular set of accounts thirty five pounds on two occasions for rooms er which we had to let go and computer data er which is still being processed i understand at a cost of forty pounds
those are the figures as they stand as of thir at the thirty first of august nineteen ninety three
right
how do we stand now
pretty much the same at the moment because i'm sat on a couple of bills for UNK council who i'm sure can afford it for the moment
so
but we w we are UNK
right
any questions
perhaps i could just add something to the item about the data processing
we er that was that er election software wasn't it
that's right
ears
yeah
er we have now received a package from them
incidentally i think when you when you net it all out that forty pounds er is partly offset because i think we got er twenty five pounds from the UNK or something
that's right yes
er so the actual cost is fifteen
i've had a package at long last er back from ears er but i haven't actually erm put it onto the computer yet because it's erm it's proving a bit UNK at the moment and i didn't want to risk UNK it with yet another er software package u until i've had it seen to
er i suspect that what they've sent us is the software but not the database for any wards and the deal was that we would get er at least er the database for two wards er and a UNK with telephone numbers of the er electoral register
so we may have to pursue that further but there has been some progress after all this time and expenditure of money and time
where's that from bob
sorry
it's a it's a thing called ears er which is an UNK for starts with election anyway
and what it enables you to do is er to either type in the electoral register or er read it in from the UNK disks er maybe after translation which is what one of the jobs that ears did for us er and you can then tag it with erm er UNK erm UNK er returns and telephone numbers and things like that
well the reason why we were attracted to it was of course the very point that they would translate the disks for nothing we wouldn't have to type out the register and they would also add the telephone numbers without us having to look them all up so that we could do telephone canvassing
mm
mm
er so i suspect it's not worked out quite as we intended er and it i mean the main problem is that it's cost us time cost me time which i would rather have spent on something else but there we are
yeah the other the other factor is now that data is getting on for twelve months old
oh yeah
and new registers will have been er made composed UNK of
indeed
and UNK
yeah
th there is supposed to be an updating or editing mode for ears
yes
er
can i ask you how you've provided them with the data to actually produce the erm
we bought it from UNK and from UNK
er it was a deal done with the UNK society er on a at a national level in that er the individual local parties would buy this data er from the appropriate councils on either disk or tape er ears would translate them and the cost of the translation would be borne by the UNK er society and the cost of the disks would be borne by the UNK society and i think it was about a hundred and thirty quid or something like that altogether
er the UNK society would obtain the data for the purpose of trying to identify street agents for them er and er we would get the database when completed
now er we already had a license for an earlier version of ears which in er in fact was in UNK name from the last general election but one
t or two
erm er that was for a b c computer
so er the forty pounds was for the update of the license to erm er an i b m compatible
that was offset as i say by er this er i think it was i think it was twenty five pounds er UNK from the UNK society
so the whole operation has cost us fifteen pounds
er whether we've got anything UNK out of it still remains to be seen
mm
right
might i just add that if anybody does actually pay their fee by cheques erm please make it to the right department er as tom will give you erm the co the correct er name for your cheque
it saves us er handling and
yeah
erm
so you they pay it to who do they pay it to then tom
who do you pay a cheque to
er just pay it to are we talking about er s UNK
UNK yeah
UNK
er well the liberal democrats or even s l d if you want
you don't have to write very much
yeah
liberal democrats
the point peter er is making is don't make it out to us because if you if you give me a cheque to UNK i've got to go to peter's house and then get him to give me a cheque and then i've got to go to either kerry or bob and get them to
mm
UNK it and er
lot of messing
the other factor is that
we used to get
we used to get exactly the same UNK the only thing is we have to wait three months for it
we do get a regular cheque every three months erm of a UNK of thirty percent
the other factor is that the negotiations with the bank erm to pay two pound fifty per quarter erm should have been erm reviewed last december
they've kept quiet and so have i
yes
so therefore until they stay UNK start charging me some more money on it i'm gonna keep quiet
mm
mm
right
any other
could i suggest erm mr chairman er our treasurer has been under er some pressure recently
yeah
erm could i suggest that er that the incoming committee be given authority to erm obtain erm audited accounts and to approve those accounts on your behalf when available
can i move that
yeah
any UNK
yeah
all in favour
right passed
right
er d says social here bob what does that mean
are we does it mean we're having one
er no
what it what means is er a report from anybody that will admit to any responsibility for the social activities
er
er well i think i've said quite a bit about it
do you do you want to say anything peter in particular
er not particularly apart from that er that the s the support from the party in general wa was very poor from the members in general was relatively poor
erm
yeah
and though these sort of things were the best way i saw it er of raising funds for the coming two elections the euro election and the next local elections
yeah
and whilst we had no opportunities last year for canvassing or erm for getting members we could have i felt er put on more fund raising events as we had a quiet year and we could have probably at the same time persuaded one or two people to actually join us
it er i mean i as far as i'm concerned it's er extremely difficult to get people to er come to social events
mm
yeah
er if you advertise them too early er they forget about it
if you advertise them too late they've booked up something else
er so i don't know where we are
i've er this the er UNK down i've been advertising since before christmas er and er although we didn't inform the members till about three weeks ago something like that er i've been telling everybody about it and i've had more response from non members than i've had from members for it
er i t i suspect that most of the tickets have gone to people who you know who are who i know and have rung up er not it's no good putting notices out no nobody UNK to that
mm
you've got to ring people up and ask them
and then you've gotta ring them up and ask them again to see who's to see who cos they usually say well i'll see what i can do and then you've got to ring them up again and see if they've done anything and er and then sometimes you've gotta ring them up again
er so it's very difficult
i managed to get rid of about eighty and if we do sell these extra what twenty or thirty that's going to be between a hundred and a hundred and fifty pounds profit
about that profit yeah
yeah
because although the UNK cost a pound er most people er will buy drinks at the bar and er we'll make fifty p out of them in the evening at the bar so you know we'll make five pounds from anybody we sell tickets to from now on
mm
er so if you can if you can talk to y r ring up anybody you know and just ask them
you know
mm
did you say talk to or UNK
UNK
UNK them
yeah
but er it's less than a fortnight now
er i also need people to help me on with the bar wi serving on the bar
chris promised to help me buy the drinks and organize the that side of it getting the drinks
and help on the bar
and help on the bar
right
er so we'll need some help on in the evening on the bar when also er we want some cakes as well cos we usually serve cakes with the UNK so if anybody would like to make a cake i'd be very grateful for that
er i've already had some promised but it depends on how many people we get there you see
if we're going to get over a hundred we're going to need quite a lot of cakes
any er any questions about UNK
i'll promise one
you'll promised me a cake
well done john
ah excellent
well done john
what would you like
cherry pie
cherry UNK do fine
UNK
UNK right
right
yeah
a UNK a question about the er raffle tickets
oh right
mm
yes they've stripped me of my cash for tonight
should i really have supported this venture rather than the raffle tickets
what are what are we gonna get out of
both
what are we gonna get out of the raffle tickets
er we get er three pounds er per complete book er out
right
of the five pounds for a for a full book
right
fine
er of the raffle tickets
just so that i've got some idea of er
yeah
yeah
if i could just er just add to that erm th the cheltenham gold cup er as i said earlier produced us ninety four pound last year
erm if we actually get into the th t the top selling bracket er or the top ten as it were erm bearing in mind that the top sales were one thousand three hundred and nineteen pounds
that particular group got an additional five hundred pounds as a prize for selling the most tickets
mm
the next figure down was nine hundred and ninety two pounds fifty
they got an award of two hundred pounds
er that was at UNK
erm the third prize was erm seven hundred and fifty eight pounds sales from south suffolk they got a hundred pounds and seven other er constituencies who sold between six hundred and ninety three pounds seventy five and five hundred and one UNK worth of tickets
got an extra fifty pound each
over the erm four years th the last four years er on UNK the income from the erm the draw has been one a hundred and thirty thousand pounds er of which ninety five thousand pounds has benefited the party and most of that is at constituency level
mm
as against er head office
mm
er anybody that actually wants to see a list of the UNK from last year from the actual race i do have a copy er
yeah
which gives na
right any comments then on this
no i thought it was alright
thank you
yeah that's fine
yes works quite well
i thought it was quite funny as well
er do you think the language is actually the language that would use
yeah
i i've used in my script i've used a very loose language like er very er well non standard english then because they now erm you know especially after having it banned
my experience
so do you think this is loose enough though
yeah this is fine
you know i think there's erm room for like people being able to make up bits as well
yeah
not like you're not it's not the way they s like phrase it put a sentence together
no
as the way they're saying
to be quite honest man i've never really never really did see a problem
if they're gonna be that type of band they're not gonna be thinking as how they pronounce a sentence
is that
how they've portrayed a excellent
it's like in interviews as well like you don't som some people do but if somebody asks you a question you just try and answer it you don't really think about erm the way you construct everything
no
isn't this
no
a lot of these people english
yeah but
isn't this isn't this language a bit UNK of the band
it doesn't really matter who that is
i feel like
it's true but
if they if they can't speak properly they haven't got much chance of writing a song
i mean some UNK are pretty UNK aren't they
yeah
it's
i think they're clever
well they're clever in one respect but they're not necessarily clever with words
yeah well some of some people can't really er communicate can't UNK with er people in normal conversation but er when it comes to writing stuff down you know they can be very good
or they can UNK in a sense that they can get a UNK progression or a UNK together that actually works and says something UNK of the words
exactly
the words are often the last thing that or sometimes the last thing that people actually write
and this i mean this isn't meant to be a good band anyway is it
is that
the fact that they can't communicate or they don't speak or whatever is something to do with
i suppose
yeah but just because they're a rubbish band doesn't mean that they can't communicate and that's sort of the image that we're UNK here
or isn't that bit s UNK
so what
what's the matter with words
i don't know i just think i just think
what's the problem
no there's no problem i'm just like saying that they sound really thick they're rubbish at being in a band and it's just all so down hill for them from the beginning really they didn't really have a chance did they
exactly
exactly
gotta have high hopes to start with
yeah
but they don't that
have high hopes
yeah but they just are they're just rubbish
you know they just they just not UNK to be in a band at all
no
have you seen the graham taylor UNK
he had to bring football into it didn't he
well it's not exactly football it's just like a tragic UNK slide isn't it
er i just think that th the language is a bit too sort of proper and that you know they have you know
he couldn't play the UNK he was too loud that sounds too formal you know say he was crap at the UNK couldn't they
yeah
or
what would they say these days about you know the UNK
i mean in sort of UNK language wh what would they say
i think you'd be surprised here i do with how the bands speak at like especially on a UNK on t v
yeah
you wouldn't think that they were a band like you can tell they were on drugs some of them
yeah
the way they speak you wouldn't
so their language isn't basic
no it just terrible no
you know there's ever hardly ever any UNK
they're probably not allowed to show it are they
exactly they're not they wan they're being interviewed for television they can't be probably their normal UNK can they
well that's what this is isn't it
exactly same as
all ages
yeah well of course
famous people you'd be surprised people just erm switch into a different like mode when they're being erm UNK for you know cameras and everything
or recorded
exactly
so the they got to erm watch everything they say
do you reckon that er word at the top there UNK
is that is that the kind of word that you would use about er
that would be used by the UNK
would there be an official reason
what
are there usually official reasons
well i heard a lot of peoples
got bored with being together
sorry
they become bored with being together
they just if they
if they don't get on
give up
exactly they're UNK
mm
yeah
this is whether it's the word they'd use or whether
yeah but they wouldn't use it their manager or something like that would say
their agent
their agent yeah
not that they'd have one but
yeah well they might have one
so possibly that UNK ought to say the their agent described it as
yeah
the reason as being UNK
that you know th that puts it more in the context doesn't it
mm
it's what we mean by the official reason it it's the p r person
yeah it's the reason we give to the paper or whatever
yeah
the local paper
it was in the press release you know
that kind of thing
probably wouldn't have really UNK why they split up if they were that rubbish to start with
yeah well they're making a big deal out of it aren't they
if their first UNK was
hopeless or rubbish as to put it yeah
who would really who would really mind
well if you're doing a erm a UNK about them somebody must mind mustn't they
yeah you've got to have a reason for that
but if you if we're doing a UNK about the whole got to cover for whole scene
we've got to do how they started whatever
you can't just leave it open at the end
some somebody must be interested otherwise we wouldn't be doing this theoretically
i mean sometimes a band can be so bad but they're really interesting cos they're so bad
does that make
yeah
i mean you look at the sex UNK for example
i mean they were pretty awful weren't they in any sort of musical sense but they were so UNK bad in some respects as well
a good UNK player though in the sex UNK
ah
i know when he played he used to play it with his UNK but erm
nice day
it is a nice day actually
quite fresh
yeah
so let's just talk about we've had a look at this one basically we're sort of happy enough with this aren't we
yeah
gonna see how per UNK perhaps fits in with the other erm bits so who's starting off you're starting off aren't you
i'm starting off yes
so tell us tell us what happens
well
just have a quick sort of chat about where we're going whether it's you know whether
well in the beginning erm this is an interview before they start UNK one evening or like what they each other play and they're just talking about how they met and everything cos they the UNK and the UNK met in a chip shop and knocked all the chips everywhere and then he er the UNK talks about erm he met i mean he knows a UNK that's free and it turns out that it's the UNK brother
although she didn't know he played the UNK at all
no
she just like thought he was being a carpenter or something and this brother erm her brother didn't know that she sung at all so it all turns out to be a big surprise
loads of UNK
yes
i think that's pretty consistent probably with how bands are formed actually isn't it its friends of friends and somebody knows somebody else and somebody's looking round for a UNK just happens that somebody mentions it to somebody else
tends to happen that way doesn't it
yeah
they just grabbed this bloke who's standing outside the music area thinking he might be a UNK and he isn't but it doesn't matter
yeah
that's it really and they just tell them how they meet and everything
and which UNK that
or are they just a crowd
oh that's the UNK
so is that er i mean in the in the UNK we've got is there particular personalities coming through here because i think that's one of the other things we need to make sure in the script that we've got a consistent view of certain personalities
the thing is because yeah but because we're all doing different scripts
that's right
we're UNK we're doing our own personalities for
yeah
each character so
i know
they're bound to differ
but they've got to have to be consistent
yeah
cos that's how that's why we've got to ultimately look at all the scripts and sort of
yes
change them to make them all consistent
tie them all in
yeah i mean UNK starting it off so have you got a particular personalities for the characters
who's the sort of UNK here
i mean
yeah well i think er th the UNK is one of one of the main people she's very su sure you know of her ability you know despite you know actual or reality anyway
yeah
erm the UNK the UNK is very erm how can i put it erm
arrogant
arrogant yes
did you just say
has got to be like the leader
yeah
well in this i've got her as the UNK
oh no that's the UNK that's the UNK
actual of the band
i've got her as
well the UNK pretty erm
yeah
stupid really
the UNK th the very stupid one and the UNK basically can't be bothered at all you know
as long as that's like is the UNK james or
yes
ken UNK the UNK
UNK the UNK one
yeah
the UNK just can't be bothered
and the UNK takes everything personally he's very er but takes like fits and can't really see what's going on
well this would he take it all personally
erm he well he
he doesn't really understand that's why
he doesn't understand it's all going over his head
doesn't really care
okay so that's the first scene and then we move to
number three
three
i think
UNK isn't it
no it's the rock gala isn't it
yeah recording UNK number two
yeah recording UNK
recording UNK
okay let's see what see what
right we've got they go over to the UNK and start recording
three of the group members turn up but one was late
okay and that one happens to be UNK
that's yeah that's consistent i think UNK is are always late
every time
right so she gets a phone call
she UNK off to the studio erm a room in a house her mum and dad's house to answer the phone
yeah cos she could say she's doing her hair she did coming i mean she's doing her hair or something like that or is that terribly sexist
but it is erm if anybody wants one of the other band members could be doing their hair
yeah well that's true
yeah
yeah anyway she she's told to get a move on
she gets moving gets there she arrives fifteen minutes late
it's time they get to start recording but they're missing the UNK so she can't sing
that's because ken forgot to photo photocopy the UNK and they're at his house with some other stuff and they discussed what happened on t v last night but UNK starts to get really annoyed seeing as she was the one turning up late and like she was on about we're paying a lot of money for this studio let's use it
yeah that's true
but she turned up late to start off with
yeah then they'll all have a go at her
what do you mean you turned up fifteen minutes late
yeah then have a big argument then
stand up
fall ou fall out not getting anything done at all
well that's basically it there
so are they all gonna fall out at the end and not get anything done
no it's going to the end of the interview
can't we have some violence
see the thing is UNK she's gonna get UNK involved with ken
with
oh no
i think i think that's not the necessary one
it's not the UNK
bit of a twist in the story line isn't it
big yes a big twist
okay so they've just done their UNK but then are they gonna take UNK to
yeah organising the rock gala
to you to you
rock gala to me yeah
which is a bloody good thing really that i started off with the tape hands
cos i was originally gonna let them do an UNK for you but i thought na
no i think tape sounds like a good idea
erm they go to see they first of all it starts with them looking at a notice board with the notice on it
then they continue they hand you the tape you ask them a few questions like what the UNK called how long you've been working together and UNK and then erm i think i i'm actually doing it with kent and james and they're not thick
no oh no they're not
but they're not i don't have them down as thick but they
no
is
yeah
mm right okay that's alright then
and then erm i've lost my thread now
yeah james and
kent
yeah
yeah right and then erm kent or one of them is talking to you giving them your address an no giving them their address
yeah
and so that you could send them the information about it all and then james is just talking into the camera saying oh i'm really glad that this is happening the UNK gonna be really happy finally we're on our way UNK and then it ends
yeah but i was thinking of
oh no then it goes to the UNK that's the bit of the script i haven't done
yeah
it shows a few UNK as well
that's quite good
yes yeah
i think you'd have a er scene of you know jonathan listening to the UNK in his office and
that's an idea actually yeah
yeah
so that's afterwards yeah
that's afterwards yeah
so wouldn't one normally if they were that bad refuse them
no
no you can just look into the camera and say erm
yeah
give 'em a chance
that's not fair that's not fair
mm
no names mentioned
no it's not so how do i get everything out then if nothing is
UNK it's like you said only got two other bands
it's exactly what you need though
they can go on first sort of warm up band and that'll put everybody else in context
exactly make everybody else look good
right so the then we got the UNK
yeah which john was doing
yeah
yeah he's talking about he's doing a UNK type thing with UNK of the UNK that sort of thing
should be interesting
erm in fact we can we have a rock gala this term perhaps we can fill them fill them with imaginary er UNK
and who are these characters gonna be anyway
i mean what have we what have we done so far and then think about actually creating this group
well i'll be the UNK
i'm gonna be the UNK and
right
i'll be the director
okay
we did say that if possible we shouldn't be actually in it
but for the sake i think we have to make an exception perhaps in UNK case because he actually is a UNK as well
was there any scenes with all the characters in because that i mean you're isn't it
mm
really the other three people can be UNK it
exactly
i mean it would make it easier from the point of UNK
yeah i mean
yeah well i know but it's nice
mm
yeah but if we're in it who's gonna film it
exactly
it does need
i could have UNK in from outside
right to play
well i dunno he could be erm
bass UNK
he could be either the bass UNK or the
cos he plays a bit of UNK
yeah
so we really want him not to play case of being not familiar with
well exactly
that would be quite good
yeah
and then we need a UNK
well could be the UNK
john would look good as the UNK
mm
john would look good as a UNK wouldn't he
yeah he does play a little bit
yeah that'll do yeah that'll be alright then
and then we need erm
UNK
UNK
yeah can be it
yeah but george can sing
no i can't
yeah but not this sort of stuff
so how's that gonna work then if we need people to film and things cos i'm not gonna film it for you
well i i've well
well not in every scene is there all the characters anyway
sort of take turns in doing it
exactly apart from apart from the play the actual play
what the actual
and then we've got and
do we have
exactly
recording
ask the questions
like on our on our scenes
yeah
but i'll be sitting there asking
yeah of course yeah probably
whatever questions i'm gonna ask
UNK
eventually get to be
so what did you do
yeah
try and get somebody else to ask then we fill their own you know scenes cos then we get what we want
but is there is there a situation where there's one where you're all in it
all
on only in like the UNK and like the actual UNK and
but even then i mean if he wants to be the UNK
can't just like putting people off
yeah have to have the whole group there
no not really
they've all got to be sat down but
no well
chair over there
i was thinking erm in like
got to have the whole group there otherwise it's
one line in my in my interviews in my interview
always said but they don't necessarily
no in my interviews erm i done erm two people and they just that way they can talk about each other without erm having a fight or anything
yeah
i mean all th this script
mind you it's the
one person and the UNK all of it
yeah mi mind you though if pete does it with everyone then it's a change to what's been going on usually it would be nice for a change
yeah
if you see what i mean to have that sort of contrast
yeah
while everyone's there
so i mean i'm not gonna point the questions at anyone in particular i'm just like have them answered but i might just say to is this normal for her to be late
now one of them will pipe up yeah she bloody always late
yeah well whereas in that if they when the recording the UNK they have to be together don't they
yeah
UNK not there anyway
not for hers to boot
so if but if you're interviewing that only leaves
yeah but you know he can
yeah
hold the cameras as well
yeah
sorry
he can hold the camera as well
what and interview
but wait but the thing is yeah there's only a few scenes where everyone's in it right and where people everyone is in it then obviously i'm gonna have help from you or from andy aren't i
well
i think we can do it
i know you're not convinced
no i'm not convinced because
you're not convinced but i think we can do it
the idea is not that you're actors on this course but that you're learning how to film
objection aside i don't want to be in this at all
not UNK nothing
is that all of us
so i mean we could we could recruit people in to do it but the problem there is they've got to be free at the times when this course runs
see the thing is everyone's gonna get the chance to be behind the camera or do some directing because it's not
yeah well if that's if that's i mean that's all i am concerned about that everybody does
yeah
that directing
yeah
everybody does a bit of camera work and sound and things and everybody experiences those different roles that you have so far covered you know across the UNK but not in every act
mm
yeah well yeah UNK get the chance because erm
definitely
yeah but why
so we're saying we perhaps need an UNK
yeah
and we need a we need
yeah discuss this really
so can we also think who this UNK would be wouldn't it be sort of a really UNK sort of person with you know i don't know yellow hair or you know sort of
oh i don't know
UNK
two people you know
yeah
where they're quite sort of UNK looking aren't they
i think they'd just be normal
just be i think they'd just be normal
it's alright i was thinking about you've seen
but they aren't normal are they i mean you look at n m e and you look at the language they use i mean that's not normal
no i wa i was er i was thinking anyway that it wasn't exactly like that it's more like a forty minutes type thing
oh
b c
yeah very over normal
mm
extremely normal because erm i don't think n m e UNK would bother to do something like this
so you want some something out of cutting a complete contrast between the sort of person who's being interviewed sort of
yeah i think that would probably
yeah
work better
and er laid back perhaps
how many actual scenes are there
erm five well five
five
acts
five acts and the people that took
sections
but have you got the
scenes
no
but
have you got have you got a
first one
first last
yeah
yeah
first one
second erm
yeah
so we can have like commercial breaks sticking adverts in between
oh
good idea
oh
break coming up you say right
like UNK have little cliff UNK
break it up a bit
little cliff UNK in between
you can have your adverts in there
it's a shame that they're all about a drink but anyway
this is like some getting done with the ads
yeah but
and everyone else in the group
oh yeah
cos i've been trying to organise it
so why don't we do this other one your static
yeah
i'm actually no i'm seriously considering doing it
right
but i really like to work with that lot because the advert would be so funny
yeah the exact the set that would wait forever wouldn't it
that's true
so perhaps we ought to realise the fact that we've never actually gonna get that one down
true
unless i could do two
yeah well perhaps well we'll need one down there
oh yeah
do the one that you can do
okay well
what we need to do is make sure these scripts are done before half term really don't we
when's half term
next week i think
next week
we really ought to be UNK this stuff well UNK the scripts after half term
yeah and UNK and the UNK
i think what we need to do
need to be UNK pretty much straight away
yeah
once we've got all the scripts done i think we should erm allocate roles to certain people behind the scene so we know exactly what we're doing
in each in each section
yeah do
who's doing what yes okay
right okay
so is i mean you're nearly finished with your script
yeah
is there a chance that you could work on this before friday and have a script
i think so yeah
what about you
definitely i've got three quarters of it done already
right so hopefully we'll have a look at all the scripts then on friday
we've got time though don't we
yeah but somebody else set
you know i mean they'll be some changes
it's not essential is it
no
there'll be some changes
there's a couple of people who haven't got the essay titles from last friday erm have you got your copy of it handy and that they could
no i didn't copy it down
you didn't copy it down either have you no intention of doing it or something
i did at the back
well i've got it written down here and at the end of the lesson you can get it
is there anybody not want spare scrap paper
got loads yeah got tons at home mum
no because we're doing something else now
okay we don't want the entire lesson held up while you did what you were supposed to have done on friday right
now we're working on language now but because a question turns up every year on paper one to do with education we're going to be considering education and we're going to consider education in the UNK possible way and that is how do we know things
or more specifically start considering how you learn things
now you should all have a spare scrap of paper that's blank on one side out of my recycled paper box okay
at the top of this i want you to write either a skill or an area of knowledge that you have that you possess okay that you're pretty proud of
that you know that if anybody asks you to do this or asks you a question connected with this you can do it
right
it could be when you go to UNK you win every time
it
i wouldn't bet on it
it could be that you're the world's expert on michael UNK greatest hits i don't care okay it can be anything if you were in the scouts maybe you can light a fire with two matches
i don't know whatever
or half a can of UNK if you're anything like most of the scouts i've met
but you see what i mean
it could just be that you're the person in your family who knows what's on all those video tapes that nobody's labelled up
oh that's me
you're not okay
whatever i want you to think about your skill what you're an expert at and write it at the top of the bit of paper
just one
well UNK do okay
where did you get it from
haven't done anything
well you're the leader
yeah but i can't exactly write that down can i
like telling people i take after somebody important
what are you good at
i don't know
i know i can cut a loaf of bread on a machine
yeah so can i
i can work a till
medium slice
medium or thick slice par UNK yeah we can do thick slice too
oh okay
yeah
we know
oh that's bad that is
i know
i've experience of cooking sixty to seventy sausage rolls every saturday
i can work a till
fifty pounds it's a real bugger
spend any money
spend fifty pounds worth of bread do you
no true
i can work a till
oh right
yeah and i know what to do with cheques and credit cards
i'm a professional pick pocket
i'm a professional stamp collector
i don't know i still can't write anything down
spend money really well
i can work a till and i know what to do with cheques and credit cards
yeah
i think i'll put that as well mind you like everybody else put that down but
well it's a skill i have
i have i did have experience with cheques and credit cards but that was when i was working at the chemist but now we don't take cheques
right
don't take cheques
where do you work
i'm putting that to
have we all got something sh have we all got something
yeah
right now and here's the tricky bit
i've looked over the shoulder at a few of these and they are obviously not the sort of thing that you came sliding out of your mother's womb knowing how to do
okay
er so some how or another you've learned them right
right could you manage to remember how you got that skill or that knowledge okay
er you might also want to consider er any gains that you have got from having this skill or knowledge
gains
gains
gains
gains
does it just make you feel good or has it helped you to do something else that you wanted to do
if somebody's written it about somebody else's UNK okay it's auto if it's you know
okay now what you should have in front of you is a recipe for successful learning because what you've got at the top right what you've got at the top is something that you've learnt and you think you're pretty good at it and what you've got in the middle is how you got to be good at it and what you've got at the end is what you gain from having it
really if we can make every single one your a levels follow that pattern for you we'd have excellent results at the end of the day okay
but let's just see if there is a pattern or if everybody's different
okay so what we'll do is we'll combine
first of all perhaps if you could all let everybody else know what we're talking about what your particular skill is
do we start over here with martin
and go round
it's not exactly a skill but i've got good erm at work i've got a good memory like a knowledge of all the different items an the counter
so yours is work related
yeah
good memory for all the items on the counter you have learned and classified a variety of material
UNK and things like that you know
UNK okay
right okay jo
good at making UNK
UNK
good at making UNK
fine er a number of skills involved there
right
oh yes
i mean perhaps sometime after the lesson you can tell me how you stop the UNK on the bottom going UNK
okay vicky
good at making scones
scones
that's mine yes
that's the one i always use for this exercise is scones great
lynn
playing the clarinet
playing the clarinet
we've got a diversity here haven't we
what about the next table
knowing what's on t v every night
knowing what's on t v every night
knowing what's on television every night
okay so the portable radio times
okay
star signs and that
yes you're good on UNK is it
UNK
yes
okay
really cool
darren
erm eighties music
eighties music
right well again UNK of a wide l lot of material well all three of those yeah
david
i like sport
sport
yeah
any one in particular
boxing football UNK
boxing football UNK
okay in boxing have you got a particular move a particular UNK a particular punch that they've
yeah
which is
no just go mad no
it's all tactics
so it's you're good on the tactics
suppose so
okay right
UNK
cricket
cricket
mm
yes
fine
knowledge of or skill at playing or
skill and knowledge
skill and knowledge
UNK
okay
UNK
erm i can remember or orders and prices at work that i have to do
again it's memory and UNK of material
yes
i can work a till and i know what to do with cheques and credit cards when people pay
right
s so th there's a variety of different skills involved in there the mechanical the till and the knowing what to do with cheques credit cards er have you got a sense of when you've got to check up on a card or something like that
yeah i've caught two bad ones
there you are you see that is a very definite skill which she you're using an awful lot of that one it would be interesting to know how you developed that skill
stephen
UNK
UNK again material UNK memory
red UNK
red UNK again the same the material the knowledge
erm working on a till knowing what to do at work
right another work related one
the same as well
and the same with you
okay isn't it interesting isn't depressing that absolutely none of these things was taught you at school except possibly the sport
no
i mean i knew what was going to happen when i started the exercise but if you UNK it from a teacher's point of view if i go out and commit suicide or break down you'll know why won't you
none of you have said my deep and UNK love of UNK my knowledge of relevant quotations in UNK have you er
no
you know
tony UNK and american UNK that's my area that's none of you okay
so
let's think about what this means for education let's er work out how you learn okay
now i might forget some of them but er what about er you seeing as how your skill is one that i haven't been able to acquire yet jo how did you get to make the perfect UNK
just trial and error
trial and error i don't know i think i've done enough of that
never mind okay
how many of the rest of you would say that you got where you are today in your area of expertise with trial and error
david definitely
my UNK maker here
anybody else
when you first started work didn't you make any mistakes UNK
yeah
but they're horrible about it so you don't do it again
right
maybe i could learn how to be really horrible
okay so trial and error and involved with trial and error is something that i'm almost certain that UNK and david are going to er
come up with and that's practice
yeah a lot of practising
yeah
yeah because you can't have trial and error without a lot of practice
erm you too lynn
mm
yeah there you go
trial and error and practice lots and lots of practice okay
anything else er lynn did your clarinet teacher ever play the clarinet and let you see her playing it well
no
no
don't get taught like that no
you don't get UNK do it like that
did you ever see anybody else makes scones before you started
erm my mum
erm right precisely the same way i learnt the same skill watching somebody else do it right
did you ever watch people at work before you've gone into it
yeah
yeah
yeah
sport erm i remember when i learned UNK that the teacher would show us the high smash shot down until we saw it being done properly if he told us the theory of it without showing us what it looked like when it was done properly we wouldn't have known what we were aiming at
does this ring a bell in any of the rest of you that learned a skill
yeah
you saw it done properly okay
now there are lots of you have got skills involving just UNK or learning of doing research on a particular subject whether obviously your red UNK how to you go about it
well i bought lots of videos and then watch them a lot
aha
well again it's time the commitment here okay
is it the same with you with UNK
yeah
and you spent a lot of time reading a lot of time finding out
erm do you get together with other people who share
sometimes
sometimes
what about and the red UNK
kind of
kind of
right so also this the commitment is shared we'll talk about it okay
and i expect that same thing happens with the work related one that because you're never at work on your own or hardly ever at work on your own and the same thing when you started you weren't ever on your own you could say to people am i doing it right
what's the best way to do this okay
so you're learning from other people as well
right okay
now the question is why well it's pretty obvious with some it's pretty obvious why rachel wants to know everything on television in her life i suppose
planning a time yeah right
er it's fairly obvious why you want to UNK a UNK or a UNK it's fairly obvious is it why you want to play the clarinet
why
for pleasure
for pleasure
and the work one there's a definite incentive of work
now why are you doing a level english might want to talk that through
biology
and an answer has come up with no because they wouldn't let me do biology you see
you could tell each other about this you don't have to tell me
i'm pretty aware of it
i was under the impression that we could choose our books
okay have you had long enough to
eh
so you've got an idea
yeah
about why erm
the reasons will vary
some of you i'm quite sure chose to do a level english because you were good at it at g c s e
mm
and you thought you would carry on being good at it at a level
what
erm some of you chose to do it because you like reading you like reading books and you thought it would be a chance to get an a level doing something that you enjoy doing
a lot of you are doing it because you want to go onto further or higher education and you needed a third a level to add to your other two
right
now could we just consider this because you're all about seventeen which means that you'll be starting taking driving lessons some of you quite shortly
have you ever met anybody who took driving lessons without wanting to drive a car at the end of it
yeah
yes
no
have you
people have said i'm taking driving lessons but i never ever want to drive a car again in my life afterwards
yeah
it's just in case they ever needed to
they
well in case
but they didn't say they didn't ever want to ever drive a car again
they didn't want to drive but they did they learnt to drive but they said they never really wanted to do it but only if they really had to do it
had to
a kind of a safety thing
yeah
most of you when you take driving lessons what end are you gonna have in view
bus driver
right yeah
yes you are taking going to take driving lessons in order that you can drive
but you're taking english lessons so as you can go and get a degree in UNK or physiotherapy
doing a levels okay
er it's you don't have to be frightened of letting me know this because it stands to reason that it's going to happen okay
now so we haven't got the reason for you gaining this skill that you had in the case of making scones playing the clarinet
you learnt to play the clarinet so she can play the clarinet
so orchestra
you don't learn to play the clarinet so that you can erm be a UNK
okay
and fair enough but you can be doing a level english because you want to be a UNK and you need that other a level is that not true
yeah er i mean i'm not picking i'm i mean UNK in my tutor group so i know that there is another a level subject that she's really very good at
and er gets more excited about than she does english you see
so erm
this is you know this is how it happens
when we're in the class full of people and we don't have the incentive that we don't want to do a level english for it's own sake but for another goal which is one further removed
what can we do about learning it
do you think there are some of the skills that we got from here now there's one rather important that i didn't put up
it was involved with your trial and error and practice but it was certainly involved with vicky and that is watching or learning from okay
now can we get some of these into our english the trial and error yes
if you avoid writing because you make mistakes then when you are forced to write an exam you'll still make the mistakes
if you write a fair amount and read your work critically and let other people criticise it you will get better
think about people who learn really important skills how did they learn them
teachers learn in part by sitting in classrooms watching other teachers teach
did you know that
er how do UNK learn to do complicated operations
yeah they learn their basic moves on UNK so it doesn't do any harm
just as you learn you learn your basic UNK of essay writing in essays that i'm not going mark for a level exams okay erm but there is another way
they have to attend enormous numbers of operations and watch experts doing it
alright
sorry
so there you go
how can we relate this to learning english
trial and error yeah do every bit of work that's set
practise writing even although you think you're rotten at it
yes
it's sometimes not obvious what mistakes you've made in english it's pretty obvious to vicky and myself when we make UNK scones
how can we tell
UNK horrible
yeah
erm and you know when you've gone wrong in the clarinet
right
do you know when you've gone wrong in the clarinet and you know when you've gone wrong with the till
and if you remember the layout of the cheese counter you find out pretty quickly that the
i didn't find out
sorry
any of the counters
er any of the counters
yeah
okay
well what happens if you go to the wrong place
if they ask for some cheese you won't get it on the meat counter will you
yeah quite
so you find out right away
okay and this is difficult when you hand essays in isn't it
very difficult
time commitment
do we have to talk about that word really
i mean how much time do you put into the red UNK
more than you put into an a level subject
full time
yeah probably
yeah and not only that not only that but dan talks about it to other fans right
now
sharing it
well we have talking english lessons and we hope that you don't stray off the topic too much
sharing okay
how often do you talk about what you've done in english with somebody else
think about it
i won't listen honest you can just discuss that with yourselves
are you good at UNK
UNK
yeah
you should have put that down
i'm gonna i can make you a paper star if you'd like
yes go on
only if you make me an UNK triangle first
UNK triangle
i mean no an UNK triangle please
an UNK triangle
okay
