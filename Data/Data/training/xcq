now
now one of the ways that you will get better is talking about it to people okay
now you may be a little embarrassed to discuss how you work with people other than in this classroom although as the course goes on you'll find more and more people doing UNK in other classes and you might find especially when you're in the upper sixth when someone in the lower sixth comes to you and says what does this mean that you can talk about it with them okay
er but you can talk about other aspects of english very easily with other people and that is what you read in newspapers okay
i read this very interesting article on UNK in government
what was in it somebody asks you
could you tell them
probably if you thought that okay i read this fascinating article about what's his name richard th you know one the one who plays UNK
UNK
UNK that UNK right i think
i read this fascinating article about him now you can see how interested i am in star trek can't you
not at all
yes but dan if dan has read an extremely interesting article about this UNK who plays in star trek and he meets his friend who is also a star trek fan
he'd tell him what was in the article probably won't ya
mm yeah probably
probably yeah yes you will
er certainly i'm sure rachel shares her information even if it's only to say you can't watch that because something else is on channel four at the same time
right
mm
you share the information you got but you talk about it and you hear what other people have got to say
right and you can do this with newspaper articles
erm you are going to be practising at least one a level skill when you do that and that's UNK
because when they say what did the article say and you tell them you're UNK it right
so you can all do a summary every single one of you okay
so keep practising that summary
the other thing you can learn is style
what is an appropriate style for an appropriate situation because you all read outside english lessons and you all know that well what about this one what sort of style is that in
mm
what would that be useful for what's the audience
language
college
what do you think that style is
how does it get its information across
by writing
a list a very simple statement
and you've worked out the audience
what about this one
do the same for this one
yeah it's good isn't it yeah
and then for these
you recognise these styles that's what you're supposed to do
you recognise this style
well alright then yeah
and this one
now have you all read examples of those styles before
have you
have you read the have you read articles or any pieces of writing that were like that before
you read examples of styles like that before
yes
have you read examples in styles like that before
yeah
that's an UNK yes
and you've read UNK giving information
right
you've all read these styles before is that true
you might not have read those actual pages before but you can recognise the style where it comes from
you could recognise the style of a weather report an UNK aunt all sorts of different types of writing er you could probably if your reading is as wide as it ought to be recognise the style of a leader from er pretty heavy newspaper guardian independent observer that sort of thing could you
could you tell the difference between that and the leading article from the sun
yeah
yeah mhm you could you wouldn't get those two UNK up
er you could tell the difference between er newspaper on crime and the chief UNK report
right
or er an article in the times about crime prevention or problems with youth you could tell the difference couldn't you
you don't seem so sure about that could you
yes of course you could and not just because there's pretty coloured pictures in one and not in the other although that's part of it that's part of the presentation
now if i asked you right to present information about this a level cos it's something you all know about okay
in the form of a very brief list of what we want to know about a level could you do it
could you make a book mark out of it
ju just no
a book mark of the information you need to know about english a levels
probably yeah
could you write an article for somebody in the top year of your last school about english a level and what they should be able to what they should expect
yes
yes definitely
yeah you could do that
would they look the same
don't know
don't know
could you write an UNK entry on UNK
no
no
no
depends how well you know the book
sorry
depends how well you know the book
well you ought to know it well enough to write five or six lines about it which is all you need for a book
right and you would know what style to use wouldn't you or would you
oh no
what's the difference between the UNK style and the other styles then
can you work that out
it just comes straight to the point
yes it's concise so is the book mark it's informative it comes straight but it it's very factual isn't it
it doesn't say some people think a levels are a good thing and some people think a levels are a bad thing it wouldn't say something like that it wouldn't be vague like that it would say a levels are the qualification issued in most sixth forms in england and wales right erm they generally need a two year course of study
they are recognised by all british universities
it'd say something like that wouldn't it
mm
the facts about a levels
right
next stage up from g c s e the stage before er a degree
you're happy about that
now we're going to work on summary skills this week and you have summary skills already
if i said to you i missed neighbours on friday what happened a lot of you could tell me couldn't you
right
yeah i yes but a lot of people could tell me right
er and if i said it about any television programme you had watched
if i sa said to you tell me could you describe to me briefly the layout of where is it you work
UNK
UNK
you could do it couldn't you
easily
easily yeah
right if i say could you summarise the plot of revenge of UNK could you do it
who
shows you how stupid i am about now which is the revenge of UNK then
star trek
yeah okay
yes i bet sorry
there you are you see
there you are and again you get the problem you see that i'm just not interested so i don't learn these things
erm and it's probably the problem that a lot of you have with UNK you see
okay red UNK oh dear character study of whatever the UNK called i've forgotten yes
you can do that yeah of course you could
right
could i just have your attention it's just the end for practice for summary you need to be very aware of why certain pieces of writing are written the way they are
mm
which audience demands which style okay we're going to be practising that over the next week and the other skills to do with summary
for the benefit of those who've forgotten
you were going to look at ways of UNK the short stories you've been looking at when y sort of to look at similarities between short stories like which ones deal with husband and wife relationships which ones are about loneliness i mean use your paper it's only there for scrap paper you haven't got to produce something that's gonna be pinned up on the wall
erm and there is some more paper over on the UNK over there if you want another sheet
but just use it first to brain storm some ideas about you know what sort of things are the stories about what ideas what themes are they dealing with and which stories deal with those themes
alright and i'll talk about well the lesson finishes at twelve so if you have about a quarter of an hour twenty minutes on that then what i want each group to have someone who will report back on what the group's been talking about in the next twenty minutes or so
alright
any questions on that
that's fine things that you haven't thought of that's coming from what they've done okay
so erm UNK for this group
shall i hold it up for you and erm or UNK hold it up for you
if you'd like to turn round turn round and address the UNK multitude
you might not be able to see all of this somebody will talk you through it
go for it
right we sub divided the whole book into four main areas we divided into husband and wife male and female loneliness and death
most of the stories into categories one or two
for a husband and wife list we've got the black UNK the stone trees and the weekend
and for male and female we've got all of the ones above and summer picnic the different nights a love match miss love letters the man
for loneliness we've got miss love letters annie no survivor stone trees UNK the visitor the picnic summer picnic different nights love match and new people
for death we've got UNK of the different nights no survivor and the visitor
yes any questions
any comments
it's better than ours
better than yours
yeah
okay
well that's a good lead into yours then
would you like to talk about yours thank you
this was UNK idea of
shut up
no
erm
UNK going to work paper
do you want again talk about this one first or gonna
no
as you can see
well what we were going to sort of do is similar to what you lot did but it UNK came out wrong
yeah
in the sense that we wanted to UNK them under things like sex race religion whatever and colour code
we're gonna be thinking about it beforehand so we can scrap that
right decided to do away with that because what's happening here is what i don't want you to do really cos we've been we've been through the stories separately
yeah
right so i actually don't want it don't want you to do that again we've looked at each story to see what it's about so it's actually better to take the idea and erm get the stories and to write the idea
now actually they do themselves down because this is where they started you see can you talk about this one
erm we started off with was that erm we would just write down any word that came up to our head in terms of relating it to the story i e we thought about memories and memories erm this is gonna match up with your isn't it
yeah
tell us what some of the ideas of could you just quickly go through the areas that you identified
the areas
well people might like to write them down if they haven't thought of them
well sex seem to
quite large
sex written three times up there
erm we've got sex and memories women versus loneliness erm race class relationships religion erm
couples UNK incest marriage sadness relations grief that's what we think covers quite a few of the stories don't we
yes well they haven't got round to it
let's what you oh
classified
under those headings
yeah
okay
we did try
yeah we did try i think that's quite pretty
okay
having failed just try again you know the UNK syndrome
right
have i got so many sheets of paper then i need about six hundred people to erm
yeah we went through these stories and tried to link all different things they go under got attitudes weight sex exploitation memories mother and child relationships old fashioned UNK aspirations working women UNK husband and wife loneliness change working in middle upper classes racism and grief and then we started again through the stories giving numbers and putting them under the headings we thought they came under but the thing is we've got a lot of them under all well not all the headings but a couple of the headings
a couple of the themes
yeah we haven't got rea like they've done you know just four
mm
but we're probably beginning to make ours smaller now
mm
yeah erm i mean i think what you've what you've actually done is identified quite a lot more areas than they had four which they did in some detail and they got the stories classified erm what you've actually thought of is far more areas which i think's good erm and maybe other areas to consider as well
erm what would be more useful if you could identify the stories that are to do with memories
a count down
they aren't UNK though are they
erm
it's miss letters is the best one erm the new people summer picnic
how did you get to work though did you just like
we had to
we all did it as part of an english lesson
but
erm what else have we got the man who kept bus station and the lone survivor memories
alright
what have we got then as a mother and child
july ghost erm summer picnic
you know sandwiches or whatever she just have like but it was kind of
she did have a mother
oh shit
and then to right let's start doing that one
yes
fall from grace
this erm old fashioned whatever it was is quite an interesting area i thought erm whether it sounded old fashioned to start with an old fashioned what
whether it was attitudes or setting or relevance to modern life you know to what extent are some of the stories relevant to their time and place and not to our time and place so that might be an interesting area to explore
erm and to look at the stories which are of a different time but are still relevant to our time and place they have a have a message for us even though they were set a hundred years ago they've still got something to say us so i think that's an area we need to explore
i certainly think that this is good in terms of it gives you a lot of areas even if they don't necessarily identify the stories so if you're sort of taking notes about which areas
yeah
that's the UNK obviously but if you're looking at the areas i mean there is er
i think you've identified a lot obviously the husband and wife relationship and obviously the men women which is one you looked at
change is an im er as an important one how different writers present change
so if you've got sort of three or four stories that you know that you could deal with the type of question you might get is discuss how erm different writers deal with the subject of change with reference to probably about three stories
er loneliness i mean a lot so many of them deal with loneliness you'd think that was a UNK of women short story writers i think
i can't see what's here working oh class the class thing comes out
grief
i suppose grief loneliness loss they're all UNK aren't they so any one of those could come into it
UNK attitudes again there's a bit of a cross over there
sex exploitation
i think between you i should think you've covered quite a lot of erm of the areas there
i mean some and some of the issues are perhaps not the main issue of the story but er are sort of peripheral if i can use that word on the on the edge like identified weight as a problem which a lot of middle aged women seem to encounter and get obsessed by it but actually the weight thing there but the central thing is the relationship between the husband and wife and the weight issue is sort of i don't know tied up with it but it wasn't the main issue
right so that's a brief gallop the various issues in the short stories does anyone want to er speak now or for a long time hold your peace
does anyone want to say anything on the subject
not gonna say anything for the microphone
okay then erm can i collect the pens up then and erm wednesday you're all going to write your assigned essay don't forget
julie
have you got time to somebody
essay on wednesday
right the apostrophe
are you ready
the apostrophe
right the UNK at a level expect an a level student to be able to use the apostrophe UNK and correctly so let's just erm go back to basics with the apostrophe as it seems to cause more confusion than practically anything else
when an apostrophe comes just before an s at the end of a word it shows that something belongs to that word
so you write the car's UNK the UNK bike and the king's head it's an owner plus possession and the owner has the apostrophe of the thing that comes immediately afterwards
alright
so if a word the word the cars occur at the end of a sentence as in erm i went to the UNK and saw the cars full stop
there would be absolutely no u need to use an apostrophe because there's no possession to follow it it's always got to be in that pattern of owner and possession and if it's one then it's before the s and if it's more than one it's after the s
so that covers the next point about UNK
you don't add another s obviously UNK suits are examples
the exception because there's always an exception to every rule
if the plural word doesn't end in an s you use the apostrophe and then you add an s and these i think are the only there are three er is men women and children because the UNK form is man changes to men so is apostrophe s the women the same the children the same
so that's the only place i think where you're going to find where the word is a plural the apostrophe comes before the s is where the plural didn't end in an s
write the apostrophe and then the s and that's the only reason for putting an apostrophe before an s or after an s at the at the end of a word
now that's not every word this is what happens when you start doing the apostrophe that there'll then be a UNK of whenever you see a word ending in s ah word ending in s use an apostrophe regardless of whether you should use one or not now you are a lovely think about it
if it's not in the owner possession pattern then you don't use an apostrophe
there are lots of words that end in s and you don't need to use an apostrophe on them unless it's an owner
which as a straightforward plural is a straightforward plural and the UNK sin is putting an apostrophe on a word which is a verb which shows really you're not thinking about it
you know she sits by the window
well what logic is gonna put an apostrophe on sits
it's a verb
you're only ever going to get an apostrophe on a noun
you can't possibly have it on a verb and that's another little rule you might like to think of that you're only going to get the apostrophe on a noun and you will never get an apostrophe on a pronoun
so that why it's UNK
never has an apostrophe it's only on a noun that you're going to do it so you could pick up sort of just little clues there as to how to remember what you're doing
right a little exercise for you
exercise one put in UNK where they are needed in these sentences
okay sentences
think about it though don't just UNK put them on any word that ends in s make sure you know why you're putting it there
okay
one minute we're welcome to UNK with the person next to you don't have to do it in splendid isolation
how are you doing have you finished
no
no
the first group of four
no
the UNK are causing people a lot of difficulty
in number one what have you erm put the apostrophe on
erm on UNK
where
between the e and the s at the end
correct
and in between the t and the s on assistants
and that's the UNK of you all is it
no
no
should be an apostrophe over UNK as well
there should be an apostrophe on UNK as well
so there should be one on assistants too
yes
yeah
because it's the UNK assistant
and it's the UNK chair
and the UNK chair
so it's the UNK
UNK chair
so i should think both of them were apostrophe before the so you got
three
how many of you got the three right in that one
is that all
right erm martin number two
erm well i just put one on friends between the d and the s
you put one between the d and the s of friends
yeah
father's
it's father's as well
certainly i think fathers as in my father's friend yeah and my father's UNK yes so one r and s of father's in between the d and the s of UNK
and councils
and councils
and you'd like one on yes
where would you put in on councils
between l and s
between the l and the s
tell me has anyone got an apostrophe on UNK
no
no
shoot yourself
i have
shoot yourself
between the t and the s
on UNK
come on get your brain going
after the s
what what's the possession that comes after UNK
after the s
there ain't one aunt is there
no there ain't one aunt
there ain't one
i know there ain't
right
okay so it's on father's UNK and council's and on nothing else in that sentence
i'm not doing well
erm UNK
number three
erm i put the UNK between n and s in stations
yeah between the n and the s of stations
mm i put one after s in UNK
you put one af after the s of UNK
mm
no
between the y and the s
because if it was UNK it would be i e s
i e s yes
if UNK is plural it would be i e s and you would have the apostrophe after the s then but it's obviously UNK cos it ends in y so you put it after the y and the s
and erm charlie
the sausage skins
oh yeah
i put one between
pardon
i haven't done that one
you haven't done that one
no
well would you like to have a go
no
put one between p and s on UNK
you'd like one between the p and the s of UNK yes i would agree with you there
erm the n and the s on skins
no
no
no
UNK what
no
UNK what what's the word that follows it charlie
are
skins are
it's not you can't have it on skins
UNK then
yes we'll have one on UNK between the d and the s
don't have to though
pardon
it looks like it could be a name because UNK could be the name of a company
like
well
no it's not
i mean if the company was UNK then
in a UNK but UNK you don't know though you start
at the end
i think you should like forget that one for a while because that
but you can't mr UNK can you
well i did i don't know i've crossed mine out so i wasn't you see
oh right
and you can see the crossing out there
we should have an enquiry whether it's UNK
i don't think we need to type an enquiry i think that the people who realise that the fact that you had got there is meant to indicate to you that name of the firm was UNK and therefore by using by using UNK sausage skins they're expecting you to use apostrophe s
yeah
erm and so that's all you need
between the d and the s of UNK and the p and the s of UNK
did anyone put did anyone put apostrophe after the s of UNK
no
cos it's one of these words where the plural doesn't end in an s
sh
right put your hands up if you got all of those right
okay
i would have got them all right except for
fine right
now try the next s set of four then and erm see if you can er improve your score
i like the second one next one
that's right
it's they if it's the same
would you would you like to do a group UNK on this one because erm can you come up with a version that your group agrees on
yeah that's true wendy
your UNK eyes will have noticed that there is someone sitting in this room with a tape recorder and erm it's should be quite interesting for you to know what he is doing
his name's jim
and he's
hello jim
alright
being friendly
and he is he is recording you erm
he's recording you because there is a project under way which is known as the british national corpus
which may say seem to you something to do with dead bodies but it's not
erm but it is a body it's corpus as in body and what the british national corpus is doing is putting together a massive amount of spoken english erm from all sorts of different UNK and one of the UNK which they want spoken english from is an educational context and so they are having to record you people as they've been recording some other people erm in other educational institutions around the country and so on
the idea is not to make any judgements about you people for instance the whole thing is totally anonymous but it's to hear the state of the language as it is i assume at the moment and what's going to happen is they're collecting a massive quantity of erm of words
they are UNK it all it runs into millions but i can never remember how many millions
they're UNK it all there are people going to UNK all of this write it all out attach UNK tags to us and this body of work is going to be t available to students of language and so on
so erm you are not to be in any way i mean i'm going to talk at you anyway most of the afternoon unfortunately but i do want you to respond
but don't be inhibited by and don't perform for the microphone that's there because that's not
so just forget it's there
what it's about
what
just totally forget it's there right
yes
yes
but that doesn't mean turn on a display of the kind of language that you wouldn't normally use
mm
when you're forgetting it's there
yes
right what i want to work on today is and 's reminded me that incidentally that essay which you're due to write in class on the monday we come back after half term there isn't a monday we come back after half term
brilliant
students aren't in on that monday
so it will have to be in for thursday of that week so you've got another couple of days in that first week back
right i want to pick up on i've started looking at your tests the history of language ones and i've actually marked only the section where you actually re wrote the er early modern english extract and i want to pick up on that instantly and talk about that and the ways you the way you can go around no i'm not gonna give you that
the way you can treat this task
the UNK task i might tell you is half of one of your exam papers
that is it's worth half the marks on one of your three papers
so it is worth one sixth of your overall mark for this subject
is the way you go about a task exactly the same as that one i gave you the other day
but it won't necessarily be erm an a some language taken from a historical period
there have been other examples used though not many that aren't historical but there have been for instance there was an account of a road accident i'll give most of these to you as exercises
an account of a road accident written by someone who's learning english and had a very limited vocabulary on it
erm so the UNK task each time is exactly the same you had to rewrite the extract in modern standard english and then comment on any differences and explain why those differences occurred but they are quite often erm eighteenth or nineteenth century UNK from books descriptions of things erm dialect descriptions of events and things like that and last year's one on the one of last year's paper was er a middle english one
it was a letter written by er erm a sixteenth century woman to her husband and again it had commenting on the language used
so it's vital that you get this exercise right and it and you mustn't just think of it as part of the study of history of language it's not it's a er a definite part of your course
which will be coming up whatever form of language is used
i will give you this to look at
now the major problem that came up the other day was that i thought i had given you a very easy extract to translate into modern english and it turned out not to be such an easy extract obviously
erm it wasn't
the first sentence didn't give you any problems whatsoever er well very few people but the problems came after that
you will need some paper
at the bottom of the page i had suggested how you should go about this exercise throw paper around the floor that's all the paper there is here so
okay don't take too much and that is to first make a literal translation and then to try and put it into idiomatic english
now if you don't know these terms i'm sure you have come across them really
literal
what well you define for me what's a literal translation
word for word
word for word
yes
why might that not work as a as a idiomatic translation
what does idiomatic mean
making sense
ideally
making sense in sentence
idiomatic means more than just making sense in english
correct word order
UNK use of
mm UNK yes
it also means using the kinds of erm vocabulary and phraseology which are normally used
it in every day usage
right so a literal translation might turn out to be very stiff and UNK and not the way most people would use language
so the there is a distinction in terms there you've got to do a literal translation first
because if you don't if don't do a word by word translation as some of you did you may miss the meaning of certain words and that might totally alter your perception of what's being said and then what you should wh when you've done a literal translation you will have a very stiff erm u unusual version of it written in modern english vocabulary but you'll find that word ordering and things like that won't be appropriate and sometimes the vocabulary aren't the kind of words that would normally be used now
therefore you will need to rewrite that in a way which mean something to modern erm readers
so can we just look at the extract that was given what language would it have been translated from incidentally
old english
middle english
early modern
use your brain look at look at what the extract is drawn from
something called de UNK
latin
from latin yes
erm so it's in itself is translation into english of some earlier writing
but the important thing as far as we were concerned as is that the translation was done by john de UNK in thirteen ninety eight and some of you like sam were able to quote the middle english period and place thirteen ninety eight towards the end of the middle english period it's really on the verge of early modern english
other people for who anything which isn't modern is old english claimed that it was old english
no nobody in this room did
okay word for word
give me modern words through the first line please darren
among all flowers er of the world the flower of the rose is erm
try and say it
which one
say that next word
finish the sentence
the flower of the rose is
right
and
and what
UNK
UNK yeah
ye prize
ye prize
yes so any words here that look UNK turn out when you say them to be modern to be exactly the same as modern words except that of course you don't have an f ending as you know
th what's happened is that this spelling th this UNK of spelling has occurred in english as some of you obviously don't seem to know and your modern english versions you speak used it
erm and UNK there what does UNK mean
UNK
to bear something it UNK the prize
the rose UNK the prize
who knows that to bear means
shows
mm
shows
no that's bare as in b a r e i suppose
UNK
oh it has
no it hasn't
holds
mm yeah al almost holds so it's obviously a word which has now become erm UNK for you people
to bear something means to carry it
yeah did you
well you didn't say it very UNK i don't know interesting
okay the next sentence erm UNK translate
erm i just read it or
yeah try and erm put it into literal translation to modern english
erm
erm through its virtues and sweet smell
no sorry
do it word for word
we'll do that later
oh erm because of virtues and sweet UNK
right and by cause i think by cause is literally what's said there but of course yes that we now read that as because
virtues and sweet UNK
now again is the word UNK lost
what's UNK refer to
to
if something's UNK what sense are you are you using it
taste
taste yeah
UNK literally means taste
biscuits are UNK
so are UNK
indeed yes
so it literally means taste in this case
virtues i mean you know what virtues are although again people try to smell it smell it spell it that way
it's actually is spelt in modern english with an i and virtue in this sense in what sense would it mean
it's the cause ah sorry it's the cause it's the rose has virtues
what sense of the word virtue are we er using this we're not saying it's UNK and it UNK well
what are we saying
that it's good
good goodness yeah beneficial qualities
UNK erm the problem why i don't think any of you UNK the fact that we're talking there about UNK is that erm you probably don't realise that historically the rose was much eaten
ro rose UNK erm were eaten in fact there was a thriving erm industry near paris for drying rose UNK which were used in medicine and also were used erm to UNK and to they were put in cakes and things like that
and in fact have you ever eaten turkish UNK
mm
yes
that the flavour in turkish UNK is rose water that's actual essence of rose UNK
and rose water and rose was used a lot in cooking er until quite recently and it can still be
right the next sentence erm UNK
yes
do a literal
a literal
yeah
full by fairness they feed the sight and place the smell by UNK the touch by soft handling
okay go back on that
place is the interesting one there
say the word
UNK
UNK by fairness they feed the sight and UNK the smell
UNK the smell
UNK
place this place
you're obviously not going to get it are you it's another vowel change
erm
it's a yeah it's a vowel it's a vowel change and it's simply please UNK
they please i thought in context you would have got that
a fairness they feed the sight and UNK the smell by UNK
mm
like their UNK the sense of smell
no
the touch by soft handling
then i think that the next sentence is actually the hardest one in literal terms but word for word is easy enough
erm sam could you try that the last sentence
what do i have to do just say it
say it in modern english word for word
and would be it's supposed to UNK
UNK yeah
and
and remember i gave you this word that was UNK
UNK
UNK
virtues against many illnesses fr and UNK
right
against many yes said illnesses and UNK
so in literal terms you have you've given me among all flowers of the world the flower of the rose is chief and UNK the prize or and bears the prize because obviously the erm UNK for the third person UNK is going to be you're going to use the modern version
and by cause of virtues or and because of virtues and sweet smell and UNK
for by fairness they feed the sight and UNK the smell by UNK the touch of soft handling and UNK
UNK by virtue and sorry UNK and UNK by virtue against many UNK and UNK
the problems that you raise now some of you ob obviously didn't recognise some of those words like please UNK i don't think anyone recognised and full meaning of things like UNK but what the problem was the changes in word order
look at the second sentence no the third sentence
for by fairness they feed the sight and UNK the smell by UNK the touch by soft handling
what's it actually saying
paul you looked up at the times
no don't look at that UNK
look at the at the thing at the top
what's fairness
what's
sweet UNK
yeah well that's just that's just two words th it's actually saying three different things
what does fairness mean in this case
oh we've caught another one haven't we
beauty
what's this
beauty yes
beauty fair to be fairness to look at
for by for by beauty they feed the sight and UNK the smell by UNK the touch by soft handling
see if you can UNK that into modern standard english
runs down to these versions underneath
and so on
i shouldn't have given it to you
yeah
that's why i wasn't going to hand this out right at the beginning because i wanted to make you work at it a bit more er then you can when you've got those two versions written underneath
it's actually a very simple statement that's been made in that sentence
but by their beauty they feed the sight yeah
they please they please the smell by UNK so their UNK the sense of smell
now the thing is we can refer to sight and touch and hearing but we don't refer to the sense of smell just as smell in modern english
they don't you don't say er this UNK my smell because my smell actually has a totally different meaning
erm but that's the meaning in which it it's meant here so by fairness they feed the sight by their UNK they please the sense of smell and the UNK of them the UNK to touch UNK the touch UNK the sense of touch
you what some you were erm put off by there was the fact that these senses i referred to just by their noun like smell and touch and you didn't recognise there was reference to the whole sense
the last sentence is the most difficult one because of this word UNK which of course is very rarely used in this sense now
but you can have the sense of UNK as something you know people UNK an UNK
in fact it's used by all UNK who often use very erm old fashioned erm vocabulary UNK the UNK of the opposing team and things like that
well you wouldn't actually use the that kind of vocabulary in every day life
erm and it means to standing up against erm rejecting oh no i don't think rejecting is
but i mean i suppose if we take sense of standing up against it's saying and it stands up against and it UNK against many UNK and UNK and inserted into the middle of that and UNK it by virtue so it helps by its goodness to UNK and UNK
so the process that you have to carry out then is to find a way of transferring your literal translation once you've worked out word for word what is being said into terms which mean something to a modern reader or UNK
but the other important element is that you have to reflect the style of the original look at the notes i've made at the bottom of the page please
so you're trying to find something which is in the language of the modern speaker
but also which reflects the style of the original and that means the for instance in the second sentence no third sentence for by fairness they feed the sight and UNK the smell by UNK and touch by self UNK by soft handling
you actually have a sense of style there are three different sections to that description and you have and there is actually some repetition involved erm by starting each by this reference to the sight the smell the touch and you have to and that's the kind of UNK element that you have to incorporate into your version and i put a note at the bottom too that there are times when you can't totally update this kind of work
for instance then the very last point being made up in that rose thing is it says that it protects against UNK and UNK
now obviously you can translate the idea of something being a preventative about illness or sickness but it's very difficult to suggest in idiomatic modern english that roses can be a protection against UNK because you really we really don't have that kind of concept normally now although there are many uses of erm groups of people who might retain such a concept and if something like that arises you obviously can't make it idiomatic because there's just no way it's going to work UNK in english
okay look underneath the oh sorry in between underneath the box at the top
the first version there is one that i did before i even looked at your at any of the UNK and i got myself into some UNK of trying to translate virtues and ended up with beneficial properties erm which is hardly perhaps very idiomatic and the one underneath that is UNK and the absent writer not that she could be embarrassed because she's not here erm and she's actually UNK more than i have by half a line you'll understand
have a look at that i mean it would have been better if UNK was here because i don't want to criticise i mean i used UNK because it was actually probably the best one that was done by anyone in the group
are there any ways in which you think that it does or does not work particularly well looking at hers mine's more boring hers she actually UNK from the from the text more
compare the text at the beginning with hers the middle english text with hers and tell me is there anything which she has caught well or anything which she has missed out or look at the first sentence is she right there
she missed out the UNK the prize
right so there's one actual reference gone
she doesn't repeat flowers
no and i didn't do that until i read someone UNK and he had repeated flowers and i thought why has he repeated flowers and realised that in fact that it is necessary
yeah because the point that's being made is that it's only the flower of the rose which has all these properties it's not the whole bush itself presumably
what about this second sentence
are you happy with that
ben
why
no
why you mean you mean you're not happy with it why
i don't know
clue
i was i wasn't
oh right
it doesn't in the middle english bit it's doesn't say that it's a strong smell
right that's true
yeah it doesn't say it was a strong smell no
well else doesn't wh what else does it say in that sentence
look are you are you looking second sentence UNK second sentence this is due to a strong and sweet smell in middle english it says by cause of virtues and sweet smell and UNK
it says something about taste
so it's the taste thing and also the virtues element is has gone hasn't it
it actually that actually wasn't the sentence i made i can't count it was actually the next sentence i wanted you to look at
because this is the one i want you to be particularly be conscious of
what about her version of the third sentence it's beautiful to look at wonderful to smell as well as being extremely soft to touch
anthony
what
i thought that was pretty good
it's pretty good it's pretty good in UNK the meaning
in what way that isn't it pretty good
UNK
you're happy with it
he really loves it it's
UNK
the third sentence it's beautiful to look at etc comment on UNK version
well it's good cos er in the old english one
it's
it's not old english
sorry the middle english one
it's er three sections it's er that's sentences as well it's got like you know using commas and er
the same sentence structures
yeah that's it
er right so UNK she has erm she's picked up and she's actually picked up the UNK as well of that whereas in the middle english one it was th the sight the UNK the touch no it was the smell the touch she has used an UNK an UNK of a verb which gets away from the problem that we don't use UNK for these things
to look at to smell to touch so that she's erm actually found a way of getting the same UNK
erm but in fact she's missed the third sentence and where she said that the rose has UNK many UNK and UNK erm whereas in fact what it says is it UNK and UNK against UNK and UNK which is a totally different element
we can't put
right can you put that away somewhere that sheet
no this
put that away
no
yes i'm being UNK
yes you don't need it for what we're going to do now
oh this is actually from varieties this extract and erm i'm giving it to you cos varieties here but because the other element which we haven't considered is the actual appearance on the page of erm middle english well this is actually early modern english
but it's still right on that on that turning point it's a hundred and fifty years after the john UNK theme that we just looked at
but the language is very similar erm although it's into the early modern english period
have a quick erm read through it please out loud everybody just quietly to yourselves but read it out loud because it makes much more sense as they sound
okay you've got struck once you get yourself round all the letter forms and so on
does anybody know roman UNK
yeah
yes
yes
so what chapter is it at the top
ten
ten
oh no eight
eight
eight right
erm line four and five how many days
six
this is a nice mixture
a hundred and
something
fifty
fifty
fifty
a hundred and fifty days
erm what about line oh i see it's not line a hundred the lines are numbered in an odd way
four erm the on this line marked five how
the something the date
the seventeenth
seventeenth day of the
seventh month
seventh month
until the tenth month and after the end of
fifty
sixty days
it's forty
sixty
forty yeah
cos the x is before the okay
forty days
so does UNK does everybody know their roman UNK
yeah
yeah
good
in that case erm UNK would you read out the first er paragraph there
god remembered UNK and all is that an f
no
can anyone tell him
beasts
beasts
beasts
right yes
cattle were with him in the UNK and god made the wind blow is it upon the earth and waters and the UNK the windows of heavens were opened
no it doesn't say opened
it's that same letter form all the time
the one that looks like an f
no
and the of heaven was within and the waters returned to the earth and UNK after the end of a hundred and fifty days
a hundred and fifty days
okay
erm let's just read to the end erm can i UNK on erm matthew will you read to the end
with the UNK upon the mountains of UNK the seventeenth day of the seventh month and the waters went away and decreased until the tenth month and the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains appeared and after the end of forty days UNK opened the window of the UNK which he had made and sent forth a UNK which went out ever going and coming again until the waters were dried up upon the earth
right they dried up upon the earth
right they're are obviously some unusual letter forms there
such as what
erm unusual UNK sorry
the f t for
the f yeah the f s well i'll come back to that
what else
sorry the u v UNK you've got that one yes
the y and i
the y and i i'm sure that is yes y and i UNK
anything else
e UNK
what UNK
the e UNK
the e UNK is used indeed it is you'll an example
sorry i can't hear you what
listen
i am listening but you UNK
like it's got upon but it hasn't got the n on the end
right
but what has it got
a little thing above
yeah it's got a little mark above the above the vowel sound
what else in their performance are unusual
they've got double p's everywhere where in today we've put
that's the spelling isn't it that's the spelling thing rather than actual letter forms
so you've done you got that f and f the these UNK and UNK you've done the u UNK where the letters are actually changed
the i y one is more a spelling convention than actual letter forms
you've got the use of things like upon and there was something or other else
heaven spelt like that and so on so the final n sound is missing
what else have you said i've forgotten
e UNK
what
e UNK
e UNK yes
again that's to some extent it's a UNK convention rather than a er a letter form convention but it is extra letters
there are other things
where it's got the it's y
yeah right
it's got the is spelt as a y with e a tiny e written above it
so
some of the
UNK is used for and which is not used in modern printing and you've got roman UNK
so if you were commenting on such a section as this you would have a great deal of things to say on just on the letter forms as they appear on the page
tell me what the rule is for the usage of the UNK
look at all the words with s in and s t's and you should be able to draw from that a rule which is being observed by this printer in which position is the s printed as an f
before a t
before a t
before a t and there's another one too
e
before an e
before an e
after
after an l
after an l
i forgot
at the beginning of a sentence at the beginning of a word
it's
in the middle of the word
yeah it's actually having said that it erm it varies doesn't it
because in fact it's in the middle of some words erm but as it's at the beginning of a word which i now can't find
just say it
where
yes sorry you could say it again is sent on line seven or whatever is numbered seven
apart from that it's only used in the UNK of words and the one clear rule is that s followed by a t is printed in this way
in fact there that that's that printing of s that shape of s followed by a t was still used by some printers right up until the twentieth century because it's actually you know that when prints print was put together by hand by picking up each letter erm and as UNK it separately there was actually always a stop letter a stop erm i can't remember what it's called although i did some printing years ago erm lump a die thing with s t already printed together because s t is used so much in combination the erm printer didn't always have to set up s followed by a t but had a UNK of s t's already prepared and they were often virtually joined together in this way and erm i got i got an edition of i think it's the UNK of jane UNK printed in the nineteen twenties which still use that shape of s t but used as the small s for any other forms
you'll sometimes find that there's a distinction made between the s and the and the f because the s doesn't have either has a tail on it or doesn't have as big a bar across as the f one
but in this case the printer is using exactly the same UNK obviously for s and f
the erm what's the rule that you observe with this dash above a vowel
before an
sorry
before an n
it's not it's not just before it it's it actually indicates an n
yeah
doesn't it yeah
it shows that in fact the following letter is an n
erm i don't have any idea not knowing very much about this why that was done
they've done it differently
in one in one heaven they've done er they've just put the n in one in one heaven they put the little thing on the e
yeah
they it could be something to do with space erm i don't really know
erm but you can easily see what the rule is can't you i mean it's enough it's enough to be able to recognise that there is a pattern to that usage
this word here this again it's a it's a UNK device
the is one of the most common words in english and to set up the all the time would be very time consuming and so this symbol was obviously available to the printer and obviously what it spells out is ye which you now know from pubs that are called things like ye UNK erm hen and that sort of thing
so it's it is a it's a survival in that m in that respect and ye is t is merely erm an UNK version of the and would have been pronounced ye
erm UNK is quite interesting you all know that symbol because it's used in handwriting although nowadays it nowadays you would tend to use something like that i don't know what do you do you do you sort of if you want to write and quickly
erm but people who learned UNK writing used to do this for their and
like that
yes
like that
like that
yeah that's it
right and that that's obviously a an and if you look at it it's got a few less UNK than that one but it's a it's a version of
erm what why is it unusual to see that there
because it's a UNK
it's a UNK yes
carry on
what
it's a UNK and
it's formal writing
you don't use that
you don't normally see it in print do you
no it's used it's used in situations where an UNK can be made or er erm an abstract symbol can be made but again this was used normally in print even in printing of UNK and UNK and erm and important documents right up u you know up and well into the nineteenth century before it was considered that was not formal enough and that the word and had to be written out formally are there any words in this section which you can't find a modern english version of easily
there aren't really are there
in that case take the first paragraph erm take this first paragraph you lot over here
the second paragraph you three the third paragraph you three and do me an idiomatic version in five minutes
erm
now you want to if you want to sub divide that first paragraph if one of you took it to and the waters ceased and the other half took it from and the UNK of the deep
so that can you could give me two please give me a literal translation and then an idiomatic one as if you're doing a modern bible
and you've got five minutes to do both
so one person write and the other one just say what they're writing
right you should have finished this have you
yeah
yeah
have you three over there
okay right stop please you're out of your heads if you haven't got it on to paper
now first section that's you two isn't it
no we're in the second bit
oh these two
right give me this idiomatic first version please and any anything which is which you consider to be not idiomatic
right
i'd like to know
so can you listen to this please erm you have to finish in your heads now
listen to this first one
now when you're trying to distinguish whether it's idiomatic or not don't you know it's very difficult to find the fine line between something which is formal and still idiomatic and something which is idiomatic through being too UNK informal
i'll try and explain what i mean
idiomatic means in wi with a sort of with UNK with word ordering with a choice of vocabulary which is immediately recognised what as modern english but if this thing is written in a formal style then it is fair enough that the modern idiomatic version will also be very formal
idiomatic doesn't mean UNK
it doesn't have to be in every day speech patterns
if it's a fairly formal written thing but there it has got to use word ordering grammar punctuation vocabulary which are those which are presently used
so are you ready er to give us a version now UNK or UNK or someone
come on UNK
are you all working on the same one incidentally or have you got separate ones
no
cos he's done the last bit
and god remembered UNK the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the UNK
god made the wind blow upon earth and stop the water
okay
everyone listening this time let's have this once more
to comment on if the if there's anything there that doesn't read to you as being totally idiomatic
go again
god remembered UNK the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the UNK
god made the wind blow upon the earth and stop the water
you wouldn't say beasts
say animals wouldn't you
you'd say animals
right
okay
UNK creatures
i used these
yes but you probably use it in a slightly different context don't you
you might be using it as an as an insult
erm
and you actually did god remembered UNK and the beasts didn't you
yeah
why did you cut all at that point
i don't know it was his idea
erm cos three stating three things aren't there and i thought it would be easy to
sorry you were stating
well he was stating god remembered UNK the beasts and the cattle
he was stating three things
just god remembered UNK and all the animals
so instead of saying and all the time
what are cattle
no
that's what i thought
yes i mean i think it was i don't think that removing all actually did anything but shh and only if you're if you're adding to this please
so when you got what did you do then
she well i read your one
alright UNK read your one
erm god made the wind blow upon the earth and stopped the water
that's right
right all i was going to ask was have you have you started a new sentence there or have you got that as part of the original sentence
started a new sentence
should you have
should i have started a new sentence then
if we're in modern standard english
yeah
so you're going to start a new UNK start a new sentence with and
no i didn't we didn't
what did you start it with
it started with
ah so you cut and
yes
yeah
right
right
because another way to have done it would have been if you're going to do it all no you didn't do it all in one sentence that's right
if you were going to you could do it all in one sentence that that's the other point i was going to make
but you in modern standard english you wouldn't begin a second sentence with and
no
because as you'll remember it is UNK upon to begin a sentence with and i always cross it out in your essays don't i
okay the second section please
the UNK of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain of heaven was UNK
the waters returned to the earth and after erm and were calm after a hundred and fifty days
okay i think we'd better take this slowly
alright
first phrase
the UNK of the deep and the
okay UNK of the deep
idiomatic
no
what would have what would the reference be to that one could possibly use
the sea
i think that's probably just a bit bald isn't it
UNK how could you convey the sense of waters UNK up out of the deep or something
waves
the raging
currents
currents
the raging currents
the raging currents
certainly did you say the UNK of the deep
certainly the deep i think we would very rarely use the deep to talk about the sea now
i don't think we would
i just write down what she says
no
you turned round and said do it in that one so i'm doing it in that one then you changed to doing it in that one
it weren't my fault
right
for whatever reason what ca can you come up with another version of the UNK of the deep
the raging waves
the what waves
the raging waves
the raging waves of the UNK
the raging waves
yes
that's pretty that's pretty dramatic isn't it
well it's certainly it's idiomatic
the UNK currents
the deep sea spray
no i don't know about a spray i don't know although the fountain the fountain idea doesn't it
so they could have a shower
shh people
what you're working towards here is obviously to say that they were stopped and that this was the end of the flood so it's got to be something very major and something like UNK currents current currents or raging waves does do that i suppose
what about the windows of heaven
wha what does the image mean
what's
clouds
well yeah what whatever it is that the rain comes through from heaven something that opens in heaven and lets the rain come through
so if you're doing a
a purely modern translation what could you use for windows of heaven and UNK is suggesting clouds the clouds were stopped the an and stopped in this sense means closed the windows of heaven were closed
possibly well no cos they because it then goes on to the rain in heaven i was going to say maybe send the rain
clouds cleared
the clouds the clouds cleared or were cleared because it's god doing all of this
UNK of the deep and windows of heaven were stopped
angry storm
the waves of the deep and the er clouds were
cloud
cleared were dispersed and what have you got next anyway after that that's obviously a very UNK thing because it's using UNK images which are very difficult to move into modern standard english but what have we got for the rain of heaven please
and the rain
and the rain does what
was UNK was stopped
okay well yeah you're changing it as you go now
yeah
the rain of heaven
we always use that kind of phrase
the heavens are falling down
the acid UNK bring it up to date
the rain of heaven
could you give me another version of that please
the rain of heaven in idiomatic standard english
the weather forecast
no
yes it does
and it
just say the rain
the falling rain
falling rain even the rain from the heaven UNK no you can't use UNK rain in this case can you
the rain from the sky
yeah it's not the heaven i'm UNK to it's saying the rain of heaven we don't use that kind of structure now
we would say the rain from heaven or erm UNK rain
UNK rain
UNK rain yes something like that
rain which god sent
erm was UNK and quickly changed that to was stopped or was prevented or was UNK was not refused
so carry on rest of the sentence please
the waters returned to the earth
from that's not what it says though is it
what
it says and the waters returned from off the earth
so what's it saying
the waters returned from off the earth
so what's what where did they return
to the heaven
to no
sorry
they UNK
they came from the earth and that's where they returned
UNK
they UNK yes
there were waters on the earth but when the rain stopped the waters went from off the earth they went back to the UNK didn't they
did they still think the earth was flat in those days
even well almost even at the time when this last translation was doing but certainly the time the bible was written
what's that got to do with it
because obviously i'm not very no it's all right
why did they think the earth was flat for
what is it
just UNK into my head
sorry
why did they think it was flat
well you can't actually see a curve can you when you look around
no but it's
sorry
like that
did they actually they thought then it just ended like drop off
literally
the fear the fear when UNK of exploration were going out right up to the UNK was that the boats would actually run off the end of the earth and fall into a void
who is it that went over first
went over
you mean over the edge
no i mean
where
oh i know what i'm talking about
are you talking about UNK
yeah
in fourteen ninety two
yes
but that's beside the point
so shh please UNK the waters returned from off the earth so y it's saying the waters erm ran off the earth UNK from
waters UNK
UNK off
that's what he had really
carry on
and were calm after a hundred and UNK fifty days after
yeah okay
i think we'll just about move on to the next paragraph please is that you lot paul
the UNK on top of the UNK mountains on the seventeenth of july
the water
there was a lovely there was a lovely slow reaction there
as everybody thought july
seventeenth day of the seventh month
i mean depends where your counting the months from and i don't know UNK did they start in january
didn't they mean that as in a period of time they'd been stuck in the UNK
yeah do that
well i don't know
alright
paul carry on
the water continued to UNK until october
carry on
and on the first on the first of october the tops of the mountains appeared
okay
you always know
that's what i'd say anyway
what
you always know when paul does a version it's going to be his own version
but you do have to you do have to be aware of being too clever for your own good because they only want a translation
erm to do a complete re writ UNK re written version is often what you are what you are allowed to do but i think you will al also need to show them a fairly literal translation first
so anyway you did UNK upon UNK mountains and UNK was arguing with that one saying the mountains of UNK
i mean the mountain is usually referred to as mount UNK isn't it i didn't know several of them erm is UNK the place where the mountains were or is it actually the name of the mountains
the name of the mountains
no
it's the place where the mountains were
a mountain range
no it says mount UNK
yeah
so what
so yeah i'm not sure whether it whether one should translate it as the mountains of UNK or the UNK mountains
certainly modern usage would suggest the name going before the mountains wouldn't it and that's what you've opted for and the july one i really don't know about
erm
but
the waters went away and decreased
i think in relation to the fact that we were talk that the earliest earlier UNK about the water running off the earth
i don't think you could assume that they UNK
they must of how else what else
i would i would say UNK
no ran down you know ran off into the ocean ran into the rivers and off into the ocean that way
i think all you need to say is they
UNK
UNK decreased
got less
died down
died down
the assumption that they UNK is not there
i thought that though
sorry
nothing
you have you have taken the word UNK out of the air and it's an assumption you must cross that out
well it's a valid assumption cos where UNK go UNK
it gets UNK eventually
if you er if the people of west sussex a couple of weeks ago when there was flooding around UNK they're actually going to wait for the waters to UNK
not in the middle of winter
it'd be gone within a few hours
that's because it UNK into the earth
drains
drains
yeah
UNK like
i think you need to tidy up a bit
UNK on concrete
it's not going to sink into the concrete is it
unless they're on concrete it's very shallow and UNK is possible when your talking about floods on land yes it's going to UNK into the earth it's gonna run down
run down the drain then
i remember when i was
yeah
okay
apart from that i think we can accept a erm that this th the that that's a fairly reasonable meaning
what about the last one please whose gonna read that
darren UNK
listen please
shh
at the end of forty days UNK opened the window of the UNK that he had made and sent out a UNK which came and went until the waters upon the earth had dried up
yeah well did everyone hear that
no
could we have it again with a bigger voice
at the end of forty days UNK opened the window of the UNK
shh no please listen
he had made and sent out a UNK which came and went until the waters upon the earth had dried up
and sent out a UNK what
which came and went until the waters upon the earth had dried up
right i see
which came and went is there in some way i think you've lost a bit of meaning there
in came and went because it's got which went out ever going and coming again the ever aspect has gone so how could you get that
or came and went continually or something like that
constantly
went back
and the last shh please the last part of the sentence i
erm upon the earth hang on and went until the waters upon the earth had UNK
well okay right what i would like you to do on your bit of paper
on your on the sheet of paper that you've got could you now that sheet could you write down please different letter form differences and put a sub heading that says something like letter forms the other one of these was that
with the y with the little t's above it
that one and that so you've got one two three four five six different sorts of letter form changes to comment on
could you
i suggest you do it on the same sheet that's got the th the i can't see a copy
sorry
actually do it on this sheet somewhere on there so you'll have a revision of
make a list of the UNK of the letter form changes
right
then make a list of some of the obvious spelling changes which i'm going to ask you about in a moment
what just do what we've really just said
yeah
just summarise
on the sheet
on this sheet cos then you've got it for revision
yeah
oh on this sheet
on that sheet
okay
and what you need to do is obviously indicate what the modern version is next to that
shut up alright
paul
i was going to
UNK
just do it
can you just do that
ah
don't do the i y e one because we'll take that as a spelling and UNK change
was it was the s t one because of printing
well yeah because it was a traditional grouping but the use of the of the of the long round shape for an s was an early form anyway and you see it's used it's not used just for s t there are several cases where it's used as purely as an s
even though exactly the same letter form is used same type form is used as for the f good
hello
or sort of characteristic UNK of groups and the way that the dynamics happen
you've probably heard of group think haven't you
yeah
where members of the group all tend to think the same way you don't get new id new ideas are challenged
certain types of groups only have one way of viewing problems as the right way to look at problems you don if any of you have been in the r c p revolutionary communist party you might find that's a fairly similar sort of thing there's a party line and dimensions of what UNK it
erm group think is usually taken as negative
of course it can be a very positive thing
you tend to find that groups if you've got a group who're gonna launch a bomb y'know that groups make far more risky or UNK de decisions than individuals
so if you look at individuals making erm decisions about punishment or some decision where there's a consequence or an element of risk you'll find that groups quite often tend to go for more extreme behaviour than any one of the individuals in the group
there's a lot of stuff written about why that might occur
right there's a list of reasons why that might occur
erm how do people sort of UNK when you become a member of a group usually in some way the group changes you as you go through different stages of it your values may change as a result of UNK with people in the group and th this process of erm somebody's come up with how it is that you start off in a group how it is that you become an active member of a group how it is you may even become involved in the maintenance of the group and the leadership of it and then you sort of die away and that's the y'know retire from the group
so process is normally talk talked about group UNK
what was in that cake you gave me
erm and we talk about erm the stages of evolution or of a person and a group and then there's the list there
it goes through evaluation commitment investigation ok
and finally there's a UNK when you sort of leave the group when your values change
so there's a sort of list of UNK
and then there's some recent work using the concept of groups
now as i say i've covered that very quickly
that is probably about two lectures worth there ok
i mean if you go it's normally i chat about two lectures on that and you give lots of examples
text books are very good do read them and that about covers that part
so that's your lecture on groups and group processes
erm i think what i'll do with these handouts is i'll let you take some for absent friends and then any that're left over are put in the reading group shall i
so that other people can pick them up in fact there weren't that many left over because all the other ones
okay introduction to psychology exam notes right
these are the things that you really want isn't it
it doesn't tell you anything i haven't already told you but it gives you reassurance
there's only one sheet
d'you wanna pick them off the front at the end
yeah
well a cos then you can pick them up altogether if are you with me if you're doing the rounds for your friends cos some of UNK be on there and UNK be pick them up from the front it's just that some of the stuff will be at the front and some of it won't
some of you bring UNK here don't you
now it's gonna i've probably already said this to you
this will be ok the exam or paper will consist of six questions which you will do in two hours er not all six of course
the exam UNK two hours there'll be six questions on it and you will have to do three essays right
they're essay type questions they're not short answers or multi guess
now two of the questions out of the six will come from UNK and four of the questions of the six will be coming from the topics that i've covered on most of s it'll come from one of the many topics that i've c or several of the topics that i've covered
now the paper format hasn't quite been decided with reference to whether it will be compulsory to do at least one from each section
right if you've gotta do three essays now from six you have to do one from each section then you're gonna do either two of UNK o it's unclear exactly what the breakdown will be on that
er it may be that you can do three from my stuff it may be that you can do two from UNK and one from mine
they're the two extremes
now from my point of view of course all do UNK so i don't have to mark the papers right
so er i will not be offended in the least
an if you really don't know any and you're gonna have an attempt at a question that you don't understand make sure it's the other person's ok
i don't want
right
now the areas that i've identified are the same ones as i put on the board last week
erm so there's s i think there're about ten major things that we discussed erm what is psychology research methods UNK approaches cognitive and information approaches or approach there perception memory learning UNK and groups
now you'll notice the numbers in the brackets are some indication of the amount of time that we spent the relative amount of time that we've spent on the subjects
so what is psychology erm we spent about one week on whereas we spent about three weeks on memory
now the question pool or the topic area pool comes from topics one to ten
the way it was done was that if you imagine putting one card in for psychology two cards in for research methods one card in for UNK approaches three cards in for memory and so on and so forth an then they were sort of drawn out and then when a topic had been picked the other cards were removed
so although memory for example ha is three times as more likely to appear on the paper than say what is psychology or groups or perception it's nonetheless possible that perception groups or what is psychology could appear
are you w so it gives you some idea if you're gon if you're not gonna revise the whole syllabus shame on you erm then it gives you some indication of how to spend your revision UNK
er but don't i mean i'm not the fact that erm some topics have a bigger number than others and others have only got one doesn't mean they won't be on the paper now there will be some of you who will do spot revision
you will revise three questions perhaps one UNK two psychology or something like that and you will hope that they come up
if they don't alright you might end up with one or two questions
in my experience of doing exams and i'll talk to you about revision techniques in a minute erm generally you're better off to have a broad coverage of a syllabus rather than having a shallow one right
but there's a compromise
clearly you don't want to know all the syllabus so you're gonna miss parts out but you're better off knowing more topics in case some of the questions are difficult on the ones that you've covered or they're not on there at all when is the exam
may
so you've got quite a lot of time now there's some spare ones of these on the front as well when you get this UNK scrub out item number eleven which is on the back because these are the notes that w went out for the social psychology exam and i would be you'd be in a little bit of trouble if you revised wh influences of text ha b li had literature had on our lives discuss three books cos it ain't gonna be on this paper
i'll talk to you about that
you've already got some have you
cheers
okay what i'll do is go through this and you can ask questions as we go through
okay these apply to any exam
everybody make sure you cross out item number eleven because i m not giving you any advance notice of a of questions and if i was it certainly wouldn't be that one right so make sure you cross it out and make sure you tell your friends who you're giving copies to that number eleven doesn't apply
yeah so if it was somebody you didn't like you could say here i saved you one of these have a look at number element very useful
okay yes most of this is common sense erm er i what i'll do is relate it to things that i'm looking for in exam questions as we go through
right don't spend most of your time trying to come to grips with something that you just don't understand
i mean if you can't get it quite quickly and get to grips with it don't waste time on it
move on to other topic areas right
if there are bits that you don't understand and you're having trouble give me a phone i think i put my phone number on the board give me a ring at home give me a ring at aston or come and see me or go and chat to your friends or go and look at a text book but if that doesn't help then come back right
don't waste your time
other people probably understand it better than you and if you're struggling to understand it go and ask them
and as a first resort come and UNK m
most of my revision in my first and second years was done the night before and i managed to get through but a lot of friends who did the same didn't
i don't think it's good exam technique
you're better off doing a little and often
the only problem is you start UNK at sort of three months in advance or something and then or a month or whatever and it comes to exam and you think you've forgotten it all
in fact you haven't
think back to the stuff we did on memory a little and often is a good way of trying to remember things okay it's useful if you've covered topic areas to actually think about writing essays about questions that you think about to get you used to the style and time s scale of actually dealing with exams
right we're dealing with three questions in an exam in two hours
how many minutes is that
what is it
you've gotta write three essays in is it forty minutes
no it c forty minutes ok
so you've got forty minutes
what people tend to do is they answer a question that they've revised well and they can easily answer and they spend an hour and a half on it and then they fi they do i mean you know you see them answering they write you pages and pages and pages and it's a perfect answer and they get maybe ninety percent but had they spent about half as much time they'd have got seventy percent anyway because they knew most of the important bits
so don't you get most of your marks for the first erm sort of twenty minutes writing usually unless your r i mean some of you might not get any marks at but i mean most of you will yeah you get most of your marks on the first twenty minutes
so once you get towards take a clock in make sure you pace yourself and say at the end of that just put in a sort of sentence to make it look as if it's been finished off erm what i usually do when i do an exam is i spend the first five minutes actually looking at the questions because initially you look for the ones that you've revised and you see but there may be others there there're you can do in a slightly different way than the way that they first appear and that might help you quite a bit although there are no trick questions in this
i think it'll be fairly evident from the UNK erm titles wh what they want
y'know i don't think there's any ambiguity in that sense
erm there are no trick questions only there're s very straight forward sorts of questions that they ask
right let's this is hypothetical so it is it's the first thing that comes to my head but it may i wouldn't take it as s take groups for example you just got the handout on groups and you get a question coming up that might say erm i don't know how could groups how could a w what does our understanding of groups owe to speech therapy
now i wouldn't put a question in that related to speech therapy in that way cos it's far too complicated right for you but completely hypothetical and then what normally happens is people think groups and they just UNK the lot out right
you get that back right
but in handwriting that's under exam conditions with grammar to match right and you g and you get pages of it an most of which is absolutely irrelevant if you look at the question
now because it's first year exam what tends to happen is you to tend to ok UNK the stuff you let through
in a final year paper you just put a line through that and say that doesn't answer the question
so it's good exam skills
i mean those by and large those who need to listen to what i'm saying to and take it on board won't and those who already do don't need it anyway but they'll take it on board
so answer the question right
it's usually worth putting an introduction in
er a few sentences saying erm th q i y'know define your terms talk about how you're gonna answer the questions just an introductory paragraph and that usually sets it up to how you're gonna answer it
make your answer relevant actually addresses issues to the question
i'm not sure of your UNK you see
with UNK most of UNK done english and history or some they've done essay type questions that're geared to answering questions
erm if you're not used to that then perhaps this'll be more useful
now one of the things that you tend to find is that if you were to ask about groups then people UNK all the stuff about groups but with most questions you can usually see links to other parts of the syllabus
bring them in show that you've actually thought more generally and you can see how you can bring different parts of the syllabus in because that's the UNK that's what makes a piece of work stand out
if two of you UNK the notes perfectly generally in line with answering the question but then one of you brings in only a few sentences saying well this could be accounted for with di dum di dum or if we think about learning and er UNK this has something to say about that
you don't need to write another essay you just need to acknowledge that you can see a link between the work and that actually makes the work look a l a lot better a lot more UNK so that's a cheap way of getting marks
erm UNK things
okay if you're talking about child development you're gonna use if you're talking about er psychoanalysis you're gonna use freud or UNK techniques
if you're talking about learning theory well i've given you a few names
i don't expect you to remember UNK and smith fifty four y'know i don't expect that in an exam
try and remember the key names though right that associate with the sort of concepts that you want to discuss
it always helps
whatever you do don't put that UNK who er bald headed and looks like UNK freud or w y'know nothing like that ok
so UNK
for an essay UNK is extremely important but for exams it's UNK but just get the names in not necessarily the years okay when you think of erm any when you're UNK stuff and you want to learn studies try and put them in a context
put them in the context of the times
were they in the fifties sixties or the seventies
if they're the seventies think of people in UNK ties on the o u and UNK and things like that
y'know try and place a historical context to the work and see how it influenced other works
so if you're talking about somebody's i mean why was UNK for UNK if you think about the major topic areas that we've done there's a historical sequence to them
you've got the UNK approaches which came out of vienna you've got UNK at the UNK and then you've got the emergence of cognitive in the fifties and sixties so there's already a sort of historical structure there
i don't need to erm elaborate much more okay the give it give it a mechanical structure well that doesn't necessarily apply to some of the things that we've done but it does to other parts and if you're gonna discuss somebody's model think about it in the real world
think about UNK it and actually having examples of it
so if you're gonna talk about what did we do last week
what's the one with the boxes and whether or not people what was it about
UNK
whether you'd UNK it to the UNK or the situation yeah
that model for example
think of examples it makes life a lot easier
think of clear cut examples that demonstrate the model
okay er practice makes UNK
don't erm just revise three questions and keep re y'know writing those topic areas and certain limited questions
erm i didn't see any past pa i did see some past papers but it was subsequent to my setting these exam questions right
so these are not based they are similar they're not out of line but erm they i mean i don't think that you can necessarily pick up from past exam papers what'll be on the next
the best bit of information you've got is the syllabus coverage that i've given you
that gives you some guidance
erm try i mean psychology is actually finding the text books quite interesting y'know
as i got into psychology i'd read text books at nights it's sad isn't it
but i did right
they're the interesting psychology
if you i mean if you see some interesting stuff just r it tends to go in
i mean find stuff that's actually interesting
the bigger thick american social text books for example are very good on social
have a look at the UNK the erm i find is a bit sort of UNK i tend to go to sleep but the and quite got nice big pictures and interesting stories
i mean just read round for fun yo and see if there's anything that sticks and if you get chance to use it in an exam do okay then it says develop a stock of UNK
all it's saying there is if you do find something from erm other bits of the text books that we haven't covered in lectures bung it
i mean if you put stuff in that wasn't in the lectures and it's relevant i mean that's lot of UNK points yeah
so think about that there's ways of doing that yeah i it's incredible when you see erm th who was it
she was a bio chemist and one of her abilities was a UNK memory
d'you remember the erm you can't get a better bit of butter on your knife country life butter adverts
well we were trying to remember the lines to that and she came in and for about half an hour she gave a UNK
she said well there wasn't only one version of that y'know and she knew the lot and there were all the d slightly different versions y'know on the country gate and things like that
and she was going through and she knew them and er she was going into i it was her second year bio chemistry exams on the bus and she's got a bi a text book on bio chemistry and she's reading the introduction bit before you even get into proper bio chemistry and michael s look UNK across and said what on earth are you doing
and she said i'm UNK
he said but the exams in half an hour and she said that's right
he said well why are you reading that bit
she said you've gotta start somewhere
don't for god's sake do that y'know it's what i find is once panic sets in w and that's usually either the night before or the day i d anything that i try and read doesn't really go in very well
you're better off you're much and don't stay up late
the only time i've ever frozen in an exam was when i'd gone for three exams solid without UNK one after the other and i just brain and the other ones were a real struggle and i had to UNK my marks out of solid UNK y'know i was UNK away
and then for the first time ever in my life i what i normally do is i have sort of maybe some questions that i definitely pre plan and if i'm lucky one or two of them and this paper all three of my prepared questions actually came up exactly as i'd worded them or near enough
and i looked i wrote the first one first class answer and i thought this is a UNK and i'd done three days then or two nights without UNK and i sort of and erm suddenly i f and i went smith nineteen forty
and i couldn't remember it was forty four and my mind went totally blank and i had to walk out of the exam for over half an hour with a and i couldn't remember a thing and went back in
i passed but that w i mean it was so it was lack of sleep and the worst thing was the chap who was marking the paper said er when i was there he said i told him what had happened and he said er did you get much sleep last night
and the last thing you wanna say to somebody who's gonna be marking your paper is oh yeah i stayed up all night UNK for this
i mean that wasn't gonna work
so don't stay i i've generally found most people who stay up all night UNK it doesn't do them any good
you're much better off having a fresh brain in the morning and ha being able to think on your feet
so don't leave revision till the last minute
make notes
when you go through your notes now they're a very good start for revision
make notes as you go through
you won't remember them after if you don't look at them for a week but when you come to look at them the night before you'll be surprised what you do know
but it's no good starting from scratch the night before or it is but i mean you'll suffer for it
right look at an exam paper
i think erm UNK when he went for his UNK exam or the entrance exam to UNK or something and erm y'know they asked some question and he and he goes on and erm after five minutes he wrote his name very neatly right
if you don't know what you're doing do it neatly
i mean that's it's true as well
it works a tr
you get away as long as you do it neatly you're usually alright
erm good thing is to actually say to define the terms of the question and say how you're gonna answer them
it's money for old rope
y'know what is you might say if you got a question on groups i'm using groups UNK here because that's the thing that we've just done ok
there's no relationship between that and whether it's on the exam or not
you can't UNK that right
i'm not trying to throw you here
and erm what you might say is well what is a group
y'know jus and things that you already n and just that'll give you a nice little gentle start to the paragraph
we're working on sleep learning over here
is it
it doesn't go in
the work on UNK learning doesn't work okay brown suggests that you bring a c wardrobe of UNK toys and UNK and things like that were in the room when you were learning context dependent learning
i don't think i'd suggest that right
but do bring something from home little l y'know it can be useful
y d computer
right some people take the attitude of well i'll do the difficult questions first because i know the easy ones
it never works that way
do the easy ones first the ones that you can definitely answer UNK those of as quickly as you can so then you know what time you've got to spend on the difficult ones that's a very good point
make sure you leave at least a page at the end of each question in case you suddenly g cos what can often happen is you're writing the answer to one and you think oh that relates to the earlier one
bang it in
so leave a space so er usually a page a whole blank page in between your answers if they're in the same booklet now that's very true
don't waste time again struggling
if you start struggling with a piece just stop it work out where the next UNK roughly start and start r answering another one and the come back to it later
it's not a bad idea to chop and change if you get stuck
it'll it ensures that you're productive for most of the time
erm generally speaking the people who get UNK are the ones who can write neatly very quickly and that does help
erm but having said that i mean some of the worst ones are the ones that just go on and on and on about UNK
so i mean y'know j it may help you get a first class mark if you're a good candidate by writing lots but generally writing lots doesn't ensure that you get a good mark
it may affect the top of the scale but it's certainly not most of it yeah when it becomes desperate ok
if it ever does
just talk about examples of your everyday life that sort of illustrate in some ways some aspect of the question
it doesn't have to be UNK
i mean and usually it will you see most people are looking to past students when they mark
you actually if they don't do the r if they don't actually put anything down then you can't UNK it out of nothing but as long as you can get the benefit of the doubt then you'll UNK y'know we'll give it to you
well i will and most people i know
i haven't met anybody yet who's UNK on UNK work
UNK looking to pass you
erm now what that means is if you can't answer the question and you've only got a few lines down then sort of trying t w UNK it a little bit and make it UNK so that there's something we can point to and say that you've written something right
tha this is for the desperate people
if you've got a per perfectly good answer don't start writing a load of UNK as well because it'll only UNK from your mark
but if you're really stuck and you've got a third question that you can't come up with i mean y'know sort of UNK it UNK it and make it look like there's a sort of UNK answer there and we can sort of say well that's sort of twenty percent or something and then that counts and it may carry you over
it's only for the people who get desperate and get stuck
erm we i won't be there to UNK the exam but usually there's some i mean if you get stuck and you want a break just stick your hand up but not everybody cos everybody can't go to the toilet
but i mean y'know ah y'know g if you want if you're in that s if you're getting a bit worried about it do get out of the room for a bit and then come back in later
now if you've got a block of exams don't go straight from one exam to the other
have a UNK or a rest in between
don't go down the pub though that probably won't do you any good now that covers exam techniques in general and what i'm we're looking for in papers
in terms of i mean how much can you actually write in forty minutes
it's not very much is it
yeah
i would imagine that an adequate answer to a question could be done very easily with one side of that
that that's not much but if it's if it's i mean if it's not UNK out with UNK and UNK cos you i mean if it's a good ti concise answer that'll probably get a good mark
if tha if it's a short answer concise but answers the question you'll get a better mark than a much more UNK answer that doesn't address the question
how're we doing for time
five past twelve
okay i'm not saying to go
questions about the exam
right
so y w feel free now to ask questions i mean you must have something that worries you about this UNK i can only really talk about the exam
i don't know the system here but i know what i'm doing with those papers
do i have UNK
i don't have sample question papers but you do have one from previous years
but really the questions that you tend to get erm are things like critically evaluate and discuss
now if it means critically evaluate and discuss w it doesn't mean you just write a load of criticisms of it
what you actually do is erm list what it is that you're gonna critically evaluate
now usually that's what students are very good at because they've learnt something about that
what students aren't so good about is actually critically evaluating it
usually what critical evaluation would mean for example is to erm actually compare erm the model or the theory with what happen in practice
compare it with other theories try and look for the limitations of it
it's you don't have to be an UNK to critically evaluate something
in fact most of the criticisms and critics of theories are self evident they're not that difficult yeah
erm compare and contrast
if that's in the question then do compare and do contrast
i'm not sure what the difference is
comparing and UNK
anybody have an idea what the difference might be between comparing and UNK
sorry s one of you ov green UNK at the back who gave me your cake
similarities and differences
compare
well compare probably means you'd define both of them wouldn't you
and contrast means you then compare th a compare means you look at the similar yeah it could be the similarities and differences i quite like that
it's quite nice and simple isn't it
no sample questions but i mean in terms of the syllabus that you've got there is y'know you're much better off just having an understanding of it
you ca there's no sort of questions that sort of s jump out of a text anyway
i mean not gonna ask you anything difficult
you have nothing to fear in this exam at all if you d if you revise right
even if you b i would imagine that many of you based on the notes alone that you've got from here without any reading would probably get through so you've got nothing to worry about as long as you do the work
i think that's what it boils down to
if you leave it til the last minute and you question spot you might end up in a UNK situation how many people here have failed an exam
one two three four five six seven
so most people haven't in fact failed exams
how often do you fail exams
you don't
that's why you're here
if you did if you failed them on a regular basis you wouldn't be here right
if you look at the statistics i would in don't forget there's a re sit paper
now the re s yeah
the re sit paper will take the same format as the original paper
now generally speaking wi i i've act what i've done for the re sit paper is that i UNK a load of questions some of which went to the first paper and some of which went to the ne and some of which went to the re sit paper so i don't know which topics are coming up erm on the re sit paper
however they will be drawn from the same list of topics that're on the first and there may be some overlap
generally speaking re sit paper erm will contain at least one question very similar to a question on the first paper
er i does anybody know where the past papers are kept
yeah in the library that's where i'd usually go and look for them
what was that
where's the library
yes
what was the handout that you got from on UNK
you had a single sheet first of all the
oh was that the article by UNK
well first of all i
erm did anybody else have that problem
well i er agree with it but i mean you understood it presumably then
i mean that's wh who had difficulty with the UNK thing
who was there of course
if you didn't bother turning up and reading it then that was no p
the UNK seminar as far as i can remember you've gotta bear in mind i mean it must be eight nine years ago i probably read UNK in UNK yeah
erm my understanding of the paper that we had for the seminar was that it discussed the nature of explanation
UNK was trying to talk about psychology as a science because a lot of psychology at the time wasn't and if you ask pe i'm sorry that my sort of UNK with people's conversations but er will you try and finish it
er the reason for the book that was written at that particular time was that i you've gotta remember it was what was it
what year was it
nineteen fifty
nineteen fifty three
most people didn't even know the nature of scientific explanation and things like that
so in a way we've covered aspects of that seminar in what is science
okay UNK talks about scientific explanation in that so that's what he's addressing in that particular paper
he then UNK erm an approach based on a functional analysis of behaviour
now a functional analysis of behaviour is o a function is where you draw a box around something and you say it's got inputs and there's an output and the thing in between in the function that relates inputs to UNK
you're not interested in how it UNK the function you just observe the function
so wh i mean it's all to do with UNK in the sense that rather than being concerned with the mechanisms that UNK er what's the word
UNK behaviour that go on inside the head
what you do is you look at the environment and consider like the inputs and then you look at behaviour as UNK and you learn the relationship between the two and you don't UNK you don't have to understand what goes on inside
now i remember you quite strongly UNK with the notion that in fact if you don't know behaviour itself from w our own experiences we behave differently in different UNK in very similar situations and it's based on our interpretation of the stimulus
and that i mean is one of the major criticisms against a functional approach that sometimes you need to know what's going on inside the box fully to be able to fully appreciate the behaviour anyway
but ultimately most theories will be reduced to their functional component
there will be something that you draw a black box around and you describe purely in references to it's inputs and UNK
so i think the seminar itself wasn't giving you much new stuff it was stuff that we've already picked up in the course
and i mean for example he was talking about UNK as a way of UNK
well we discussed that right in day one what's the difference between UNK and UNK and we explored the differences
no i drafted the questions so erm well i'm not saying there's nothing on UNK in the paper i'm not saying there is
but i mean if you had a question on UNK i mean look at w what did we cover in your notes
if we had a car if we had a question on psychoanalysis
if we had a question on perception
what did we cover in your notes
i'm not gonna ask you questions that you don't UNK that i don't expect you to understand
it's not in my interests to mark another fifty papers
erm do write big and with yeah do write big so that i can read it
don't UNK it please
if i can read it puts me in a far better mood
just make your handwriting as clear as possible under the circumstances because it's er it'll speed the process up quite a bit
well what d t i think if you draw a pl if you draw a plan er that certainly should be taken i mean if you don't want me to consider the plan put a line through it yeah
if you do not want me to cons y'know if you put this is a load of UNK sh or whatever and then suddenly you suddenly realise that you might actually pass so you then i mean cross it out i'll pretend it's not there ok
so anything you don't want me to take into account when it's being marked put a line through it otherwise i will
a plan is actually a very good thing to put in
in my experience i c if i do a plan i haven't got enough time to write the essay
i don't know if anybody else finds that
the UNK most people if they've revised would do very well on any one of these as a single essay if they were given three hours
if you were given three hours to collect your thoughts and write it down you'd all d excuse me hello right
the chances are that if you were all given a lot of time to write each essay without your notes and you just sat at a desk and had about three hours on each question you'd all do very well
the fact is it's UNK into a very short space of time so you haven't got much chance to think
a plan is a very good way of addressing that but unless you can get a plan out in under five minutes yeah then it mi you might consider a better use of your time
i don't know
i mean is u it isn't very long is it
forty minutes for an essay
my spelling is awful by the way so the chances are i won't spot any spelling mistakes yeah
so don't worry about spelling o any other questions
i'm sure you must have some who's n i mean ho i UNK how many of you have come in here without on a levels that didn't require you to write an essay
put your hand up i ca okay it may be worth in that case having a look at past papers and having a go at writing the essays
now the seminar session that i'm going to run we can UNK we'll have UNK set up but we can sort of kick off with a discussion about topics that you want to cover in the revision
another possibility for the seminar is that if you want to bring some notes along to a sort of if you show me a if you dream up hypothetical questions and then put a plan to answer them so that i can UNK down it in about a minute or two
so you're not writing an essay what you're doing is saying well if this question came up this is how i would answer it then what i will do is give you feedback there and then on wh what else you can include and what else you can't
but if you give me a blank sheet of paper and put a question i'm not really gonna tell you what you should include and what you shouldn't yeah
so make use of the seminar time
bring along questions to do with revision bring along planned essays that you've written if you want me to have a look at them
i haven't got time to er mark them all in a formal sense so just bring a plan y'know if y give me somebody give me a mock title cos i'm very reluctant to dream up titles under these circumstances okay compare and contrast two theories of aggression
now we've not done aggression so there's absolutely no way that you're expected to know anything about it but that's a typical question that you might get on a social psychology paper
then what you might say is well what ar y'know erm you might say well s one define aggression two define one theory define the other and then y'know just structure it so you're talking about single or sentences maybe on a line that go down to very little but enough to show how you would go about answering the question
anything else
there is a UNK
can you read it to me i can't
don't forget if you have written any essays for anything else as course work
okay erm the quality of exam i mean there'll be some people here who will feel embarrassed to have submitted the work that they've written right
i have felt embarrassed because i've had to meet people afterwards who i who i who i care what they think about me and i've put in the biggest load of old rubbish
you get used to seeing it right
you get used to seeing UNK poems about you all sorts of things on exam papers from students right
so and i mean you read them in a they're marked within five to ten minutes yeah
scripts fifteen minutes at most
i'm not looking to give you constructive feedback on them i'm just looking to see what grade it gets so you go down and put it in a pigeon hole
do not worry about the quality of the essays
there is a mar if you got a two for a piece of course work ok it would easily get an equivalent two in an exam would be the UNK would be about a third or a pass yeah
the grades you do not mark the essays that you've put in at course work t erm you don't mark the exam questions to the same UNK standard
i mean most people are in an absolute state of terror in exams and it comes across
it's an awful way of assessing people
i don't think it's very fair at all
it doesn't get at what you want either but it's one of the system that we've got so if you write something th that you for a piece of an essay that you got say a two one for and then you write an appalling piece you might still get a two one for it under exam conditions
is there anybody who has w or has trouble writing fast
UNK i mean due to some physical difficulties or whatever
because if there are you can arrange for things li if you if you break or UNK you start getting strain or whatever you can ask for an UNK oh you're interested now oh what's an UNK where's the dictionary
the dictionary isn't here
oh we haven't got one
now i'm not UNK how do you think you're spelling UNK
it's either e or a could be UNK
UNK it's somebody who sits beside you and you dictate to them
i'm sure if receives a plea for twenty UNK from the first year speech UNK there might be some UNK raised
i'm s can you shout
okay er generally speaking the vocabulary that you've been taught within the lecture series is the vocabulary you should use where possible
it looks like you know what you're talking about doesn't mean you do but i mean if you use th if you if you start going on about that thing that there is er when some what on earth
but the independent variable then we get there quite easily have you found it
i think it begins is it a e i
no it's erm it's somebody who all they do is write your answers for you but dictated i m if you've ever been an em especially i mean i used to be i usually end up doing the UNK for courses that i've taught on students on my paper
it's because you can't just sit down and di if you don't know how to spell i can't spell anyway d'you know when i did it the student actually wrote a letter to me and to th or to the exam board car saying that this hand writing is appalling and the spelling it's due to the person who was doing the UNK rather th but i was marking it anyway so it didn't really matter but they were so UNK at the handwriting that i produced
erm the trouble is if you don't know the vocabulary it's very hard to dictate and write down because you have to keep stopping and asking them to spell things
erm the other thing is if you know anything about the subject which most UNK should do you actually start filling in the gaps
y'know you a you're going along and they'll say group and you write therapy or something y'know and you've done it and you think whoops and you just hope and the worst thing is when they say smith and jones and you put seventy nine in and you think shit and y'know they get the thing slightly wrong draw up a revision plan pick out the topics that you're going to revise any problems bring them along to the seminar
now any more questions that might benefit
is there anything that's unclear apart from the series of lectures
okay wh with regards to if i was teaching this next year to the first years what changes would you recommend i make
apart from sack myself
you don't like the overheads
okay overheads are boring
would you go with that
the problem i must admit the problem that surprised me with overheads is that erm people can't write and listen at the same time or the other thing is you put something on an overhead th every bit of it gets written down which is why i UNK it so that you did
the idea was i was using them as sub headings originally but then people were kept y'know slowing d it's erm very hard to work out whether what you actually want is a good detailed set of notes
i think handouts ma you you're all sort of absolutely your eyes lit up when the little handouts came round
erm so it might be an idea to talk around handouts and perhaps use the o h p occasionally yeah
well we don't really actually have any schools si i mean schools of psychology were a thing of the fifties really there's no UNK school of UNK
the problem is in fact that's UNK in fact i did that right at the start right
the first lecture i gave i was going on about the different approaches to psychology
have you got all the handouts that you need
i'm not giving any more so you should have thr erm three main handouts groups yeah
erm but the trouble is of course it doesn't go in
if i say to you UNK is about di dum di dum and i did but obviously it didn't sink in at the time
perhaps more time UNK them and giving a more a UNK introduction to them may be erm a more in depth introduction
hello
right i think it's always been time UNK for two hours though
well the alternative would be to have had the tea break in between
mhm do you have many other two hour slots
no you're not but in fact studies show after about the first ten minutes people aren't UNK much anyway
it's true most studies show i mean if lectures are one of the way of delivering information
i think
yeah but they wouldn't pay me for the hour i was sitting there doing nothing you see
well but there again that's not your problem is it
i mean how they ch the fact they choose to sub contract out to me is one thing yeah i mean that's their problem in that sense
no but i mean i was planning on having a break in the middle but y most of you voted and you wanted a break at the start but perhaps it would've but then you you'd have been going straight on from s w UNK
how much of this is a consensus by the way
i mean a few people are talking how many of you agree with that
that two hours is two long
and ho
well it's and how many of you would want the break
and if we did
so you're going for the hour slots aren't you really
that's right but i think j i think just the fact that you're doing psychology and then psychology again in a way i think that's the pr i agree with you what you're really saying is i mean how many people would object or how many people would prefer to have the straight two hours rather than the two single hours
yeah i'm in favour of videos and things like that
yeah ok i'll bear that in m is somebody writing this down at all
i know we've got it on this actually so but i'm thinking of the course reps
who are the course reps
okay you i mean is any of this of any use to you
what i'll do actually what i'll do is i'll take you name and i'll send you a UNK of it yeah
i'll pick out the points cos i'm gonna send it to anyway to say that th y'know i personally think two hours is too much for me
i don't like sitting here for two hours
erm i also think that if you have two hours a video and a talk would be better
erm i think that's that worked quite well but there is a bit of i suspect if i was to show a video every week there's a UNK th for people to want to pay me in a sense
y'know they feel that if they're paying me to teach
yeah
right the trouble i the problem that we do have is a very big syllabus that i was given
i wouldn't have covered half the things that we covered in that time yeah
and the other thing is that it's er a wide syllabus is fine as long as you're not expected to go in any depth but you're expected to go sort of both a broad syllabus and into a little bit of depth more than perhaps erm i mean in effect i mean you're not far off of covering a level psychology at this at tha the level we're going to
we don't cover the UNK of a level but i think the depth is getting close to it
so if you're doing a level UNK y'know i think perhaps you ought to say ok what we'll do is go for less depth but a more general approach
that may be it and perhaps one or two topics only we go into some depth on
i think that may be an idea
so overhead are out
that's a shame because i don't normally use overheads and i've got into them this year and er my UNK group in particular who get the same sort of treatment as you do have actually said th
right
that's right the UNK that's
the problem that we did have i mean my normal UNK style until here in fact was that i would just UNK y'know and generally do a few bits on the board and then carry on for an hour or two but the sh people weren't getting the notes down that was the problem with that
now note taking is a skill in the sense that y'know the final years you wouldn't final year UNK i mean are so UNK and ah go off in all directions because of different people
i mean it's hard t y i mean you come away with a list of t things that you've talked about maybe headings and that's about it and then you go and build your own notes up
i think there was a lot more concern here with getting a good set of notes that you can revise from
maybe by the t i mean so my UNK style was i geared if you like towards a more you go off and do some reading based on the following topics and i agree with you that was too vague given the fact you're not UNK
y'know i mean you're here to do speech therapy
i think what we may get away with then is handouts and less overheads
i think that would do the trick but preparing UNK i mean i was doing those till two this lot for you this mor i'm absolutely y'know it's quite hard work when you're UNK teaching all the time
if i'm not teaching i'm marking in th to actually get a lecture through cos i was given this with about a weeks' notice you see so i didn't have a chance to prepare the stuff for this course other than as we go along right
but i te i agree with those points i mean most of them i go along with
it's not very interesting for me to UNK for two hours
other points
there's only half the class so you can't really throw many eggs and rotten UNK and things can you
okay you tell me
how's your first year going then cos you've nearly finished it now
generally all glad you did speech therapy
really
i mean i a how many people are a bit UNK with the whole business since they started from how they initially set off
couple
i know s i've UNK to some other people and they've said the same so you're not alone
you haven't done much speech therapy which seems to be the main problem
you don't even do you get a chance to look at speech UNK in action
pardon
yeah what surprised me is i mean you don't wanna let you loose on the general public with due respect i mean you don but you should certainly be i mean i'm surprised they don't take you UNK have videos showing you sessions in practice and things like that
you do go out place
when
right but the first year i mean you wanna get the i'm surprised
mhm
now i agree with the point that you've just made and i've heard some other people say well the teaching that they've got so far isn't going to influence what they see in their second year
so that might be worth bearing in mind
but it's tr it's true in most if you do clinical medicine erm er UNK you don't get to play with the patients until quite a way on and most of them don't even get a chance to observe for a lot of it
i mean if you're doing me medicine for the first couple of years you you're just doing text book work aren't you mostly
and a bit of lab stuff
mhm
but your course is a very good erm non drop out rate
most UNK i mean you nor you can get up to about ten percent on most cou on a lot of courses where people leave after the first term
here one person out of fifty over the year isn't bad is it
three
oh who else is gone
oh the boy that you got rid of yeah
very UNK of you wasn't it
mind you what was he like
not bad
not bad
are there any particular topics that you think would have been useful to have seen in the course that weren't
and are there any bits of the course you'd rather not have done
well no apart from all of it but a
right things we'd like to see in psychology is there any i mean any the trouble is you don't know what's on the menu so it's hard to but i mean what sort what sort of things would you like to have seen from pr what you have a
a question
so sort of yeah how to deal with people inter personal
i think you'll probably get that next year though
i think you've had the crash course and inter personal communication is next year
okay
of communication
i think what we may be able t i mean yes i think that what you may be able to do is UNK things about so that you don't get much social psychology until the end i know i mean there wasn't really much time
right i'll make a note of that
okay somebody suggested that the communication essay or which reflects the communication model w in the hand book it says that you've had input from UNK er UNK and people like that and in fact you haven't
i think that
okay any more
how're we doing for time
well unless somebody can come up with something to talk about i think we might as well go
anybody who has any concerns or questions i i'm gonna be here for a few minutes
good luck been fun teaching you
the race is on for the spare hand outs
shortage was twenty five k gs of
you hadn't got the bags printed the bags being printed today and tony will make it today
currently alan is having extreme difficulty in getting hold of any dried blood
apparently we're not killing as many cows as we used to
so there's a tremendous shortage he's trying germany he's trying all over
but the consequence is until he gets it we can't make any fish blood and bone
and that applies to twenty fives and obviously pre packs
er before i went off we were talking about packaging have we decided to bring any in yet
there's another few weeks have UNK and sooner or later we'll have to start making
yeah alan and i are gonna go through the details
i've got a i've got a lot of things to talk about so
you know before we do
the next thing i'm not very happy about the supply of printed bags coming in from er the workshop
talking to eric yesterday how many should she be able to do an hour five hundred erm approximately
i said to celia how many she thinks she can do a day she thinks about two thousand depending on what she's doing
and when she worked here she had her daughter working with her and they were a team and they went like a bomb
up there she's got no UNK somebody who's not quite as bright as they might be er and she's not working overtime as they would do here if they got behind they're working half eight to half four is it ray
yeah
and in consequence you know there's an UNK
erm simon had a list well we'd come and see him the thirty first of january tony came to me to work on it today and that's not
all i'm saying is at the moment she can't apparently cope with the demand on her for bags
according to tony we're going out of at the end of the month
well s well erm pete said originally at the end of the month but it looks like with this problem it's gonna be UNK if we can get some off site at the end of the month
it doesn't matter though does it if we UNK
no because all we have to do is switch it on switch it off like that
we don't give them any notice at all
but i do believe that we should seriously look at getting say internal usage bags for nutrients er bags for lime anything that we have printed we ought to look at the and say to mike or get 'em printed or something
okay
alright
lynne at a meeting yesterday tom said to ask you please no more to be ordered
that is ian i'll give ian a ring cos ian r rings direct
okay
erm ray can you arrange please to send one hundred thousand j e b bags up to
okay
a complaint from george er in the pre packs this morning reference er going through the u v a apparently i don't understand this but he says it's wearing out erm belts at a cost of a hundred and forty a pair every fortnight
and last night he was out back here at work at nine o'clock
and as a result of this through the night er angela working in u v a produced two hundred and ninety seven
UNK the three k g line when the machine and everything was running properly you'd be getting six eighty
er i mean obviously be due to
right in the back
UNK er lack of experience yeah
george UNK
and he says it's i think he was gonna talk to you about it
yeah
he has done this morning and he's talked to us about the film
i think
yeah
the machine side of it
yeah
we know there's a problem and we've all gone back in and
er tom has also asked for twenty tonne of UNK to go up to
er this week's production sheet er and i wonder of ian could bear in mind that he should try and keep an extra ten tonne when he's looking at his reserves here just in case
and we don't get stuck in the middle of an export
he'd already he'd seen the bags going up and he'd already got that in his head
but you see he knows he's gotta keep something back
if he can
yeah
keep up a reserve here so that
yeah
send them five or ten tonne
yeah
er one thing stewart erm any word for from john about the state of the
no
right on the thing just finally there's a hundred and thirty thousand UNK here next week
and currently we've got a hundred and thirty four thousand cos we've got four days production to build up the surplus
but we've got eighteen thousand three hundred and thirty
my count at the moment i reckon we've got scattered round the countryside ten thousand
which would cover us for friday and UNK
phil said if you wish he'll his men on saturday and sunday
right well don't have any papers on those but i thought we'd got more than that
i thought we'd got i thought we could satisfy
friday monday and tuesday
well friday monday tuesday you're talking about nearly twelve thousand
we're almost there
yes
but that's wh that's your position at the moment isn't it
that's how i take it
we've got that on the computer that came in yesterday that came in wherever
yeah
and that came in this morning
yeah
that's the total we've got in at the moment
we've got one thousand eight hundred and ninety at and eric checked and we've got nine hundred at the other place
and they did another h eleven hundred and forty yesterday didn't they
well that's what he says they've got in stock at the moment
perhaps they've got more in transit eric do you think
lorries on the road
i don't know i don't know mate
no
i don't know
i've got a bit on that if you want i could bring it up now while you're talking about it i will
okay
pete while you're talking about i've got i've got a UNK to bring up on that
i've been on to this morning asked me to and they have got thirty UNK there at the moment
and they and they're working away
what they say is they're getting no liaison at all when there's any lorries going in to pick any product up
it would be lovely he said if somebody could give him a ring
no let me just tell what is actually happening
who are the main people
yes
actually had a program of what is going through
yes
so does tim
yes
i think it's a lack of communication
ah so it's their end not our end
yeah
they have got a program of what's being pulled out as far as the trucks are concerned
yeah
dick got one 's have got one
the people at have got one
everybody's got the schedule of what they pull out so
yesterday what actually happened was yeah hang on a minute
so it's only the poor bloke on site who doesn't know
what happened yesterday was they had a breakdown again
yeah
right
and they had three wagons turn up
yes
and they couldn't load three wagons
yes
they loaded i think one and two thirds
yeah
and they had to send one wagon because they couldn't load it over to pick up some more
yes i see
it's more
so it it's UNK end
i think it's just tim and the other guy
okay
cos he does do a hundred and one jobs
he's on
okay
the breakdown was only for an hour and a half the lorries turned up and the breakdown was happening
but the information is there just that
said i've got a guy that's been stood here for an hour don't know what to do with him
what was this production here last night
yeah cos it was
they didn't do anything really did they
what happened was the stuff didn't come in till quarter past four the dust UNK didn't get done till after five so we said right from six this morning till they finish it give me bags per hour and the run
i've just timed
hello
er UNK timing per bag fifteen seconds so that's about you know it's two hundred odd an hour
do you want to
just a sec hang on
and i know they got to UNK them wrap 'em and shift 'em and everything but er as our lot more than
mm
you know if they did
but it's brian i would like to see
the calculation it's not just the UNK it's the UNK and the UNK
well what i'm saying though ray is really everything UNK of
the UNK should be able to cope shouldn't it
you can get it through the UNK quickly and under the UNK
providing you can get it UNK and it's UNK men at it
i wanna go out i'll go out there with UNK and eric anyway as soon as we've finished cos it wants
as soon as it's finished i'll ring joseph and get one
well ring him now then see if he's got any
the and then we'll let him know when
there's always er mr if you want to drag him
well i could take him off line
no
where is he
i mean john
oh
oh
i says to him i says we're flexible here you might find
erm the only other thing is we've still got a spare man out on the haven't we covering the breaks
we take him off and don't cover the breaks while you want him
right
well let's we'll go and have a look
yeah
me and UNK and eric
there's not really much
we had a breakdown yesterday it was an hour and a half
apparently it was caused by dust getting in
dust got into one of the circuit UNK on the machine and apparently UNK it out
electrician in
yeah that was solved very quickly
the problem with the truck you know about now
the plan is today to i is still three loads and we've got three loads planned for the rest of this week
if they are double shifting it'll be on monday
just whilst
they've got through eleven hours today have they
yes that
we've definitely gone to eleven hours
yes that's what he told me he said we were going on to for the rest of the week eleven hours and then start double shifting monday
who's responsible for shipping it from and into here
who's the trigger what's the trigger
to bring it in
cos it doesn't it's not gonna
i don't like the way you're looking at me
we're the trigger we've got to try and schedule three UNK three UNK a day
three UNK a day
three a day
based on we can do they were doing sixty five UNK loads a day
three trucks would UNK to sixty six approximately
and is that to phil to get his lot over is it
i've asked phil to bring his as he produces it bring it over
there's one in this morning i saw
has he
yeah
well it's just a question of him arranging the transport to get rid of it
it's best if he UNK the transport cos he knows what's there
yeah
well i'll tell phil then and no saturdays but also get it on a daily basis
what's erm what are we gonna work here assuming this goes
if it goes we're gonna bring the lads that finish at lines three and four so it'll be what six till whenever you want ten hours
twelve hours
well that'll be from monday lynne won't it
from monday yeah
yeah
if you want
i think that's alright for monday
er no cos we're what we're gonna use the product that we've got in and you need some don't you
definitely
so what we're gonna do was do what peter wanted and have from monday if you do want us to do it
cos again no decision it's just yes we can do it
we're just running out the material that we've got here
i dunno steve said yesterday he thought it was cheaper at
they seem to be able to cope with it far better than anybody in this group at the moment don't they
they're producing more than
or well
it's not a sort of a long term thing
i mean what's the position with
well you've got the contract UNK number of bags
i think if we went in again and tried to do another
they want the work i'll tell you that
they want the work
they want the work
they're keen to do it a and if you want to make any more it can be done but i think
they was hoping three months work then
yeah i don't think they're doing a great er i don't think they're making a great deal of money out of it themselves
they're not
well he keeps telling me that he keeps saying
well can we not buy it see where stocks lie
do we have to make a decision
now
well you've only got actually you've got
well no only that
you've got five thousand bags here anyway
the rest are out at and you've got one load at run that load through
oh yeah it makes sense to run that load through but whether what i'm saying is whether we go on next week to a continuous
well i think you have a look at what they're doing the only thing is if we say they need another bloke if you're gonna do that next week then you've gotta plan for that before next week
that's the main problem what it is i'm ho we're holding fire
the temps
the temps we're holding fire on them to know what to do with it
if you want them on a coach they'll be i think there's six up there is there
six
six so that means five on a shift down here we'll find something to do with them
if not we're gonna double the shift back with the UNK
we don't want to lose the men so we've got them here
yeah
and we're saying yes you've got next week but we don't know where you are
yeah that's why they're here and really i would like to know by friday m UNK
let's make a decision on friday management meeting
depending on what we've got out of by then
what 's done
yeah
what the breakdown situation is
we need to look at UNK and eric and just tidy up the bits but see what they get off this then
yeah
today
yeah
get an idea of what
well let's leave that let's leave
yeah
to friday morning then
so friday
so just UNK it to death
yeah
at the minute we're waiting for some bits for this should be in today
yeah
yeah but we're that would enable a double shift to be done decide not to run a double shift
only because it would have meant stopping the pre pack
no it doesn't no that's what we've been
prior to getting the
yeah
but that was why as i understood it that was why i wanted the UNK
yeah
well arthur wants the UNK anyway because if you're not doing over there you'll have double shift working on pre packs
so it still wants
i still want to get it going but i don't want to put a double shift onto unless i have to
pre packs
mm
the message i got was that the last few days it didn't matter a bugger what it cost but we were in desperate UNK to get in stock
what we're saying now really that's not quite
well i'm saying i still don't know the figures that i'm being given suggest that by friday erm or by monday we'll have sufficient to meet the orders of
the fifteen
it's on there steve and the amount that
the eighteen the allocation is eighteen thousand
by friday night we'll have sixteen thousand of those right
now that's the worst scenario given that you get five hundred a day out of
yeah
and you get fourteen hundred a day out of
mm
now that would be the worst scenario
they should do two thousand plus
then okay two thousand plus
and then you've got however many you're gonna get off the line here between now and
well you're gonna get whatever
and did seven hundred in el in eleven hours on monday
so they've UNK slightly
seven hundred
but they did four hundred last night breakdown
but we know are going on to double shift on monday
yes it's eleven hours this week
the problem is
they should do
you'll get two thousand on monday
yes
and that's without going onto a double shift
that's right
at
that's right
that's why i'm saying let's wait while
i think so
friday and make a decision on friday without UNK into a decision
if things change in the meantime we could always
we could always ch we could always
well we've got the o we've got the
you've got the option
the people
yeah
and we've got the people here
why look for spending extra money when you don't need to
alright let's review at but let's make a decision on friday about what we do on the shift pattern on monday
okay just before we go off peter's erm the first comment you made peter was about ten k gs of
yes
the computer says there was some and there isn't any
yes
i think this is erm it it's an extremely worrying fact as far as i'm concerned i got a phone call from chris just before this meeting
he wants er to get together with ian and myself ian and myself straight after this meeting
because he's saying that the january stock take is quite is al is impossible to UNK
bloody hell
he says he just can't UNK
he says there's so many differences
quite honestly steve
it's very difficult at this moment to say we're not talking about finished stock you know you're gonna get UNK on product but what worries me i don't know at this stage how many tonnes of bone meal we've got UNK away somewhere or how many tonnes of UNK maker we've got UNK anywhere for use in the pre pack
because that information is not in the computer at the moment
can i just i think it's fairly important that if we'd have actually done the reconciliation last week we'd have had the opportunity to UNK them
which wasn't possible because chris was saying it wasn't possible to do
we might not be in this situation now
but i thought that er with coming off that malcolm was going on to that
malcolm was doing part of it
sorry i'm not laying any criticism anywhere
i know you're not steve but all i'm saying is that we had a discussion about this earlier in the week
chris UNK to do something i'm afraid when somebody's already done three quarters of the work you can't put somebody on to do the last quarter
mm
and chris was already UNK all of the data
and when he was offered help he said no i will do it myself
and we've been waiting and waiting and waiting now for a week to get this reconciliation at least together so that we could go out and re count whatever was required
eric and myself went out and did a physical re count last week of wha a whole bay of because numbers weren't adding up
mm
we went and did that ourselves it needed that UNK effort
and i'm not being funny but when malcolm did it we would do that almost two or three days after the stock taking if there were odd counts
that's the question i asked this morning why wasn't it you know why weren't we doing it
and i think i think the reconciliation what he's actually saying is he hasn't got time to UNK those UNK before this UNK deadline that's what it appears to be
and that's not good enough
no it's not agreed
and chris has just put his head in his hands and said i can't do it
mm
it's not a matter of they're not UNK i think there has to be a strong point that's made
and i think peter's been saying this for almost well since he's come back anyway that i can't work because the stock figures have not been updated
UNK not in
UNK not in
and i said to chris you know i said to chris yesterday are you putting in the production or have you put i can't do two jobs at once i can't do two jobs at once and that was it
so at five o'clock last night when i called down i didn't respond
i just ignored it
at five o'clock i said to chris i said how about if i ask UNK if she can help
it's bugger all to do with me but my interest is getting the in
no
no
now UNK saying to me i can put it in
mm
so if you if you're having words with chris if you can say
well i am
if you know
well i think we should reaction was happening with malcolm last week
how malcolm was asking how he could help
and you can't unfortunately take it away on block like i said and give it to someone and say finish it off
and the other is why should i clear up the mess that this guy's made
yeah
i don't think it was a UNK stock take
i think the count etcetera went alright
i think it's the reconciliation based on perhaps some of the problems that we had at the lost last stock take which are UNK you know probably the odd UNK here and there this time
mm
i mean i looked through it this time
mm
i mean i looked through it yesterday and th there are a few UNK which wouldn't take much sorting out
small ones
there appear to be a lot UNK throughout but they don't amount to a vast amount of money
i d i don't know the problems at the moment
i think it's worth looking at
yeah
first actually
yeah perhaps that's yeah alright i'll UNK that
i don't know whether it was a UNK stock take or not
the UNK suggesting that it wasn't a good stock take
yeah
when i was speaking t very briefly erm to ian before i came down he said well i'm really not surprised the continuing problem and difficulty in establishing what's on the UNK as to whether it's lawn feed and UNK lawn feed and for example
and erm
why should that be
i think UNK problems of identification haven't really been right this time and we made a point a clear point this time with a note to people if they weren't sure to make comments on the books
i think if you look through the books there are comments in there where they weren't sure with question marks and they were to be UNK
the problem is it's not got to that stage yet
yeah
i mean th that is that's crazy
absolutely yeah i mean i and i i'll reiterate it and i'm not UNK with malcolm but two days after the stock taking they did prior to this one we were out there UNK
mm
out UNK with malcolm in UNK to say well show me where you counted these and let's do it again
yeah
that's not happened there's been absolutely zero coordination either on a daily basis here
but malcolm chris have you got the numbers yet have you got them UNK
oh well i'll got to enter another few
i feel a bit sorry for some of the counters because they can see certain on one UNK for instance i found there were three sorts of bags
just on one UNK
and if you didn't have the expertise to know ah well i know what's in there then what the hell does that person count they've got to go and chase somebody to find out
these were from erm from
there was there was ten bags there was eleven five
ah right
there was spring and summer and you thought well what's what like you know we
but as ray said all they got to do is query it haven't they
yeah but everything was UNK you look at
oh the yeah
books and they were all UNK
i'm partly agreed with you the fact that the stock take at the end of the day we got it right but all i'm saying it was very difficult
difficult to count yeah
and we could make it better by making sure that the bags came in more correct like what UNK doing now with those printed labels
every bags gonna have a printed label on
so
steve you were here on the day
mm
we were supposed to start at six o'clock
i mean some of us were in at six
no it wasn't supposed to start at six it was supposed to start at seven thirty
no chris should have been in at six that's when the first team started counting
most of the teams that we'd organized that we sent notes round to start at seven thirty
yeah
when you got in there at seven thirty chris wasn't there and the books weren't there and people were waiting around ready to get off
it wasn't organized well from that point of view
i i'd asked chris to organize it and it wasn't
okay
i think the fact that the books were filled out correctly and i think you should give the people that did the stock take congratulations because the books were filled out reasonably well considering some of their ex UNK in it
i think they did a good job on the day and they stayed until the counts were done
in fact i do believe one team was here till about two thirty doing it
yeah
i know chris was here doing his own calculations on books but after that i mean the i think on the sunday i he came in and did some work
and then the stock take was dropped then for four or five days
and we got malcolm in to enter some of the input we got joe to enter some of the input
but the final reconciliation has taken so long
mm
even after i mean as i say we went out on the wednesday and he said all i need is for you to do this book again for me
for god's sake
i mean we did that on the wednesday and he said that's all i need now
monday it was
and it's now
straight after
middle of the following week and we got the first reconciliation yesterday
okay
i don't have anything further to bring up there are no packaging issues
yeah erm just to clarify one thing UNK and UNK up in UNK and s when the screen blocks up
who's job is it to dig it out or clean it out
that's what i'd like to know cos there's a lot of confusion going on out there
in terms of what ray
well a lot of people out there think it's a UNK job to clean UNK out and UNK screens
i in my personal opinion i don't think it is
if you need tools to do it then a fitter initially and then if the help comes from the people that are stuck because it's not working anyway to help clean out
mm
well there's a prime example at the moment down the UNK hopper
which we call the UNK hopper on the line
now i've looked at that this morning we are getting UNK because the UNK is that blocked up there's that much UNK round the UNK which we had a fire on before down there and the stuff is UNK right up you can't even see the bottom tail UNK
and the UNK that takes the stuff away
now you know it's alright we can't stop UNK we never will stop UNK
but i think we with the wet stuff we've had going through the UNK is blocking up
and not getting cleaned out
pete got some cleaning up done last saturday which is you know round the er screen that area's all been cleaned up but obviously he ain't got enough blokes to get the lot done
clean them
well apparently so yeah
yeah
yeah basically it's always been but it hasn't been enforced for quite some time that the clean up rate is four pounds and hour which UNK to six pound an hour on a saturday
yeah cos it's time and a half
mm
now erm when paul came in he unfortunately come in and clean up come in and clean up and they were put on their own rate which they should never have been
right l i'd said to paul now have you told them it's
oh no i haven't
so they got paid their own rate
so they've been used to their own rate and i said each time if you're gonna get you must tell them it's the UNK rate
so probably three months went by where they got their own rate
so i says to pete right start as we mean to go on i refuse to pay any more than the UNK rate
so he goes out there and they all turn round and say stuff you i'm not coming in to clean up for four pound and hour which again UNK to six pound an hour
so we got mark i think was the only erm full timer off the UNK plant that agreed to come in
mm
and two or three temps and the rest were a couple of temps from the mixing plant
now pete has said he's not gonna give in
it's four pound an hour and it stands
when UNK lads are down to seven and a half hours which they are in the erm summertime i mean we s the UNK come in i mean we can't pull them off now but those UNK come in and clean up
permanent lads will come in and clean up
but no they're just being damn awkward i'm sorry
so pete said right they're not gonna beat me it's four pound an hour and that's it
so they turn round and say i'm not coming in
but they'll come in if we want cutting out and cos they get their own rate
well if they're going onto eight hour regular they'll probably they'll probably still change their mind
you see as i said they might have just actually cut off their nose to spite their face
well they i think yes i think they
really got to play them at their own game really
and i'm sorry
mm
it's been hard work for us but we're not giving in here and that's it
oh it is i mean i that responsibility
they would come in mate if it was on their own rate but as soon as you
there's a erm if there's a need for 'em to clean this saturday say they need to clean round that UNK
well i think there's a necessary to clean up this
i i'll try and get a gang
well no what you want to do ask that same gang that came in last week
i will
and bugger the rest
yeah
ask those same blokes specifically
i mean i've had an offer from who said i'll come in any saturday but i can't take him off dick cos dick needs him there
but when it comes to the
you know when all our temps are gone then the first people that'll get asked are UNK lads who've said yes we'll do it providing dick doesn't want us
i wouldn't i wouldn't give them the option i would go and ask those same ones you had in last week
as long as you've got somebody here that can
underneath the screen up in the pie in the sky i mean that i mean i've known that when you've only got about that much where you should have that
and it's maybe UNK down to that
which the UNK take the side off for 'em
yeah
but to get in to clean it out
what i might actually do it see if UNK not doing anything if he not come in for the full time that they're cleaning up but come in for those sort of things
well as long as the UNK get cleaned out
you see that we're getting a lot behind that UNK wall in between the packing line and the UNK wall again
i mean an incident happened last week er the fitter went up they asked the fitter if they could track the belt up on the top
so the lad went up and UNK it
he come back to me he says it's UNK over the top because the UNK are blocked up he says i'll tell the track driver the track driver says oh well get the to clean that up
i said like hell you will
like hell you will
i've had bloody platforms put up there to make it a lot easier for people to get up there
i mean i could understand when we had to climb up the belt which was damn dangerous but now we've altered all that
but they keep thinking i mean i've got like forty days holiday my staff to get in fif in fifty days left
you know it's a problem
will you will you for saturday though do that see ian and make sure he knows what wants do what you think wants doing
and make sure that he UNK the plant
ian did come in one saturday
for me last year and he and he did yeah i will see him
yeah we'll see if he'll come in and do something like that again
yeah
you will see him before
and have a word with him because he knows what UNK is blocked up and what wants cleaning out
but as i say we can take the plates off the screen underneath here but i mean i think you still ought to have another bloke
well get together with ian and sort of
up there with him to clean it out because i say you can UNK things but you're up in the air
yeah
and that and that's what
well as long as he knows what wants doing as long as they're safe
well
erm i've been out as on the er line three this morning and i think there's another little bit we ought to buy but we'll discuss that as we're going on eh
mm
erm the u v a machine the problem we've got on there which UNK explained or peter raised this morning there is in between the drive belts that take the film down the former and which they've put a new set on which is a hundred and forty pound a pi they're in between the two drive wheels there is a plastic UNK
and what it does really is keep the belt firm so when it goes on the former it keeps it firm
that is worn
and one's been on er apparently i didn't know this but george showed me this morning
brian made on and put on
well it ain't lasted
i think it's only lasted about eight or ten weeks
and it's worn
so what i'm doing now i've got one of the lads down at er UNK
mm
yes they have got some stuff yes he's gonna get a price to make some on this hard plastic that we've got on the
mm
erm which i think that's gonna solve one of the problems
it's gonna be cheaper doing it that way than going through u v a
u v a yeah
erm as i say but that is on there
now the mix up we had yesterday er on a lot of UNK when i got about this dust extract system one line three
i don't know whether people think they can move a dust extract in an hour or two hours
er we're limited with people and while brian was in the verge of moving it which the UNK all had to be took out and UNK he got called away down to the pre packs to a breakdown so obviously it didn't get done the job stopped cos there's nobody else
when i come back in things was all up in the air because while he was moving the first position of the dust UNK there's a radio there
and we'd squared it up once before because there was wires hanging all over from the sp not from the radio from the speakers
and we asked them to tie it up the lads made a bloody job i think they tied it up for coming round
which they did do but yesterday when brian went to move the dust UNK that the radio was at the side of there was wires hanging again like bloody clothes line again
so straight away he said that's it i i'll condemn it
and that's when he lost cooperation with the workers out there
they UNK him about apparently
went and signed the UNK off and signed the keys out and generally
well he was moving with the UNK their UNK and he come back and he says
pete was out there and i know a lot of UNK got UNK
yeah
said i walked away
yes quite right
it was it was personalities
yeah
more than anything
and i said to brian you know he's
out there wasn't it yesterday
you know i did say to brian
yeah well at the end of the day i mean i wasn't there but a the facts at the end of the day were that they'd been UNK about with that radio system which they shouldn't do
no
so i said to brian right leave it
i think the best thing there would be to leave it for a week
yeah
let 'em have it back
yeah
on condition that they don't do anything silly with it
that way UNK had his they've got their
it's yeah
radio back and everything should be status quo
yeah
but they shouldn't do that
they're not they aren't allowed they aren't qualified to bugger about with
well that have actually been told that if anything comes in providing this is what i can't get through we've said to them you can bring your UNK in but give to brian first
to check
let brian check them
it's not the radio though it's not
they they've put some speakers on it haven't they
they bloody speakers all over the place
i mean the UNK just as bad but really we've got on to them brian did and they made a good job they squared it up
but i mean i mean we still walk round there's wires hanging and UNK
mm
now
well it shouldn't be done anyway
it shouldn't be done
end of story as far as i'm concerned
but i think i think it was the way maybe the way brian approached them you know i think there's a little bit on both sides
but it was a bit of yeah
to come back in and get bloody UNK like that and it's you know and it
UNK be under stress anyway having to move that er dust UNK quickly and he's
well he got called away
had to go to a breakdown the poor bloke didn't know whether he was coming or going so one of these situations that stress arrives
yeah but as i say i just want to make it clear to people that it's er it's a bit of both and i think a bit of bit of heated argument was
this morning they're different again down there cos i've been down there and i've looked at the situation erm and i've had a word with the lads there and i will try and alter it a little bit more
which i'm g
give them a week then and give them their radio back then
i gave them some er jackets and trousers that i got in stock down there that's it then yeah
i see
er us i went to yesterday the UNK is now fully covered in secure er and the water system is working well
i as well but he's still a load of water on the top
a lot of water
did you get the
took it home last night
he took it home last night i w i got it going i got the time on it but i
he couldn't find an eleven year old kid to do it
because it's like an m f i
y all you need is an eleven year old kid you can't do it can you
take it home and sort it out
well apparently paul his erm his mate up there he's done works on the b t so he'll set it for him
nobody works for b t
only the buggers that send the bills out
while i was there we had the council man there
and he wasn't he said they can only stand the water problem so long so what they can do with it i don't know
i keep saying i said to dennis well it's on our property
there will be a report coming through because the chap from the council believe it or not said oh this should be UNK
and it's true it's right
dennis said i've got asthma you're not putting this under cover
but i mean when i went going towards they were screening it you know seeing it
it was
water on then
yeah
well you see you don't put water on when you put screening system
no
it's when it comes through isn't it
the stuff that they're using now is crap it's nothing like
it once was it's just so it's just absolute dust
UNK isn't it
well when tom
it's wo it's p it's not actually UNK it's wood flour
it is yeah
absolutely crap yeah it's nothing like it was i mean
why you know what i don't know what's changed in the meantime or whether we're paying different rates or whatever but if you take the material that we were getting in two three years ago when first time i was involved it's just absolutely nothing like
and there's no wonder it's blowing away cos it's just lighter than air
i mean in terms of stock
well it is you're right
in stock out
i UNK to think
i mean yesterday was yesterday really was there wasn't a deal of wind at all but bloody UNK
if it UNK up for three or four days it's st UNK up for three or four days and dennis has to stop the minute he picks it up it's just blown away
that's right you get so much in the hopper you get seventy five percent
yeah and it's blown away
in the hopper UNK and then the rest is in the field
well that's the first i've heard about the change to it
do you want to samples bringing d UNK going up on
tomorrow
yeah UNK going up tomorrow do you want some
who's responsible who's responsible
who buys the timber
who buys the d i y
well it's bought in it was an original contract that was but we buy it through here
we set the contract up
technology
technology
mm
it's been going ongoing for eighteen months two years change it
do you want some samples bringing down
tom knows what it's like cos last time i was up there yesterday tom was and chris UNK was up there and we went past an heap and it and we said is that a lorry load and dennis said well it was at this morning
i've got some original samples down here
what's changed is that they in the early days we used to get the UNK and they were ideally they used to put those through a UNK which is a thing that breaks it down and it's these it's UNK
yeah
yeah
that they break down
so you end up with a UNK if you look at that it's UNK about two or three mills square
and then what they used to put with that on each of the machines that have dust extract system
so if they were where the machine was UNK or UNK or whatever the UNK be UNK away like ours is into bins and then that used to go with the material we used to get
and that would be UNK
the way it looks now as if somebody else is getting the material that was the lumps maybe that's going to er what's his name technology and we're getting the crap we're getting dust
was there a specification set at the beginning do you know on this
hardly there's hardly anything there's hardly anything written down at all about this
sorry
i've got a deal in writing this
as far as the UNK concerned i mean obviously i think it says something very simple like d i y wood waste
yeah i d i think there's hardly anything in writing
i did in december but it was not relative to any of the specifications it was simply to try and ascertain how long the contract was still live to find out get this guy
well according to barry of technology it doesn't finish it's ongoing
arthur erm arthur actually met with him as well on that particular day
mm
but there was no talk at the time about
i think what you and i ought to do is sit down we ought to list the UNK and cons and problems of and look at them UNK and then maybe talk to tom anyway
what vis a vis
well if you take the site as a whole i mean there are numerous problems
they've got a problem at the minute where the UNK aren't very good
yeah
you've got the fact that you we're paying dennis but we don't employ dennis you know he's so there there's the extra cost there what you wouldn't have anywhere else
hello
the things that they
yes
the implications that are onto that and we've got
i'm just in a meeting at the minute
and really
coming over at dinner
i mean tea break
you've just got back
i'll give you a ring when i've finished then
alright
what's the difference between i UNK down this morning
we've got according to the information i've been given we've got seven thousand cubic metres of which is useful
no this is processed d i y
well according to dennis he thinks it's eight thousand
alright seven to eight thousand
yeah
we've got nine thousand of raw material not processed
yeah
the takes it to UNK it's a twelve week cycle isn't it
yeah
so we have four five six seven eight nine we haven't even got enough to see us through the next twelve months
but
twelve weeks
but out of this out of that seven thousand some are s weeks plus
some already been down four weeks five weeks six weeks
what of the eight thousand cubic metres
yeah now
i'm assuming that's twelve weeks is it
is that
yeah
th the eight the processed one are twelve weeks ready to go out the door
that's twelve weeks
now i have i've asked dennis and chris 's insisted that he deals with it so chris has taken it over and dennis is getting back to chris with the UNK of how much is ten weeks old eleven you know so you
right so the nine thousand raw material not processed in fact some of it's processed in various stages of
some wh is ready yeah some is on the road to being processed
i had a word with tom yesterday it was me who brought this up
i was concerned dennis has never been given any schedule since he last spoke to erm arthur which was get as much down as you can boy
i mean it was like that
he works like that
now i was concerned that nobody although they were looking at the water they were looking at the UNK they were looking at the electric nobody was actually looking at production up there
and where we stood
so i said tom like i says to tom
he then said right you ring dennis get the UNK and wha cos apparently paul used to flag them
yes
he started a system of UNK didn't he
mm yeah
he puts the date that it's laid down and then he knows how many weeks you know this is ready in three weeks time
so then tom had a word with chris and chris insisted that he did it
because he's got a plan of the site so he wants to know with his little squares what's what
and dennis is now going straight back to chris and he's going to give him
so he's probably got it now
it's d i y really not a function i don't think
not in terms of controlling what's down there and what's UNK
they all that we can do is to
that needs to be more production yes
specification if we know what it's meant to
which is since we had him here last time but we just ain't had time to get it do by
and also he's dropping in with unnecessary and you know when i'm short UNK
i think the think is though if you're not careful
well it is and i'm going concerned i mean it's i mean it's like now i mean th we've got UNK and plugs missing i've got toilet rolls
what you wanna do is i've just done a seven day report on the er on hazard spotting etcetera and all the different surveys we've had on the site over the past month
mm
plus risk management meetings works committee meetings work from
i think we can keep 'em going another week anyway
you've got another you've got another report coming from
well i mean i yeah
i think what you want to do now write down a list of what you want him to do and let steve do that for tomorrow if you can and then let's see if we can make him stick to that list cos otherwise he'll be here in
another fortnight saying can i give another fortnight
when we get this list typed up that UNK doing at the moment
yeah
then you probably have to take it from that and i think you'll find there's a weeks work on there
i'll
and now we're doing down the pre packs on the saturday apparently that's coming off my budget
the hours are being
yeah
george's hours are in the pre pack
yeah because they
they are not in your maintenance budget
they're not on my budget
no
i left his hours in the pre pack
i think this is quite interesting
the only one that's gone down to yours is bill last week for those four and a half hours doing that UNK
that's the only thing i've charged to you
all the rest has been kept by myself
so i've got something spare now
piece of metal put up over the entrance to the UNK plant please
it's gonna be like UNK two one day
bloody UNK
what do you mean shut them big doors and lock 'em
no just the piece of UNK iron that's just about to drop off
no it's not dropping off
now be sure that it's all in the pre packs it's been taken by the pre pack department
yeah
yeah
and it's not gone to yours
anyway who do you think's gonna stand my pay while i'm
yeah
eh you've got
you've got it all now
er now that is another thing peter about that hanging sheet
but have you seen the state of the doorway what somebody's UNK
can't blame me
have you seen it
that bay three doorway
no the big doors
and they've UNK it from the outside going in
could that be a lorry UNK in to tip sand and UNK in it
don't know
sand and UNK this way not that way
but er that i mean and then there's that's another thing we ought to look round there's the state of the shed outside
on the r main road
yes yeah it's not very good
it's not
it wasn't very good in nineteen eighty four
well somebody else has UNK it now ain't they further down
have they
yeah
but anyway that's all my UNK and UNK this morning
you know there was something wrong i was sitting listening i mean i'm not been involved when you were talking about the stock take somewhere along the line a few things have slipped because when you go back in the days when i used to be morning stock takes we used to before the event you would nearly always have the counts done
i'm thinking now the areas i used to do the UNK
i used to really go down there and all i did was sort of tick off what the lads had already done
cos used to tell 'em when it was gonna be and they would have time before the event to get it all UNK up it was all ready he would in and say there's such and such on that one such and such on this one
a four letter word dick time
and he would you would really only have to UNK because at the end of the day what you said about you mentioned somewhere along there ray about given the fact that they were UNK
and that's a problem because you really want the blokes counting who are used to counting
precisely
because otherwise you or i can only take your best estimate
oh aye
if you have the people doing it who know what they're doing you've really only got to look at what they're counting
in fairness the people what did it
well yeah i mean bear in mind bear in mind you've got a week's notice to put one together
mm
the most people that we could get together in a weeks notice we have to put the actual amalgamation of the team
yeah i'm not i'm not
over to someone else anyway
and malcolm sorted that out as you know
yeah i'm not UNK that
what i'm saying is
we did the best we could
that maybe it shouldn't have been a we a weeks notice then
yeah
correct but even the one prior to that which was apparently wrong which i think a lot of things were UNK
well we don't know whether it was wrong or not do we
no exactly but i think prior to that we did do what you're suggesting we did go round all the areas dick myself and malcolm and chris walked round all the areas told the people what needed UNK up to go in the it was before we had the racking up by the way so it was more messy
yeah
down there
and we UNK those areas up and we went round and said right the people with the problem areas take 'em round and show them
we designated the areas we UNK 'em off we did as much as we could pre UNK
this time there wasn't time to go round and do that
mm
malcolm myself and chris went round i think it was two days before looked for the well it's a lot UNK that it was the previous time because of the new racking
mm
it is easier to count there's not so much in the UNK as there were
the problem area's going to be the yard because we didn't have enough people to count the yard
we wanted to split it into three
mm
we had to split it into two
i volunteered then to do one of the yards because you know you're asking other people to do it was gonna be a nightmare
and you did have the odd team of people like don and UNK who o obviously hadn't done things before
but most of the teams
that was hardly
sorry
they UNK but even then if you've got somebody climbing up the top of a UNK shouting
the people were they was only UNK people i mean
what's on a UNK
yeah but we spent three hours lynne malcolm myself sorting that list out and everybody what was on the stock take
who was
worked in that area
i mean it
it we actually got the expertise and the people
we had problems because there wasn't an awful lot we had the good old ones back again
we had UNK and wendy and terry they'll come and do it
a lot of 'em you know where's mr
but i mean you know we didn't have much
i've got a lot in reserve you've got a
i honestly had to bully eric to get a list
i r you had a word with him didn't you
mm
so i rang him a bit later now look we've got a weeks notice we know it's gonna take some time
so i rang him up i said eric i haven't had time to ask anybody i thought well i'll bloody come down and ask you then
we got that much cooperation from up there didn't we
i mean UNK said i haven't done it before but if you need a UNK i'll come in
and we had people coming back after they'd actually done their run out there saying do you want any help with i mean that's what we asked them for
yeah we had a lot of people offering help
and they gave it
so i mean a as a team it wasn't really a problem at the end of the day
we ran short of numbers to do it if you like from seven thirty to twelve initially in terms of the original count and the original people when they'd finished their count
but if that was only i was gonna say the other thing when you're talking about damage you know at one time i would suggest that a good many years you wouldn't see any damage out there
no
and something's changed in the intervening time i mean i know there's UNK and times are hard i know we've cut back on the hours and the rest but there's a lot of things that aren't good
there's a lot more going out the gate for a start UNK
oh yeah
there's a lot hell of a lot more going out the gate
yeah
and it ain't coming in the gate
yeah but we've had we've had times before peter when there's been huge pressure
thanks UNK i think you've proved the point really by the length of these meetings
o normally a meeting of this type should take twenty minutes
mm
because there's so many there's so many things that are going on at the moment that it does take time
primarily because it's that time of the year when things will start going bad
we're just at the beginning of it and this is going to go on till the end of april or may now it'll be like this
chaos
cos it's that sort of business
well no
well i don't think it needs to be
that i know we're UNK a dead horse but that half past ten a UNK amount of time it should never ever have taken a fraction of that if it had been done properly
well how many weeks stuart have we been talking in here about UNK you wouldn't know because you haven't been in here
but we've been talking about it for three four months
every day
there's water on the site bloody there's a UNK problem
mm
he's gotta get a generator
and it goes round and around and around and around
well it's true
and the same things are spoken about every day
mm
yeah but you may spend that bloody standing at end of a bloody airfield here thinking nothing's been done
no UNK i'm just saying you know the reason the meetings are going on
but there is i mean i've assured him that things are being done
but it takes time
bring the same things up
all these massive problems that end result
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
but as i say
i mean i accept what they say that you
that's right i mean the i mean
it's part of isn't it that's
hello
okay
but i mean
finish
this idea UNK you know but you're just waiting while they get their load done to come up with some suggestion
i mean that might be er a solution to our water problem
i've spoken to him yesterday
you did
yeah i've spoken to tom he wants me to get an outline price which i'll do today
okay UNK let's get on
yeah that's alright
eric
and that's about i think that's about w vaguely covered everything
apart from one thing the lads out at taking this
apparently when they're not on the lines there's
and they're doing a pretty good out there for us and ray went out there
cos they're UNK all the other stuff
re UNK about ten thousand UNK
re UNK it all
so when it actually comes it's gonna be a lot cheaper cos we're not gonna send the lads up
you do
it is bless 'em
i mean you know how much it costs don't you for me to send those lads up there we worked it out steve
now hopefully dick said they're UNK while they're waiting for the containers they're also UNK the rest of that stuff
so can we give 'em some bonus for their work up there
can we have some bonus
how are you gonna work that out
i might as well be
it's what we used to do if we took them off a line and got them cleaning up it's a token tow pound ten a day
yeah
ten pound fifty the week
yeah
please
mm
thank you
is everything still alright up there eric
yeah it's going fine sir yeah
going fine
and is there a chance we'll give a little bit extra for the hour to cos he's organized it he's taken
yeah
he's not the charge hand he's taken charge he's taken responsibility
something like the line leader rate
which is about ten pence an hour extra
is he gonna on friday have fax both to er and to erm s to fetch the UNK and the generator the generator away
yeah
i'll ask mark to stay there while they're collecting it
yeah
yeah
yeah that's okay
he should be that lot three anyway
yeah
well i could always ring and ask them to get the container up here earlier on friday you see so
well whatever time you say
if i say if i say three
well you can make it three if you want
we'll be finished with it at three
right then i'll tell them three
cos i mean the UNK not a problem anyway
re oh it is for the
yeah i was thinking of the lights and them we hardly use the lights
saturday because mark
three of us
what about bringing your own lights
make sure everything is safe for the containers to come in
so that's already gone through
yeah well that what about your UNK sort that out next week or is it
are you leaving the UNK up here
well no it doesn't container we don't want
the other one back you see
yeah
we shan't UNK the other one
well so that one's got to go back to back to cambridge then hasn't it
yeah i've arranged that but i if the lights if erm
well caravan weren't we
three months time
well you won't get 'em in er
so three o'clock friday then we ought to be the lights before i suppose
yeah
can't we
oh yeah you can fetch the lights
you can fetch the lights friday morning seven o'clock friday morning
how many more UNK are like that steve
eh
how many more lots like that
how many more lots have come in
equivalent to what we've had
erm we've had
it'd be about
what have we had we've had twenty UNK in
yeah
twenty
that's twenty five twenty fifty five
erm equivalent of fifty five twenty UNK
so two and a half times as much again
it was about twenty five more
yeah two and half two and half time
so about another er two and a half weeks then maybe a bit less
maybe doing two weeks
well i think yeah we could put it up to three a day we'll got cos there isn't quite so much messing about you know
we could certainly go for three
when you say you want will it do a forty UNK
no it'll go twenty foot
yeah but i yeah but i mean
seven people here doing it
no
it'll go about fifteen foot into the
it's just whether it's worth having the hire for that one doing forty foot
well i think the one we've got is actually longer than the one you've got
i've never seen it fully extended actually so i
forty foot
yeah well it probably will be cos but it i mean they've never had to go to that extension have they
you see with it being twenty foot so i've never seen it fully extended
okay yeah
yeah i've just got when
this by the way when you've finished
right a few problems yesterday a UNK and trailer keys not being signed in and i had taking them home
yeah
pete says nobody's pointed a finger can we get big UNK on like hotel keys so they don't take the damn things home or leave them in their pockets
or if you
yeah you're right i mean
can we have big UNK on them or something so as they don't put the bloody things in their pockets
can you put that on his list for next week
yeah er yeah it is a good idea
right ian concerned that are UNK in grain into UNK then loading six five thirty five
apparently according to we are supposed to grain free t certificates
yes
we haven't seen one yet
yeah but it's in hand
that's alright
's UNK a bit of shit
that's alright
just for a change
bless him
right there's one for you
got that sorted he was speaking to guy yesterday and apparently if after two days we don't have certificates then i
hello
yeah
yeah
yeah it'll be about five minutes and then he'll be down
alright
check with him UNK that with ian
some problem i think on line three
can you go down when we've finished
right we're going down in a minute yeah
UNK erm pete said the erm hopper nineteen have any answers anything been thought on that one
well he's supposed to be testing it
left it with er
well he's put it on here give me an answer on what steps we should carry out on hopper nineteen
which is now empty or is it a UNK bed problem
so you want them to do
no i'll see him
will you
i thought they'd done it because ray i asked a question the other morning in the UNK cos it was on the board
you know they set out what
yeah
and i says to ray aren't we using hopper nineteen
he says yeah i've just used it worked perfectly
apparently he did use it but with a different he didn't put nutrients in it did he
i don't know i don't know
no apparently there's no problem at all
test with it was all arranged i thought testing to see what weight they got
can you just please
and oh probably after this meeting not now apparently peter came and see me about samples procedure i e marketing
so you me dick cos we're the ones that it's gonna be somebody they're gonna pull off aren't they to do these samples
maybe brian but what they want is initial contact point for somebody
samples for what
marketing samples
well they haven't got anybody marketing have they
they pull on
well that's UNK i think they've got plenty of people up here to do it it's just that they don't want to do it
what about the young girl they got up here young girl's here
isn't she there one day a week
i've no idea
probably what they'll be calling for is empty packaging erm you know what it's like UNK condition samples for sales that go out you know to customers
i mean the answer is that somebody's got to have a bit of experience to do it
it's not
what's that got to do with peter then
well it's go apparently there's got to be a procedure
it to be five seven five o
hello
sorry phil
it's only ten past ten
okay thanks
so again after this meeting cos i want to tie it up
it's gonna
yeah sometime
peter's UNK that he wants
peter
that much sooner and in the last hour couple of hours we've seen what i would call a UNK and UNK amendments erm because quite frankly there isn't that much difference between them er at the end of the day the impact on the people who've had to pay the bill is virtually the same
the amendment which has gone up there and which i think is being circulated is our amendment which is designed to achieve spending at the government target figure
now despite what er councillor said in the paper the other day there are no real UNK in this no rabbits to come out of our hats
because of course we did put er these proposals most of these proposals until we've had to erm at the board meeting er and we did give them full publicity in the cambridge evening news a couple of weeks ago
but you might say and i councillor did say in fact that of course we would be most unfair in the way that we did this because to quote from him er we were giving no time no time for discussion no time for evaluation no time
no time for evaluation and no time for consultation
well just i wonder how much time councillor actually wants to consider our proposals
i wonder if he's looked in the minutes of the council er for this time twelve months ago er when we proposed a very similar amendment to the one that's on the board there the figures are reduced er but certainly lots of the areas are actually there and in fact if he looked back even further in the minutes he'll see that it bears a striking UNK to what we actually proposed on the fourteenth of february nineteen ninety one
if two years isn't enough to consider the proposals that my group have consistently put forward i don't know how long it's
it's consistently wrong
well if they're consistently it's amazing that you have accepted something er actually moved in our direction this evening
can i quickly go through the various points
first of all we're not prepared to put the nine thousand back into the environment committee budget to er to save the cooperative development agency
i wish i'd brought the environment committee before so i could quote from it but from er recollection it says that organisation did not have a consistent record of producing a significant number of jobs and that the expenditure on funding them did not provide value for money
that's what the report said
everybody i thought accepted that in committee i can't remember what the liberal democrats did but certainly we did and certainly all the members of the labour group
so i can't see any reason er for putting that back but obviously we've
the argument about the contingency fund erm i find that amazing that er y'know up until a few hours ago you had to have two hundred thousand pounds
the labour group have now agreed to reduce it to a hundred thousand
i see no reason whatsoever for a council that will still have two and a half million pounds in balances after the labour group proposals why on earth we need to build another hundred thousand pounds into the budget paid for by er council tax payers to provide for UNK expenditure
i don't think we ought to provide it because that just means it gives the wrong impression to the officers i have to say
it gives the impression we're prepared to spend the money and that's what's happened in previous years and it shouldn't happen
if there was a desperate emergency you could find the money from other sources
i'm not going to go into any length about the community arts budget that is one area of service provision that we feel and i've said for the last two years does not provide value for money
i have not one person ring me up and say ooh you rotten tory taking that money out of
and i don't want any
so don't encourage the people to do that but that is true if it's so valued you would have thought there would have been an UNK there hasn't been
the councillor i am not UNK about getting rid of union representation what i am UNK about is union members paying for their own representation not me not the people out there if they want a full time union official let them pay for it but don't expect other people to pick up the bill it's ludicrous er to er put that sort of money in our budget
the local government information unit the labour party in disguise er i don't think we need to er waste money on having propaganda coming from them just simply attacking the government completely wasted
we've said all along that staffing the community centre should be reduced er and that we should be encouraging the community to take more interest in running their community centres
the do that in wonderful community centre i went there to a good function the other evening very good fish and chips and as well
they do it in and up the road in peterborough they've got about thirty eight community centre and the labour run council there is handing every one every one of them over to the local communities
there's no reason why we need to put this money in our budget
the corn exchange er oh public relations well i think that speaks for itself
i really did find that we sunk to the pits when we started circulating UNK for UNK on er poll tax er payers money that is absolutely ludicrous and we shouldn't be spending money on that
you made great play on how ooh advertising is going to pay for it all out of a budget of about sixty odd thousand pounds you've got fifteen hundred pounds in advertising
that's hardly paying for the UNK recipe let alone the proper information which was being given to the public
the corn exchange well i've said that one so many time i don't think i need repeat it
our philosophy is that it's not just UNK twenty five thousand pounds out of the air it's actually changing the way the corn exchange is and we feel strongly about that but we are not going to waste your time going through all that
reduction in committee administration budget of er fifty thousand pounds
this isn't just a figure drawn out of the air unlike councillor i can actually back it up because i've got the detail of that budget
do you know that in the last twelve months er we've produced or the office has produced twelve hundred twelve hundred reports to committees at an average cost of six hundred pounds each and that's just in officer time in writing them nothing to do with the paper they were printed on the cost of printing the cost of distribution the cost of our time to discuss them and our attendance allowance
that is over a million pounds right in that budget for committee administration and you ask me where we can save fifty thousand pounds well start producing a few less reports
let's have a more radical view of the committee structure
we get rid of the cycling working party and what do we do out of the UNK rises another UNK the transport work
what a waste of time we all know that the county council is the highway authority and is fully responsible for traffic management we're in a minority and to set up a working party is a complete waste of time
information technology costs councillor said don't worry we've already saved a hundred and fifty thousand pounds in the last year
alright fair enough you accepted what we've been saying for ages that we had to go to voluntary competitive tendering right
well why on earth if you're s y'know you embark on that route why don't you put something in the budget for the fruits of that exercise and we believe that you can save money by that and that er this is going to be one of those budgets that's gonna end up er under strength at the end of the day because of that
the we're coming closer on the er figures for the er staff turnover and i believe that the four percent which is easily achievable on the thirty first of december nineteen ninety two the turnover savings were running just below four percent alright we just cut some of the post out of today's budget but i still think if we give the wrong messages to the officers er we're in danger of spending money that we don't need to
we need to keep a tight control on staff turnover and we need to pay tight control on our staff budget
let's face it it's the largest amount we spend in this council is money spent on our employees
the balance of this er well the community groups we don't feel it's right to spend that money at this point in time until we've sorted out er where the other four hundred odd thousand pounds is actually going in that budget before we start throwing even more money
the final point is taking money out of the reserves to make sure that we don't have to put back twenty two pounds on the council tax
that's obviously been accepted by the labour group because they have taken extra money out of reserves we're simply going to take some more out to meet our er our figure that we're trying to achieve
mr mayor we all want to provide quality services by this council
every one of us we wouldn't UNK our time our precious time serving in local government if we didn't believe in local government and didn't want to provide the best possible services to the people of this city
but i come back to what i've said at the outset mr mayor in conclusion
there is a still a clear divide between the conservative groups and the other two groups on the council
obviously labour and the liberal democrats have no desire to UNK council tax bills
we've been saying the same thing for the last three years and i've got the minutes here to prove it
that message needs to be got home i'm pleased to note this evening that after three years of making these suggestions you have at last started to accept some of them
it is a step in the right direction
there's further to go and we're gonna keep saying these things until we're blue in the face as well as
keep on UNK that message home mr mayor and i beg to move this
thank you is there a seconder for the amendment please
i'll second that it was quite overwhelming
debate on the amendment
councillor yes i'm sorry
thank you mr mayor
couple of points not the one
i refer with er councillor to the remarks i made earlier about the tr the post of the trade union i don't propose to say any more on that
but it's interesting isn't it that we have here the proposed UNK of subscriptions to local government information unit one thousand five hundred pounds
is that a desire to save one thousand five hundred pounds or a desire to prevent the rest of us finding out what your government's really up to
councillor
i'd like to erm just say a few words about erm the three erm reductions in the budget of the erm er the erm community services erm the erm UNK of the arts budgets you probably have heard this before but i do think it's a great pity that erm when it was on the basis and i think very little knowledge of un and understanding with erm er of what arts is about which is to delete one of the was one of the erm the erm things in this council which we actually do best it's one of the things which has attracted attention from way beyond cambridge erm and which is UNK has undoubtedly to communities in which it takes place erm as far as the erm oh the erm community staffing of community centres erm this looks like erm in calculations involved handing over the r the management to the community centres to erm volunteers
in the first place volunteers are be there
there's no reason why we should change our method of managing er community centres
it's a UNK mixture between erm youth volunteers and the youth paid extra workers
some of our some of our er community centres are in fact run by volunteers some of them are run er most of them in fact have a very large substantial volunteer input
but when you have a community centre like street that is which a joint you can see the value of maintaining it as a paid for as a erm and be substantial volunteer input that exists
erm to comparison with UNK particularly useful but it might be must be said that peterborough do have problems with at least three or four of the their community centres all the time in fact have quite a substantial budget on er staff involved in sorting out problems with voluntary managed community centres
the fifty thousand well i if they do they haven't been able to what we intend to do
the er budget this year is greatly over UNK erm but applications for grants for people who are being of their work in their community
the additional money that we're looking for this year er a substantial amount of this will go to funding of the rent for the new premises for the c the UNK advice bureau and i don't propose to stand here and defend the UNK advice bureau because it doesn't need it i hope
erm the rest of this money would be used part to fund additional workers in er minority ethnic community groups children's groups the community service strong support with housing officers in dealing with housing management problems and a and possibly from community radio among others
we are here to serve people of cambridge and it's quite clear that the people of cambridge do want good services they want they want services which improve the quality of life in the cities and this is precisely what is erm spending is there to do
thank you
i've got councillor
erm thank you mr mayor erm i'm taking up to speak about the community arts
i think it's fair to say that it's not quite as simple as just UNK that item out of the budget there are in fact i think five or six people working for community arts and in the events of that item being deleted we would presumably have to add on the costs of making them redundant erm an and dis erm the community arts scheme i think represents it's true to say a range of expertise
it's not something that can be done or UNK very easily by people without expertise
their expertise lies in enabling others and others to take advantage of arts facilities and helping them erm or working with them to produce the things that happen for example all the erm posters which were up during last years festival erm were produced in conjunction with community arts which erm has erm er produced on UNK place erm and earlier this morning i was thinking that up as i think other councillors did that more serious of projects which community arts are now entering into er in UNK in particularly in the children erm i think councillors went to UNK women's photograph project and it is things like that about giving people confidence to join arts in a way erm with which they might never otherwise have experienced and the community arts have taken just that
i think erm it's interesting erm to listen to desert island UNK the last two weeks that the luxury item chosen has been a piano and people are saying that they would like very often there are a lot of people who'd like the opportunity to have learnt a musical instrument
now i don't think of us here and neither certainly myself i would not claim to be any form of artist or expert but i think a lot of us can enjoy er getting our hands UNK with paint erm paper UNK and other activities and in fact having that opportunity of ex enjoying those experiences that's we ought to be able to offer to people in cambridge and many peop children in schools they do get opportunities but i think particularly amongst older people who've never had that opportunity and i think you should be do so
the community arts team i believe is an example an excellence in its field as a team
sadly we're seeing things too often which have expertise but i think on this occasion we should support the community arts team and not delete the item from the budget
here
councillor
yes thank you mr mayor
i just want to talk very briefly to the about er reducing staffing at community centres and with particular reference to one in the ward that i represent which is street
that centre for one of the staff who work there make quite profound impact on the quality of life for many people living on our estates and i cannot see anything more short sighted than denying access to the sorts of services and the sorts of UNK that people can get from use of a community centre like that by cutting back on staffing so that we can't actually use the capital resources that we've b the capital that we've invested in facilities like that
it's an absolutely crazy idea
councillor
thank you mr mayor erm i probably will repeat some of the things that have already been said with regard to community arts
we can't let this erm moment pass without actually er defending this particular service
erm i think it's important for us all to remember what community arts is about
now the tory party are forever UNK us about choice are they not
how a lot of this legislation will about choice
now for some of our members choice is not something that they are fortunate enough to have because they are very UNK and they do not have perhaps all the education that some of the tory party perhaps have that they have been less fortunate in many ways
there are also there are many people with special needs who don't have much element of choice about their lives
the thing about community life is that even setting aside the actual word arts through the way in which community arts workers work with small groups of people who have come together because they're doing something interesting because it looks something that they want to do brings groups of people together
that's then produces people talking to each other
it then helps them to share their problems it then encourages them
because they start talking they realise that there's something that they can do about their problems and then they can start to campaign
now to help those problems
now that might stand oh you say UNK y'know rubbish you just sort of depend in this particular way it's not
community arts is a very important part of the community development
it is through these means that the people our people all the people in this city many of them bound together and then able to go out and think about their civic lives if you like their civic the way th that this council works perhaps and take part much more in just go in and putting little crosses on pieces of paper maybe
people who have never voted before might think yes i suppose that's how we change things
by getting together and talking to each other in this way
that's what community development is about that's what community arts is about
to say that it's not value for money how can you
i had this councillor mentioned this morning that mr community arts erm until april and russell street self image problem
working with adults who have suffered or are suffering from mental illness using drawing and slide photography
this is not value for money we're working with very UNK people in our community
we can't just turn round and say right scrap this whole and very valuable part of this council's work
i would support the community arts programme but i would point out that many elements of it are er the kind of things that technically are the responsibility of the county council's services department
although i don't i don't support any the less for that
er mr mayor there's only one point i want to make an and that is this is a rather typical conservative budget
i was hoping for something different this year and for a budget that erm er proposed that didn't depend on er us taking far more from reserves than any other party
but this one does the same thing as ever
er the main part of conservatives er saving on the council tax is by taking comes from taking eight hundred thousand pounds than anybody else
erm if you compare for example erm their real savings on er budgetary items er it comes to about half a million just over half a million er compared to the ones we're putting forward about a third of million and if you look at the UNK in the two budgets for that you'll see that erm we disagree with their saving on community arts and that er they propose saving on in on information technology costs is unrealistic er that market is changing very rapidly there's another large organisation in this city which has found us going down track which we are now proposing to down has produced no income at all no reduction in cost at all
erm so i don't think that one's achievable erm i think what this amounts to is that erm there are two cuts that we don't agree with er there's a vast on reserves we don't agree with but we managed to put forward a thousand pounds for education at the same time erm i this does strike me as a budget of a party which it knows has no prospect of any sort of responsibility in this council for a long time to come
i'd just like to address two points which
which none of my colleagues seem prepared to direct to
nonetheless the public has a right to know
that is the questions which we've raised councillor over the contingency plan and also the three point five percent as opposed to
i think they're unfair questions to respond to erm if you look at the potential calls on the contingency budget in the forthcoming year they're been outlined by the officers
the first is the reduced subsidy grant for council tax housing benefit
you can blame the government for that
the second is the increased take up of council tax housing benefits which we anticipate you can blame the government for that
the third is the interest on which will be unknown until the council's tax starts rolling in
you can blame the government for that
support in court costs in respect of sunday training trading you can actually blame the government for that as well for not sorting the mess out
the fifth is the abbey pool UNK pool non closure potentially
and then you can't blame the government
but
might be able to blame UNK
erm and that i think the response therefore to your position on financial figures for the contingency fund is if you sort the government out we might be able to
the second point on the three point five percent turnover
in the past three years we've adopted a three percent turnover
we have not ever yet achieved a fourteen point two turnover and i grant you that at christmas we were up just under the four percent mark
it's predicted for the end of this year that we will be under four percent on our turnover savings
now those are in years for consistently what we have done is we have held those savings in order to do what we said earlier UNK this council back and we structured the organisation by UNK back on staff and that's why th the vacancies had run as high as they have
now given that so much of that UNK has already been done and given that even given that situation we have never yet reached four percent UNK er turnover savings i think it highly unlikely and so do the officers that they will be achieved this year
finally we did look once again at that area of the budget when you put that in
we got advice from the officers that three point five percent might be achieved and therefore we acted on that advice in making the amendments which we did
i think that's a prudent way of going about things it's responsive t to the questions which you might possibly have read and but it doesn't make over optimistic assessments about the likely savings that the council control
councillor second it
thank you mr mayor
my modest er surprise at the beginning mr mayor was purely in recognition actually of my er colleagues presentation bearing in mind all the previous criticism about being specific
if i may say so very well councillor and you were specific and indeed backed up the particular figures even though of course one is entitled to the that i thought it was fair and well argued
but the first thing that's the first thing to bear in mind the first thing to bear in mind of course is had our previous proposals in other years been accepted mr mayor we would need it as it were to make these cuts from this year
the second point is that of course as we accept into the role of opposition indeed to give these alternative proposals give this UNK case to come within the government guidelines
but i think of course we can all debate er the various individual proposals and i think if we were in control of the council not only of course would we have different policies but the sort of detailed matters which would come up in debate would be discussed in committee things would be in the normal way
so it's not necessarily that one has to be too critical of all the individual items in the way that some people have
the fact remains that we as a council if we wish to can meet a proper prudent budget and the alternative proposals tonight which is really the er unfortunate ones which would appear to be going through are really not UNK that this is not the time to impose additional council tax or anything else on the people of this city when generally speaking their personal finances are not at their best
this council is not sympathetic to that councillor
er basically this council will spend what it will whatever the guidelines
our role is to propose a prudent council tax and that is what we've done and at the end of the day i agree the figures are UNK one way or another but it does show a net saving of one point three million and however you look at it mr mayor i'm sure the leader of the council if he adopted these proposals could then find somewhere a sum for a stress control officer
it was in the original setting we realise the UNK difference between myself and chris that when graham gets up to speak the earth moves
this is
and many of the matters have been dealt with erm i think by speakers on various sides of chamber
w what i go for are two major points i think which actually demonstrate the UNK of this budget that has been proposed to us as an amendment
the first is how much at variance it is with what actually a conservative government seems to expect
and that seems to be to demonstrate difference between what is happening whether we like it or not at central government level and input of somebody who is UNK of opposing UNK and that is the to two particular items within this alternative budget
the first is the cut in public relations
we are being told time and time and time again i think once more talking about this about UNK and the need for the public to know
i'm personally going to throw up being told that this is
this is actually essential
cutting public relations actually means saying to people in this city you have got less access to information from the council
we're not trying to say to people the information is there come in and get it we're actually trying to present it to them
whether they're the UNK charter whether they are response to people from the press or from the public or constantly ringing in to the switchboard or whether it's by all the other ways in which we UNK information
this is something which the government has learned how to do so i must think that this is highly motivated politically on their part given the way in which the difference between public information and conservative party political propaganda is becoming a UNK to
erm that this council had a tradition of actually putting forward information in as straightforward a way as possible and indeed the attitude of the UNK er charter working party demonstrates that we actually put a value on this and it seems to me that there is a gap if you like between what some people in the conservative group are doing in this context and what they're actually doing in working parties and in committees and it comes out elsewhere as well
community groups the community services budget in general
it's very interesting that the only way in which one tory hand went up in support in community services committee for any of the things we had before us and i can only worry was only because the
and they said well you know we was there
how long is he going to be la leader of the group y'know
on the ground when we look at services your voters your supporters and group not only in the budget
we are talking about care in the community we know there a on routine fifty thousand pounds extra to community voluntary groups which we can well afford it flies in the face of the group the UNK of the people that we represent and what the government is expecting
this is a UNK budget and we will happily throw it out with a fairly strong vote
would you like us to take it in roman UNK order
least you can do
thank you okay all those in favour of the amendment please show and all those against the new found conservative
right can we
mr mayor if i may amendment if i may
another amendment
a very brief one i'm pleased to say
this is a fair chance i think mr mayor this amendment is very self explanatory i think we seek to UNK the noise budget pollution to its original thirty thousand
the twenty thousand required to make that spend will come out of public UNK budget
i think i speak for the vast majority of the environmental health committee when i say that the UNK and noise pollution has been one of our ongoing major concerns in things for the last twelve months
noise mr mayor is one of today's great UNK
be it industrial domestic or social it is a major cause of neighbour disputes
the problem is UNK acute in the evenings and at night when parties music and other noise sources can have most effect
i'm sure we can all recall cases of being driven to UNK by UNK music and late night noise especially during the working week
the purpose of thirty thousand mr mayor will be to extend the night time quiet service to all seven nights of the week
this will have great benefits for residents across the city who currently have little UNK against any UNK neighbours making undue noise
as you know mr mayor we are inside the chamber don't believe in spending any more than is absolutely necessary in any part of any budget so rather than spend any extra money we are proposing an extra twenty thousand be taken out of the public UNK budget
in the original proposals there was in fact scope for savings of a hundred and ten thousand pounds in this budget
in the event we agreed to only save seventy nine thousand pounds
as you can see therefore there is at least some scope for further savings without actually causing undue pressure to this particular budget
as with all financial decisions mr mayor this one comes down to a matter o a question of priority
this group places extremely high priority on the UNK of noise pollution and i hope it's something we can all support
councillor i had to admit that i'm slightly lost in that one a now ends as i understand it with the roman UNK three that was proposed in the labour amendment
that is now the end because of the difference of one a but if you're proposing that this comes at the end of one a you're proposing to tack it on to the end of roman UNK three in the labour amendment as was the council's which i take it was not what you intend its effect to be
so could you please UNK if you so wish your amendment so that it comes in the appropriate point
okay so
you want this added at the end of roman UNK four
councillor
sorry is there a seconder for the amendment
er yes mr mayor i would severely question the effect of this amendment in two parts and erm the second part er UNK the bit for noise er if er we don't take a vote for public UNK
