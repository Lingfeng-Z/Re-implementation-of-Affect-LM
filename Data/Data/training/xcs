can i can i take it this way
UNK your opening to me you were saying that there's expert evidence that solicitors instructed in the purchase of a property must ask about financial arrangements and advise about them
secondly it is the solicitors must advise about clause twenty two and thirdly well that's about it really isn't it
well my lord and yet
because the UNK factual
yes but my lord d dealing also with the suggestion by the defendants that it would have been UNK to advise him to serve completion notice when he wasn't in a position to complete and the solicitor deals with the expert deals also with that position as to what is the practice of a solicitor in that situation if there's a potential er problem for that particular solicitor to what the advice should be as to how the client should deal with the that
well that depends on the terminology of the of the rule doesn't it
does that require expert advice
well i think that the way the case is put is that
let's just have a look at them have you got the general conditions here
yes there is there is a bundle er a and what it deals with is the availability to a purchaser of the service of the special notice to complete er if the vendors are not completing and then if don't comply with it within a certain time limit the contract is UNK
now of course that it is the defendant's case i anticipate erm is er although there's nothing specific in the rule about it is said to be er only a possibility for a plaintiff if the plaintiff when they sell he or she served the notice to complete is in a position to be able to complete himself and here
well he's got to be in a position to complete by the time the notice runs out
well i think its the way that the plaintiff puts the case on that point my lord is that even if the defendant mr took the view er that it would not have been proper for such a notice to be served in view of what the plaintiff was saying to him about his wish to get out of the contract the fact that it was available to him should have been brought to his attention and then as mr was saying that i sorry i don't feel i can do this on your behalf because it's not proper in the circumstances or whatever erm should then have gone on to advise the plaintiff either to do it himself or to go and seek independent advice
but should to say nothing at all the matter not being drawn to the attention at all was not right
so the those are the issues the factual issues of the matters at issue
but my lord what erm i
er a notice to complete is a is a notice to complete and not a notice to withdraw
certainly i accept that
but i don't erm from the nature of mr justice in the midland bank that there's a well known but w what i say is that in this case er what your lordship will be dealing with are essentially what are matters of practice for conveyancing solicitors when faced particularly with clients er making financial arrangements to enter into this and the duties of in that particular situation
does it really help to call them label them that of practice er mrs because the end of the day they're not matters of practice they're matters of law
either they're under duty or they're not
well if that were so my lord then there would never be any solicitor's negligence claims in which any expert was ever called to give evidence because it's always going to be eventually a matter of law as to what the defendant's duty is but what the er what the plaintiff had not said at any stage is that a matter of law is ever going to be admissible and in fact the is justice our in the course of er a case in which he despite expressing reservations about the UNK of the evidence plainly admitted it because he was within the course of his judgement
er he may be concerned but my lord erm there has been reference to the er the professional negligence and my lord there is a bit i have in court i'm afraid the second edition because the third edition which is the latest was not available to me this morning but there's a paragraph in it and i want to refer your lordship to it i wonder if i might read it and er hand it up to your lordship
what i'm just checking to see is erm it appears in does your lordship have the
is this actually a book that er is going to be of any assistance to me
i think
well my lord it might
those authors are still alive aren't they hopefully
my lord in my submission it will be yes because of there's some er reference
well why don't you just adopt their UNK as part of er won't have to pay any copyright fees for doing that
can i just ask you to look at page three hundred and forty of and
yes have you got it
i don't think we've got it
er i thought your lordship had it i'm sorry i thought i'd your lordship
no i haven't got it
oh i'm sorry my lord perhaps i could read the passage out and then er i can hand it up to your lordship but it after setting out the UNK from mr justice in the midland bank
erm the UNK say that and i rely upon this because it's important in my submission that it is submitted that a wider view might be taken as the function of a solicitor as expert witnesses
while of course the extent of the solicitor's duty is ultimately a question for the court surely this is a mixed question of fact and law
even if there is no directly relevant practice of the profession the evidence of other UNK as to what they do in similar cases and why is likely to be of benefit to the court
a knowledge of the working of a solicitor's office particularly er o of those departments handling non contentious business cannot be automatically UNK to the judge or to council and he may as well make it is not UNK for an expert witness to give evidence of what he would have done in a particular situation after consideration and er i resign on that because in my submission er the issues in this case are clearly issues of mixed fact and law and my lord it is seen from the report handed up that there is particularly in relation to the erm financial aspect of the case reference to a provision within a professional conduct of solicitors guide as to what the nature of the er duties of the solicitor in the situation is
er and i rely
well that's not in dispute you can you can put in that er that guide
yes
although in fact you haven't pleaded it er
no my lord it's not pleaded certainly but it but it's part of the expert report
it should be it should be if it's part of the basis upon which you are making an UNK that a duty arises
well my lord i don't know
you are saying that
whether it could properly be said that it's a duty because it's not it's a guide er the question arises as to whether it's a duty but of course it's here it's always been in the UNK report incorporated in it the reference to it erm but er lord in my submission er it is undoubtedly correct that your lordship would be greatly helped by hearing evidence from a solicitor engaged regularly frequently in commercial conveyancing work as to what the extent of the practice the accepted practice and the professional standards operated by solicitors in this field and
see what his qualifications are shall we
he's an expert and to tell us what the practice is
yes my lord er you can see that er on page one in paragraph one two he is a partner in a firm of he qualified as a solicitor in nineteen seventy three and became a partner in nineteen seventy six and since qualifying so that er some twenty five years ago he has dealt primarily with commercial and residential conveyancing and his contained in paragraph one and three er he's been asked to advise on the extent of the duty of professional care and skill in relation to mr financing the transaction and the extent to which they were under an obligation to advise mr of any opportunity to UNK
well that doesn't show any er expertise in what goes on in a solicitor's office at all
well my lord
we may know what practices and particularly his own what he can he tell me about what er the practice of solicitors up and down the country
well he's b the second part he's UNK his opinion on clearly what the plaintiff's case is about what he was what he was telling mr to do
i accept that erm and of course he's dealing with it approaching it from the basis that factual issue is one she's resolved in favour of the plaintiff erm it may be that there's very little issue between us it may be that the defendant would concede if your lordship were to find that er the plaintiff had been asking mr on several occasions to get him out of the contract it may be UNK i know not
the that condition should or would have been drawn to his attention that is the major factor in this dispute which goes
but the expert is dealing also with the financial aspect of the claim
but er isn't the situation here that er UNK advisor to very UNK solicitors and so are the defendants in this case
yes indeed
w what w what am i to UNK from this expert reports
that they are solicitors who would have handled the situation differently from er the defendants
well my lord the issue is that the defendants deny they were under any duty to offer any advice about financial
yes but i can't receive expert evidence on that because that's the very thing i have to decide isn't it
my lord it will be helped in that situation in my submission by evidence from which is dealing with what is the accepted and standard practice in that solicitors in handling these forms of transactions and what advice is given my lord undoubtedly that must be of benefit to the courts
i know not it may be that mr is saying this is something that never it's never i've never understood it to be er part of my practice or part of any solicitors practice to offer such a and if we have a solicitor er who has constantly UNK in his skills for a very lengthy period of time that is saying oh yes it is because this as far as i'm concerned standard advice which solicitors should give to clients transactions
your lordship must be helped in that considerably by that evidence
to resolve that conflict between them
i can't fault a solicitor er to say that there's no practice unless i call an expert to give that opinion
mr who's the defendant of course
you haven't pleaded any practice mrs you haven't pleaded any practice
well my lord the case is about the practice of solicitors and i've pleaded upon the practice that's part of the statement
it's not about the practice of solicitors it's pleaded that there's breach of contract
my lord it's pleaded that there's common practice in the statement of claim
well you haven't pleaded a term of the contract that there's a practice to which all solicitors are subject that they have got to do this that and the other
my lord with the greatest respect that UNK my submission from the pleadings er in the statement of claim
in paragraph four specifically paragraph four page seven
that the negligence or rather the breach of the implied term was failing to ensure as is the common practice amongst solicitors that the proposed source of finance had in fact agreed both finance for the transaction and the term UNK
that is clearly pleaded my lord now unless i can call mr to say er yes it is er i cannot deal with
does common practice means does common practices means it's a practice which is common or
well yes
not common to all of them but
yes
common amongst them
yes the that is the a practice
now i unless i can call mr to give evidence that it is i cannot deal with mr er contention which may be anticipated in the witness box
because er unless i can call er a conveyancing solicitor to say yes it is common practice er the plaintiff is proceeding very much at a disadvantage
i it's clearly the defendants case that it's not UNK and as mr is undoubtedly going to say
there's plenty there's plenty of legal authority of course on this very question isn't there
well my lord no there isn't that is in my submission there isn't
oh isn't there
in my submission there isn't
well you surprise me
i seem to remember several cases in which the court considered to what extent the solicitor involves himself in the financial arrangements for a conveyancing transaction
well my lord not er so far as i'm aware
we are dealing specifically with a lack of information for commercial conveyancing and the extent that the conveyancing solicitor duties in that situation
that is the that is the key to it in my submission
because that is what is at issue between the parties
the er the defence case is that er there was no duty a and in my submission it must be of assistance to your lordship to determine that issue to hear evidence from both sides upon whether there is such a practice and if there is what the extent of it is
a and that is my submission it is not a matter of law but a matter of fact a and practice
thank you mrs
at this stage i take the view it is very unlikely that there's anything in this expert evidence that will be of the slightest assistance to me and i'm not going rule it out
question of UNK it doesn't arise unless until we get to that part of the plaintiff's case and erm i shall hear the evidence of the plaintiff and the other witnesses first and the UNK can be renewed in due ti in due course at the proper time
i'm not encouraging it because as i say i really present time i can't see that it's going to be of any assistance to me to have the opinion of solicitors from er from any part really from the defendant or someone else
on these matters
my lord er those er in essentially are the matters to which erm i wanted to draw your lordship's attention in
er my lord may i say that er in relation to the witness statement erm clearly the credibility of this the plaintiff mr is going to be substantially in issue er and therefore er i propose er not to simply to tell him er and say erm in your witness statement your evidence erm but clearly to take him to those areas which are in dispute and to ask him to deal fully with them in i appreciate it's going to erm take some time to do that but it is important in my submission that your lordship has the ability to er assess the plaintiffs
yes
erm and my lord i hope that
do you in fact wish me to read the evidence in this case you have decided that have you
well my lord as i said as i said at the beginning i think the both mr and myself considered that it might er assist your lordship considerably if you have some time now to read er the witness statements and the reports from the expert which are in bundle three and indeed erm
the experts er they deal with the damages
yes
don't they
yes and i think y my lord the plaintiffs will be cross examined quite considerably on the damages claimed and i think it might help your lordship to see erm the way
the case in which the evidence on damages is going to possibly erm enable me to form a better view of the credibility of the witnesses
well my lord i think
or why or do we need to try this go into this business of a fairly complicated damages assessment as part of the liability claim
sorry my lord
well my lord i must say it had occurred to me erm that certainly on the basis on which i'm UNK for damages to be assessed with the plaintiffs and it is completely irrelevant er many of the matters to which the defendant's expert goes to as to the damages and the extent to which they were caused by the negligence of the defendant the breach of duty
erm but my lord er i think the difficulty is that as far as my learned friend is concerned er he takes the view and it's probably better for him to develop this your lordship that the matters cannot properly be separated and he wishes your lordship to deal with them in total so that er the whole picture can be seen at liability stage
yes
to enable him to cross examine the plaintiffs as er he sees appropriate
yes alright
er my lord it's been
i'm a bit reluctant to embark on a on reading reports of this nature which are liable to mean very little to me till i UNK until i've obtained the view from the
yes
from the general history of what the case is about
yes my lord i i'm not going to invite your lordship t to take a great deal of time reading reports that state in detail erm but i think the witness statements and i think probably the documentation that might help your lordship at this stage er to see something of the and to ensure that where evidence is given it can proceed fairly quickly
mr is er twenty five pages
mr is er eighty pages
my lord i'm more than happy to for your lordship not to not look at the details of the UNK evidence at this stage a and concentrate on the witness statements and the documentation which deals with liability matters
so it's bundle
it's part a trial bundle
trial bundle
two one of two of the pleadings
part a one and two
and then er part b UNK one two and three er my lord you want to look at the documentation which is dealing specifically with the purchase of the wine bar
it starts at page one seven eight pages one seven eight to forty effectively deal with the crucial aspects of
er i'm sorry i hadn't quite understand understood how you trial bundle a one is the pleadings bundle
yes my lord the witness statements
yes i well i did have one of those
yes
but i give it back to er cos i have two pleadings UNK
ah yes one was UNK i think and one wasn't my lord
and the pleadings bundle which i've got also seems to be erm from your side but it's er seems to be the trial bundle that was lodged with the court rather than the one that you've a different order and different UNK
yes does your lordship have trial bundle two part a the witness statements
pardon
does your lordship have part a trial bundle two
yes i do
yes the witness
i have one and two now and i give this back to the associate he can keep that and you can keep this one
and er my lord
you can have that one back
the documents that my learned friend and i think would be most useful to your lordship to read at this stage would be pages one seven eight four two five
where do i find those
my lord trial bundle part b er and then er UNK one and two
you're not asking me to read the part er b at all at this stage
my lord
my learned friend and i thought that if your lordship wanted to look at the documentation so that your lordship is familiar with some of the documentation which is going to be referred to in the evidence er simply to enable your lordship to be er a little more familiar with the nature of content of some of the documentation then the crucial documents are those of pages one seven eight to four two five bundle b
what oh d
bundle b
yeah
which is in part one and two files one and two
yeah
er that together with the witness statements my lord i think
well that is that's getting on for two hundred and fifty pages of document
my lord yes of course
but i think it's time i think we both agree that the time er well used because it's for the because your lordship will have a better understanding of the evidence when the plaintiff and the defendant give it from the witness box
yes well it strikes me that this case involves some very narrow issues really it's generated an awful lot of paper
it has my lord
well now how long is this going to take me
well erm my lord i don't know whether you'd like to take certainly the rest of the afternoon and sit again tomorrow at ten thirty to get a clean start having read all the documentation or whether you feel that you could read it before then
i think that there's a lot for your lordship to read but i think it might be beneficial in the long run it was certainly our experience has been that it certainly would take time in the long run but to deal with it this way
yes well er what do you say mr
well my lord as a time UNK it would quite er how my er learned friend went through the documents i it in the contents she would otherwise make and one UNK that it would take a great deal longer
my lord it may help to say that if your lordship does this reading my lord i don't intend to take your lordship through the documents any more myself in opening because i think once your lordship has seen the extent of it i'm going to call mr to give evidence and go to through the documentation that way once
er and i don't intend to take up any more of the UNK time simply opening myself documentation and making points upon it
obviously preferable to get evidence given about the documentation which is why i advise consider it necessary for your lordship to UNK yourself with it now
well if i'm going to read this er at all properly it's going to take me all afternoon isn't it
that's what the parties want
my lord i think it's right that it's clear from the discussions i've had with mr that the plaintiff is going to be in the witness box for some considerable time and i think if your lordship's had an opportunity to read the witness statement seen the areas of dispute the nature of the fact that UNK and had a look at some of the documentation it would be much er a much UNK process than it would otherwise be
very well then i i'll adjourn into chambers and i don't require the attendance of the parties or council until tomorrow morning
members of the jury and you'll be pleased to hear that i'll be doing that quite quickly
can i start however by telling you what this case is not about
it's not about police UNK
it's not about racism in the police force it's not about UNK amongst police officers
it's not about violence or UNK police officers and i say that because for the last few years there's been an awful lot of publicity about the particularly in the metropolitan area and i ask you will have read some terrible things about certain police officers
put those out of your mind
indeed yesterday you may well seen on the news heard on the UNK seen in the papers forget such attacks
it's also not about macho gun UNK ho policeman as has been suggested
what it is about members of the jury is a very professional police force doing the best they could in the circumstances
and what do they try to do they were trying above all else to protect you and i the general public
and this is a police force you will remember mr telling you very remarkable characteristic
never in it's entire history has it shot a gun in anger at a human being
and what does that tell you members of the jury about this police force
what does it tell you about their UNK
now in this case the police have the burning proof we have to satisfy you of in particular three things
firstly as you have probably already gathered we have to satisfy you that there were reasonable grounds to believe that lawrence was in the flat the plaintiff's flat
secondly we have to satisfy you that in order to that flat they used only reasonable and necessary force
and thirdly we have to satisfy you that in the circumstances of the operation the police were justified in UNK mr with UNK for the short period of time that he was UNK and in addition mrs who you will remember was UNK in her lounge she was told she couldn't leave the lounge again for a few minutes
and members of the jury we don't that we have to prove that to you
and in a UNK shell it is our case we say the police what the police did was reasonable in the circumstances and indeed to go any further and say what they did was necessary in the circumstances
there was no realistic alternative
of course in he many years later to debate whether other alternatives could have been adopted
what other courses of action could have been pursued
we say to you taking all the facts into consideration the officers did in due course there was no other
there may be few actual options that lawyers can UNK over
but there was no other realistic option
and why do we say that
why do we say there were reasonable grounds
well members of the jury it is because we've set the course that acting upon in itself would not have been enough
that's and he couldn't and then mount this sort of operation
having seen just one or two pieces of the UNK but the police didn't act on one or two pieces they put the rest of the UNK together and what did they have
well they had the information that you will hear in due course in just a few moments from the caller
the person who phoned up appeared to be perfectly genuine
there was nothing about the man's voice nothing about what he said that cast any doubt on his motives
and he told them that was in the flat that you know about and that there was suspicion that other occupants of the flat were in danger
now what do the police know at the time
when they heard that information they knew that lawrence was indeed on the run from prison that he'd escaped
they also knew that he was a violent man a man prepared not only to handle UNK but to saw off the barrel and to shoot UNK off shotgun at human beings
they knew all that
but they knew a little bit more than to put the together
they also knew that lawrence was a and knew and there's one final piece of information members of the jury that which the police knew
the knew mr himself was no angel
that he had the long record of UNK mainly UNK and some for violence against the police
and they put all those factors together and they weighed up the alternatives and you've heard some of them already
the they weighed that up
the idea was of UNK out the estate and counting on someone at the appropriate moment
they weighed up the prospect of knocking on the door and members of the jury you have to consider in due course whether they got that act right
and you will do so by listening to all the other officers who will give evidence in the case
the this is what the police say
they had to risks didn't they
one risk was that if they didn't act there was a UNK on the loose desperate he's after all escaped from prison possibly in a confined space in a block of flats with a UNK point
that was one risk
they risk leaving him there and him going on to do damage to personal property
a very serious risk
on the other hand there was the risk which in fact UNK which is that in mounting such an operation they would frighten innocent members of the public it was open to the jury we don't swing from the fact that mrs and her children were clearly frightened no doubt about that it must have been a UNK experience
but those are the two risks the police had to weigh up and what they will tell you is that one risk a UNK on the loose is a potential to main and kill one is far more serious than the risk of causing some temporary fear and UNK of little children
and the that mr and other officers never like to mount an armed operation never
if they can avoid it they never would
but it was the only option available to them
and you'll hear two sorts of evidence in this case
you'll hear evidence from those officers that took the decision to get into the flat
that's the first and they'll be the ones that will be able to tell you why they've taken that decision and why we say it's a reasonable decision
then you'll hear from the second of officers namely the officers that went into the flat that were carrying the guns carrying and who conducted the operation and from their evidence you'll be able to judge whether or not the force used was reasonable and was necessary
members of the jury whilst you're listening to these officers ask yourself a number of questions as they're going along
do they all look to you as professional men and women
are they considered in their judgement
are they UNK
do they keep their cool
are they
firm perhaps
UNK do they show any compassion
and weigh those matters up in your mind as you hear one evidence after the other
and ask yourself a question are they really a sort of dirty harry or UNK sort of officers you would be lead to believe
in front of your mind because the UNK intended by the plaintiff's is that these are UNK violent UNK officers stealing into a place with no regard for anyone else
we say nothing could be further from the truth and indeed to get any if you read just one newspaper this morning we will say from that which you will actually see in the witness box
because after you listen to the evidence will be that these are professional officers doing a very difficult job and members of the public members of the jury create very dated job they have the one objective i've told you about to protect members of the public from further harm from what they thought was an armed criminal on the run
finally members of the jury by way of opening tonight ask you to be warned about two things
firstly it is inevitable and natural and quite proper that you should have a sympathy in particular for mrs and her children and
none of us it is a matter of extreme regret that they were terrified in the way they claim they were but that sympathy must not be allowed to cloud your judgement on the issue about whether the police were reasonable
secondly members of the jury please don't do what the press are always doing which is act on the basis of UNK
if the police had a crystal ball and a UNK woman they could bring in and ask her to look and see what was in the flat we wouldn't be here today would we
but they don't have a crystal ball all they have is their judgement and they do what's best in the circumstances
the questions maybe that if they did what was reasonable did they carry it out in a reasonable way
members of the jury that's all i wish to say to you by way of opening the case
and i'll now call a number of the officers to explain their case of their own
thank you
my lord call elaine
take the book in your hand and repeat after the
i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god

yes
i told the witnesses yesterday you may sit down or stand just as you wish
thank you
miss what was your job in december of nineteen eighty eight
i was a civilian controller operator
and where were you working at the time
at
and can you tell the jury as briefly as possible what that job UNK
basically it was receiving telephone calls from the public erm and using that information to put on a computer to send officers to incidents various incidents
erm i missed at the beginning perhaps that's your present job still is it
no that's not my present job i've changed jobs since then
what do you do now
i'm a crime officer at
miss do you remember taking a telephone call from somebody about a mr lawrence
yes
can you remember roughly what time of day that was
it was approximately five fifteen five twenty p m
and was the caller male or female
male
and from the UNK voice were you able to come to the view as to his age
it was five years ago but i believe his was he sounded fairly young i'd say about in his twenties
did he have any obvious accent
not that i can recall
miss what did the man tell you
erm i can't remember the exact conversation but the basics of it were that we were looking for somebody called lawrence and he was at the present time at erm and that he was in possession of a gun and that the caller was concerned for the safety of the occupants of those premises
miss did you ask the caller for his name
i did yes
a and what did he tell you
he wouldn't give me his name because he was concerned that something would happen to him if he gave me his details
miss were you able to come to any view as to whether the call was genuine from what you heard
as far as i was concerned the call did sound genuine yes
er miss what did you do next
i reported it to my section inspector mr
so he
miss or is it simply that er when the male rang up to say about lawrence at has a gun and that he is the caller who is concerned for the safety of the occupiers
did you say anything to the effect that lawrence was being UNK at the flat at or did he merely say he was concerned for the safety of the UNK
from what i can recall he just said he was concerned for the safety of the occupiers
my lord does your lordship have any questions
no thank you very much miss you are free to leave is you wish to
thank you very much

and nothing but the truth
inspector can you give the court your name and address
i'm inspector UNK richard of i'm currently on the road traffic division in UNK
at the time of this incident i was patrol inspector at
again inspector just to help the jury and myself indeed what does being a control inspector mean
i was in charge of a shift of at that time approximately twenty constables er four or five sergeants who do normal patrol work in uniform at
were you involved inspector in the events leading up to the search of
only in that i received the message from mrs of a telephone call
perhaps it's quicker if i ask you just heard about it
yes
can you confirm that what she told you
the information mrs gave to me was as she stated that erm an anonymous phone call had been made to the police station which she had received
the information was that there was a lawrence at that address in luton that he had a hand gun and that they were the caller was concerned for the safety of the occupants of that flat
i you may memory you added he had a hand gun that's what she told you
yes that's
she told us just now merely that he said he had a gun but you remember that it is a hand gun
hand gun yes sir
yes
inspector did you at the time know of lawrence
only by reputation
i was aware that he was an escaped prisoner
i didn't know him personally and i wouldn't recognise him
and on receiving that information inspector what did you do
my task was to assess the validity of the information taken over the phone and the only way i could do that was to contact someone who knew the lawrence situation
i UNK the c i d department at in an effort to trace the officer who was dealing with that case
did you trace that officer
i didn't sir no erm detective sergeant was the officer dealing with this erm lawrence
he was not available
did you speak to anyone else about the situation
on UNK the criminal investigation department at i spoke to sergeant it was he that in fact suggest i called erm sergeant
then in the long run i did in fact to superintendent about the information we had UNK from this telephone call
now about what time did you speak to superintendent
i don't remember exactly sir but certainly between the call at five twenty p m and what say by six o'clock that evening
by the time you spoke to superintendent had you learned anything about the address that had been given to you
it was UNK that address erm was occupied by the family again i don't know the
did you know anything about mr at that time
i didn't sir no
what information were you able to pass on to superintendent
when i found out the identity of the person UNK or UNK the flat at i made enquiries at the police UNK department in that office erm they keep records of any information about persons in the area and beyond
information kept for police eyes only
a as a result of looking at that information the UNK department
did you learn anything
yes i learned that was in fact known to mr
so did you pass this information
well did you did they tell you a little more than that i mean did they tell you that er mr played cricket with him or something like that or what
he's known to him
a known associate sir
aware that had a criminal record himself as the department said
yes they did tell me that your lordship
i mean what we've heard that in fact erm they had met in prison but was that known to you at that time or simply that they were known to each other and that had a record
the actual information you quote my lord wasn't known to me erm it was on the cards certainly and all this information was passed to superintendent
i made copies of the information and these this was given to superintendent
i see well it's perhaps ultimately the important thing but erm
what i was trying to say my lord was that i didn't know was associated or was associated at that time
i i'm until you spoke to the UNK department they told you simply that they knew each other
that's correct my lord
and that had a record
that's correct my lord yes
i see and you arranged for more information to be passed on to superintendent is that it
that's correct my lord yes
right
no sir my job was then to pass over to mr who made the ultimate decision as to what to do about the incident
it clearly wasn't something that the patrol section could do at that time
thank you very much
because we talking about the UNK department are those the one's intelligent
yes sir
did you actually see either er car or card or was it all done over the telephone with somebody else looking at the card
i actually went to the office and er UNK the card sir
and would you say from one of those cards you found out that was er an associate of or the other way round
no sir
i can't be sure where i got the information from but from that time until the end of my shift at ten p m i was UNK information from all different directions about the and the connection
but we have the original cards here as my learned friend will correct me if i'm wrong
neither card in fact although they do give mention of the associates for both men neither card says that associate of the other
so it obviously didn't come from the cards
no sir it i couldn't remember but erm i'm not surprised er between i was able to ascertain that the two were known to each other
well you see it may be important where the information came from you didn't get it from the cards you say you were getting information from all directions
i know it was long time ago but can you now possibly recall where the information came from
i can't to be honest no
i can remember ge obtaining the UNK cards erm and doing other enquiries but as to where that actual information came from i cannot be sure at this time
what erm what sort of other enquiries the asking other police officers and that sort of thing
that would be part of it sir certainly yes
would it have any other major part or is that the major part
sorry i don't understand
would the other these other enquiries you made would the major part of them be asking other police officers or is there any other way of getting information
to myself it's a matter of well my first reaction was to ask the c i d if they knew the situation between o of that was my first response actually to when the phone call came in but i knew very little about
it was then we found out who UNK who was the UNK of that flat then we started to look at the connection between and
and that's the only other question i have
how physically do you find out who's the UNK of a flat
you've got an address if you give that to the UNK departments they can give you a name for the UNK can they
the obvious way is through the voters register erm as to whether as i say i don't know can't remember exactly where we got the details of the UNK from but t in the course of that evening the details of the occupants were found
well yes it may be important and if you can't to say but did you yourself in any event look at the voters register the electoral role
i didn't sir no
so again the information as to who was the UNK was obtained by somebody else and given to you verbally
i believe so sir yes erm i can't be specific at this time
thank you sir
i my examination my lord does your lordship have any questions
no thank you
yes all the witnesses can leave when they've given their evidence if they wish to
my lord i call detective constable
how do you spell the name
my lord you spell it
good
take the book in your hand and repeat after the
i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth
shall be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
would give your full name and address
er michael david er currently stationed at
and er what's your current rank
detective constable
and in nineteen eighty eight where were you based
a at
and were you a detective constable then
yes i was
and what was your job at the time
er i was a field intelligence officer
detective could you just say to the jury what a field intelligence officer is
er my job was to er obtain intelligence on er active known criminals and also to develop intelligence that had been obtained by other officers
now before we come to the matter that the jury in this case could you tell me had you ever been to the estate
yes
prior to this
erm yes
a and h had you ever been there to conduct any UNK operations
er yes on a couple of occasions
tell the jury what it was like conducting a UNK operation on that estate
er very difficult er on each occasion after about an hour er we were approached by people knocking on the windows of our cars asking us what we were doing
and you were in plain clothes were you
yes i was
and in a plain clothes car
yes i was
a plain car
yes
was your intention to be not seen
er yes
so it didn't work
er no obviously
now when mr did your did you have an involvement in the decision to mount the operation at in september of nineteen eighty eight
er not in the decision i spoke to mr and he asked me certain questions
yes well at that time what did you know about lawrence
er i'd known lawrence since it was either nineteen eighty five or nineteen eighty six
erm i knew that er he had escaped from prison
i knew he had previous convictions
er i knew that er he had access to firearms
i knew that er the circumstances of him being in prison involved er a firearm and using that firearm
where he actually shot somebody with a UNK off shotgun
i had been told that er he'd made threats against his wife and er his wife was living with somebody else at that time and he'd made threats against him
er i'd been told er that he'd been in prison with mr er i believe it was in nineteen eighty six and i'd also been told that in the past er and er had planned armed UNK together
did you convey any or all of that information to superintendent
i told him everything i knew
did you obtain any of that information from the UNK card or did you know it yourself
no i knew it i phoned mr er from my home address and er i knew the information
a and just in case it er should become an issue can you now produce the UNK of both UNK cards
yes i can
yes
a and did those cards have photographs of the person they concern
yes they do
and just tell us the names of the two cards you've got there
er it's the cards regarding david and er the other cards involving lawrence
and my lord this stage against those cards
now let me just have a look at them thank you
my lord i can tell you that i do have a copy for the jury if your lordship thinks
well we'll see if there if there well the jury can have a look at them if they want certainly if er if neither side think they're going to be of any assistance then there's not much point in producing them
it doesn't actually say i was just looking it doesn't s seems to go up to september nineteen eighty six but not to say that he had escaped from prison
my lord it may be that the it certainly should say that lawrence escaped i in my photocopy caused the escape and who he escaped with
maybe i ah it opens up and goes further on
simple answer to that
if it's all er arrested for shooting of anthony sent to prison for five years plus six months for UNK a firearm with intent to UNK life
july nineteen eighty eight escape from prison at with one other a mr believed to have been a white UNK lorry near the prison
and obviously for whatever relevance it is he was later on caught because the next entry after that is in march nineteen ninety one he was released on UNK from prison
so he must have been caught in the meantime and sent back
my lord the reason i to make it clear is not er unnecessarily it's just that to enable a police had tried to not show anything well we've got the documents here and we're very happy to receive them
oh i think i think they're here and mr has referred to them the jury can have a look at them in due course
my lord yes
er that i really said it it's got a history on to an ending with the bit i've referred to
and the other one which is er mr and that er has details of various convictions with er picture of his as a rather younger man er various offences going back to nineteen seventy five and UNK quite a long space but there
well i don't think we need to the jury need read them now but they're there and available for you to see in due course yes
good
well i think it's much better once things are served i think it's better the jury know that they're being shown everything of relevance
continuing told us what he knew about lawrence
could you now tell us what it is that you knew about mr
as i said i had been told that er he was associated with and they had been planning ar armed UNK in the past
er i knew that he lived at
i knew he had a wife i didn't know whether he had children er and i knew that er he had previous history of er criminal nature
again did you convey that information about mr go superintendent
yes i did
from your knowledge first of all that lawrence can i ask you to of how you would regard the prospect of trying to arrest him while he was armed
erm from what i knew of erm i knew he'd got access to firearms
i knew he'd used firearms in the past and because he was on the run from prison he obviously didn't want to be UNK
yes mr if you wait there there'll be some more questions
yes you got the cards you can therefore confirm can't you that neither man an associate of the other on the cards
er yes that's correct
it may therefore become of some importance who it was told you that they'd been in prison together and so were at least known to each other
can you remember that
erm before the event i was told by more than one person
well can you remember who they were
no
can you even remember whether this had been volunteered to you weeks or months before or is this something you found out by asking around that day
er it was volunteered to me before that day
mr may i ask you also had been told by somebody that they been planning armed UNK together
i don't suppose you can remember who told you that
no i can't
you can confirm this that there have been any convictions for er two men UNK to commit armed robbery or anything of that sort have there
no previous convictions
mr got erm i understand that no convictions even for armed robbery itself
no
i don't think lawrence got any convictions for armed robbery has he or that there are any subsequently
er no he's got no previous convictions for armed robbery
he's been UNK of committing armed robbery but no convictions
on the er second of december did you speak to er mr the officer who just gave evidence
no i didn't
so it couldn't have been you that told him that er and were associates
no
i spoke to mr
do you know the circumstances in which er lawrence was UNK
er no i just know that he was er UNK in nineteen eighty nine i believe
for instance er could you tell the jury whether there was er any violence or any firearms involved in that UNK
no i cannot recall
i don't think it was in UNK
i think it was somewhere else
but you are in you can't recall
no i did visit lawrence in prison after he was UNK er and spoke to him about various things including this er this incident and he did confirm that he had been at flat er for a couple of days er UNK before the actual search
answers my question but it's of some considerable relevance isn't it
did he tell you that he'd been at flat i mean years before or near the date of this or what
no it was during the conversation he er he said that i hear that you went to flat and i said yes and he said er well you just missed me i'd been there a couple of days before
well your honour there are a number of matters arising out of my lord there are a number of UNK matters arising out of that
yes
firstly it wasn't put secondly is UNK thirdly it wasn't marked as a question
UNK i very much expect although it's not obvious that erm my lord how it's going to be said
perhaps it's a matter that erm needs to be discussed at rather more length than that
well here you are
it's come out it's part of part of what we've heard
my lord rules of evidence apply in this court
it is not admissible as evidence it's been volunteered to the jury erm my lord it needs to be dealt with in more detail than that
alright well to consider it in due course anyway for the moment there it is
i am obliged
my lord nobody any questions
no as long as you've finished mr because i think you erm introduced the topic of erm when he was UNK
my lord yes
my lord let me speak plainly i introduced the topic of when he was UNK i asked nothing about what was
no i agree with that but i wondered if you had stopped because you introduced the topic and then when this UNK and unexpected answer came up you sat down and i thought you might have pursued your original questions
my lord no
i have an application to make to your lordship er in due course when your lordship feels it is appropriate for an application to be made
alright fine
good well thank you mr
my lord call superintendent
my lord on reflection before er this officer gives evidence er unless your lordship rules otherwise i'd like to make that application now and er that would allow the er jury a short period of erm rest until
well i is it simply an application that the jury be directed to take no notice of the answer you've just missed me because it's not admissible evidence
no it's right it is not just an application for that effect
i see alright well or i invite members of the jury the council wants to address me on some point of law which needn't concern you so if you take a short break please
the council says it will be short i don't know what it is yet
mr had better remain while this is going on
remain in court mr
yes mr
my lord this is course made i apologise for the of authority to support it
er in my UNK submission er some of UNK evidence put before a jury are simply too important and too central for a jury to be directed to UNK and then safely er to the which we known that the jury will UNK them
if for instance this was a criminal trial as to which will rule this to UNK exactly the same
in my UNK submission there could be a no question that the jury would be discharged and b in the submission er some er UNK of an experienced police officer UNK what any police officer must know is a UNK and b not an answer to the question
now my lord i'm i make the application with no with no joy at all but the for a day this matter has proceeded on the basis that yes these two men might have known each other but that's as far as it goes
nothing else
well no erm didn't he didn't mr say he had met
oh but my lord yes but what i meant was nothing else was put as a far more serious suggestion
s so then the evidence is that they did know each other begging what know exactly UNK but that's not in dispute
no it isn't but what was not put was that er if the police had got there a couple of days earlier they would have caught because i was half
it wasn't put here unfortunately of course in this case there have been no witness statements exchanged
it's another UNK about this case an UNK i would say all these cases always have an exchange of witness statements
why weren't they exchanged in this case
well as i understand it the er these lawyers for the defendants took the view that as all the statements had been prepared for the police complaints authority investigation public immunity er yes er public interest immunity attached to them
i don i should also say that following a very recent decision er in our submission that's probably right that my lord as i say i say to you with no joy this really is desperate and er one cannot have in our submission in the minds of the jury by UNK evidence the suggestion that yes we have been UNK this man two days before
it
but it's not part of the police case here that they knew at the time that they entered the flat
that er had been in the flat two days before
this was something which has come out that an officer was told by for better for truth or for UNK a year or so later
yes my lord but UNK this situation
the jury comes to a conclusion that er the police er took whatever degree of UNK was UNK that the raid shouldn't have been made on the day it was
when they come to consider the plaintiff's damages it must be highly material that they then may say to themselves however this would family was UNK this dangerous criminal two days beforehand
well i think it's premature any isn't it mr
on the state of the evidence at the moment it may well be that there will be a request for to withdraw the case from the jury on the grounds that no reasonable jury properly directed could UNK find er a anything other than UNK in the police acting upon the information they had and that's for me to decide
well e er my lord
an and to speak quite UNK on the state of the evidence at the moment it seems that is a very possible end to this case in which case in which case the jury won't even get round to having this matter
my lord there will be as your lordship will know my friend and i have been er talking outside about questions
there are other UNK used that do have to go through the jury particularly what happens in relation to mrs and the children as my friend opened it to erm opened it to the er jury
but erm what subsidiary questions
as regards mrs er and the children whether er it's now been admitted that she was arrested and kept in that living room whether that arrest er was UNK or not
as regards res as my friend put it in opening
the police were justified in UNK mr and mrs in the way that they were UNK
those are matters that are going to have
but even if
your lordship may well find it was reasonable for the police to act on this information
but that still leaves for the jury in submission a whether they used reasonable force yes reasonable to act but was it reasonable force to act was it a reasonable method of acting by which i mean time of er time of the incident
well again that may be that erm the evidence will be such that i think that i ought to erm give the decision on it
i don't know yet let's hear all the evidence
well i'm it'll stop that your lordship erm from er from so holding
but i'm not going to discharge a jury in a case where i think it quite possible the jury won't be required to give any to give any UNK
well my lord so be it
the UNK been made i didn't want to waste time before making the application and it had been
very well thank you mr
i must just stretch my legs while the jury are coming back alright
yes mr next witness
lord i call superintendent please
take the book in your hand
i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth
shall be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
yes sir i'm michael charles er police superintendent in the at present stationed at er at the time of this incident i was the operations superintendent at
erm superintendent were you involved in the decision to UNK enter the flat we know about
yes sir i was
and how did your involvement begin
on the evening of sunday the fourth of november er i received a telephone call at my home address from er inspector
he told me that the UNK at the police station had received a telephone call from a man saying that an escaped prisoner a lawrence er was to be found at er the home of a david and that the er lawrence was in possession of a hand gun
superintendent what was your response or your initial reaction to that information
i needed more er information on both of those persons david and lawrence er and i asked inspector er to make enquiries regarding those persons and to come back to me with that information
and er did he get back to you
yes er he eventually er i in fact spoke to a detective inspector er at the police station er he informed me that er detective constable had a good knowledge of these persons and i therefore instructed that er d c make contact with me which he did a short time later that evening
and er perhaps you could briefly confirm what information he gave to you
he told me that he knew both individuals er that lawrence er was an escaped prisoner
er that he had received a prison sentence er for in fact being in possession of a firearm with intent to UNK life
he reminded me of the circumstances of the incident resulting in that conviction which er was in fact that erm had actually er fired a weapon at a person causing injury
did he er tell you anything about
yes sir he told me that er would know because they ha had been together in prison and that he also had information that they had been planning armed UNK together
superintendent did you er ask d c to give his opinion of a non armed intervention
yes er i asked p c if his relationship er with was such that he would have any influence er with regard to erm getting him to er surrender er
his view was that erm if he was armed he had been armed in the past he had discharged a firearm he felt that er he would be in a desperate position erm as he was an escaped prisoner and that he wouldn't have erm any influence over him
did you er superintendent yourself consider whether perhaps there should be some UNK of this flat
yes i did
what view did you arrive at
there are a number of options erm that i considered
i considered erm arm UNK officers actually making an enquiry er at the flat
but erm did not pursue this er because i considered it too dangerous erm and any information you gained would not be UNK
i considered keeping observation actually on the flat but because of its location did not feel that it would be possible for armed officers or for that matter any officer to maintain observation for any period of time without being seen
just UNK there a minute did you have did you i should say have personal experience of that estate
yes sir i did
did you then consider the use of guns firearms
er yes
er in the light of the information at that time and the options i had already considered erm i thought it was likely that we would need armed police officers
and er superintendent what did you do then
it is necessary i had come to that view for me at that time it was necessary for me to contact one of the duty chief officers and on this occasion it was the assistant chief constable mr so i made contact with him
a and what did you tell ask him
well i gave him all the information that had been given to me and we discussed between us various options that were open to us
at the conclusion of which we were both of the view that an armed police operation was necessary and he therefore authorised armed police officers to be used and i was to command the incident
can you remember roughly what time on the fourth that conversation took place
that was at seven fifty p m
you said that you were in operational control
does it follow if it's not an obvious question
you had overall control of the further implementation of this operation
yes sir that's correct
so responsibility was in your hands
from that moment it was my responsibility
please tell the jury on a sort of general point here when you were in charge of an armed raid what are the considerations
well the consideration first of all is the safety to the public
er the next consideration is the safety of the police officers and then we also take into account that in this priority the safety of the er the criminal and an armed operation would not be taken if it was possible to achieve the objective er in some other way
but ultimately it is what is the UNK option that i would have to go for
who was to be in control of the tactics to be used for the operation
operational er UNK of incidents erm have a what is called a firearms tactical advisor er a highly trained officer who is made available to people in the position that i then found myself er in order that they can advise as to the tactics to follow and my tactical advisor on this occasion was er sergeant
is sergeant someone you have worked with before
on a number of occasions yes
h how did you view the prospect of working with sergeant
i regarded him as a professional highly trained officer er confidence in his judgement
following the decision to mount the operation on the evening of the fourth of december er did you have any further involvement indeed as of that evening
yes erm i had i then actually went to the police station to see if any further information was to hand er i spoke again to inspector erm to ask if there was any further information he could give me
he said that his assessment the UNK assessment of the call was that he was genuine
he added at this time that the further information was that the occupants of the flat at we were frightened of i also
he had what did you say
he thought they were frightened or the UNK or what
this the tarmac training centre
we're recording for the national corpus and we're testing at the moment for sound quality
the tape is currently running through to seven four
right something is happening
right
right so this is what we're thinking about this morning
we're thinking about problem solving and ways of solving problems because you are a manager then it's often down to you to solve the problems isn't it
people are going to come to you we've got this problem what are we going to do
now that's fine with normal everyday problems that you're quite used to solving
but sometimes and in the sort of quite UNK conditions that we work in now problems are very complex and very difficult
and it's not easy to find ways to solve them
and the tried and true w tested the tried and tested ways aren't necessarily going to be of any use to you
you want some new fresh ideas
we can get stuck in UNK
so some of the things that we're going to be looking at this morning is ways for you to use that the people working with you can come up with some new ideas but you can also use these ways yourself because sometimes you don't have the luxury of people to help you with your problem
so we we're going to look at those sorts of things this morning
the first thing we're going to think of though are the roles of people that you have in your team and how they might be able to help you in solving the problems
we're going to work through the UNK test
anybody done the UNK test already
yes oh right
well the UNK test is it's quite straightforward when you come to do it
it's one of these things that sound much more complicated than when i explain it to you
you find you have i think it is seven questions and each of the questions gives you various answers
you have ten marks for each question or each statement and you allocate the ten somewhere around there
you might think that e is so important to you that it's ten and that's quite alright you can do that
or you might decide you're going to put two there two there two there and spread out the ten
you can do it however you like
it is up to you
now in this test you cannot be wrong because you're looking at personality so how can you be wrong with your personality
i'm not going to ask you what you are it is for you alone to know so have a look at it work your way through it allocate your ten marks to each of these questions
you should end up with er up to question seven
right
o k yes
right i'm now going to hand out the score sheets for you don't worry about the initials at the top of the columns because they will become clear as we go on
so all you do now you look at the questions that you've answered and let's say for question one you gave erm a two to g the two goes in there one to f you move along there three to h you move along there
so you move along each question first of all and then you total up afterwards
then i will tell you what each of these initials
as you add it up you'll find that some columns are very low they may have nothing in them at all that that's alright
you may get one very high again that's alright
right then i just agree with that's all
right have we all got there then
now what i'm now going to do i'm going to tell you what these initials are so if you on the back of the piece of the paper you make some notes because some of these obviously are going to be what you your personality is but you also need to note if you look at the type of things that you can expect from different people in the teams or the strengths and weaknesses that some people may have in your team
so we start off with the first one that you have this c w that stands for company worker
and the role of the company worker is to turn concepts and plans into practical working procedures
excuse me
turning con concepts and plans into practical working procedures and the UNK that these people have is you know company workers or you are one yourself is that they have self control self discipline they're realistic common sense but there's always a but side to these things isn't there
erm they can lack flexibility
the next one then number two on your list c h is for the chairman and the role of chairman is controlling the way in which a team moves forward towards the group objective
the strengths that these people show are an ability to command respect and to UNK enthusiasm
they're usually good at communicating
UNK sorry
erm in sorry enthusiasm
UNK enthusiasm
yes
and they're good at communicating
but then it's not necessarily very creative
nor does do they need to have good intellectual powers
then we have number three the f h who's a UNK
what shape
UNK
and their role is to set the objectives and priorities for the team and to impose shape or pattern on discussions and activities
will shape and pattern
on discussion and group activities
their strengths are that they will have drive and self confidence and the weaknesses they're UNK towards vague ideas and people
vague and
vague ideas and people
you know these UNK fairy types who've got no you know bothered with those
er number four then the p l is a plant
how do you spell it
that's right you've got it
yes
a plant
and it's the role of the plants is to bring new ideas to the group change the approach to problems and the strengths that a plant has is that they're often independent with high intelligence
that's what's called a relative computer
and a lot of imagination and they're a pain to work with
and the reason that they're a pain to work with is because they can be UNK and not very good at communicating with other people
number five er resource investigator is r i
their role is to explore and report on ideas developments and resources outside the group
explore and report on ideas development and resources outside the group
they create external contact
and the strengths of this sort of person is they're er often outgoing relaxed personality
like what sort of person
outgoing and relaxed personality
they're very UNK
like some management
well i'll be polite and er they their weaknesses the problem is they can be over enthusiastic and not follow on things
number six the m e is the monitor UNK
and their role is to analyse problems and to evaluate ideas
their strengths are that they have a critical thinking ability
what's that
their strengths are that they have a critical thinking ability and they can be objective
their weaknesses they can be UNK and over serious
number seven it's the last one is it seven
oh no there's two to go
oh eight o k right er the t w is the team worker
and the role of the team worker is to support members of the team by building on their suggestions they improve communications and foster team spirit
the strengths of these people are that they are flexible popular and they have good listening skills
but they can lack UNK and they dislike friction and competition
the last one then erm c p is the UNK and their role is to see that the team is protected as far as possible from mistakes and they also maintain a sense of urgency within the team
the strengths that these people show are that they have an ability to combine a sense of concern with a sense of order and purpose
what's that
they have an ability to combine a sense of concern with a sense of order and purpose
they can be UNK and UNK towards people of a casual UNK and habit
now if you go back and see what your scores were and you say no that's not me i'm not a bit like that
but i know somebody who is like it that's the sort of thing you say no i'm not like that but i know people that i work with who are like it
anybody find that it absolutely like they are
you know they're a really good description of their character
oh good
it's very well known this test the UNK test it is very well known
erm it's used a great deal erm as we the sort of people's work as they work in teams
now then what sort of people do you think it's most important then to have in a team because you'll only have a very small team
who would you pick to be in your very small team of say perhaps four people
chairman
bob said he'd have a chairman yes to er pull the whole thing together
it seems to me you need a UNK don't you
you've got to have somebody that's obviously going to save a UNK lock to you
hopefully yes
what is going to be good at solving their problem
doesn't it depend what the UNK objectives are
no
it would do yes but w wo imagine that they're there because the UNK now for solving problems
you need a company worker
somebody to get the work done yes
monitor UNK
yes
and
somebody that i said was very difficult to work with or can be
plant
a plant yes because if you're solving problems you want somebody to come up with some good ideas to get you out of your UNK
this is what you want
so those are the sort of things that those sort of people that you definitely want
and then you know you think well erm this sort of the area we're going i might look for a person you know particular types of person
you look at the others then so who do you particularly want in your team
if you ever get to this wonderful stage of being able to pick your own team it would be marvellous wouldn't it
and of course that's right yes make them do the test first and of course you may very well need some specialists depending again on as we said whatever your team has got to do
that they would fit in as well
well that's the one test the UNK test
there is another test that i want to refer to that we can't actually do because you have to be qualified to do this test and it's very complicated and all the rest of it
just let me explain what it is
has anybody done the k a i test
no nobody's done the k a i test
right i'll just explain quickly what it is then
it was devised by erm a man called michael curtain and it's the er curtain UNK i've forgotten what the i's for now oh well anyway it's probably it's deducted in the basis
and what he says is that you can see people on a UNK
now what i can't explain why is that he starts with thirty two now whether he sort of gets UNK up with the sort of the system of something i don't know but for some reason best known to himself he starts with thirty two and the UNK goes up to a hundred and sixty
he UNK that when you do this test which will show how you approach problem solving you will be somewhere along that UNK
most people are in the hundred the eighty or hundred and twelve
most people fit in around there
it's quite interesting when they get people to do this test erm if they fit into certain categories depending upon their job as well it's almost it is strange that you do get erm say solicitors to do it
most solicitors would fit in a certain category but if you go to another group of people they would fit in engineers they would fit into another category
which is quite interesting the way it actually works out
and what it's saying is your the pattern of behaviour that you're likely to adopt when you come to do problem solving
now down at this end then these are the UNK and at this end these are the UNK
so it depends on what your score is when you actually do the test
now how you'll be when you're seen as being more of an UNK or more of an UNK
it's very good to compare how people see you because if for example your score came out we'll say at a hundred but you work mainly with UNK the UNK who were up here they're going to think that you're an UNK
it very much depends on the people work with
but on the other hand say you're a hundred and you're working more with UNK they're going to really think you're a strong UNK
so you have to bear that in mind as well
so what's the difference between them then
we can give some way to describing these people this is how UNK are generally seen
they're seen as being reliable they'll use a standard approach so that when they come to solve a problem what do we what did we do before
let's tackle it as you've done before you know this was safe this was good we know it works
things like that
they'll improve on it or they might adapt it see if they can change it in some way in that case and they'll act in a UNK way
we don't want to be falling out with people and they don't work well together and it is important to UNK
they're cautious and they're practical
they do all the things the UNK given for UNK
UNK on the other hand they're all right down here are seen as being UNK
they will challenge assumptions so when the UNK go we've always solved the problems like this the UNK will say why
why do you do it like that
well it works
it's
yes but why
you know they sort of really rub people up the wrong way
they will UNK
well let's look at the problem in a different way then
let's turn it on it's head
there must be another way of looking at things
they're often UNK they're not bothered about getting on with people that isn't important to them
challenging go for these problems and find a way of solving it
they don't mean to upset people it's not they go out to be particularly you know horrible
but they're seen as being UNK because that is a part of their code to really get on with people
they'll take risks let's do so and so and have a go at doing it this way and they're often UNK
so you can see when you get these two people together it can be very difficult if you've got them in a team
especially if you get them at the far end of the UNK
but you also need them in your team because if you're trying to solve a problem that is difficult or what's called a messy problem we'll come back to nice messy problems in a minute you need somebody to come up with some good ideas some ways of solving it
and having done that you then need some people in fact so you do need the two types of people and if you are the team leader you have to find some way of getting them to work together
it is that it isn't necessarily an easy thing because these UNK are seen as being UNK and unrealistic and you know they have these UNK fairy ideas
we'll do so and so and they walk away and leave it and the UNK they say they see the UNK as stick in the UNK ooh they all do the same old thing ooh it's boring and that sort of thing you see
so it isn't an easy thing but you do need to attempt to bring the two together for the benefit of team and solving the problem
an easy way of sort of getting round it is to say that UNK do it better and UNK do it differently
this is how they er tend to compromise with it
any idea what you think you might be if you look at that look at some of the questions some of the descriptions
when i said that we would need a plant in our team then would he be seen as being more of an UNK
the plant would be like that
it's very interesting test curtain says he UNK that once you've done the test you know and you find out what you are you are that forever
other people say no this isn't the case because you change then you come and do your work within your circumstances
it depends on what you're working on as well
that's right
you wish you could
yes he sticks this out but other people are sort of beginning to challenge him and say that you know this isn't necessarily the case
it also seems to be that it's different in different cultures
so you know get say people from this country and america doing it and they would come out different say to people from japan because their culture is different and certain different things are expected of them
but it is interesting and i in any case we still need these two types of people it doesn't change that
because what we want to do when you're solving your problem you want to UNK and UNK
it's important that you use both of these types of people in that sort of way
so you throw the problem in you get as many ideas as you can
if you see throw it wide open so it can safely give you lots of ideas and then you can say to people who are UNK right now what can we do with these in five years
how can we adapt them to the problem that will the situation we're in
so that's what you need to be doing when you're with your team
we now want to be thinking about oh let me show you the er i nearly forgot
this is a description then of the UNK and UNK
so the UNK are attempting to get up the career using sort of tried and tested ways of digging and sort of UNK each other up and this sort of thing
the usual way that you might attempt to get up a er tree
where as UNK say that's boring er there's got to be better ways of doing it you see
so they have to do it to be shot through a UNK and off a see saw and various things like this
you know with a balloon there's just got to be a better ways of doing it instead of having to use boring ways
that's just a very you know UNK describes the difference between the two
and it says then it isn't anything to do with intelligence or anything like that
you get people from all sorts of walks of life who can be in these different ways
we're going to imagine now then that you are in a situation where you've got to solve a problem
a problem that's come your way and it isn't the usual problems that you can quickly find an answer to
this is what's known as a messy problem
you don't really know what it is
it's so UNK that you don't even really know what this problem is
you've got to get into it to find out what's going on
and there are four phases to this type of problem solving
and you can use different techniques in each of the phases
and as i said you can use these techniques with your team or you can adapt them to use them on your own because you don't always have somebody to help you
i'm going to give you examples of some of the things that you could if i can find anything to write with yes some methods that you can use because there are lots of methods that you can use in problem solving
it's a very exciting field it really is there's lots of work being done on it it's extremely exciting
i'm just going to give you a couple of things that you can use for each of these phases and when you get used to them you can really spread out and do all sorts of other exciting things
you know UNK the limit with this
so the first one then
let's imagine somebody wonders in to john major one day and he says you know i've a bit of a problem john
er the er we're losing confidence in us
not too happy with what's going on
and he all amazed do think right nothing relevant is happening
we'd better get a group working on it
so this group is going to get together now and think well we're losing confidence in our party but really what actually is happening
that's such a huge thing to say that you can't begin to tackle it
it's a messy problem
so they've got to now begin to home in and find out what things they could start to tackle
so you start off you put your problem in a box down here
problem here
we'll call it that for now no one's actually voting at the moment but it it's covers the same thing you see
it's the same thing
can't let this go on they'll be in trouble if they let it go on
right so that's the problem
what might have caused that
give me something that might have caused that situation to lose confidence
incompetence
o k incompetence
somebody else say something
scandal
scandal
is that how you spell it
it's amazing when you get it up it can't be right
is that it just that
financial
right i'm just going to call it finance
what about unemployment
o k unemployment
what the papers say
we'll put media i can't get it all in
yes anything else there must be something else you can put up there to make it er
foreign policy
foreign policy that'll do
stronger competition
competition
stronger competition
o k
or UNK might be a better way of looking at it
i don't know
right let's see if we can find some things that come up here
somebody else might leave it on their own just there
what else can we say about being incompetent
who is incompetent
all of them the prime minister
i think you could give it that one all to himself then
right er what about UNK
that's about sex
it's back to basics
basics
i think it's about basics
two things
normal basics
UNK in the cupboard
right or
unwanted children
single mothers
only i think we're happy that you can put in UNK
yes
yes get on there what about the unemployment
isn't there unemployment in the south
yes that's to show it's regional it is regional if i just call it regional then
get it probably get it all on the board eventually
lack of apprenticeships
poor education
no engineering future
this is all coming from the heart
schools
that's very popular
town
we can't get much more in there are you
how about finance then
UNK
risk
wage claims
o k what about the er foreign policy
the situation with europe
i'm going to call it e c to get it in
foreign aid
o k i just hope we won't run out of space here
military cuts
n a t o
cuts how about the strong competition
there's no opposition to it
what else
o k
they don't take advantage of the state of the economy
if i said not take for granted in here advantage
what about the media
no control
it seems they might like to get a lot of things
what can will we do now
UNK to traditions and
right now we've a lot there
imagine then that there's this group of people if can you see now it's made like a fish bone and that that's the whole idea a fish bone diagram
as long as it's close that's the thing as long as it's close
now supposing then this committee that john major's set up do something like that and they get that down on paper
get together for discussion and they get that down on paper
obviously they can't do everything all at once
they might think to themselves what is the most important thing for us to home in on first of all
controlling the media yes
once you get that down this then becomes the area that they might think let's do something about that
because it's the media that's got them on the run isn't it
every time they open their mouths they're there and they're doing something about you
it UNK me that they don't use it they don't use the media in some way
but when you first say you've got this problem they're losing votes the media isn't necessarily the first thing that's going to come to your mind
you might
but it's only by sort of putting it out like this and thinking yes the media wants to talk about this talk about that talk about the other you know they are in this case the most the likely thing to be adding to the problem
and they are something that they could probably do something about
try and get them on their side or work on them or something
we don't actually want them UNK do we but er it might come to that in the end might we
so that's one way of trying to when you get your messy problem and you think i don't i don't know what it is i don't know what's going on i can't really get into it
do something like that
draw it up and here we just took suggestions from everybody but what you can do if you're on your own write it down on a piece of paper and ev when every time something occurs to you put it down
over a period of days
we're not saying you've got to do this in five minutes
there isn't any time limit
you might say by the end of the week i'm hoping to get that completed and i'll then i'll see what i've got
so that's how you go using the fish bone diagram
or you can build up a tree
anybody want to suggest a problem
you know something that really is big that's major to go at
having solved the problems of the conservative party i mean we could get very good at this aren't we
traffic in the city
o k traffic in the city
we're saying that is our problem then
now we're going to start to look at up here
if you look at the causes
what are the causes of this problem of traffic in the cities
poor roads
no public transport
i'll just put public transport because it's er you you'll realise it means that won't you
concentration of business people
gosh that's a lot to say isn't it
erm
business density
oh good o k any other causes you'd like me to think about
till you pass
hours of business
sporting events
hours actually would come off there
you can start now to get your because this is your tree this is your tree here's your branches and then you start to get your UNK coming off the way do so and that also you see that can link up with like that can't it
erm did you say er sport
sporting events
sporting events
so that'll still come off here wouldn't it
o k anything else that we might want to say around those things that go off
airport locations
any UNK coming off there
the way people see it erm that just one person in a private car seen
UNK are a nuisance parking of
that was would you put that on it's own or would you put that with something else now
it goes with the transport section
it probably goes in the
lack of investment
and that will go with that but also go with roads wouldn't it
o k roadworks
political working deregulation
where would you put that
under control
put that one in here a UNK in here
three days of spring
right
how UNK
right well let's say we can go on and go on obviously with this
now we want the consequences down the bottom of our tree then
oh what would be the consequences do you think of this prediction
UNK residents from pollution
is that going to coming from pollution really isn't it
i'll just put poor health
cost noise
that's another thing to do with pollution really isn't it
stress
out of pollution
no
no
accidents
economic er
economic resources
erm that had better come over here really hadn't it
erm
let's call it just economic you get to the point of going on before you
right anything you want to take off some of these things then
children risk to the children
and old people and people
damage to property perhaps
with accidents or pollution
both
both
both probably yes
there's crime in traffic in cities now
they've got this new thing
UNK of one in a car you know
UNK car UNK of people yes
i can't think of it as fashion
i believe it's more hard to get
that really is er a separate thing isn't it the er the crime you see the sort of things that we're doing
you build this up now and then you get to the point where you're going to say to yourself well do we have to do anything about it
is it really something that is important
somebody's coming here to look what is the problem here
and when you do this you can say to yourself you can see is it really something that's important
now the consequences of leaving it are what makes you decide whether it's something that's important and therefore you've got to do something about it
and if somebody came to you with those sorts of things you'd think to yourself it can't just go on and gradually just build up and build up
so then again you start to look at the causes and the big sorts of things
you want to start out and try and work in with your tree
home in on a cause that you can do something about
you can't tackle that problem just as it is
again it is a messy problem
it's all sorts of things contributing to it
so you highlight all these things and then you might say right in this town in this city we're going to concentrate on and you pick one thing
it might be
build a bypass
yes a bypass yes
there's money to make but it this is such a difficult problem you can't just anything about it so let's get the cars out
yes that may be what you decide to actually do
you may say let's improve the public transport and let's have er park and ride
and then and that may solve all sorts of problems for you if you were going to do that sort of seven days a week let's say from seven in the morning until i don't know nine at UNK at night or something
that might solve a lot of problems
you've got you'd have to decide but by looking at that you could then start to tick off the things that would help to solve
so that's another way for you to decide which bit of the problem you're going to actually start on
before you really get down to doing anything you've got to look at the problem and really sort of try and analyse what is going on and what bit of the problem are you going to work on
once you've done that you've said right you'd like to go on the problem we're going to solve is not john major's something to do with me here
that's our problem that that's what we're really going to home on first of all
me here
here you might say what we're really going to solve look at now is public transport
so you have your group sitting round and you say this is our problem now that we're going to actually home in on
so now you're on to phase two
of really generating solutions now to solve that part of the problem
and what you want you want people to come up with as wild as ideas as possible
you don't want safe tried ideas
you want somebody to come up with some UNK ways of thinking
UNK
and when they come up with something which you think oh stupid idea
the UNK thing to say you don't actually say this to them you think oh hello perhaps we can adapt that perhaps it's going to lead into something else
remember i said you've got to have these sort of safe situations with the people that work for you
open communication and they can say something like well why not kill off half the population and you think well how stupid a thing
i don't know perhaps really like to UNK people you know that might be something which came as one of things they did wasn't it in the fifties and sixties
they actually UNK people out of cities they didn't really kill them off just put them somewhere nobody else wants to be
things like that
so these are the sorts of things that you want to be looking for
so some of the best ways of doing this is UNK
everybody used to UNK
it's really easy very easy
what you do you have your group together and you have a UNK somebody that presents the problem and you also have somebody that's going to be the UNK
all their job is just writing
you either want er a white board like this or several flip charts and you sit round and you tell them that they can say anything they like no holds UNK and nobody's going to criticise anything they say
the problem is presented to them and then they think about it for a minute and then they say anything that comes into their head
and i mean anything
and the UNK just writes it up as fast as he can
as long as he can write fast and UNK and they write it up as fast as he they can
and the idea is that it's quantity that UNK quality
because the more ideas you get the better your problem solving is likely to be
if you only get a few ideas you've only got a few things to look at
whereas the more ideas you get the more things you have to look at the more chances you've got of getting something that's really good and unusual
but you don't at any stage say what did you say that for you know something like that you just don't do that sort of thing
you allow people to say what they like write it down you have to set a time limit because people get tired it is a very sort of it takes a lot of energy to do this and concentrate on it
so you set your time limit right we'll have say twenty minutes half an hour at the most then you stop and look at it and say anybody want to add anything else
when you've finished you just tear off all your flip charts and put them up round the room or something so people can
right then we're on to stress
the thing that nobody was worried about
remember your objectives nobody was concerned about stress were they
let's see then
first of all i want you to write down the first words that come into your mind the first say half a dozen words that come into your mind when you think about stress
this is stressful
oh we haven't started yet
let me say now that most of things that we do in this part of the course i don't ask you to tell me what you've written down stress is a very personal thing your reaction to it so don't worry you write down anything that you want to write down because it is for you
right now have a look at what you've written and ask yourself the question is it negative
almost everybody will have written down negative aspects of stress because that's what we think about whenever anybody mentions stress it's always bad
it's bound to be bad
we want first of a think first of all that stress in necessarily all bad
the definition that i work to is this one
a stressful circumstance is one with which you cannot cope with successfully or believe you cannot cope with successfully that's the important thing
how much results in unwanted physical mental or emotional reaction
it's the belief bit that's important
what's stress to one person isn't stress necessarily to another
we want to look at stress now and realise that it is not all negative in fact some people actually go out and seek a fair amount of stress
and you'll see why in a few moments
have a handout and we'll look at the different types of stress
i've got two sets two different sets it doesn't say
problems
it's a bit stressful this isn't it
oh it is very stressful yes
yes you hang on to those and these will come round later on
these will worry you later
how
yes you've picked up two lots sorry
o k let's look at the three faces of stress
these may be very likely some of the words that you've already written down
the negative side of stress is also called cause dis stress
things like worry pressure fear pain UNK illness all these sorts of things
it's all the negative aspects of it
and then we get what's known as neutral stress these are conditions really that can cause stress but it's stress that could go either way
change for example can be very stressful when you work through it in your private life or in your family life
a lot of people don't like change and yet we don't want to stay as we are
crisis again can be very worrying as you go through it
money well they tell me that people who have a lot of money are as stressed as those that don't have it
i've yet to be convinced of this i'm still waiting to find out
but is one of these things obviously you know money does cause lots of worries and problems
communication again that can go either way
and people a lot of your stress will be caused by people because they're UNK to control like that
and then we get the other sort of stress the positive stress that's also called use stress
a challenge we like a challenge we enjoy a challenge we want this
children i'm i wonder why children are in that column because i think that they can cause you know all sorts of other problems
promotion we go out to cause promotion but when you first get it can be very stressed as you come to terms with your new situation
and marriage again it's something that we want
we look forward to it but it can also have its other problems as well doesn't it
and success we want success UNK for success we go for success but you can be very stressed by directly doing it
as i said people go out looking for stress
they want it
how many times have you heard people say i'm really at my best when i'm challenged
you know when the chips are down when the deadline gets near that's when i work at my best
and this is it is true for some p it's true for a lot of people that they really want to be challenged
this is what happens
when people are not challenged they're here
because tho their performance is low they're not challenged and the you know life is difficult isn't it
these are the people who're bored
they suffer from UNK they hear of housewives being stressed and they say look at the stress of UNK
it's because they're bored
there's no challenge to what they're doing
they get frustrated
life you know it's miserable for them
what we want is to be working here
a high performance and a the amount of stress that is right for us
and then we are at our most creative
we're good at problem solving we're really UNK excuse me we're really challenged when we have the right amount of stress for us
we feel satisfied with life because we feel we're getting somewhere
but what happens in most many jobs many situations
it's UNK on isn't it
and then you come right down here the stress becomes too great
we're over UNK
and this is where the illnesses come from and it's because we can't cope our self esteem goes
we ought to be able to cope we feel bad about things and so we come right down here withdraw and can't cope
precisely
you might say to yourself well how serious is this problem is it just another er american thing
you know they've done all these tests over there for all these americans that can't cope is that what it is really and somebody's imported it into this country
is that really what we're talking about
no we're we can cope here can't we
we're alright
no problems here
well let's have a look at a few figures then as to why we do need to consider it
they estimated that stress costs a thousand pounds per employee per year to businesses
it's costing them a thousand pounds per employee per year
you might think so what that's alright they put the pressure on they've got to pay the price
so let's bring it down to a really personal level then
the average employee loses one and half years of their working life due to stress and very of very seldom is it in one lump because people have very severe UNK don't they
very severe illnesses
most of your working life one and half years of the average UNK working life is lost is stress related
how do they measure it
sorry
how do they measure it
looking at the di the time you have off work
and why you have time of work
a lot of people are not honest to be non productive at work as opposed to actually off work
stress related illnesses
people aren't always off work
no but you see you've got to look at the type of we look at the type of illnesses that people suffer from in a minute and sort of you know a day here a week there somebody has a month somewhere else
and of course some people do have a large block of time don't they because you know they have very severe illnesses and it builds up
but that's it that's what that's what the average is
so it is something that we need to look at and study
and what we're going to be looking at is what causes stress
not at what it is what causes it
how your personality is going to affect your reaction to stress
it's a very personal thing
we look at some ways of coping with it and also recognising it in other people because if you've got people working for you and they're stressed and they have time off work you've got to carry things on haven't you
you've got to keep things going you've got to cope
so you need to know if they're stressed and what you can do about it
there are certain things you can do about it
so what's happening then when you're stressed
we've looked at the different types of stress what is happening to you when you're stressed
any type of stress what is actually happening
say that i don't i've got it wrong
now our bodies haven't changed since UNK died
we evolved that far and we haven't changed that much since
so let's think what happened to the UNK then
life was very difficult for him or her and they'd be out
a lot of their time was spent looking for food wasn't it
i think that was how they had to be and they'd be out in this very dangerous environment looking for food and suddenly they'd be aware that they'd the were coming
it's more dangerous because a UNK was near
what can you do
run
most likely he's going to run isn't he to get away
if he's really UNK he might think well i've got to fight i've got no way round it
but he's either got to run or fight
and certain things are going to happen in his body to help him to cope with that situation
these are things that will happen
the sense organs either his sight or his hearing tell him that he's in danger
there's something there that he's got to deal with
immediately his heart rate increased
his blood vessels UNK or contracted in different parts of his body
sweating increases to cool him down
UNK up the pupils UNK and many UNK are UNK into his UNK
because he's got to cope with this situation
he's going to need a terrific amount of energy and he's going to need it quickly because he's got to deal with this very dangerous situation that he finds himself in
unfortunately we don't meet many UNK but
speak for yourself
imagine then you're out you're in wolverhampton and you're about to cross the street and round the corner comes a big lorry
what happens
your sense organs have told you there's a big lorry
you've got to deal with it you can't fight it
you've got to get across that road quickly
all those things happen to you all those UNK particularly UNK have got into your UNK because you need this sudden burst of energy to get you across the road
and that's right and that's good and that's what you want
that's what you're aiming for and you cope with the situation
what about the ones where the situation is say about the people freezing and they do nothing
well isn't that much sort of er lorry
we'll come back on to that later on because it if this is what happens with you because what's happening there is you're not using the UNK and we will we're moving on to that where you don't use up the UNK
yes that's what happens
but you see that's still going to happen isn't it
somebody goes i you know i can't cope with the situation you might be i've got to stay here i've got to stay here
but then you've not used it up and so there's certain things that are now going to happen
and they can be which is what we're going to move on to
because when you do run across the road you get to the other side and you're thinking good gracious that was a close UNK i'll have to sit down for a minute i think i'll have a cup of coffee or something
that was really close that one was
o k then that's right you go and sit down get yourself together again and get back to being able to cope with life
now supposing it isn't you that crossing the road but you're out with a young child
you're on one side of the road and the child's on the other
and the child runs across the road in front of the lorry
what do you do when he gets there to you
you shout at him
you shout don't you
you sh probably shake him
you just can't believe it you know you're sort of like this aren't you
because all that happened to you but you couldn't use up your energy you couldn't help that child across the road and suddenly you've got to get rid of all that and you take it out on the child
how dare you do thing like that you know you're sort of you just can't you're almost beside yourself as you're trying to use up all that UNK all that energy that's poured into your body as you try to help that child across the road knowing in actual fact you can't
and again although it's not very pleasant for the child because he's had this terrible UNK crossing the road then he's got this adult sort of you know UNK over them and going mad as well
it helps you to use up this UNK and that's what you want
think of people that go to these dangerous sports clubs what happens to them
they expect you to leap off you know on bits of UNK
they're suffering from this because they want to they enjoy it
they get this great high
it's said to last for days even this great high that they get when they jump off and leap off these bridges or something on a bit of UNK
i've never tried it and i've no intention of trying it
but it think of things like that because they they've got to the stage where they can actually enjoy that
but in our everyday life it isn't like that is it
if we look at this chart here this is you coming along here you're just walking along quite happily and you go to cross the road
this is when the lorry comes round the corner and immediately you've got to respond
you get all this energy cross the road and then you go and have your cup of coffee and go and sit down and gather yourself back together again
build up your reserves and you're back on the ne level there
if i give you another example of that
some years ago er my husband was on his way to work and he was involved in a car crash
it just so happened that he you know he was alright and the car was a right off
and somebody was following a colleague was following saw it happen stopped and helped him sort of do what you've got to do to get the man's address and this sort of thing make sure the car was alright and took him into the office
that was first thing in the morning at two o'clock he had to be brought home
there was nothing wrong with him but he couldn't keep his eyes open
he was just falling asleep on his feet
because of course he'd used up all his UNK everything in dealing with this he was completely UNK
came home went to bed slept right through to the next morning and then you wouldn't know that anything had happened to him
so that's quite normal quite happy if you're body's coping well with that that's what you'd expect
that's good you're using up all the UNK it's not remaining in your UNK
fine
but you see life isn't like that not everyday life
o k this is one of those days
and you set out in the morning and you know this road you know this road well
you travelled along it yesterday there was nothing wrong with this road yesterday
but on one of these days and you hit the road there's been an accident somebody's dug the road up there's something wrong and you're in a traffic jam
it's a day when you want to get in early
so there you are you're stuck now in this traffic jam and you know you're going to be late
they're waiting for you when you get to work and you can't get on with whatever you want to do you have UNK after UNK
i'm never going to get this work done i'm never going to get my act together today you know as people say it's one of those days
and then you think right i'm really going to get settled down to something
i'll have this cup of coffee and i'm going to get on with it and what happens
on these days you're sort of you're coordination goes as well doesn't it and you knock the coffee flying always over the company report
it never goes over something that's UNK does it
so you just get worse and worse and worse on these days
and then in the afternoon there'll be some problem with the staff
they all come to you will you sort out this will you sort out that and the other and you think for goodness sake can't i get something done here
you know so all the time you're up here like this and then perhaps you stay to try and get some work finished before you go home and as sure as fate that's the day when you promised to take somebody out when you go home and you've forgotten about it
so you get in and you walk in to a row
know the situation
it's a bad day
when you get home you say i'm just sick of this day i'm going to bed
but do you sleep
you're not in the mood to sleep are you
either that or you run yourself around UNK and you go to sleep and then we get to one o'clock two o'clock in the morning and you wake up and then what do you do
you start to think well of course had i done so and so yesterday had i done and i've missed on so and so you sort of review the day for a couple of hours and then it gets to about four o'clock and now you're thinking oh my god i'm at the accountants the next day i'll be so tired i'll be you know and it's too late to do anything about it now so now you're having a bad day the next day as well because you've got yourself all UNK up about that
so this is what's happening and we said the people that don't use up the UNK the ones who decide to freeze and sort of try and cope with it this is what's happening
all the UNK is now remaining in your system with all these other UNK and this is what's causing the illnesses and the problems
what do you do about it
well first of all what can you do about being stuck in a traffic jam
not a lot
nothing absolutely nothing so instead of thinking oh what am i going to do about this and can i get round here if i turn round here can i get round these bends or something no i can't it'll all be sort of no
nothing
what a wonderful gift
somebody's given you ten minutes
how nice of them
somebody up above as said i'll give that person ten minutes sitting in his car
take them turn the radio on because there's nothing you can do
o k accept it because the only person that's suffering is you
they will cope they will cope these people nothing absolutely nothing so instead sit here and accept it because i'm going to survive these days
m mr UNK for the chief constable to go isn't
now of course it'll come as no surprise to you to use up all your UNK
i suppose so
what's the problem here
right these two men decided in the end there was a correlation between this and they were able to put people into two categories
if you've got fifteen and above you're t
i've seen i've got one there all UNK
er these are the a's
i'm sorry to say these are the a's i don't think there are any fifteen UNK here
what's an a one for
just you're just known as an a one i'll explain what it means in a minute
a nervous UNK
if you will yes this is it yes erm between ten and up to fifteen you're an a two and five to ten you're a b one and below five is a b two and i shouldn't think there's a single b two in the room
i have not had a b two here yet
if you are a b i should ask somebody to do this test for you because usually the people on these courses are a's quite a lot of them are a one
and i can't decide whether it's you're a types and you go into construction or you're in construction and it makes you into a types
but i'm sure there's got to be something there because it's amazing most people are a types and quite a lot are a one
now then these people are the people the a types of people who are going to suffer these stress related illness
this is why we're actually thinking about it
these are the types of illnesses that you're likely to suffer from
we'll start off on a real low now won't we
yes
i need you to read the illnesses that you are going to be UNK to
gosh you're going to be some
i'm going home straight away
i won't say when to do it will i
you've got the bottom one
it's a crap report
what's UNK
high blood pressure
UNK when you are you know somebody that gets very sort of UNK out by things and you then you sort of you
the slightest thing sends you off you know
very sort of that's it yes
you know if somebody says something to you UNK you blow up and you know
somebody looks at you in the wrong way some morning you know what's the matter with you that type of thing you know
some people are like that all the time
right so is there a necessity to do something about it if you're an a type
let me give you some other examples in case you feel there is some doubt because of course it's one test
it's not the only thing you need to do there are some other things that i can say to you now that you might recognise
let me give you some examples of a type behaviour which you might recognise in yourself or in other people that work with you
a type people are usually UNK hard driving and busy bit of a UNK always doing something a types
they're ambitious and they UNK for upward social mobility
it's important to them because it proves where they are in life they don't want to stay like where their parents were they want to prove
they're very aware of time they have an enhanced sense of time urgency these are the people that never have enough hours in the day
oh gosh i wish there was forty eight hours in every day and there were ten days in every week and it's still no good with forty eight hours they'd still find enough to do they'd still be racing around all the time
they're very competitive
you're often seen as being aggressive and UNK but you believe that your pattern of behaviour is responsible for the success that you've had
this is the way to do it
now how did you get to be like it
well of course in our society we like people to be like this don't we
this is what we want
victims of our
we have but really well they're alright you know in their little hut with their tray or something like that
yes maybe
still got to have them we've still got to have them
we have got to have them but really the people we want to push the country on you know because people have got to get us somewhere these are the a types aren't they
these are what we want to do you know work hard and they do this sort of thing
see this is what we know we want them but the ones that we really sort of look up to and reward are the ones that show these other types of behaviour
do you need more a's than b's
you need a balance
you probably need a lot more b's doing most of work and the a's are UNK around
well we come round to what happens in a moment to as and bs
what happens is of course you're so very often UNK into behaving like this ask yourself if your an a type are your parents a types
and what happens if you're an a type when you have children
send these children off to school they go to school this is your opportunity in life and you work hard
you're what we want you work hard at school and the child comes back and they say had a test today how did you get on
i got eighteen out of twenty
what did the others get
was it an easy test
and how is that this child got eighteen
you know because this were they UNK in some way why didn't they get twenty
what's the matter here
you see and you keep and they work hard
it's what i expect for you to be able to work really hard get your homework done work hard in your exams i expect you to go to college
you know i want you to have the chances that i didn't have
all these things pushing this child on
and in the end the child's UNK i'm loved because i work hard and this is what i have to do
if you work hard you gain people's love and respect
rise to the top
you do yes of course well yes
all these sort of things to make them work as in you set out a pattern of behaviour
and that's what matters to make them work like they are
and if you've got a type parents you copy them you do what they've done they've worked hard that is what to respect is
and this is how you've got to where you are
you're prepared to work longer hours to get the work done
you say to an a type sorry i say you've got to work most of the night to get this done they'll UNK but they'll do it b types turn round and say no way
the a types will do it
the they sort of have less sleep
if you want something done in a club a voluntary club and things like that go to your a types
they'll find the time
the people that do the most will always find time to do more the b types well can't you fit that in you know
but the a types somehow yes i'll do it
unfortunately it's said you communicate less with your wives i don't know if it's exactly true but if somebody says to you never talk to me you don't tell me anything that's your a type behaviour
you go b you can go back and say now well it is my a type behaviour that's causing this you see and see if that gets you anywhere
that's because you're always working and you don't have a chance
that's right yes because you see that's the other thing that i've got on here
stressed when you get up
work is more important than UNK to a types so if you've got to make a choice between the two it's the work
that's what you choose to do if there's a choice sorry you know i can't have this weekend away i've actually got to do this job that i said you know a load of work or something
i don't know we can't go to the cinema tonight because i've got to do this work i've brought home
that's not a b type
that's it because you're an a type
whereas the b type
i know which is more important
see this is it straight down the line yes this is it i won't ask you how many you've got but i did see notice the UNK yes this is it
and you a types cannot see it in any other way
you're almost better to be in a job first get a few offers
yes that's it yes
that's exactly how a types see it
yes i have to tell you you're a temporary one
is there any chance of being an a type excuse me between eight and six and a b type thereafter
no except because your personality it's your personality
i'm not so sure i'm not so sure
well let's look at the b types
the b types have the ability to take a longer view of things
they'll stand back oh you know the laid back type oh does it really matter
oh you know
hey go an get you know get life and death
this is the b type
they're too like that you see
they don't expect things to be done perfectly
a types are often UNK
there's only one way to do a job and that's the way i do it and that's perfect
if i ask somebody to do something that's why the way i want it done
no oth no other way to do it
you see whereas b types would say no i can see that what you've done is acceptable and that's alright
and a types can't take this and find it very difficult
you need to ask yourself if you are an a type and a UNK what is the acceptable standard
are you working to UNK within your job
are these jobs that you are doing for your client absolutely perfect
no they can't afford it can they
it can't be done it can't be done
no so what you do you agree an acceptable standard
and this is what you've got to do with most things that you do
now i accept that if you're adding up a column of figures you can't say well it's within a few thousand well that'll do
that's near enough
there are some things that do have to be done to a certain standard
but most things do not have to be done to UNK
and b types can take that on board and they
a types often find that quite difficult
b types aren't concerned about time
time doesn't worry them in nearly the same way
you get these sort of these UNK you know saying beautiful picture how long did it take you to paint that
oh a hundred hours a hundred and fifty hours
you see i couldn't spend a hundred hours on a painting and only ask that amount of money
you know you say how much am i worth an hour yes
a pound an hour good gracious i couldn't be working like that
you see because they just look at it in a completely different way
i mean it's very much again the way they've been brought up because they don't feel that they've got to earn respect and love
their parents are the ones who send them off to school and say just do your best
we don't ask any more of you just do your best
and they come back and they say i had a test today i got five out of twenty
but you did your best didn't you son
you tried that's alright that's what we want
we can't ask any more than that of you
yes that's how the child grows up because they did their best
you put the two together of course and it's going to be very difficult for a's and b's together
they will drive each other mad
because they just see things in a completely different way
but we do need some b types
what we do know is of course that if the a types continue as they are they will be ill
there are certain things that they need to do to learn to modify their behaviour
and you can modify your behaviour because you've got to try
you know nobody was really concerned about stress before i started
didn't figure didn't figure did it
no one
no i noticed this programme ages ago
i'll give you that i'll give you that you know when you go home you should have known that
i wonder why i wonder why you get that when you go home there must be certain signs
right some things that you can do then if you're an a type
find some t time in each day when you are idle don't structure every single part of the twenty four hours some time when you're going to sort of be do nothing
we talk later on sort of thing when i say do nothing you're going to do something in that bit but as far as you're concerned it's idle time
it's quite a good thing as well for a type people is to read books
because you say no i watch television to relax
i very much doubt it
you watch television you can watch television with a you know quarter of your mind can't you
you wa if you think of those UNK i bet i'm convinced you could miss six weeks of the UNK and still not lose a minute of the plot
probably yes but what's really happening is you're watching television and half your mind is taking it in and the other half of your UNK thinking when i get back to work tomorrow i'm going to do so and so and so and so because yes i'll do and you're really UNK over the problems of today
so you're not really concentrating on the television because you don't have to
i mean do you really care when you look at these game shows and things like that whether this person wins a car or a holiday you know in wherever
do you care
of course you don't care
i mean you know you just it's there isn't it UNK wallpaper
you're just watching it you see because it's on
you're not it's not really relaxing you
but if you read a book you've got to concentrate otherwise you're not going to follow the plot
you won't follow what's going on
this is why they say read
do whatever you like i'm not saying go out and buy war and peace because you know if you don't if you're not into the habit of reading you pick up war and peace and by the time you get through the first page you say who are all these people
UNK them you know they've got thousands of people all with different names so don't buy something that you know you don't really want to read
it doesn't matter read mills and UNK if you want to i mean who cares
barbara UNK you know who really cares so long as you're sort of thinking right i've got to concentrate on this because you know have this different way of going about things
right try and see your life as work and non work
not just UNK in together
this is work this is non work time
some of your stress may be caused by problems at home particularly if say you've got teenagers
i can't think of anything worse
so if you've got teenagers sometimes you've kindly got to say to them look just go away i want to be quiet sitting reading my book or whatever
and ha you know ban them from the room that you're sitting in
give yourself you know somewhere where you can sit quietly and also give children the same opportunity even quite small children need to be on their own sometimes
some time in the day they need to be sitting quietly on their own
it's not the same situation obviously so you have somewhere where you can be quiet on your own reading a book or whatever you're going to do not idle but
know what your stress points are
your body will tell you when it's had enough
one of the best ways of knowing think if you have taken work home sometimes and you get to about ten half past ten and suddenly you think god i've got a headache or my neck hurts my shoulders UNK those sorts of things
this is your body saying er i've had enough i've had enough i want i want to change
don't work through them
yo that's wrong
you say o k this is it put it all away because i've got to cope i've got to survive in this life so know what your stress points are and act on them
don't structure all your leisure types your leisure time
you know the a types they go on holiday monday went and looked at so and so tuesday we did so and so wednesday we did thursday was really boring
do you know we sat on that beach all day thursday it was really boring there was nothing to do on thursday
but you need some of this time when there's nothing to do and you don't know what might happen
i mean today the house don't structure every bit of your leisure time
allow things to happen
i find that more stressful
this how you over everything well there's something in the background that you might do
what's
er erm another thing you might do you might take up a hobby that you've got to think about
something that's going to take your attention because while you're thinking about your hobby you can't be thinking about work
whatever it might be that interests you but something that you've got to be thinking about in your share time
er it can be a sport it can be some sort of activity it could be going to evening classes learning something
whatever it might be for you but something that you're going to have to be thinking about and while you're thinking about that you cannot be thinking about work
this is the idea this is it's going to help you break up things into work and non work
there's also a lot of stress in hobbies sport because you're sort of challenged you want to win something or even your hobby you want to get something right
that isn't necessarily a bad thing
what we're saying here is you breaking the two away
it's different
it's different yes you you're breaking work and non work because otherwise you break up it becomes twenty four hours work
you see you might say well my hobby is gardening
you know i maintain if you're gardening you're thinking about work or you're not thinking about UNK or whatever you should be doing in gardening
you can still be thinking about work
yes and then you and then you cut off your favourite plant in the garden
probably yes but you see but if
for example er if for example you were doing something i don't know say you s said erm i'm definitely going to go and learn another language i'm going to go and learn german let's say
so you go off to this evening class while you're doing that you can't be thinking about the problems at work because you've got to concentrate otherwise you're not going to get it done
or you might go to a sports club and meet some colleagues or some friends there and while you're training together you're talking about other things you see and again you can't be you're not thinking about work
this is the whole idea
yes there is a certain amount of stress in competition but it's er in a different way
yo you're challenging all your efforts into a different way
er do one thing at a time these a types who UNK all these different jobs still can't get them all done
yes i'm very clever at doing all this
one thing at a time
and seek to manage your time before other people do
you be in charge as much as possible of your time and whatever it is you're going to do
now you might think well what about all these people at the top then
all these a types that must be you know top of industry in our society
well another survey was done to look at these people at the top and see how they're coping and a big surprise
they're not a types and they don't know why
and they've come up with several suggestions
either the a types are too busy doing other things the wrong things and they don't rise to the top you know you can't see the wood for the trees
that type of thing or they were a types and they learned to modify their behaviour and survived or the a types are dead before they get to the top
that's the way
giving the b's the stuff to get there
i'll leave you to choose which one you fancy
in the higher the higher up you go you delegate it
yes but you it's in a different frame of mind isn't it
and whereas you can see if you might have a type behaviour sort of lower down you think if you really want to rise you're going to have to cope
so you modify your behaviour delegate see take a longer term view of things
a fair bit of a fair bit of UNK comes in things like that
so you you've got to think about those because if you want to survive and you also want to go on
what was the second choice
b the m they learn to modify their behaviour
er we need to also think about erm er b types because b types may not be being assertive and i shall talk about assertive behaviour in a few moments
they may sort of be very UNK b types and therefore they can be stressed in a different way
so i'll talk about that in a moment
right so what causes you to be UNK stressed
who or what causes you to be stressed
eighty to ninety percent of stress is self imposed
is it stress or frustration
no it's stress because it's your it's the way you perceive things
because you can tell you can have two people in a situation one UNK really well UNK through it but the other gets really stressed and goes down hill and can't cope
it's to do with their personality their perception of the event their UNK their UNK all sorts of things like that
but it is you have to accept you can't blame the boss the circumstances you're in and things like that it is the way you react to it
this is what's causing stress
i thought companies were ensuring that you wouldn't take that on that stress
it appears that more or less the company would do it
i would think it would yes i would think it would be people more and more people are coming round today with the idea that people need to go away send somebody to get something
erm b p for example have gone in for what they call erm a culture change
it's taken them two years
it's very it's very difficult to change cultures in organisations extremely difficult
they decided to take it on board and as part of their culture change they will not have people working beyond a certain time at night
and the manager goes round and switches out the lights if there's anybody there they kick them out
because the maintain that you need to le a certain amount of time away from work to be able to cope with the situation that you're in and you're not going to be at your best at the time when they want you there
so i w i haven't heard what they've said about holidays but i would say they ought to say to people if you know if your allocated six weeks holiday you take that six weeks holiday
because you'll say to people did you take all your holiday last year
and they'll say well no i didn't manage to last week in or something
they've decided that you need that number of weeks holiday then that's what you should be taking
and i think you'll soon find that more companies are coming round to thinking about this now as it is becoming more difficult and more challenging if you like in working in the company
and people have got to be able to cope with the challenges
it certainly stress has become is being taken more seriously by some companies
put it like that
other companies prefer you know they've got to be able to cope but you know you read various things that are said and some companies are taking it much more seriously and they're UNK the problems right the way down right through the whole company that stress is causing and trying to save money
it's the object at the end of the day isn't it
i mean they are concerned about their employees they are
but at the end of the day they're more concerned about the money
the problem is the problem is though half the time you put into a situation where i was due er a week's holiday and two weeks previous to that i was actually changed contract so i was there on this new contract and in a fortnight i was going to take a holiday and sort of well i can't stop you from taking your holiday but you know it's that sort of problem isn't it
because i mean i i've got three weeks holiday UNK to me from last year
yes i know UNK yes oh i can believe it yes
it's an attitude as well from your immediate superior as well
if they're used to working long hours they expect that off you
you hear these people say i don't ask anything of my staff that i'm not prepared to do myself then you find something like a ninety hour week or something
you know it is a definite problem
yes i can see that yes
yes you you've got to keep UNK for this holiday
you've got to survive at the end of the day
do you know if you're ill then what's going to happen
they've got to cope then haven't they
that's different though isn't it
a perfect manager
i like it
personnel
i like it yes right well
is it any different if you
right th thinking about things then that do stress you
now there are lots of things that can cause you to be stressed and i mean i'm talking about a lot here
and we're going to go through them you don't necessarily need to write them all down because there is such a lot but because they're all sort of shown individually here
now in your environment then there are lots of things that cou could cause you to be stressed depending on the type of person that you are
so let's look and see what they are
things that i mentioned yesterday you need to be able to er manage effectively all these things like temperature the noise level around you
the older you get the more sort of find that you like to work in a quiet environment
if you've got teenagers they can't do their homework unless they've got the ra the television on and the er the UNK at the same time
and you say how can you concentrate
what you know
they're still trying to do their homework
i can't work without that actually going on around me sort of thing
er lighting again you get much more concerned as you go on we get much more concerned about these things don't we
the young cope
er office UNK we find actually makes a big difference to people
some tests done in wasn't there in one of those prisons and i think they tried with very violent very aggressive er prisoners there and it they eventually found that the colours that UNK them down most of all was pink
so if you're if you find you have some very violent and aggressive people working for you put them in a pink room to have their sandwiches so
give them pink UNK
there you are yes even the open door policy can be very stressful for some people
some people like it and UNK on it others find it very difficult to live with
but so those are what we call environmental stresses
these are the things that can cause you to be stressed in your environment
but you might say no it's fine i can live with all those
you know i'm easy going and i can cope with that and get on and do the job with whatever it is that's got to be done
is there one colour that might do er what best person
blue is seen as being very cold
y you h you want you've got to go for neutral colours that's going to sort of stress the less number of people haven't you
you wouldn't sort of erm if you think of UNK er
what are the what is it that
i don't know i don't know er i i'm not really up into this but for example the reason that UNK uses red is because it's part of their culture of being classed in an so if you used green
UNK use green because they want it as a more relaxed atmosphere i mean there's a lot in colour psychology and i i'm not into it
but er if you if you really wanted to find out there is quite a lot in colour psychology
oh yes even yes even things like that yes
but of course we've got to be a bit careful because the americans are going sort of the other way now that people can't wear UNK and UNK that smell and things like that can they because it's now seen as being equally as difficult as people who smoke
so you you've got to be careful which road you go along oh yes haven't you heard this in america
commitments in a recent task
rights of way are an important part of our heritage the road network should not be allowed to UNK further
all is a labour activity by all people do things cost unless of course special clothing and then awfully difficult and making it people's education and general health
we feel it's very important that our rights of way network should be maintained and improved where possible which is why we are proposing an issue thank you
i'd like
thank you mr chairman i would agree that there was two or three on the question of
we will outside the erm the supporting it if it wasn't for the fact that we understand that the officers would have a great deal of difficulty spending that money
erm these are not schemes which you can cut out with an a b or a c solution
every one is different everyone has its own pattern of possible UNK runs and they take a great deal of er
hesitation a great deal of divided effort as near as life as possible in the first instance
erm to prevent that in fact erm we understand these people a great so er that is one of the reasons why we
the second reason just if i could point erm we only learnt this morning of the landscape design erm where we understood that savings were being made by the four members of staff organisation
we understand that because of lack of work they will now only give two of those records and what people are saying and obviously really good
finally UNK period erm especially the fire so trouble erm er UNK we'd like to apologise for his UNK because of
you never er not in fact the committee we do in the eyes of when majority
and that's what we're talking about because the reason why that wonderful piece of work didn't go through priority to set up
now if we go back to two years ago on the question of whether or not we should accept erm almost don't think you'll get any reply the professional advice of an officer two years ago or so we had the professional advice of an officer we were looking at yearly report of the er inspector and
strong of er the er a number of firemen of the first er out
and what was the action of the majority party then over and it was to receive the report
that's what it was
we might have said no but that's what it was because of pressure put on this side
erm concentration put on of where pumping into us there came back a further report on how one would win that and as i remember it the professional advise was we should have twenty but charles and his i nearly said men but progress erm
they suggested ten
now i think if you look back on this report famous report that didn't through
that started because i think charles saw that they were eventually going had to give way to twenty additional fire fighters and they were looking for safety within the service
now if you're a majority party you can instruct officers to come up with a specially paid reduction UNK you pay for the policy so you can then structure the system or look at the service and come up with a reduction come up with an expansion
or come up with a whole so whole position
they need to know that they can give you your professional their professional attention they will not make it UNK the majority party of what went wrong this is you were no longer the majority party
chairman i have followed your information and can i direct er councillor to item three point four on item four today whereas if we see that asks that the full year effect of those er financial fire fighters are concerned we wanted to an additional ten and that was the position that
ten and if you can discuss the fire ten later on
that's what the inspector says we should do
council asking mrs and mr erm arrangements save you then making no comment and going back
sorry
yeah
mr
i think you are asking him to worry about
erm thank you gentlemen we were asked by mr of the conservative budget that if the budget of er cuts and that really considering
if that money in that it does come into the policy and the guideline here and i erm he accused us of putting out er press releases talk about council tax and this may be popular with
well i strange erm UNK yes we will be we would keep the council tax down if i am that would be a popular message to give out and so having accepted our below er the guideline figures they did take this into consideration but we have a budget that has elements of growth in industry
it does er include a past policy and the planning department includes two hundred and forty thousand for erm various statutory fire which seem so any fire growth over and above our list are based on the judgement panel that we are
that was
ever important
and our growth is offset by savings and they are not budget they are not cuts in services they are savings which of efficiency erm they would should and would happen erm in any case
the particular ones substantial one is erm down two major schemes
er this will not cut in any budget erm as can be seen from our sheet
i'd like to erm two constant er budget we feel that UNK of the capital design staff salaries is important if not because
design work cannot be turned on and off er it is er feel flowing continuous process and we must be particularly must be er as well as practical work in the future
i hardly dare mention traffic calming but it does seem to be the flavour of the month at the moment but to see that the existing work doubled by and i know it's going to cost the county erm this but if you don't want to talk about the children and their crime it is er traffic calming it certainly is a and i do believe
i think what we've all to pay for this erm that we will perhaps it will have to come from somewhere and again of the council planning department as we do erm continue
we are multiplication work and there isn't should be tackled and we were very that we cannot do this without and therefore we accept the grant fifty thousand in these four counties planning service which i would say servicing
erm district council to erm support the er service and we will come back into the thirty thousand council
so we are putting towards will happen anyway does and i
now mr
i'd like to say this is not going to be a very anyway
have another fire service erm we have the labour mix and budgets
we want back to basics
this year i'll quickly run through one or two of the er various aspects of er mr commented on money being thrown at the problem
i think produce need to increase cash across the whole of the county very
point of order the point that i made make it on this side is that we are not against the expenditure
richard made a very and i wish he had the confidence about our proposals
here
robert said that we to spend money said the opposite so doubtful
oh they'll spend the money don't worry
budget our priority for our manifesto
that spend a proper sum of money on we spent a lot more but we don't district councils hundred thousand each
that about thirty traffic if that be proposed use the money for we do not
we will also provide money for public transport
start the way
we would hope to make large contributions each years and we would hope deliberate non standing this year for an increase year's
we are able to achieve all of this and priorities in other areas such as the nursery education
and yet we are not which conservative because at the end of the day you will be an s a which is expenditure or UNK
thank you mr
mr if you wish to speak
chairman
mr
i think that all that can be said has been said chairman and i think that UNK is the leadership today
mr
just to say a few words fire as usual he didn't actually those to erm
the conservatives are inconsistent i mean that when they wrote the policy when they were looking at the guidelines this erm i can't remember off hand what it was on page fifty
erm the conservative thirty three million and the policy committee is that labour was actually sort of lowest
erm in terms of community budget so this environment committee and conservatives gone down to below sort of seventy two million so we are not actually getting any sort of
conservative actually being down to the traffic calming
i know it varies erm we are rather identical we are actually very close together and erm hope that with the erm c county what labour's put forward to the basic budget er
it do
it is the sort of sensible budget
but in it's balance erm mix and match
but it is traffic calming passenger transport town UNK
i mean i can tell you
provide something on doing erm etc and we call it we call it but what it is actually doing it has UNK the traffic that's what its about giving us the back pedestrian back but the traffic still come through
is that traffic calming or is it town centre enhancement because it happens to be in the middle of the towns
there are connections passenger transport is one way of calming a number of cars that you've got erm on our roads
now i suggest chairman that there are number of on your paper which probably the committee could really of this stage i think the sort of important ones
labour is what the policy committee wants
it was asked for and arranged to be put erm forward
erm if the liberals wants they want to stop seventy two point six er million but they seem to do rather than go to seventy three point three which is what they want to reach what they want to look at originally
er for the policy committee erm committee
if you want to stop at seventy three point six million erm pounds we're quite happy to erm and i suggest chairman if we don't get the main er growth savings through at the next few minutes of voting that perhaps a rather longer lunch erm maybe there would be some

excuse me mr chairman motion the erm
i was mr chairman as all the budget process have been perhaps so perhaps some budget direct committee when in fact
to take on item number five
thank you
before going to item five can i just ask items
general item two straight after number five back to the budget which allow us a couple of UNK who have been so far
yes
we will therefore planning to present the petition
thank you chairman erm take this opportunity to the committee to sub committee erm back early erm year three
what we are asking
eventually when all of the information is gathered in we're asking you to quite simply reject this
the vast majority of the organisations all of the civic organisation in the area are strongly opposed to it
vast majority of the population five mile radius of the proposed site are against it
your county chairman has received your personal letters rejecting this planning application o of a maximum two point six represents fifteen thousand residents object to it
planning has had some two and a half thousand letters of objection to it
members of the detailed planning has objected to it grounds
nineteen thousand three hundred people have objected to it on petition
nobody seriously wants this installation
this is an installation that this county is not required to have one waste from four counties
initially i would stress initially the reference side of has to be ten per cent of the authorisation the best thing since UNK bread
showing you the reality ten per cent the rest comes from all over the country
you will see photographs behind you showing medical waste international lorries going into which is a whole year's circle
bringing stuff into the
residents not prepared to tolerate
we are facing initially something like a hundred and twenty tons of acid UNK from this plant
the local whole year
the current royal commission report indicates that this type of er this likely to be on average twenty times the current legal limits within a year to two years we will be looking at receiving it which is ten times plant producing two hundred fold the legal limits UNK
we in a world UNK medical evidence showing it does state in effect that the have our local populations
even in this country where advances be in minimal amounts of UNK that can go through simply not the population prepared to allow this to happen to us
surely in this day and age the all we hear governments consultation documents even your own consultation documents has been put out to the er future UNK plans
people must be allowed say in the development of their own environment
this is what we are here for it's what your council is here for
your care and our representatives to look after the interests of the population within your area
not blue circle we have to have UNK to them
h m i p which your officers show er or hold up to advise you technically never get turned down on UNK submitted to them
er the daily telegraph recently made this item clear
we are asking you for your protection everything is well UNK and clear
UNK environmental public house er disaster for the population
when you consider the full planning application please turn it down
i would take the opportunity to present a petition to the county council containing over six thousand signatures strongly object to this development and asking you to use all of your powers to protect this
chairman er first of all erm local is not erm having said that my straight run at the moment erm future the decision of the erm council UNK application
yes er made an important point er the application is not in front of the committee most important that will be says anything that would UNK consideration of that application
when it comes to really assist those who er of the so i would be grateful if members would remember that this item is on the agenda because first of all petition received and secondly because there is no explanation in that not the time to discuss whether this application should be
given the constraints of the chairman a question
chairman on a point of order
erm can we just refer to the general item paper as you will see they are not set out to be resolutions will committee er by the county councils er paragraphs three one to three set out the latest position on the planning application
erm essentially we are sticking to more information about environmental issues expect er within the ne next few months
therefore we will get a statement to reporting to the sub committee on this particular application until probably
er section four sets out the background of public concern to the amount of and the number of er latest objection which we have received
as the UNK pointed out
two and a half thousand erm letters of objection
erm just to refer you to the last sentence paragraph four three er to assure members of the committee that those er representation whether the erm application
section four onwards talks about erm the affecting the environmental and makes a point that will be we as officers have been with people on this and that is quite unusual er at this stage of the process
erm we have also asked for information from er the action committee and if necessary erm satisfy the used we will commission because we value our four
and turning finally to section four background to the first half of this motion er relating to consultations
certainly prior to the nineteen ninety two legislation erm in relation to what was er the was er required application but as you see since nineteen ninety two legislation that petition was changed erm and in terms of the resolutions we suggest that recognise the people concerned hertfordshire and that they are taking into account the applications erm that we continue to work basically with h m i pollution aspects and that we respond to the department of the environment er expressing our concerns er erm way in which er consultation has changed and in fact us
call mr
er th thank you chairman erm i not aware of the very great public concern erm in the neighbourhood members committee of the council of our main UNK in relation er to the which i believe has now been received
well i'm a little bit concerned however that er the letters i had er reflect a rather exaggerated view about we will say yeah or nay or may
er to an application with nature a and i wondered if the if this gentleman regular planning er could describe how exactly the responsibility for all this application er which splits down between ourselves er inspector of pollution and indeed the secretary of state
thank you
mr
mr chairman er mr chairman
frank
erm as far as er premises concerned that will be the responsibility of h m i
er premises of this size er this er erm integrated bridges control research and my opinion county council relation society
in terms of the planning petition erm as you know this er application has been referred to the secretary of state and he has informed us that he wants us to carry through erm and consider a consideration of this and make a recommendation er of it
at that stage he will either indicate that he wishes to application in the local term action before he will UNK the county council to take the decision on it
erm if we having considered all the information both on the planning side and on the pollution side have been agreed er with the application
we have proved if er having considered all the erm information if we are not happy with it we can produce
if we refuse it of course it will be our acceptance to the to submit an appeal which would then er ought to be by secretary of state
er it take a view on that er appeal he will take into account the er development plan forces which were in force at the time
and at the moment of those who are UNK in the county structure planning and district planning erm which have no specific proposals relating to er consideration funds
erm and possibly in terms of emerging waste level which of course is due to be er reported
thank you mr
yes mr chairman erm i shall move the obvious suggested resolution with amendments which i wish to be circulated in the last
erm and er i i'm planning to accept the labour amendments and the conservative addition to them
er this motion is not an attempt to UNK applications mr chairman come before us that's mr said time is indicating for the first time that er september might possibly be months
er i was very conscious that we must be careful say do nothing and certainly to accept no resolution which might even appear we don't have a on planning application and this is
erm from the content of the post bags in the past three months members of this committee are well aware of the UNK of the people but the circle building waste UNK on the golden edge first of the city
the volume of the testing matters which have received my
erm the variety of the words which UNK have to stress their UNK erm have shown er this is not an UNK campaign although it is er very well organised
most people have been worried that this UNK would be too close to the school in which their children are taught
their homes shops their community centre and centres and to the place in which they work
UNK have come not only from all over the but themselves considerable numbers and from further UNK i think wolverhampton was my
i have been impressed by the variety of the UNK letters almost without exception
people have written UNK angry and occasionally UNK letters
erm i take all the motions first to try to assure these people that we shall we are that will be taken and i hope that er has been achieved
erm and also because i saw no early prospect of the application coming reports
erm i turn to the last paragraph motion mr chairman
when an application is enforced community is proposed then positive measures should be taken to advise residents of the proposals
that raises matters principle because under the present law it is a public very large vehicle which has to be alert
i hope that the last part in my motion now translated it was suggesting a resolution by officers with the amendments regards was further department of the environment who actually prevent such a situation
erm and our next resolution in motion with the
thank you mr chairman
is your resolution formally accepted
that's formally accepted
mr
chairman erm i'd start erm by for the labour group motion committee like people also who erm have actually sort of written to us letters repeat what they said but the vast majority that erm have expressed the genuine concerns of the people who have left work
er a pity too and er also the villages erm in the in the area erm which i know very well and my and the UNK er UNK itself
erm i only want to say it is very important that we must do nothing to sort of prejudice the outcome of the consideration of the planning application environment cases sub committee erm at a later erm stage
erm this week the three routes fully UNK committee have in fact sent a letter in their joint names to the press in north hertfordshire er trying to say erm what the position is at the moment
er say that the application has not yet been considered
erm that it will be erm that by law the county council must consider any planning application which is made erm to it for a particular site
we don't use sites we don't make planning applications applicants do but we have to consider that we can't say we don't like it go elsewhere
we do have to consider it
we are also not allowed to take into account records of
we have to look at the application er on its merits in the particular erm circumstances and i'll tell you something which we will certainly have to do erm and i will say i will say this in sort of due respect erm because we are grateful to them that we can see
er i to the campaign which is taking place
erm perhaps also say how urgent a lot of people but perhaps there ought to be sort of changes in planning law er changes indeed which erm this council has sent messages to government about erm er previously
erm chairman just UNK the er motions put forward by essential to accept
i in number one we did want to replace the word by erm UNK them because we that just for the strength of this
erm we are UNK everyone who has written to us in the that all of the will be taking it fully into consideration when the money application is considered
in relation to erm the second erm motion erm we did want to add at the end that her majesty's inspector of pollution UNK environment
erm etc
not only having gone to higher standards of were but also looking to account a motion which has already been passed by the environment committee on the fourteenth of september nineteen ninety three and what i was basically saying was that erm UNK should come to that's life that the current e c proposals on erm that and i know that's not a rule but in fact when her majesty's inspectorate of pollution is actually considering this want to draw their attention to a motion which in some cases were saying that we would expect the highest possible standards if those developments were to go ahead with the
so if we just want to make that erm clear erm number three er we wouldn't like to add a fourth erm motion and the labour resolutions it is erm it's actually end of it should be consideration should be given
there is a reason for this chairman is that erm i think erm many of us and i am sure we would be deserved by recent articles in the daily telegraph er particularly the one that appeared last week which erm referred i can see in the report that it referred to a report which is very critical of the work of her majesty's inspectorate of erm pollution
er that certainly UNK me because erm i certainly
h m i p erm there which job we were doing
what we thought all of us it's going to actually this report item which is and i think therefore because we certainly haven't had time
discuss this with officers the same came up over the weekend
erm that we consideration of be given by independent technical advisor on environmental damage
erm er the costing involves we will just say we ought to be for the first fortnight
we would also consider the resolution
thank you
mr
thank you very much mr chairman thank you very much for giving me a chance to speak this afternoon
there is just one observation i wish to make to the committee this afternoon and it actually goes about the whole issue of the planning aspect of what's gone on
there was indeed information given to labour on this but that application proceeded by the council and i think some of the officers have omitted that in the last few weeks
it's just one word of warning that we actually strengthen the application received to the future to make sure again
mr
question alone i don't know whether the officers would want to respond to that last comment first
is that the consultation is a problem the legislation which takes away the requirement for several developments to promote valuable time and be advertised prior to the application so the first most people knew about this application was after this opportunity prior to that to discuss it with the development before it was submitted
could i just follow on what mr was saying earlier when he introduced the he referred to that er are no references to UNK in the structural plan
would this planning application be regarded as a of the
as far as this planning application is concerned
the planning policy which applies purely to the and the in case the sub committee have already er discussed with etc for this
as far as the other aspect is concerned that there is no something that would have to be dealt with on its merits taking account of the arguments for and against
as i said you mention it may be something which is out of our field and we'll have to make sure that the arguments for and against the problems the problem
o k
mr
the question erm we are told that we have got to take into account the actions of er true to me that the er reference site therefore we must carry on as er
i think we are looking at the advantages and disadvantages of erm various types of problems that might occur
really one of the things at the examples of where it's happened in the past
i would expect er i would expect the to actually provide us with the small details of and not necessarily same
that's very kind of you chairman
thank you
chairman er case reports to the letter the joint er that's on our er under the names of these three departments
i think that's very useful
i think a number of us were becoming very concerned indeed that this was eventually becoming a political area and this is dealt with in this way
very important issue considering most of the issue er the environmental interest
er that started with show that we are whatever our issue and obviously resolve er a very for the benefit of
er i will er be taking up with oliver the question of report erm since it is a critical report er like take the place of oliver to ask the government what their views are er on the performance and the truth is
i think that will be of better use this time er
frankly some of the other things that have been going on weeks
er i don't think er erm difficulty of er amendments that would be made er in a couple of words here and there er the people very specific at what we are attempting to achieve problem with that
i thought chairman that er mr is saying that er they would consider any consult with the union on some of the statements that have been made and i quite er the item d is in fact necessary that er i gave no arguments it should be given consideration if it is come to that and er it will come back presumably to form a proposition of deal with it then
er brian has already confirmed that er he will support the conservative resolution which in effect UNK that some of the changes in government regulation over the past er decade has not always turned out for the best er this county in particular order er other asked the secretary of state to re to relieve some of the pressures that UNK in that area and it's for that reason er
to move the resolution er that asks that the consideration be and the UNK of the general er development order which would have the er and earlier for the planning application on the basis of er being mainly on friendly
thank you erm i think that's all i'm concerned with except to say that i wrote er to a little church spelling what it is today er really into consideration on its this proposition so that we can ensure all of the issues with er our requirements
does anyone wish to any further comments
right i propose to go through and go through one of our green
so the first one to start resolution number one
same time
would it be possible to report that as unanimous
i wish now to move on to item two
that's a couple of petitions to be made to
we were asked petition
mr chairman residents of there was recommended to however if transport which has caused the residents to draw
how many points we consider the transport as inappropriate in and effectiveness
we also because county council to address and introducing traffic calming measures such as er UNK or
and as a result of this petition the public and association
first and i am sure we can afford transport spending school
thank you for listening to me er petition
thank you very much
comments approach
well now we go to mr
thank you situation are appointed jointly by the county council and the county and effectively these consultations and of that er appointment and the following the last committee we agreed with the er detail and of the and we also agreed that we would not go ahead with the which until we have seen the result of the consultation and therefore there still outstanding as whether we wish to action the not
the report deal deals with a fair detail and concentration and then on page four this the erm main results of the different elements of the result and though grouping them into those had high levels of sport er to those that were where now the officers and a i think that if you could see that er there was a considerable census for those from the officer part of the
the erm the views coming back from the consultant were obviously er so follow occasions but not dramatically so
so that there will be general consensus whilst they do represent a reasonable view of the people
the erm main issue that are not reinforced that we are trying to determine an overall strategy that will last for the next ten or fifteen years
we are not talking about a package of measures which we go and try to do tomorrow
it is absolutely clear and i want to make it clear that we may not be doing anything tomorrow or the next day we'll all be we'll all be try to understand and determine is how we will deal with the issues in as and if traffic UNK over the next ten years or so and that strategy will then form the basis under which we will try to resist city area that we did not see there
that's the key point ought to go across
on the general the city and district council met er and erm agreed to in fact upon consideration to the joint meeting er a joint committee
on tuesday the eighth of february as i understand it that meeting then will report to a council meeting of the council so i would not wish to put forward the suggested resolutions that are on the order paper er i think i would want to suggest to you ladies and gentlemen for decisions today to whether you wish or not and then i would suggest that the appropriate decision is to UNK the of the city additional council and therefore bring this matter forward to our committee on march the twenty ninth
the only one other point i do want to say is on
it has become apparent on some of the issues some of the comments that we made that was if i could call it the you'll know what we're talking about and i don't if we are talking about the there was there was a point somewhere where talked about ing an increase or short of journey time along the ring road and this has been taken as i understand to be that we are setting out an increase of speed er traffic on the sections of road to a junction and that's totally in force and it was either
well the accident was that if you look at the UNK along that section of road and carried out qualifications junction you could release reduce delays from UNK and effect of your making your total journey in a shorter time making that route slightly more attractive
we would go through a great deal of trouble to ensure that the
between UNK did not suffer for be and any proposals that we agreed you agreed to make fact the existing services
i just thought it was worthwhile making that point as it is made to be very
mr
thank you for
erm only support it
this saga since this recession has been a sorry tale
it was beginning with the disasters on one way systems and then of course a panic decision to do further research into the so called traffic problems of st albans
the very work of the consultants in associated with the road construction industry
nothing particularly wrong with that but that does show where they are coming from when they are looking into being with as i call it the so called traffic problems of st albans
and then there was a consultation exercise consultation exercise which will
relevant groups of consultant those in the for some reason are not despite the fact that the UNK scheme
would it involve belonging to the residents who were residents association but was worth that
there were the city questions you asked if traffic jam
it mostly comes up to you with a UNK and says UNK you mind sitting in traffic UNK yes or UNK
what is amazing is that two didn't seem to like that
and then look at the conflicting interest whereby the consultants did their own report and didn't research into it
and i think we must recognise that it is only that many of the questions and questionnaire had they been displayed of what they wanted to propose
and then there was the attempt not to issue a questionnaire to every household but to reserve the questionnaires in the town hall for four week days saturdays to will honour the people who didn't actually have friday who were at home perhaps walk in to the city centre you might be able to pick one of these up and then there was the problem UNK in distributing the questionnaire because despite of the assurance given to the consultants they were nevertheless distributed amongst the numerous st albans and believe you me even those likely people who did go to the press do sometimes for every that we having suddenly fully UNK to see whether perhaps there might be a consultation questionnaire UNK within it
and then there was the UNK final report i used to take will be the first to endorse and interpreting those statistics at least in my case course but i UNK what these consultants have done let's give you a few examples sixty five per cent you see on page three think that changes are necessary they were asked UNK you think changes are necessary to meet the fifteen transportation problems and to be needs UNK
well a little more in future ask travels for the earliest make changes and deal with the future and again this is remarkable that only sixty five per cent absolutely endorse that but our UNK in the if you look at the next examples forty four we are told here were in favour of the strategy and thirty six per cent opposed
that's it we can majority vote on that sort of basis
well you will find for instance that three times as many people will strongly oppose and was strongly in favour something omitted from the report in front of me and there are eight per cent there that were UNK
to your council did i knock on the door and say standing for the liberal democrats they said well we're not sure it's the way we are going to vote for you we may vote for somebody else
i don't put them down as a
i put them down as a UNK eight per cent couldn't bring themselves to support this strategy they are UNK
madam if you add thirty six to eight what do you get
you get forty four forty four in favour forty four and that doesn't take into account that the consultants in the overall strategy so madam would question is this difficult to get
there's always to say them up will they against more buses and public transportation
yes
we are asking questions
do you believe that sin is bad and that virtue is good
do you believe the people should be faithful for their wives etc
etc
is anybody timing this UNK please
does anybody care chairman
i am sorry to be concerned i don't know what he wants to pour something down my throat and this is
perfectly clear chairman if you have
that is perfectly relevant we saw what you felt when you were briefed with the reference on the twenty second of december
unfortunately view and i'm sorry that we don't have
on page five again this is the UNK the forty per cent in favour thirty per cent against
that again is not sixty per cent of those again i would suggest that part of the report is misleading
the consultants at least have to recognise they couldn't fix that the closure of was strongly opposed but it was a mystery to all of us except obviously mr on the december how they were unable to nevertheless to accept a little UNK of part of my and the associated increased in the despite the fact that seven different people are of the same several different people same margin mr but not
did the consultant have difficulty here i suggest but if one UNK of strategy is demolished by public consultation then that's fortunate but in the second UNK then your whole strategy UNK down
this strategy does not have public support
i if you don't like the sound of it mrs then i'm sorry for you but this is what democracy is all about and it is about time you listened to what people have to say
now i'm disappointed to see here before us a motion of group which report saying that he should receive the report
it is perfectly clear to me and fellow councillors that a report which is so badly and which so badly uses statistics cannot be received because it is not of sufficient quality for this county council and support the district council to use it
i don't therefore at the earliest possible to reject this whole exercise book and to start a proper consultation strategy of proper transportation strategy for the city of st albans
thank you mr
i usually to start by saying chairman have you followed that
erm i don't think i have been down to that i think i've sh erm UNK the whole damn out of my mind because er it's a long time since i heard such UNK in this chamber it's fortunate for us chairman that mr isn't a member of the environment committee because if that's the kind of contribution that he's prepared to make on these occasions we would could well do without it
here
here
chairman the st albans traffic issue the erm bus for quite a long period of time but throughout that period of time chairman the county council's decision has been absolutely clear
we believe that st albans er has a traffic problem facing it in recent years two or three year's ago at the height of activity er the problems facing it were more obvious and along with that situation er there's no question about that and one might be forgetting to thinking the problem and not the way it hasn't it will return now we know it will be return and therefore we should be firm in our resolve and at some point in time in the future that problem must be addressed sensibly for the good of the people of st albans
it has also been our position of this county council chairman that we will never seek to impose a solution on st albans we felt that it's our duty to highlight the problems we to give them our expertise er as part of the leading part of our authorities committee in this country
er and seek good qualified er consultants to carry out the work which could be UNK on by the various committees of the county council and the district and that work has been done and i think if i saw anything chairman from the meeting on the twenty second of december at st albans it was that form very first time three political parties took up the policy and they started to address particular issues er we believe less measures UNK
over the period of action five to ten years
now i don't think there's any doubt about this chairman that particular group bears er comment from us er part of the er conservative resolutions made wants to acknowledge the fact that for the first time all parties members of the parties haven't started to look in detail at these st albans and many aspect many aspects of the UNK strategy of starting to appeal
there are relevant UNK er chairman which you can look out of place at the present moment of time but they will need to be addressed at some point in time in the future and therefore one could be forgiven for wanting to UNK various but in general terms the strategy that has been er looked at is the progress of st albans in general there may be small elements of it and some of these have already touched upon but in general that is no sound strategy er which over a period of time and in the process of that it will be essential to monitor erm the effect of some of the changes as you go forward to see in fact whether the other elements of strategy that were erm put in to that er work were in fact still necessary and whether they should be have some
so all in all er the survey approved says
in coming to grips with this issue we have realised how particular they are met er and a number of members will prevent from getting to that meeting to put their views on the table and for this reason er they decided to defer that
er the director of transportation UNK that it was said that he's happy to UNK the outcome of UNK by that er district council and that's what the conservative group has suggested that we do but if he wants you to recognise that every policy has to be accepted the way in which they have performed time and decided to be addressed by my members of all parties and therefore i urge you to support the conservative resolutions i now put forward
thank you for secondly i was that the decision now is left to the district council er have you not discuss some parts of elements er could be addressed in the short term
er i really can't accept that er general questionnaire responded to sixty five per cent twelve per cent of sixty five per cent of you will recognise and agree that changes were needed that are existing now erm and so there must be evidence as and when the erm district erm district erm
so i cannot accept that
mr
try and be er as positive as i always am but er
all well know
however i must start by saying that er the county council are giving so many people the hundred and twenty nine thousand people who signed UNK
erm er that problem did seem to be appealing in the shape of a UNK
questions of this switched on and some of them how to do
first thing is to make sure that you get an opportunity to discuss it and i agree other people who actually res responded in seem to collect the fee and i am not paid to collect the fee to try to make it very difficult for people to respond but nevertheless the numbers that we i think in terms of other areas other areas the response that we got it is a bit UNK though to sit here in the afternoon having listened in the morning to a lovely discussion which was UNK three hundred five hundred thousand for on traffic calming
er then to er put er against the background as the district council last week were being told our budget will cost us er to er accidents and of course what this exercise would cost us three hundred and fifty thousand is the amount very close that some of you just want to spend on the doing traffic calming over the next year
so i mean is certainly makes sense on the background and very UNK by er mr saying very positive so i can't hold my hand up and pick out particular in which they some of them er never change opposition district council that their negative response if you like but there were there were some positive responses but only i have to say this for something like four er proposed paper and one of those in which er lots of in which relevance and er businesses in the area could have er the thing that er response was er this UNK particular phrase would seem to be saying trouble erm er identified
and it isn't like that one at all but nevertheless there is a way to adopt something like four strategy
this is this is why i find it very sad i mean having gone to erm meeting for our my apology for this
to get known response long before the county er UNK er decide consider what good will come
that's to start with if you look at the you will find that erm and then you've had that sort of what er local people that is now part and policy
thank you very much
proposing
now what do i find oh dear we now say no great
no to the railway group but this particular council it isn't the type of bits and say no to that
i want to see er the this rubbish dump but this isn't the time to do it and as the conservatives said we should wait on er to see what the council er wants to do and i take that on board
and certainly i would above all else above all else i would like to say to people whose how comes UNK by the group
the areas through are the safe was only built fifteen years ago right the way through
i'd like to say they relax our agreement
but apart from that the government has
is the way the total response of the city and district council and it's had a chance this committee to look at it and move forward
that's the right approach and i suggest to this committee that if you take the liberal democrat conservative resolution that will be not a bad
thank you mr i now
er thank you chairman erm i should say as i live er st albans and i actually er live
erm on what they report does is the UNK
i don't think it is
no i don't think
erm and these are the fairly brief er chairman i think i am sorry for disappointing mr because erm i main properties but erm we are basically i think sort of more or less agreed parties that we actually want this
er the reason want referring because hasn't commenced it's considered er view and the last thing we want is to be in business actually doing is UNK on st albans and anything that st albans doesn't actually want
i mean i think you all learnt from the one way system and the UNK erm of that was actually there
erm on the other hand if it's if anyone who doesn't think that st albans hasn't got a traffic problem erm well they probably live in a
erm but there are sort of problems erm there
we want to get views of st albans district council am i told erm that last thursday evening in the snow er UNK st albans council came through first er to erm agree it
er but not right
er i am sorry this mr means the tone of his
here
it sounds as if he was launching a little democrat er campaign for the district council elections in may that's what it sounded
erm i do think charles we need some serious approach er and deal with this problem
it's a very complex actually
there are sort of costs in that respect that come out of this erm business report er and on the late sides erm we would actually support the motion that's been moved by er charles and jane but there is a policy of response and that doesn't mean to say that they will accept all of it but there may be some good elements er within it but we need to actually refer it
the end of the i wanted to do chairman apart from well that er we can support erm the third motion
is i think we probably do need as mr suggested to move number one suggested resolutions erm now if the liberal democrats won places in and if they'd rather have the work noted proceed to proceed by something UNK
it might take just a decision for st albans oldest of the country by having changed the word received to
so if we would like further consultation apparently it was noted in view of the test carry out what we could do erm in fact the questionnaires have the response i do share some of mr 's er worries that erm i think we ought to get out of the way and say to number one that this er
yeah well mr chairman i would formally like to motions my when the study one and the problems of this having to despite that the district council have six and it's much further i again i think specification of erm what we do need despite what we should not need this time this time later
er another er UNK another committee because i would like to accept the if we could do something then modern conditions
so erm i i've got them in the back of what type of strategy you should
i think it would be fair to say we should not at this moment in time take any decision on the matter
taking votes on the first
number one to take up the work of the
agreed
take the conservative resolutions against a to afterwards taking
right thank you very much
that's it that is it
we've waited at st albans
what you'd have to do
reception
was for us
i would now like to move back to er defer lunch
circulate paper from erm a new motion in terms of the environment motions erm UNK more than that i don't really say
we had about two hours on it this morning
needless to say there has been er
lunch time back on from aberdeen
make yourself available
er tomorrow and er thursday are even more critical than today when we actually haven't got any hard of hearing members in today
er
i don't th when i tested it doesn't affect the hearing aid
doesn't no but the point if that was being UNK and today we get away with it but we wouldn't get away with it tomorrow or thursday
well the only think which erm which erm i and i said look this er system because no way
before the meeting proper may i refer you to first of all the voice UNK system is currently working but er there are some difficulties with it and it may during the day UNK to a state that it is more trouble than it's worth
in which case the er calculated very kindly brought in a system UNK so be warned of that please
secondly i did write to all the members of the council about the issue of the british national corpus and their desire to have a record of english as she is spoke and their is a gentleman from here today if you would care to stand up to identify yourself please
yes
who i have no doubt will be very happy to discuss with members during lunch break what the project is
o k thank you
confirm that the minutes of the twelfth of october are correct
yes i just wondered if i could ask mr er if it was item nine page seven yes its item nine erm row five and its about a report being brought to the committee on trans proportion policies relating to public transport by extending free transport to school children and students beyond the UNK obligations of the council
er i just really wanted to know when that's likely to occur
oh i don't think i'm able to give you a specific answer
erm will question
there are 2 petitions on the agenda but the one will be taken with item 2
i therefore call upon chairman of the village association to present a petition about traffic at
mr chairman councillors ladies and gentleman as chairman of the village association i am pleased to present the following petition which has been signed by UNK residents representing over ninety five per cent of the
we the UNK being the residents committee for hertfordshire county council bring forward and promptly carry out plans for the through the village especially in view of the UNK and dangerous traffic conditions and designation of the a four two five one through the village as the southern entrance to from the a forty one bypass road
mr chairman the traffic problem has been with us for many years as our village existed before the motor car
the old a forty one trunk road just grew up through our village erm and erm just exists
we now have a splendid new bypass road for which thank you very much the only problem is that it has UNK the traffic but doubled the speeds
erm our problem can be UNK up in one word UNK
the major cause of these accidents is drivers going too fast for the road conditions that exist in our village
there are two different areas of these accidents one the UNK of the various UNK some of which are blind erm with no pavements and also the four minor roads which junction onto the main road in the village
in section 1 of two hundred metres of road we have counted over twenty six accidents people coming out of the drive parking cars and this kind of thing erm in the last five years
these are accidents that did not involve personal injury but involved er physical damage to walls cars gates UNK etc with cars coming down the road
now i'm not an expert in
modern traffic calming measures however er i believe we have experts on the council er in these matters but i believe that by UNK the road and perhaps giving us pavements because one of our problems is that we have not got a continuous pavement through the village and it is necessary to cross the road four times in some cases to walk from one end to the other
erm and possibly the installation of mini roundabouts at the minor UNK erm would give us quite a lot of benefit
see what has been done in kings UNK and UNK for something similar on a similar scale for ourselves
thank you for listening to me
please give us some expert assistance
thank you
thank you very much for that and er
there has been no other business items and the same for there's been no questions either
before item one i'd like to propose we break for lunch as near as one o'clock as business allows
for the convenience of the members of the public i intend to take item five by erm statement
one or two members who are resident in st albans did ask me about their position on item two st albans transport study er the advice that i gave them was that unless they er did which is likely to be affected by any UNK schemes in the study they do not have a need to declare either a pecuniary or a non pecuniary interest
we now move onto item one
hand over some questions at the end of each section i will then ask each spokesman to present their budget
thank you mr chairman
er you will all be aware i think that the budget has been running for some months and er i suppose a lot of you either as UNK persons or as members of groups have actually been dealing with the budget issues in some detail
therefore i don't propose to take a great deal of time going through this report
you will also have heard er in the question earlier about the fact that there are references to budgetary issues both in the minutes of the last environment committee and also in the county council on thirtieth of november which did refer specifically the fire service review and also passenger transport
in terms of the process erm we are the first er major service committee to consider its budget for next year and i think everyone will be looking at us to set a pattern for the rest of this week
erm what will happen is that we will er hopefully at this meeting er set a budgetary position within the guidelines required by the policy committee and then that will go forward together with all the other service committees to the policy committee on the twenty seventh of january and from then we will go on to the county council on the fifteenth of february
the committee itself erm the report itself is structured in that it takes you from the starting point of this year's ninety three ninety four resource budget
it then proposes and suggests some certain technical adjustments and makes allowances for previous policy decisions and losses of income etc and leads you through to er being able to propose a package measures within the policy committee guidelines
table one on er page three er which refers to mostly to f appendix one er of seventy three point nought million pounds or ninety four ninety five er moving to seventy two point eight million in ninety five six
and seventy four point two in ninety six ninety seven
as i've said the policy committee guideline was that we should set a budget within the range seventy two million to seventy three point three million which means at the lower level if you go for the lower level er to which says for ninety four five about almost exactly a million pounds
if you go for the higher limit then that allows you to go with the growth of approximately three hundred thousand
the following pages er then describe the budgetary changes commentary on a number of and i don't propose to go through them individually
except i think just to emphasize one or two minor issues but the savings from last year that was the UNK from ninety two ninety three were as you recall last year er used to support this year's budget er those savings UNK are no longer available and therefore have been taken out of the consideration the staff costs for t s g schemes that are mentioned at the bottom of page five erm the programme this year which is actually listed over the page at table two does erm indicate that erm we are now UNK link road and bypass next year and staff available are needed to complete that work or fortunately we've been able to secure a start on which enables some of the staff to be transferred to work on that scheme
moving on then to the capital programme erm which is summarized in table two on page six and er go into that in detail in the two
at the bottom of page six top of page seven i think that issue there requires a resolution from you in that we have the officers have suggested that we spend er six hundred thousand pounds out of the minor works budget on those four schemes but we should reserve the remainder of that minor works budget for approximately and er that report should be put to the march committee
paragraphs last five er and six er identify the number of options for change which allows you to er determine the authority budget and to either go for growth to within the overall particular areas savings in particular areas or to make switches of resources between services or within services
one or two of the items of growth particularly have been er identified as UNK which may mean that you can choose er almost any amount you like er to be spent on those particular items just identify er a figure which you may consider the starting point
and UNK also mention some of the some of the items do have staffing implications and if you resolve to increase expenditure in certain areas such as traffic problem
that will require additional staff and we need to er look at that afterwards to see what effect that has on the er staffing budgets
there are also some there which er can or cannot at your discretion for more than one year er terminology now being used about UNK not UNK expenditure it's up to you except where we are you are UNK to recruit staff or reduce staff erm it would be useful to have an indication from you as to whether you wish the money to be erm carried through until next year or whether you can see it as a one off
just picking up on an item on page fourteen about the UNK programme that obviously is going straight through the process er and should be resolved in the next week or so
picking up the staff costs there was some concern about putting that in there because we were awaiting the result of the t s g settlement
that settlement has now come through you'll see the details in the papers er but we also want to have regard to the fact that the award for the and bridges has actually been reduced substantially by thousand pounds the total reduction in that area approach one point five million pounds
page sixteen structural maintenance of local roads erm i know that there is some possibility that er groups will propose an increase er a reduction in that area and to increase the contribution from the management reserve fund
if it goes as high as an additional half a million each year then the structural management fund will not last through the three years
need to be aware of that
the paragraph eight budget monitor does require also a resolution in relation to carried forward from
UNK this year
you will have erm before you on the sheet a number of resolutions from the groups in relation to the budget and although the motions haven't been put i'll just refer you to a statement which i produced which seems to compare the compare the motions the draft motions from each of the groups
er from which you will see er three entirely different packages proposals and er why this was achieved
one of the at the end of this meeting
can i just make the point of clarification in what said there that as far as staffing additional works spread through for example we are assuming that staff costs are within the figures you are looking at and the work that was referring to was after you made your decision to will need to take some element of that cost into the start of the budget there is no staff figures that would occur after you've UNK this budget we are not aware of so there will be
i can then take questions i think er answer any questions that you might have
mr can i just ask the erm about the i think it's very that he's produced this er so that we can look across and make sort of UNK between the proposals of the groups
erm presumably we are talking here next year talking about sort of years effects and i just wondered what would be the effects that in general terms if we were looking at the full year effects
erm all the figures there are as far as i know full year effects so there are no half year effects
those different effects in following years in relation to we got
er this er james can i ask you erm if we could establish what the stage er the next stage remain UNK probably er so that we the er paper indicates er schedule of balance of a thousand pounds
chairman to that question are rather caused forgive me if i to answer that question
er members will recall that the potential savings that might from the original was something in the order of eight to nine hundred thousand pounds and of course the majority of those er present the saving will be policy will be consideration
erm i'm not at all certain quite er what will come out of that policy and what savings there will be at the end of that exercise
this report does touch on if i find the paragraph speak
thank you does touch on that issue and refers to the point that i made earlier that the proposals having been referred to that policy and how it meets with er more work
i'm not saying i can give you a figure all i can say is that originally UNK will not be forthcoming now because some of this proposal is not meeting them
er UNK the issues requested by the earlier policy
i am sorry i can't be any more help with that at this stage what i can do is to take that question away and circulate the information after i've done some sums
discussion with the chairman
the chief officer don't quote me by it UNK er i've had with carried out on a larger sum other than that available
at worst
are there any more questions
i am concerned in seven two as eventually savings
while we are talking about the UNK that we not going to be dealing with the position of
was that er question environment
i'm sorry chairman what am i being asked
forgive me chairman erm i actually question
i do apologise i do apologise yourself order i see it's been placed on the early question again
chairman i asked you item seven two when the talking of laying and reassurance that this will not include the of the above
which is certainly right
seven two er refers to planning environment er and not to and also refers to a type of actually
since the confusion environment issues erm
three minutes
perhaps the questions can be answered at the
i can say that erm none of the bonuses that currently exist within the fire rescue service are included upon
so no determination has been made about as yet and therefore upon that are not included in these calculations
are there no further questions
i will pass you over then to erm mr to make a presentation
chairman of my all of the offices or er tremendous amount of work which has gone into the local report to the committee er but also to the tremendous amount of work which has been done behind the scenes which i know has been going on with er that is quite good for the officers erm looking at the budget er i in the line with what actually saying for them
i would like to move erm er the grant most of this on the er the order of make up erm both with one to eight
erm and although i will briefly go through some technical ones erm motion number two to erm er because it's in relation to growth savings that we have the differences between the budgets and which are actually being er proposed and er i suppose we do need to go through number six carefully as well about structural maintenance funds
er we actually need to withdraw from but i think in relation to the other business about the UNK of the i think that essentially routes are agreed without er without so perhaps it's structural erm maintenance
erm the first er labour motion is really still a technical one
quickly go to number two
l it's presenting the changes for the next year er are really so we can have a two way and a two big
er two ways essentially erm the labour see erm for next year
we are operating within a of because of the government this council is erm UNK cuts of all its services of four point two million reduction of four point er two million and the policy system
er to look at the budget for ninety four to ninety five in ranges of seventy two million to seventy three point three
the seventy two million erm for this committee is the labour that would involve roughly er UNK savings of about one million er pounds because we and no doubt all the routes of course have to look at the social budget and where their priorities are and in order for us to er do other things perhaps indication in relation to and also will provide primary school er budgets
we do need to be looking essentially about budget of two million pounds erm for this particular er committee
what the is saying to of er of savings is that in the appendix four UNK the possibilities for savings for next year
erm the labour group is prepared to accept all of those accept one er exception er related relates to item number twelve so that is the information the planning and environment erm in parliament
er now we think that is absolutely er essential and that should have a serious effect on information services
very much but we think it important that you
erm if you look at what we are proposing planning and environment in terms of er in terms of
to say that in fact various significant costs budgets for next year's
very much the view of this group that we have an excellent planning and environment department service led by a distinguished er director and say that
erm and we would very much er long to see work that department does erm continuing er also be continuing er beyond actually
so its taking quite a
the other exception to accept the erm the savings identified as possibilities relate to item thirty structural and maintenance of the roads we could make a cut of half a million
erm we are saying that we certainly couldn't go that far maybe two hundred thousand but we would want to put it back so you will have an equal there in terms of spending
from the structural maintenance i think all members who remember before they start er
structural benefits that we do have this backlog twenty six and a half million pounds of work
we're not talking just about roads we're talking about what we call technically i've thought about what everybody else calls pavements
er now these are more important asked about so i think we should be very clear on it before er we reduce spending
in terms of growth that we actually want erm unlike i think perhaps one of the we don't want to put all our eggs into erm one basket erm one million pounds in terms of er of course we want to do that the income of the budget which is actually feasible and UNK er in terms of i take it that as where it says the liberal democrats are going from a growth of a hundred and fifty million erm on town centres that there probably was an error
in terms of transportation growth
erm want to see expansion in half a million there
passenger transport in order to promote the new transportation erm policies of the to get off the ground erm during the erm previous council
seriously do need to put erm into the passenger transport
town centres er we think there should be growth of two hundred thousand it's not enough
erm we are still not going to enough we need something like just over half a million to do all the schemes er which er and we could do next year and this committee is going to have to decide there which er town centres are actually going to be done and which are going to be erm left out
in terms of planning growth erm right take orders item number four erm this is really just a correction because attendance for fifty nine should actually be fifty
