i say here that i have been UNK assisted by the reports and evidence of mr peter and mr david from UNK park in this case
i've also been greatly assisted by the detailed report and evidence of mrs UNK the plaintiff's expert on UNK costs
where her evidence is in conflict with that of miss UNK the defendant's expert i prefer the former because of the depth and variety of experience mrs has
it will be necessary for me to return to mr assessment of the quality and extent to which the parent's contribution has helped to achieve the plaintiff's present quality of life
when i deal with the cost of and care and also the cost nursing care for her future
it will be seen that i have to arrive at figures in respect of damages in this case under a number of heads
the first is of course that covering the plaintiff's pain suffering and loss of amenity
to that must be added her loss of earnings throughout her life in her chosen occupation
there is also the cost of care both up to today's date given by her parents and in the future to be given by her parents and by professional carers
to this must be added the cost of accommodation in the future it being accepted on all sides that the plaintiff's present home though much loved by her is not suitable in any long term assessment
there is also the cost of transport to be used in the future to get her and her wheelchair about
there are also a host of other matters where in the main agreement has UNK been reached on the figures
sub heading pain suffering and loss of amenity
i have already drawn attention to the appalling contrast between the plaintiff's young life as it was before the accident and her life as it is now
her UNK treatment as an in patient meant that she was nearly a year in UNK hospital over a year in UNK hospital and a further year at UNK park UNK and medical centre
the medical reports before me deal fully with those years
her time at home since leaving UNK on the twenty third of may nineteen ninety is well described in the reports and by her parents and her sister
the expert reports detail the visits to her and describe her home UNK
she is now left in the situation where she is wheelchair bound
in need of twenty four hour care to get through the day
only able to take part in a limited range of activities at home and particularly seriously she is only able to hold a conversation by the UNK method of UNK out her comments on UNK tape through using her UNK
this is a severe disability in one so young where the speed of communication of youth is an ever present part of daily life
as mr said in an earlier report brackets b twelve closed brackets quote anna jane is a quick UNK intelligent girl and it is obviously extremely frustrating for her to have to type her conversations unquote
the UNK report from doctor brackets b twenty three closed brackets noted that quote most avenues of normal life are now closed to anna and will remain closed to her permanently
she UNK a UNK of mind which is quite extraordinary under the circumstances and she still displays a keen sense of humour and a warmth of contact despite the fact that she has to use a machine
while this is some ways a mercy it nonetheless serves to UNK the loss that she experiences
it will increase her UNK about the future and it will also and it does indeed cause great frustration at her terrible disabilities
she is an extraordinary young woman who UNK her difficulties with great UNK and makes every effort not to show her UNK to those around her
however UNK guilt and a sense of terrible loss is with her almost constantly
i interrupt the report of doctor to si to say that i have seen that conclusion for myself in her writings that i have read
doctor goes on when one considers her potential life in terms of an academic achievement and marriage with a family one can only say that without a shadow of doubt she has been UNK and her emotionally UNK will i fear increase over the years unquote
for my part i entirely accept doctor assessment
the plaintiff's position now is that she has to face the fact that she's wheelchair bound for life and unable to speak
as well as the fact already mentioned that she requires twenty four hour care
this at the moment is being undertaken by her parents
her father has to sleep in the same room since he has to attend to her during the night when she may need a bed pan up to four times
she is generally continent but may be UNK of urine once a week
she needs assistance to get her on and off the toilet and in cleaning herself after opening her bowels
she cannot brush her own hair or clean her teeth adequately
she can drink from a UNK with a lid and straw but has to have someone with her because of the risk of UNK
she can hold a UNK and feed herself but only slowly and with UNK
her food has to be in sandwich or semi UNK form for easy UNK and again to reduce the possibility of UNK
she can use a pen in her right hand for short notes
there is a problem with UNK which has shown some improvement but which is UNK to be most UNK when for instance she is concentrating hard at her computer
these constraints on the quality of her daily life are enormous
the change from what she was to what she has become is a vast one
law of the evidence in relation to that change will be apparent when i deal with the question of loss of future earnings
as i have already indicated she has entirely lost the possibility of marriage children and an enjoyable career
it is in the light of these matters that i have to decide upon the appropriate evidence up upon the appropriate figure for pain suffering and loss of amenity
naturally enough different figures are advanced by council on either side though that difference on this particular head of damage is not great
mr for the plaintiff argues for a figure of a hundred and thirty thousand pounds whereas mr for the defendant UNK that the claim is worth between a hundred and fifteen and a hundred and twenty thousand
mr puts the case as comfortable with awards in the case of UNK
he draws support from and the trustees of the italian hospital and others reported in and volume two dash a four dash one o four and nineteen eighty six one all england report page three two
mr on the other hand stresses that there is no continuing pain or UNK and no UNK illness such as depression
mr stresses that there is in this case a much longer life expectancy than in UNK namely fifty five compared to forty two
he says that the speech difficulties and the mental injury in this case put the damages higher than in and
both council agreed present day value of the award in that case would be in the vicinity of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds
i conclude that taking into account all the matters which were before which i've attempted briefly to summarise in the introductory paragraphs and under this heading
the proper figure for general damages for pain suffering and loss of amenity is one hundred and thirty thousand pounds
mrs
mr first laid plans of mice and men is one page missing as it is only twenty five metres away and i shall have it shortly
i resume sub heading cost of parents care to date
it is agreed that in arriving at a figure appropriate to be UNK for the care given by the plaintiffs to the date of trial
the period of six and a half years should be divided into two sections
first that from the accident and until the plaintiff was discharged from UNK park in may nineteen ninety and second the period the plaintiff has spent at home from such a discharge until now
for that first period mr claims a sum of seventeen thousand eight hundred and five pounds worked out on an UNK basis
by multiplying five thousand one hundred and ten hours by three pounds fifty a rate something under the full commercial rate
in contract mr does not count hours but arrives at an overall figure of seven thousand five hundred pounds
it must not be forgotten that for this three year period the patient was being cared for in two hospitals and in UNK park by a full range of no doubt dedicated UNK
however i have already referred to the views of doctor david of the quality of the parent's care while the patient was in UNK
i shall also refer to the views of doctor david as to that care when the patient was at UNK park
he thought the care had been quote managed UNK well unquote
he had quote rarely seen a case so well managed as in this case unquote
he also said in evidence that the quote parental contribution has been of fundamental importance unquote
he attached UNK extreme importance to their visiting in the first few years
it should be stressed that in the first period when the plaintiff was at UNK hospital that is from june nineteen eighty seven to may nineteen eighty eight at least one parent was in attendance for eight hours a day
the help given in the first period of UNK when the plaintiff had her own room and was for much of the time still in a UNK was clearly UNK significant not only in caring for the plaintiff's physical needs but in giving the support and encouragement which no doubt contributed greatly to the plaintiff's emergence from that UNK
for the second period at UNK from may nineteen eighty eight to may nineteen eighty nine again at least one parent was present for eight hours each day and assistance was given with physiotherapy occupational therapy and speech therapy
the parents assumed responsibility for helping the plaintiff to eat her midday and evening meals
at UNK park from may nineteen eighty nine until may nineteen ninety both parents stayed for the first week and thereafter supported the plaintiff in taking her back for home visits every weekend plus a week at christmas and easter
i consider that it would not be appropriate t to UNK too UNK to the number of hours multiplied by a rate of three pounds fifty per hour suggested by mr
but i feel that the sum suggested my mr is far too low
it follows that i award for this period of care by the plaintiff's parents the sum of fifteen thousand pounds which UNK to an award of three pounds UNK for five thousand hours
the second period covers the time from may nineteen ninety until now when the plaintiff has been solely looked after by the parents with the greatest UNK application UNK and skill UNK on their natural love and affection for the plaintiff
that care has been without the benefit of any paid help
indeed in may nineteen ninety mr gave up his appointment as a teacher in order that he could care for the plaintiff full time
as an of what he's lost by so doing his gross salary for this financial year would have been twenty four thousand five hundred and sixty seven pounds
mrs gave up her voluntary employment in order that she too could assist full time
were the plaintiff's parents unable or UNK to UNK provide her care themselves
the annual cost of full time care including two full time staff and weekend and holiday cover would be fifty nine thousand four hundred and twenty one pounds ninety six pence as set out in the report of mr UNK at b one o two
it was claimed that the plaintiff should be UNK for care of her parents to the full commercial rate in accordance with the principles expressed in UNK
that sum as originally claimed UNK two hundred and seven thousand nine hundred and seventy six pounds eighty six pence for this period of care
it is no UNK that figure included matters which should not have been taken into consideration such as the agency quotes mark up UNK and the effect of v a t figures making allowance for appropriate UNK but also including what i've said by mr to be appropriate increases totalling one hundred and sixty UNK one hundred and sixty six thousand two hundred and fifty pounds are claimed on behalf of the plaintiff
mr relies upon what mr justice as he then was called the ceiling principle in the UNK case referring to the principle UNK in and
in UNK mr justice found it appropriate for the plaintiff quote to UNK his parents up to the commercial rate for one full time carer unquote
on that basis mr took the cost of one professional carer as twenty three thousand eight hundred and six pounds a year he multiplied by three point five and arrived at a figure of eighty three thousand three hundred and twenty one pounds
mr had an alternative calculation
he thought to take mr gross salary in the present financial year to reduce it by a third to get from gross to net earnings and to do similar calculations for the rest of the three and a half years so as to arrive at the figure of fifty three thousand nine hundred and six pounds
it should be noted that the figure of twenty three thousand eight hundred and six pounds which mr had taken is the cost of the carer paid on the basis of quote UNK charges unquote UNK by the defendant's expert mrs and not the british nursing agency charges UNK by the plaintiff's expert mrs
brackets for the b n a charges see b one thirty where the carers fee is an UNK rate of four pounds twelve pence but the inclusive cost to the client with the mark up is six pounds and ten pence
again i accept the constant parental care has been of the highest UNK and i remind myself of the many UNK to the quality of that care in the evidence before me
i also remind myself of the effect upon the plaintiff's fathers career of his decision to give up work in order to attend the plaintiff
i pause to state that i accept mr submission that no claim for loss of pension has been made out on the evidence before me
the pension has been transferred to the legal and general and has been left there at the present time to grow and be managed
i should have something to say later on about future care by mr
i reject both of the methods of calculation submitted by mr
i also reject each of the additions submitted by mr to the net commercial care valuation put by him at thirty six thousand one hundred and fifty pounds and seventy two pence
he had UNK an addition of either a half of the agency mark up which would produce a figure of forty seven thousand seven hundred and eighty six pounds and thirty four pence or alternatively a factor of twenty five percent which would produce a figure of forty five thousand one hundred and eighty eight pounds and forty pence
i conclude that the proper figure to be used as a cost in this second period is the net commercial care valuation of mrs figures which would be thirty six thousand one hundred and fifty pounds and seventy two pence
that multiplied by three point five comes to the figure of a hundred and twenty six thousand five hundred and twenty seven pounds fifty two pence which is the figure i would award
sub heading care for the future
the problems i have to resolve under this heading are not made any easier by uncertainty even in the short term future as to who will be doing the caring and at what stages changes to the present regime will take place
both the father and mother have already put in six and a half years of devoted care and certainly physically and perhaps mentally the strains are beginning to tell
i have reports from doctor their general UNK brackets b two one eight and two one nine close brackets on the state of their physical health
mr has low back pain sometimes with left sided UNK which he's suffered from since the twenty second of june nineteen eighty eight and which may have been UNK by lifting the plaintiff
mrs has recently UNK a UNK and also has UNK neck shoulder and arms pains from the nineteen eighty one traffic accident
i want it to be clearly understood that i do not in any way mean to suggest there is any question of UNK when i say that as to the prospect for the future there is essentially a difference between what the plaintiff's parents said in their statements made as recently as the twenty eighth of october of this year and what they said in their evidence about their attitude to future care
to deal first with their statements mr accepted in his statement that he and his wife would not be able to care physically for anna jane UNK and spoke of the intention to introduce the use of carers gradually
mrs in her statement said that quote although my husband and i would like to be able to care for anna jane as long as possible i accept that the last six years have taken their toll on us and the reality is that it's unlikely that we will be able to provide the same level of care and same level of care and outside carers are required unquote
mr in his evidence spoke of their quotes beginning to think that alternative regime when we began to realise that we had limits unquote
he accepted that the introduction of a night UNK was something which couldn't be UNK in their present accommodation because it would involve the carer sleeping in the same room as the plaintiff
he accepted however that once this case was over the real hunt for more suitable accommodation would begin and by that time at least there could be the introduction of such a carer
mr later on in her evidence said quote i consider that after six and a half years i deserve to have a life of my own it is not a prison sentence i have done nothing wrong i wish to be free to give assistance at my choice we cannot continue to live in our present home michael and i cannot continue to look after anna in the way we have
all these matters show that it is a UNK question when exactly there will be a change in the regime and that is a question i shall seek to answer a little later on
however one question to which there is a clear answer is what is said to be the plaintiff's life expectancy
it is accepted by the medical experts on either side that a t that at twenty four the plaintiff's expectation life is substantially UNK by the accident
the life expectancy of a girl of twenty four according to conventional tables is for the age of seventy nine and is thus fifty five years
it's on that basis that a whole life multiplier must be found
mr relies on hunt and sellers nineteen ninety three for all england reports one eighty and two o one where the said quote what we need is a simple arithmetic calculation of the present value of future payments
council have provided us with a table which shows that the present value of one pound per annum payable for the next twenty five years discounted at four point five percent is fourteen point eight two eight two one pounds unquote
mr relied on the same table to produce a figure of twenty point two five pounds on a life expectancy of fifty five years and accepted a reduction to twenty for the whole life multiplier
this was an advance from the figure of nineteen claimed by the defence on the pleadings
mr UNK that the case was different from hunt and sellers in that there was an agreed expectation of life
he said that the proper approach was to be found in against the national coal board nineteen eighty five one weekly reports nine thirty at ninety five
he submitted that the multiplier should be seventeen for the whole life
those then are the two approaches of the parties in relation to the appropriate multiplier to be applied when working out the cost of future care for the plaintiff
mr had opted for the figure nineteen for the multiplier in the pleadings in this case
after the decision in and which was only reported on the fifth of october of this year in the all england reports
he moved to take the figure to twenty
mr selected the figure seventeen it is in no spirit of UNK that i have lit upon a figure not UNK for by either of the parties namely eighteen
i have looked at the approach followed in and
i've also looked at the approach in and national coal board
an expectation of life as was pointed out in and nineteen seventy two one sixty five at eighty five to eighty six is a matter of probability taken for actuarial purposes to be treated as a certainty
it relates to the average man or woman and no one can say whether an individual plaintiff is that average man or woman
the calculation has therefore to be discounted to allow for the various UNK
in this case i consider particularly that there are there are a great many UNK
i consider the and figure should be discounted down to eighteen which is the figure i adopt for the whole life multiplier
i accept mr submissions on UNK that arrive at a different figure from him
i remind myself that
UNK was a case concerning a pension scheme
in
UNK lord justice had this to say at page nine two seven quote having decided that he brackets the judge close brackets could make no allowance for the possibility of increased pension payments because of the increased cost of living index he had to decide the present day value of the fixed sum payable in thirty one years time
he chose a five percent discount rate table and in my opinion nobody could fault such a choice
two
it was submitted a that the judge in taking a multiplier of seven to compensate the ten point four years loss was taking a figure that was too low and b that in applying a substantial discount for other UNK he was UNK twice over for early death
a the judge did not explain the use of seven as a multiplier but it not suggested that such a calculation could be done with complete accuracy and using a five percent table the judge was faced with choosing between seven and eight
he chose seven and in my opinion this court should not interfere
b the discount for UNK which the judge made in UNK case was twenty seven percent
the judge said that the UNK included voluntary UNK redundancy dismissal UNK ill health UNK or death before sixty five and said that death was the major discount
it was submitted that the risk of death was already taken into consideration in the expectation of life
this is a misunderstanding
the expectation of life is an average and assumes everybody lives to that age and then dies but in fact some die before and some after
those who die before are the important ones
sir gordon in and nineteen seventy two sixty five page five twenty six
after saying that actuarial calculations were based on the performance of the average man went on quote the average man has an expectation of life of a certain number of years
this is a matter of probability but for purposes of actuarial calculation it has to be treated as a certainty
yet nobody can say whether an individual plaintiff is an average man or that he will live for the expectation of life of an average man of his age
any actuarial calculation must therefore be discounted to allow for the chance that he may only live for a shorter period
the chances and not the UNK are what the judge has to evaluate in any given case
it is true that there is also a chance that the individual plaintiff may live longer than the average expectation of life
the chances are equal either way but as a matter of calculation it can be shown that the impact of the chance of shorter life is of greater significance than that of longer life end quote
lord justice went on quote i agree with this indeed when making the calculations the judge had to make those who die early are the only ones which matter because the fact of living longer than the expectation is UNK
it is thus that i arrive at my multiplier for the whole life of eighteen
as to the UNK and the way it's arrived at
there was again a UNK between the parties
it is worthy of note at this stage that on mr t to say that on mr calculations the figures for multiplier and UNK to the cost of total ca er of future care involved an addition to a total sum of one million two hundred and twenty five thousand seven hundred and fifty five pounds and twenty eight pence
on mr calculations for the defendant on the other hand the cost was said to be six hundred and twenty thousand three h three hundred pounds and thirty one pence
in short the one calculation was almost double the other
mr set out his calculations in three separate bids
the first was from now for ten years
the second from that point on until the parents were in their seventies and the third after the death of the parents
for the first period he took as a starting point his previously arrived figure of forty seven thousand five hundred pounds and as an end point a figure of fifty nine thousand four hundred and twenty one pounds ninety six pence derived from mrs
a mean of the two with a multiplier of four arrived at a figure of two hundred and thirteen thousand eight hundred and forty three pounds and ninety two pence
in the second period applying a multiplier of six to the figure of fifty nine thousand four hundred and twenty one pounds and ninety six pence he arrived at a figure of three hundred and fifty six thousand five hundred and thirty one pounds and seventy six pence
for the third period he applied a multiplier of ten to mrs figure in b one o four of sixty five thousand five hundred and thirty seven pounds and ninety six pence to produce a figure of six hundred and fifty five thousand three hundred and seventy nine pounds and sixty pence
those were the figures which he UNK to produce a total of over one point two million pounds
mr calculations on the other hand split into two periods one of eight years and one of nine
for the first period he took as his starting point a figure of twenty thousand three hundred and seventy eight pounds to cover the parents involved
that figure was made up as to sixteen thousand three hundred and seventy eight pounds being two third of mr salary plus an addition of about four thousand pounds to cover mrs additional help
to that we added a night keeper and relief brackets b two six four close brackets and an allowance for physical help during the day charged at the crossroads rate which brought the total up to thirty three thousand five hundred and twenty eight pounds and twenty pence
that figure multiplied by eight for the first period gave a total of two hundred and sixty eight thousand two hundred and twenty four pounds
to that figure he added a total of three hundred and fifty two thousand one hundred and seven pounds for the future made up of a yearly figure of thirty nine thousand one hundred and twenty three pounds for mrs evidence multiplied by nine
it was thus that he arrived at his figure of six hundred and twenty thousand three hundred and thirty one pounds to the overall cost of future care in this case
those contrary approaches contrary calculations and contrary totals the one nearly twice the other had only to be set up to illustrate the difficulty of the problems in this case
i first deal with evidence in relation to how and when the caring regime will change in the future
mr in his statement c thirty three had said quote although he wished to care for anna jane as long as possible i have already begun to have problems with my back therefore we intend to introduce the use of carers gradually so that anna jane gets used to them
i have already quoted mrs in her statement brackets c forty eight saying although my husband and i would like to be able to care for anna jane as long as possible i accept the last six years have taken their toll on us both and in reality it's unlikely that we will continue to be able to provide the same level of care and outside is required unquote
by the tear by the time each of them came to give evidence in this case it was clear that each had brought forward in their own minds the time when daytime carers would be needed
mrs the plaintiff's expert thought it was quote extremely unreasonable to expect mr and mrs to continue caring as they do for their daughter unquote
mrs the defendant's expert in her statement formed the view that the plaintiff's parents quote will remain the main carers for the rest of their natural lives unquote
she said quote i do not accept that mr and mrs will hand over the care of their daughter to paid carers until it is absolutely necessary
when i discussed this possibility with them mrs became very UNK unquote
mrs said that quote when the time comes that mr and mrs are unable to provide all or any of the care themselves i consider that it would be appropriate to employ carers direct and not via an agency
agency care is not a permanent solution and it as agency carers can never be as good as two or three permanent staff
support for my argument that agency care is likely to be used comes from the findings of a follow up survey of a nineteen er sorry comes from the UNK i i'll start that sentence again
support for my argument that agency care is unlikely to be used comes from the findings of a follow up survey
one hundred and fifty three personal injury claims received awards of a hundred and fifty thousand or more in nineteen eighty seven and nineteen eighty eight
the study found that in practice family members remained the primary carers unquote
in her evidence she said that mr and mrs needed assistance to care for their daughter
she said i think in practice they will make considerable input in the care of their daughter not necessarily with the heavy physical work of care
i found it impossible to get from mr and mrs what their care would be they were either unable or UNK to discuss it with me unquote
as to who would provide the care she said that where there is care over a long period of time families often stop employing carers through an agency
she said quote i really don't accept the agency argument i've not met one family that has continued with agency care
agency care is not the answer i'm not aware why they say agency care because they have no experience of it
i think the family is being asked to accept something which they have no experience of unquote
she agreed however that if agency care was appropriate then sixty thousand pounds plus was the cost of that care
doctor the medical expert called on behalf of the defendant had discussed the question of future care in a visit he made to the plaintiff's UNK home in july this year
he had discussed with the pl parents in the presence of the plaintiff the care options
the conclusion was that quote anna jane was to be cared for primarily by her parents i am not saying UNK they wanted to be involved for as long as they were able to do
there was no UNK from anna jane unquote
he thought it was reasonable for them not to provide night care even now and essential for them to have a night UNK for seven nights a week from this time on
he thought it was also reasonable and sensible for any family involved in long term care to have additional assistance for particularly UNK and regular activities
he had in mind particularly the getting up of a patient in the morning the morning routine and also the going to bed at night
he felt that two hours in the morning and one hour at night was the appropriate assistance
he spoke of the research evidence of the few people who are gi who are given money for care taken up after the settlement of their cases and added his own experience
he said quite quote in my experience people who have access to or are offered this level of care even if it's even if it is started it is rarely continued for more than a few months
he said the explanation was UNK in two factors
first the socially UNK effect of various carers coming into the home and secondly the practical difficulties of ob of obtaining carers
he said quote if there are relatives available a care package does not normally work
somebody UNK to stop it because it is not satisfactory unquote
as to alternative sources of care he thought the better answer was the crossroads organisation rather than an nursing agency
he thought that the question of involvement with the patient was quote precisely what you do not get with the agency they meaning the agency are professionals taking a professional non involved approach
no staff do it short term or as an addition to their normal job
much more commitment comes through crossroads whose workers are UNK in the sense that they are not qualified but are expert carers
he said from experience that in using an agency it was extremely difficult to get even a small number of carers quote you know who is coming when they arrive through the door unquote
doctor made it clear that in comparing crossroads with a nursing agency he was not saying that UNK were any better than the agency but they were less expensive
the current rates were between two pounds sixty and three pounds ten pence an hour
i have already referred to the b n a rate the british nursing agency rate of four pounds and twelve pence without mark up
i found doctor an impressive witness
he had both academic and practical experience of the problems of which he was speaking
he was lecturer in clinical UNK at the university of oxford consultant at consultant in UNK disability at the UNK and the UNK centre oxford
he was responsible for twenty five to thirty in patients and thirty to forty out patients at UNK he was also responsible for a hundred and thirty patients attending UNK russell house oxford for relief care
i found his professional knowledge and experience for the management of patients severely disabled UNK upon head injury to be extremely valuable
i wish to state however that there were two areas in his evidence which i found myself totally unable to accept
first in his evidence he referred to a better solution as being quotes seeks a small residential setting with some other people unquote and went on to refer to the possibility of the plaintiff entering one of the UNK homes
in cross examination he accepted that there was no such reference in any report he had written in this case and agreed that quote i don't think i've discussed UNK homes before today unquote
mr also achieve UNK success in demonstrating that doctor knowledge of the recent medical and other expert reports in this case over the last two to three years were UNK
that he had only looked through mrs report on the day of his evidence and had taken five or ten minutes on mrs report
i take full account of these UNK in his evidence but overall i found his experience of the likely care UNK introduced in UNK in cases such as that of the plaintiff to be of assistance
i know have to give my conclusions to the resolution of that conflicting and often very massive evidence as to how the plaintiff's care routine will change when it will change and from where the carers will come
the starting point for these conclusions is the plaintiff's parents
i have nothing but the highest UNK for the quality and UNK of the work they have put into the care of the plaintiff over the last six and a half years
with the plaintiff's cooperation and the assistance of care they have seen to it that the plaintiff was not to be UNK and that she was to be brought back into a loving home and encouraged to be the thinking intelligent and lively person she still is
however i conclude that notwithstanding that the strain of all that they have done they at present leave them to feel that they will transfer their physical caring duties to paid helpers in the immediate future
that will not happen immediately or alternatively it will only happen for a short period of time
i conclude that they have done so much and so well they will find it hard to let go those duties
i conclude that after a short UNK which they have UNK deserved and when the full regime of paid helpers may be set up they will revert to taking an active part in the physical care of the plaintiff as well in the mental care in which they will have remained ever present
i consider they will accept the continued need for a night UNK for now on but that within a short period of UNK a full paid up carer regime they will revert to a regime which includes only one paid carer and will provide the further physical assistance between them
i find that will continue to be the position for the next ten years
i take as a second period the ten years thereafter until the parents are about their early seventies
i conclude that it will probably ne be necessary for there to be a regime dependent on paid carers
i conclude that such carers will either be obtained from the crossroads organisation or something similar or from private advertisement but not from a nursing agency
i take as the third period that which follows upon the death or UNK of the parents
it is UNK that it will be necessary to use the services of a nursing agency at this time because the evidence UNK me that the tasks of the advertising for interviewing and then appointing carers on a continuing basis will not be one which the plaintiff can carry out nor will her sister clare by then probably married with a family and perhaps living elsewhere be able to undertake such frequent duties
it follows that i must translate those conclusions into figures
the cost of care for the first ten years from now on was taken by mr on his calculations to amount to two hundred and thirteen thousand eight hundred and forty three pounds and ninety two pence using a multiplier of four and a UNK of fifty three thousand four hundred and sixty pounds and ninety eight pence
these figures are of course calculated on the nursing agency rates
i have already indicated why i consider these rates not to be appropriate at this stage
it follows that my calculations make allowance for two carers either both being paid workers or alternatively a combination of one worker and the joint efforts of the parents as a second as a second worker
for this care i award forty thousand pounds per year and take as a multiplier the figure three to give a sum of one hundred and twenty thousand for the first period
for the second period of ten years again i discount down the full agency rates totalling fifty nine thousand four hundred and twenty one pounds and ninety six pence year yearly to the sum of forty thousand pounds annually and to apply a multiplier of six producing the figure of two hundred and forty thousand pounds for the second period
for the third period that after the parents' death or UNK i do accept the UNK of employing a nursing agency and therefore on this occasion i do accept mr figure per year of sixty five thousand five hundred and thirty seven pounds and ninety six pence
i apply a multiplier of nine it follows that the figure i allow for this period is five hundred and thirty four thousand seven hundred and ninety seven pounds and sixty four pence and the total cost of future care is therefore eight hundred and ninety four thousand seven hundred and ninety seven pounds and sixty four pence
sub heading accommodation
it was agreed on all sides that the present home of the family is not appropriate for the plaintiff despite the extensive works which have necessarily been carried out to it
the cost of those alterations was forty two thousand seven hundred and eighty six pounds and eighty six pence of which the local authority paid about a quarter namely nine thousand eight hundred and forty seven pounds
the remainder of thirty two thousand nine hundred and thirty nine pounds and eighty six pence was covered by an interim payment by the defendants
argument has been addressed to me as to how that sum should fall to be represented in the damages awarded bearing in mind that it has been substantially discharged by an interim payment and that it will not UNK to any log term benefit of the plaintiff
suffice it to say that i find that had those alterations not been carried out when they were it would not have been possible for the plaintiff to be discharged from UNK park in may of nineteen ninety since her home would not have been suitable for her
it follows that the continuing heavy costs of care at UNK park would have gone on and would have been a proper claim against this defendant
again those alterations do not UNK increase the value of the parent's home it is not in any event their property
evidence has been put before me of the most unusual arrangement come to in relation to a possible ability of the parents to buy the property at half the sitting tenant valuation
the legal position in relation to the ag arrangement is uncertain since it is not expressed to provide it for in the will of mrs who is who is the very kindly elderly neighbour who is the landlord but is only contained in a letter of mrs from whom i have not heard in evidence
whether that intention of mrs will continue once this case is over and the plaintiff is awarded damages of the size involved here or whether an alternative beneficiary will be found cannot be certain
in all the circumstances i consider that the proper course is not to find if there's any windfall element of the plaintiff's parents and therefore to ignore such arguments
it follows that the cost of the alterations to the present home was a reasonable one to be born by the defendant and need not further be considered
it is therefore to the sum which is to be awarded in relation to the plaintiff's future accommodation that i now turn
it is and always has been common ground
the plaintiff will have to move as soon as possible to move suitable accommodation which will inevitably be a bungalow
however as with so many other things in this case the specification for that bungalow has changed as the case has developed
mr hugh of the UNK partnership in UNK was the architect who gave expert evidence on the subject
he having UNK in designing and building accommodation for disabled people and elderly people since nineteen sixty nine
he spoke of the UNK of the present accommodation and his report said that quote a minimum of five UNK bedrooms is required so it may be necessary to obtain a six bedroom property and this may be difficult to find
bedrooms are required for mr and mrs anna jane clare and two for her carers
there is only one possible option for re housing which should be considered and that is to purchase a three bedroomed bungalow and add an extension
end quote
it is clear that he was considering that extension would add two further bedrooms
mr then gave figures for that operation which UNK fifty three thousand six hundred and thirty eight pounds and fifty five pence
however as the evidence developed before him it became clear that it was not necessary for the carers to sleep overnight and thus plus they did not need bedrooms and therefore a four bedroomed bungalow with rooms for the plaintiff her parents the night UNK and one for clare or to be used as a spare room would be sufficient
a number of estate agents property particulars were produced in evidence none having any great relevance to the matter at issue and UNK collected at random when the claim related to a five or six bedroomed bungalow
credit was given in the claim to the cost of whatever property the plaintiff would have purchased in any event had the accident not happened
i accept a figure of sixty thousand pounds as representing the plaintiff's UNK house in such circumstances and a hundred and twenty thousand pounds as being the probably cost of the bungalow the plaintiff is to purchase
it follows that the difference that the subject of the claim is sixty thousand pounds
mr puts his claim for loss of interest on the extra capital employed using a multiplier of twenty at forty eight thousand two hundred and forty pounds
this is a claim based on a four percent interest rate not a two percent which would be used on the basis of and nineteen eighty eight three weekly report law reports one two four seven
mr justifies UNK the approach in and on the basis that the decision was arrived at in a different housing market when it was reasonable to conclude that the plaintiff's loss of interest on the capital employed would be exceeded by the increase in the value of the property
for my part while i accept the housing market has changed UNK since and was decided five years ago
i do not feel able to speculate as to whether or not it will recover sufficiently over the period in which we are dealing as to be again a and situation
i consider therefore despite mr arguments to the contrary that the proper rate of interest to take is two percent
the proper figure per annum is therefore twelve hundred pounds to which a multiplier of has to be applied making a total of twenty one thousand six hundred pounds
as to the cost of alterations the difference in sums suggest it is wide ranging
mr suggests the alterations needed to a four bedroomed bungalow will be minimal and allows only two thousand pounds for them
mr UNK only a very a few small items totalling just over three thousand pounds worth from the fifty three thousand six hundred and thirty eight pounds and fifty five pence sum claimed in mr report
to include the building an extension thereby arriving at a total of more than fifty thousand pounds
i find that the UNK basis for mr designing and building accommodation for disabled people and elderly is only one possible option for re housing that should be considered and that is to purchase a three bedroomed bungalow and add an extension quotes has gone from this case
it is no longer that i find that it is a four bedroomed bungalow which is required with bedrooms of sufficient size in the case of the plaintiff and the plaintiff's parents and that work of alteration er to the bungalow will be necessary along the lines of mr report but it will not involve the building of any extension
it follows that for the alterations to a four bedroomed bungalow to include any necessary UNK of a bathroom come to a figure which i allow of twenty five thousand pounds
the additional expenditure totalling seven thousand five hundred and three pounds claimed b one nine seven also includes those items which would be incurred with any move and other items which would be involved with UNK two extra rooms
accordingly i reduce that figure to five thousand pounds
i further allow additional property insurance for a four bedroomed house at fifty seven pounds and forty six pence annually with an eighteen year multiplier which gives the total sum of one thousand and thirty four pounds twenty eight pence
the sums i award under the heading of accommodation therefore amount in total to fifty two thousand six hundred and UNK thirty four pounds twenty eight pence
sub heading loss of future earnings
before her accident the plaintiff wanted to be a conference organiser and had intended to go into UNK management as a career
to that end she had a place at norwich city college to read for a b a in UNK management subject to achieving the right grades in her a levels and achieving o level maths or its equivalent
she had in fact taken one a level her law exam but only in fact achieved a d grade
so that had she been able to take her history exam she would have needed rather a good grade there perhaps a better grade than her past performance suggested she would have UNK
again her UNK o level was already a re sit and again it might have been beyond her at that stage
whilst recognising all her sporting and social successes i also have to recognise that she was not an academic high UNK
it is appropriate here that i quote from UNK in the report of the headmaster mr which was UNK to norwich city college
these UNK i have already referred to as being extremely indicative of the wonderful girl that anna jane was before her accident and i have been very much in mind in the earlier part of my judgement
it is convenient to deal with them here while we are dealing with the question of loss of future earnings
as to the plaintiff's academic record mr said this
UNK academic ability does not match her social skills which are outstanding she is expected to gain a grade e in history at a level with the possibility of a d in law
i pause to indicate those would not have been sufficient grades to get her place at norwich close quotations close brackets
she is currently re taking her UNK o level and hopes to obtain a grade c she is UNK in all her studies with a determination to do as well as possible while her powers of expression are adequate she has a fine sense of initiative and can organise her material UNK
in the next paragraph as to special UNK mr went on quote there is an outstanding ability to make others feel that she is especially interested in their welfare and to put them at their ease
she is able to UNK and UNK other students to undertake community welfare tasks and she shows qualities of leadership as well as the ability to work as one of a team close quotes
that assessment has only to be read to UNK to indicate what it UNK for future success in her chosen career
at the further confidential statement by mr runs to four pages er sorry i'm sorry runs to four paragraphs and because of the insight into the plaintiff before the accident i will read it in its entirety
quote anna is possibly the most socially competent member of a sixth form of more than two hundred students
unfortunately this is not matched by her academic ability
she can expect to obtain an e in history at a level possibly a d in law
she is re taking UNK o level in november and after private UNK is expected to gain a c grade
this is to tell only part of the story however anna is UNK in all her studies with a determination to do as well as possible while her powers of expression are adequate she has a fine sense of initiative and within her limitations can organise her materials UNK
in terms other than the academic anna is the ideal sixth former
she has played an active part in the sixth form committee UNK remarkable skills in organising and motivating others
she was an outstanding publicity manager for a recent school drama production UNK the support of local businesses as well as that of other students
she has applied to the UNK and UNK conference centre in the hopes of obtaining work experience in her chosen career before starting the course of training
anna UNK all she does with a UNK and delightful UNK
she has a most UNK character
throughout her school career anna has been involved in a UNK of sporting clubs participating as fully in organisation terms as she has as a UNK
having talked sensibly to anna about her chosen course of study i am certain she is aware of the demands it will make on her
she UNK she has also asked if her place could be deferred for a year so that she may gain as much relevant experience as possible before taking up the course
she has considered this most carefully and all her tutors are agreed she would suit the course UNK
we are confident in recommending her strongly to you
i say again that it is clear those qualities would have been UNK suited ideally suited to the career she wished to embark upon
as to what would have happened without the event of the accident in her a level year by way of results i regret i have to find as a fact that she would not in the year of her accident have achieved the grades necessary for her to take up a place at norwich city college
i UNK to add however that in my view that would not have UNK altered her ability to go on to get a qualification and succeed in her chosen career
i find that the qualifications she would have got was either the degree she hoped for or a higher national diploma for reasons which i shall now set out
the evidence of whether she would have taken up her place at norwich in autumn nineteen eighty seven or would have taken a year off and started in autumn nineteen eight is UNK
if anything it points as is indicated in the report i've just read to there being a year off
equally sums for loss of earnings in that year are claimed in the plaintiff's claim
on the balance of UNK therefore i find she would not have started her course until autumn nineteen eighty eight
thereby finishing her degree course in the summer of nineteen ninety two
i find on the balance of UNK that if she did not achieve the necessary results for entry to college in the summer of nineteen eighty seven she would have achieved such grades by using the year summer nineteen eighty seven to summer nineteen eighty eight to re site whatever was necessary
i'm satisfied that with her UNK and the loving encouragement of her parents she would by then have achieved the necessary entrance qualifications
it follows that even by she would again have finished her degree in the summer of nineteen ninety two
if i'm wrong as to that there was also open to her a further route to a degree qualification
that was to start a h n d course in the autumn of nineteen eighty seven completing the two years in the summer of nineteen eighty nine
the evidence was that it was then possible to change from the h n d course to start the second year of the graduate course in what had been autumn nineteen eighty nine
that route to a b a in UNK and match UNK management would have again ended with her UNK in the summer of nineteen ninety two
i am satisfied that whichever route she followed the plaintiff had sufficient intelligence personality and drive to achieve the degree she wanted by the summer of nineteen ninety two
her career after UNK was the subject of expert evidence given by mr for the plaintiffs
his qualifications were impressive and his evidence persuasive
i accept the level of UNK of which he spoke as being likely in the case of the plaintiff's career and i accept the sums which he spoke of as her potential earnings
no contrary evidence was called although mr evidence was clearly tested in cross examination
as at today's date she was at the age of twenty as she i as at today's date she at the age of twenty four would have had a further working life of thirty six years
i note that there is in train a proposal to change legislation to provide for a later retirement date for females to UNK with those of the males
that is not a matter that i can take into consideration other than to say that i am satisfied that the proper figure for a multiplier for working life er which i shall take in this case is the multiplier of sixteen UNK for by mr
i take that multiplier and divide it into separate periods of one three and twelve respectively
from mr evidence i assessed her net year earnings up to her fourth year as nine thousand pounds and with a multiplier of one award that sum
for the years from the fourth to the tenth i assess her net earnings at twelve thousand three hundred pounds and award the sum of thirty six thousand nine hundred pounds on a multiplier of three
for the third period in general management for the rest of her working life i assess her annual salary at fifteen thousand nine hundred pounds net to which i apply a multiplier of twelve to reach the figure of one hundred and ninety thousand eight hundred pounds
the total sum awarded for loss of future earnings is therefore two hundred and thirty six thousand seven hundred pounds
to that sum must be added under a different heading of damages past loss of earnings for the period when she would have entered the catering industry
namely some time in the summer or autumn of nineteen ninety two until today's date in december nineteen ninety three
i accept from mr that she would have been a trainee manager for some part of that time and i assess her salary as being something like seven thousand pounds net
i consider that she would have found a job by early autumn and therefore the sum must be more than a nearly a year's earnings and i assess it at eight thousand pounds
i do not make any award for the sums claimed from UNK income for her employment during the said the alleged year off since i'm not satisfied she would have had a year off or would have had any UNK income even if she had taken that year
again i do not feel she would have had any UNK income from her grant at college or part time earnings
the total sum awarded in relation to future loss of earnings is therefore two hundred and thirty six thousand seven hundred pounds and that for past loss of earnings is eight thousand pounds making a total of forty four thousand seven hundred pounds
sub heading transport
it is accepted that the plaintiff has a need for a new vehicle to accommodate her and her wheelchair and to replace the parent's UNK
it is also accepted that the nissan UNK is a suitable vehicle for the plaintiff's needs
there is a dispute as to whether the cost of air conditioning on that vehicle is property UNK but i hold that in view of the plaintiff's physical needs as to temperature air conditioning is reasonably necessary
the cost of the nissan UNK is agreed at twenty two thousand six hundred and eight five
mr claims for a five year replacement cycle but i consider the vehicle is likely to have a lower mileage than is usual and that the replacement cycle should be one of eight years
i apply the a schedule of UNK costs b one eight one for an engine capacity of two thousand and one to three thousand c of three thousand two hundred and eighty eight pounds and eighty eight pence and subtract from that figure the corresponding figure for an engine capacity of one thousand and one to fourteen hundred c namely one thousand two hundred and fifty three pounds and thirteen pence for the vehicle i find that she would otherwise have run
was genuine he added at this time that er the further information was that the occupants of the flat at were frightened of
h he had what did he say
he thought they were frightened or the UNK or what
er my lord the added bit of information that was that erm was then passed to me was that when the man rang the police station the information that he gave to the UNK included the fact that the occupants of the flat were frightened
right
said he went to the police station but it follows that you were at home which
i was at home er up until that point
were you on duty at home or off duty at home
i was off duty but on call
on making those further enquiries you've just told us about at the police station
did you er were you satisfied the operation should continue as discussed with assistant chief officer
i also met the police station er sergeant and after discussing further the matters with him erm then i was happy an armed operation was er was necessary
superintendent if any other information had come to light over the next few hours would you have UNK the matter
depending on the information yes erm
so without really putting it more UNK er was there always the option to call this off
there was always the option to call this off er to the very last moment when erm i gave the order for the officers to go in
was there at some time then a briefing for the officers who were going to go into the flat
yes it was five fifteen a m of the following morning at
who conducted the briefing
sergeant mainly er gave the briefing and after going through the UNK of giving er the officers the UNK the information that had been received er our intention erm a method by which we going to follow this through erm and other information such as radio call signs
erm i then asked er additional questions to see what the up to the minute information was at that time
at that meeting were you satisfied the operation should continue
yes i was erm the additional information that was available to me at this time er sergeant the er having left me the previous night er had actually had gone to the premises erm gone to the flats erm and had er put himself in the area of the flat and was able to tell me that he had heard voices two male voices coming from within the flat
did you yourself take part in the operation to go in with the guns
in other words did you the flat
er no er that only armed officers actually erm would go into the flat
so you were not
what was your role during the search
i was the commander and er i was erm in a control vehicle a police vehicle er was parked nearby to the flat
and what is that vehicle called is it only
well it is the it's the control vehicle er which contains myself and my tactical advisor er sergeant
yes
and we were in radio contact with the firearms team
the same consideration given superintendent to the question of medical facilities
yes we were actually erm the position of the control vehicle was erm in front of an ambulance that we had asked to be there and the crew were briefed as to what we were doing and what injuries possibly could arise
did you for the operation
i did so yes
do you remember the approximate time of that
i think it was about six a m
and did you in due course go to the flat
yes i did
when did you go to the flat
er it was a short time after having given the order for the officers to enter the flat erm maybe three or four minutes after that erm having received the information that the flat was secure it was safe to enter er i then went up to the flat
did sergeant UNK you to the flat
no he did not
sergeant
yes
on arriving at the flat did you speak to mr
yes er it would be more accurate to say he spoke to me
he was very UNK and he was angry erm he was shouting at me er that he'd been UNK naked er on the floor guns had been pointed at him and his front door had been smashed down and his er his family his wife and children had been frightened
UNK there superintendent
when you first saw mr was he wearing anything upon the lower part of his body
he had his trousers on
was he still UNK or were the UNK off
he was not UNK
did you say anything to him
yes i did er i sh i won't say the exact words but they were words to the effect that er that i was sorry that i understood and appreciated that er erm his family would have been terrified by the experience
erm that we had no alternative to do what we did er that c i d officers would speak to him and i believe that he would better understand er wh why we have done what we did er and i assured him that the damage to his door will would be repaired
did you speak to er mrs at all
i did not no
how long had you been in the police force
er thirty two years
so could you
when you rang what did you know about the occupiers of the flat
that is how many there were and who they were
i knew that er mr er lived there and probably his wife er maybe nothing more
sorry but maybe nothing more
did you know any more or didn't you know any more
well i i've answered that way sir cos i can't be sure
well let me put it plainly did you or did you not know that there were two children or three children indeed in that flat
i at no time erm until after the incident knew that
did you make any enquiries and if so what enquiries to try to find out who the occupiers
only from a record that would have been available at the police station or from officers knowledge
well what did those enquiries reveal
that mr er did live at the flat erm with his wife there may have been children but we didn't know for certain and that the previous night two male persons appeared to have been there
so when assistant chief constable told the jury yesterday i would have discussed the question of who were the occupiers before giving my authority that was do you remember that
that was presumably then that we think lawrence was there it's flat we think his wife's there
there may be children
that
if i think that yes
now this sort of er i don't want to use the word raid
this sort of operation needs to be authorised and doesn't it
not just the UNK of the officers that needs one authorisation but on UNK entry needs another authorisation doesn't it
erm no sir
so you made the decision that there'd be a UNK entry to this flat is that right
yes sir
at six in the morning
yes sir
but you say that decision and the reasons for it were never er and the authority for it the reasons for it were never reduced to
er the only authority that was given was the authority to arm the officers by mr which he would have put in to writing er he was aware as to the method of entry to the of the flat but that no authority no written authority was given for that
what my solicitors finding from a letter let me tell you why i ask
there was a police complaints authority investigation into all of this
that is correct
the letter which has just been found refers to something like called a police operational order UNK the raid saying that had disappeared by the time the police complaints authority started looking for it
have you any idea what that refers to
yes i have er it would refer to the operational order
erm the it refers to an operational order er an operational order is not a document that actually UNK police officers to do something
it sets out erm what the information is er what the intention is the method that we would follow er any communications any administration
it's a it's a briefing document so that er all those involved are that all those that are involved on the operation erm are as well informed as is possible
erm i'm at a lost on this
you're being asked erm you told us you rang up the assistant chief constable who gave you the authority to carry out the armed operation
yes my lord
now at that stage you were doing it on the telephone were you
that's correct my lord
so you didn't have a letter there and then and asked something about was it put into writing
no er
well that sorry i i've lost it so let's
a mr yesterday he was just UNK the use of firearms and he said that was put into writing and we've got that form but that only UNK the issue of firearms er the UNK the UNK and the carrying out of the raid isn't covered by that document
it's covered by the document this officer's
and when does the authority to issue the firearms when's that signed
er it was er well it said i think
lord would it help if the issue of firearms authorisation which was signed by assistant chief constable
i really wanted to know when it was done
the verbal UNK authorisation was given at seven fifty p m on the fourth of december and there was a subsequent tactical the tactical advisor sergeant spoke to the assistant chief constable at eight fifteen
both those times are recorded i've got copies for the jury
but i'm i i'm not sure what relevance it is i mean is this some procedure that it's got to be reduced into writing
my lord if i can help
i think what point is being made is er albeit from assistance from should have been referred is that an operation will always have been drawn up
it's a very simple matter and it there's no so even if the jury are about to hear it from the witness
which like the UNK order in effect
it just sets out the information with any further suggestions
sergeant will give evidence as to why he supported it afterwards
there's no legal
no right then the we know this er isn't an issue that the assistant chief constable said you can go ahead with this operation
well i i'm not sure what document is now being referred to
some document that erm was produced and lost at some point or
my lord i think the case is being made if i may say so sir to give the jury the impression that the police just document
the police destroyed the document in question they'll tell you why they have destroyed it
there was here some enquiry and the that enquiry as a matter of public policy i understand the documents aren't to be available even if they assist the police or if they assist the other side
but my lord
it's simply something that we're all bound by
my lord yes
yes well then i'm not sure wh what is this document mr
as er the officer was saying it's a briefing document prepared before the raid therefore of course it's not covered by public interest immunity
the reason i'm in it is that document as the officer says sets out the information given as the offer as the officer put it
that is the information on which the police were acting when they decided it was reasonable to take this action
right
i just wanted to know what that information was that's all
but if the document doesn't exist it doesn't exist unless you can remember what the information was on that document but i would imagine
only that it would have contained the information er as i've detailed already
now would you i think it must be right that you were at the at five fifteen in the morning conducted by sergeant
yes sir
broadly were the policemen being told they were dealing with a UNK situation or a UNK situation
i'm not actually sure that either er was mentioned erm what they would have been told er was that there was an escaped prisoner there er who was armed and our intention was to arrest him
now i do not actually recall er us going into detail about the UNK er and i certainly don't recall erm that we were talking about a UNK situation
well it's just that it's the chief UNK case that when er sorry when was got from his bed he was told that he was being arrested for UNK and UNK lawrence
have you any idea which ever officer said that formed the impression that it was a UNK situation
no er that is a matter for the officer er to answer
the only other thing is this
the armed police went into the flat and you and sergeant stayed in the control vehicle
yes sir
some time subsequently you yourself went to the flat
yes sir
did any other police officers go into the flat in to your knowledge go into the flat in that interval
i mean after the armed police officers but before you
it's quick like quite likely that c i d officers almost certainly c i d officers would have gone before me
so when mr said that the firearms office majority of language when the firearms officer said wait for the c i d and then some other policemen arrived and then you that may well be right because from what you say it may well be that the c i d did get to the flat after the officers but before
that's right
great
my lord i have no real examination to do does your lordship have any questions
er and where would the se
you were in a car the control car
yes my lord
how far away from the flat
initially probably about er three hundred yards er in a in a side junction erm but as once the ins once the operation had commenced erm we moved up onto the car park actually on below the flats
and erm where were the c i d officers whilst the armed officers went in
i'm not actually sure erm
well would they be close at hand
they would have been close at hand my lord erm i just don't know it may be that i think they were probably in a vehicle also close at hand ready to
yes
yes thank you erm mr
my lord i call er sergeant
take the book in your hand and repeat after
i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth
shall be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
thank you
sergeant tell where you currently live
i live in er a UNK of in spain my lord
and er retired from the police force now
i have yes
i thought it was exclusively terrible criminals that live in that part of the world
perhaps i've been watching too much television yes
wh when did you retire sergeant
i retired in er september last year nineteen ninety two
and in december of nineteen eighty eight er what was your rank and where were you UNK
i was a sergeant at er police headquarters and my duties amongst er others was as a senior tactical advisor for the police force on firearms matters
my lord first of all can i just ask whether you could tell the jury something about the training of firearms officers
yes
initially er all firearms officers by the nature of the duties are volunteers
they receive no extra remuneration whatsoever for their duties although at some times of course it can be quite dangerous
er applications are accepted from all officers who have completed a two year period of probation and no applications are considered whilst an officer is in his probation
first and foremost erm there is an assessment of those officers by their immediate supervisors and er a then UNK whereby er suitable officers are s selected to come for a two day assessment at er police headquarters
just UNK there i think it will become relevant
what is the purpose of that assessment by the police
the assessment by the police is to eliminate erm any officer that er has UNK or er on the other side of the coin to eliminate those officers that erm might be so UNK that they wouldn't be able to perform the duties should it be necessary for them to fire a weapon
you eliminate those who are too UNK or those you think are too aggressive
precisely my lord
so mr it would perhaps be right to think then that you're looking for cover for the firearms unit
certainly not no certainly not
and after they've that psychological assessment
is there any other assessment of their capabilities
yes er a physical assessment er takes place they're given er a medical eyesight hearing tests and going on from that er a one day assessment in the actual use of firearms takes place before they are actually selected to er attend a preliminary course of two weeks UNK
and what does the preliminary two week course involve
it involves all aspects of erm the law in relation to firearms their issue their use er great emphasis placed on er section three of the criminal law act in respect of the use of reasonable force
their actual ability to fire a weapon a hand gun in this case
their ability to react to given situations using slide and a film UNK images and er a written examination at the er end of it plus a full UNK shoot whereby they have to reach a certain standard erm of ability in order to er pass the two week course
mr i assume it's are they free to go out and use firearms
no erm they are then authorised and issued with an authorisation card following the successful completion of the course to carry a firearm on police duties if required er the authorisation is issued by either the chief constable or er his deputy and that would enable the officer if required to go an UNK at one of the police stations and produce his card and be issued with a weapon if necessary
that card er contains information er regarding er the law and er instructions to the officer in addition each officer receives er a set amount of training per month
at the time of this incident the incident was carried out by a group of officers who were called the operational support unit
those officers were especially selected from erm the firearms officers we had available at that time and they were responsible for all firearms operations within the county
they've trained in addition to the once a month or even twice a month they've trained whenever their duties allowed
mr in december nineteen eighty eight how long had you been a firearms officer or tactical advisor
i an authorised officer in nineteen sixty eight so it'd have been twenty years and er from there i became er an UNK in nineteen eighty four er having successfully completed a number of national run courses on firearms tactics at the national school of firearms er which are in the metropolitan district and er lancashire and west yorkshire
and just finally on the mr are you able to put an approximate number er figure to the number of such operations you've been involved in
hundreds
could you tell us what your role was in the operation to go into
yes er my role was the tactical advisor on this operation and in doing that
what were the name what does tactical advisor mean
it meant because of my experience and my knowledge i was erm able to advise the superintendent in charge mr on the various options that were available to him and also erm advise him whether he was considering other options whether they would be safe or otherwise
do you remember at what time you were contacted approximately
i think about eight o'clock in the evening at home
did you then go to
yes i did
and did you go to the planning question at all before the operation
yes i did
and when was that
i recollect about half past ten that evening on the fourth
and er what was in the flat
it wasn't my intention originally to go to the flat it was my intention to UNK the area in order that i could supply the officers who were going to do the actual operation with up to date information as to erm the methods of getting in to the block of flats because they had a coded key door erm and to UNK myself of the actual physical erm presence of UNK and that sort of thing
as it was er quite late on a sunday evening i did in fact take the opportunity to listen at the door of the flat in question
and what did you hear anything
yes i heard two men speaking and the possibility of either another man or a woman also in the premises
and as a result of that UNK where did you then go
i then returned back to the er police station where i commenced to write the operational order in respect of the incident
and is the operational order er the document that is being referred to be the plaintiff's council
yes it is
and what would you put in that document
the document is basically a briefing document in order that every piece of information erm that is available to the police is then able to be passed on to the officers who are actually going to do the job
so they are fully aware of the implications and er fully aware of exactly what is required of them
sergeant before i take you on to deal with the briefing itself i just want to go back and ask you one thing
the jury twenty years in time and with the information you had from superintendent did you consider that instead of mounting a an operation like that you should simply UNK the flat or be with
did you consider that
yes it was considered
er in fact it was put to me as an option by superintendent that this could be if this could be done er at the time er if i recall one of the reasons erm that we weren't able to do it in such a way was that there are numerous UNK to the block of flats and each exit would have had to be covered by at least two armed officers we only had in the region of twenty five officers available to us at that time in the police who were authorised to be armed and to maintain such a UNK erm not only would be very costly in the terms of the number of officers
there would have to be changes of shifts er and the likelihood that the operation to erm the UNK operation would be UNK as a result
how long do firearms officers spend on such a UNK shift
the minimum amount of time that is necessary er in an operation such as this when the operation is finished the officers are then allowed to go home that's the end of their shift because erm there's a great deal of UNK flows on an operation like this
on a UNK operation we are looking at i wouldn't like to see an officer who is armed more than six hours in that position
his ability to a function as a UNK office and b to function as a armed officer after being maybe in the er in a vehicle for that length of time er is both dangerous to the public and dangerous to him
yes there are four UNK and UNK to this block of flats with two officers on each entrance that's eight officers to start with
presumably you have a command post
yes
so that's within six hours you would have worked your way through more than half of your compliment of armed officers
correct
that's ignoring sickness holiday and everything else
yes
and do we understand from your reference that it's your policy that armed officers should do that job and then get home get out of the way and relax a bit
yes that is correct erm in my experience er both being erm on armed incidents er the UNK flow is tremendous the officers are erm concentrating one hundred and fifty percent on their task in hand and it is very UNK work
it's a constant threat of danger and after UNK which takes place in the police station erm relaxation is necessary erm we have the availability of er stress counselling as well and a period of about two hours normally UNK before the officers is er reasonably able to er function as a normal police officer again and because of this er it has been decided that the officer's duties for that day er will be UNK
they're not like junior house doctors who do a ninety two hour week just work until they drop
they often do ninety two hours a week but erm wouldn't do ninety two hours a week on an operation certainly not
well let's move on now to try to the briefing
did you conduct the briefing
yes in conjunction with superintendent
and when did you conduct it
er the briefing was held at er the briefing room at five fifteen a m on the
and who selected the officers for the operation
the officers for the operation were selected by their commander erm the inspector in charge of the operational support unit
i would ask him on authorisation from er the assistant chief constable i would ask him for a number of officers
and how many did you ask for in this case
six armed officers but i would also require other members of the operational support unit to support those officers in a non armed role
yes and at the briefing just tell us first of all what you said about the objective of the operation
the objective of the operation was to arrest mr with the UNK that it was to be done with the safety of the public to be UNK and that the safety of the police officers and mr was also to be considered
but the main objective was to search the house to see if mr was there
on a briefing for an operation do you have to give further recommendation to advise on instructions about the use of guns or is that part and parcel of training
no er at er briefing officers are again reminded of their responsibilities within the law as to reasonable force and even when the officer issuing firearms which is not myself er an officer of inspector rank issues the firearms er arms to the individual officers they are again reminded of their responsibilities within the criminal law
were the officers to be equipped with UNK
yes
and would the UNK be used once they were in the flat
that would be a decision of the officer in charge of the actual operation erm that was actually going into the flat but it was normal practice that UNK would be switched off
and who was who was the officer who would lead them into the flat
the officer erm lead them into the flat was sergeant
sergeant
have you ever worked with sergeant before
yes i have
do you have confidence in him to conduct this operation
yes i did
what was the decision as to how you would physically enter the flat
the police force at that time were in possession of what is known as an automatic door opener
this piece of er equipment was er purchased some short time before in order that er we could enter heavily secured doors er with a minimum amount of noise in order to er gain entry to premises where there was a possible armed incident taking place or a possible UNK situation
do we understand from that you wish to gain entry without UNK the occupants
that is the intention yes
and does that have a bearing on the time that you conduct such operations
it is a medical fact that the body is at its lowest UNK between three and six in the morning and the ability to react the ability to think when one is being UNK up in the early hours of the morning erm are a consideration that we take into account when we have to mount an operation inside a premises
er if the person er is sitting watching the television and er has been awake for several hours then we are at a disadvantage
in addition to the firearms that tell us about and the door opener was any other equipment issued to the officers
yes the officers excuse me the officers would be issued with a UNK shield this is a piece of equipment that is erm bullet proof to certain weapons and enables officers to er enter rooms er through UNK safely even if shots are fired towards them from inside the room
and could you just briefly describe the er the dimensions and the look of that
it's about six feet in height and just about shoulder width er it's coloured black and it has a bullet proof glass window of about six inches by four inches which enables the er officer behind the shield to manoeuvre it in the correct position
do firearms officers have any training in first aid
yes all firearms officers are trained first UNK and er carry st UNK ambulance certificates
is there anything about the preparation of this operation that caused you to UNK
no none at all
after you conducted the briefing where did you go
i went with er superintendent to er where we UNK ourselves in a control vehicle and er i remained there until i heard from the firearms team inside the house that all occupants of the house had been found and were secured
mr it's been suggested from my plaintiff that it took ten to fifteen minutes to enter and secure the flat by the firearms officers
do you have any observation on that time scale
i would say from the point where i was told on the radio that the officers were entering the premises to the point where i was told everybody was secured could not be more than four five minutes
that was my recollection
mr thank you very much if you wait there
yes it only took four or five minutes until you were told the occupants were secure but then it er everybody waited for the c i d to arrive
do you do you know how long that took
c i d were actually backed in the building
they weren't in the actual flat at that time er their role was to er prevent members of the public whilst the armed officers were at the scene erm from entering the corridors at either end of the block of flats
did you go to the flat with er i do apologise mr when he went
i did i did go to the er the flat shortly after mr
i didn't go inside the premises i just er went there to remove er the er automatic door opener
and how long had UNK between the armed officers going in and mr leaving flats
no more than five minutes i would say
so that was almost UNK with the message
yes er erm my instructions are that all persons are accounted for in the premises and er once they've been accounted for er then it was safe for other officers i e the c i d or superintendent to go to that yes and they would not have been allowed in had i not received instructions that the house was secure and all persons accounted for
just briefly as i asked mr were you saying UNK situation or are you saying UNK situation or are you saying neither
they were considered both of them considered both of them considered erm but it is my recollection that erm been the UNK that mr had made the telephone calls himself
that might have been an UNK i don't it seems it was there it was it was said by somebody er as a matter of course or whatever and it might well have been that erm certainly it would have been mentioned at the briefing that there was er a woman in the house mrs possibly and the likelihood of children er was possibly also mentioned but there was no definite intelligence as to er the having any children
yes but you'd been to the flat at about ten thirty in the evening before was there anything you heard or seen at the flat to indicate it might be a UNK situation
no
the only other relates to that visit to the flat
it wasn't suggested to mr when he gave evidence that there was another man at the flat that night i am told that if it had been his answer would have been an UNK no
isn't it possible that you UNK the two or possibly three voices you heard for in fact mr and mrs and
there is that possibility but as i was aware
believed to the t v
no there was UNK there were definitely er voices that were er there and there not erm voices from the television
my lord i have no re examination
does your lordship have any questions
no
well convenient time to take lunch
yes members of the jury we will resume at two o'clock erm because i have other duties later on this afternoon we'll have to finish at four o'clock today it may help you to know that it may help council to know that as well
my lord i call sergeant
just erm before you do and so that we can all follow where we're getting to erm what witnesses are you going to call
then we know we shall know how we're getting on
my lord yes er there's just we're now dealing with the officers that went into the flat and conducted the operation and then there's one w p c who comes after that to give some evidence but then that's it
i see so we've got the five officers who went into the flat now coming one after the other
my lord yes
plus the w p c
my lord yes if i could there was a fifth officer that erm had authorised nothing and wasn't
no it's alright i just thought it helps me and the jury to know what where we are in the evidence
good
take the book
thank you
i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth
shall be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
now could you give your current name rank and station
sure er it's john currently a police sergeant stationed at
and in december of nineteen eighty eight what was your rank in your job
er in december nineteen eighty eight er i was a police constable i was stationed at i was er a firearms UNK in the operations department and also a tactical advisor
and when did you first become a firearms officer
er i first commenced training er as a firearms officer in nineteen eighty
and when did you become a tactical advisor
in nineteen eighty eight having er attended all of the national courses
now if you if there's a firearms officer a full time job or are there other ordinary police duties as well as
at the time er when i was a firearms UNK er that was the job that i did every day i went to work either firearms training or firearms operations
and er mr have you ever had to shoot a suspect
no i haven't no
now were you involved in an operation to enter and search the flat known as in december of eighty eight
yes that is correct
and were your involvement the decision to carry out the search or was your involvement the operational search
it was the actual operation that i was involved in
and when did you first become involved in the operation
i would have gone to police headquarters that morning around about four a m and er from there onwards to where the briefing was
sergeant carried out the briefing
he did yes that's correct
and were you issued with a weapon
yes i was
a and what sort of weapon
a revolver smith and UNK revolver
are you familiar with that sort of gun
yes i am
and UNK how would you carry that gun about your person
prior to and immediately after the operation the weapon would be UNK erm and secured by means of a strap across er the hammer of the weapon
is there any way the gun could then go off in that
no not at all no it's a safety feature
what was your role to be in this operation
technically i was er the team leader of the operation er and therefore in charge of the actual execution
have you been a team leader before
yes i have yes
are there any rules about pointing guns loaded guns at people
yes there are certain considerations that obviously we take er we take into effect
and what are they
well obviously the fact that we er are carrying a firearm and that firearm is loaded erm has to be borne in mind at all times
without over UNK the fact that firearm coupled with myself could easily kill somebody so we have to make sure that every single time we draw the weapon er there is a need there is a justification for it er and as soon as that need and justification stops so would we put the weapon away
do er firearms officers carry any special firearms card
yes we do yes
do you have the card with you
yes i have
the card that we're issued with
mr we will show the jury in just a moment but could you just tell us first of all what the card says in general terms
yes sure the card itself er is authorisation that is signed by er an officer of at least the rank of assistant chief constable and er it's a firearms authorisation that enables us or as an individual to be issued with a firearm that is named on this card er for that particular type of weapon er if we go to a firearms operation
and is there anything else on the er the rear of the card
yes sure on the rear er if i could read it out
certainly
please read the notes below carefully
the law section three of the criminal law act nineteen sixty seven reads a person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime or in UNK or UNK in the UNK arrest of offenders or UNK offenders or of persons UNK at large
and then it goes on a strict reminder
a firearm is to be used only as a last resort
other methods must have been tried and failed or must because of the circumstances be unlikely to succeed if tried
for example
a firearm may be used when it is apparent that the police cannot achieve their UNK purpose of preventing loss or further loss of life by any other means
wherever UNK an oral warning is to be used before a firearm is used
and lastly we to individual responsibility
the responsibility for the use of the firearm is an individual decision which may have to be justified in legal proceedings
remember the law and remember your training
yes and er mr do firearms officers carry such a document all the time
yes we do yes
lord i wonder whether the jury could er look at that or whether it would be more convenient for them to look at it later
they can look at it now get it out of the way
er i i'm not quite sure of the relevance of this
it shows that this officer was authorised to carry a gun and erm that's not in dispute
my lord
it it's not the sort of thing when the gas man calls that the man is being having a gun pointed at him he says wait a minute can i see your card please
no my lord the idea was simply to show the jury that the police are a reminder
oh yes right please
yes well there we are
have a look at it members of the jury it's part of the part of the history as it were
mr again about guns what is the your general policy on and dealing with guns in the presence of children
well we would never point a firearm at a child erm there would be no cause to no need to
and in your mind at the time mr what was the object of the operation
the object of the operation really was to obviously UNK er because at that time we believed that he was er a danger to the public and other people
yes
yes does anyone want to saying anything about the card
er yes sir it does not seem to have a photograph of the officer who it just has his name
i was just wondering should it not have a photograph
yes certainly
no certainly no i well what about it
er yes my lord er in conjunction with the card er we have a warrant card which is individually issued to er a respective officer with his name his rank er and also a photograph
now that's the one the public can and ought to ask to see
that that's correct yes
when you knock at the door at night you make sure a policeman and not something else
that is correct my lord yes i have that
so got a special pass because you're a firearms officer which is essentially deals with your authorisation to have a gun and reminds you of the law
that is correct
but also because you're a police officer as well you've got the usual warrant card
that that's correct yes
it carries your photograph
yes
and it's the sort of the card the jury may well have seen on television in UNK
well er as i observe the authorisation card is of general interest to us but it's not the sort of thing you're going to produce to a member of the public
no it's certainly not my lord no
it's really a record simply that you have been given the authority
that is correct my lord yes
and it would it be fair to say mr that it is a form of control within the police force
of course yes
and when you actually go and draw the arms do you produce your card then
yes i do my lord yes
yes i see well thank you
thanks very much
mr in due course did you go to the flat
i did indeed yes
and can you tell the jury exactly what time did you arrive at the flat
we would UNK have arrived at the block of flats prior to six o'clock but not many minutes prior to and then from there er we made our way up to that floor by the stairs as opposed to the lift
and how many officers were to go into the flat
six of us in total
and had you decided in advance where you would go once you got in
yes we had yes
that was part of the briefing
and who took that decision
the decision to exactly where we were going and was taken a joint decision by sergeant and myself
a and before we go into what happened once got in the flat just tell us now who was to go where in the first instance
the officers involved in the actual armed execution o of the operation
p c would have been the first man into the flat and he was carrying the shield that has been mentioned earlier
the second person into the flat and immediately very close behind to p c was myself and the third person into the flat would have been p c
was he carrying a shield
he was carrying a shield as well
the fourth person would have been p c the fifth person p c and the last person forming part of the firearms team er would have been p c
er and put us out of our er how many UNK did you take into that flat
into the flat itself two
are you sure you didn't take three or four or five
i have to say that i know for definite that the force at that time only UNK two UNK er we kept one shield in the south of the county at and one shield north of the county and hence that is why i went to the headquarters in the morning
and again before we come on to the entry
i'd like to ask you what you were wearing
every single officer involved in that operation from an armed point of view er was wearing a UNK with a silver badge on the front of the black UNK
would you have do you have a UNK like that
i do
could you please get
sure
right this is my er the original UNK but this is a UNK that every single officer would have been wearing on his head and then er in relation to the actual uniform that the officer would be wearing er we wear UNK
they're all identical all the same and hence erm that'd be the kit we were wearing there
thank you
and then lastly over the top of that UNK er we would wear our UNK and this is identical to the UNK that we would have worn that day
erm my lo my lord again if the jury wish to in due course
mr how did you gain entry to the flat
a er one of the officers er used a door opener which is
which officer was that
er p c er used the door opener which is a UNK system er it's a jack type principal that when activated er forces the frame apart at the side but at the same time should UNK pressure onto the door and then er knock should knock it in very quickly
and w would that be the talk about the door but once you had the door off
yes
who went into the flat first
well you say it should open it very quickly what happened on this occasion
er my lord i'm afraid it didn't
erm
can you tell
it was a good it was a good question in that case
yes tell the jury then tell the jury what happened with the door opener
er yes the door opener in fact was put on wrongly erm by unfortunately p c and er as the pressure started to UNK erm it then found that there was no resistance and consequently all the pressure was being put UNK er and as such then the machine started to make a noise erm which then we had to switch it off turn it round back on again and eventually gained access
mr how much time did you lose by having to switch the machine round
whilst at the time it seemed an eternity it was literally seconds er very quickly because we were aware of the noise that at that time in the morning seemed to be er UNK everywhere
and do you erm thought it at least very possible that there was someone with a gun the other side of the door
that is correct my lord definitely
yes
just before i deal with how you get in just tell the jury what is your a approach in terms of the timing of the events
once you'd got access what do you do
we have to work as quickly and as safely as we possibly can and we can't afford to spend five minutes er searching a house let alone a flat
we have to get in as quickly and as quietly a we possibly can and then once in try and secure the place from any possible threat that might be in there
let's take it from the point where you have essentially broke the door down
who went in first
p c
he's with the shield
yes that's correct yes
and who followed him
i did
and what was your position in relation to him
er immediately at very close behind him
to such a degree that i had hold of p c
and it i'm sure the jury would get the it's rather an obvious question but why is that
that's because hopefully the UNK shield will give us a certain amount of er bullet proof cover and if i can get as close behind that shield er as i possibly can it it's got to be safer from my point of view and from p c point of view
where did p c and you go
we moved er straight along the corridor to the rear main bedroom
now to what extent did you know the layout inside
my lord at the briefing that we attended er there was a sketch plan drawn up on the er the dry wipe board in the briefing room
not to the degree of er detail that is on the map but a rough idea of what we be UNK
which room you were aiming for
yes definitely yes
i appreciate mr it's now five years ago but how long did it take from when the door went down to you getting to the main bedroom
seconds two or three seconds
a and then what did either you or p c do
er p c opened the bedroom door he i can't recall which way the door opened whether it was to the left or to the right but er p c knocked the door back erm flat against the wall
just UNK pause a moment it why did he do that
er it's something that we're trained in to ensure that there is nobody hiding behind the door
if we only opened a door partly er there is room for somebody to hide behind it and then when we go into the room then we would encounter problems
he UNK the door open
that is correct
and how far did he go into the room at all
to begin with there was a pause at the door but a pause of perhaps i don't know one or two seconds at the most
just to quickly assess that we weren't going forward to erm a horrible situation where er one of us or somebody else is going to be injured so there would have been a very quick check to see who or what was in the room
and ha by this time had you or p c said anything
no not until the until we opened the door gave that quick check and then i saw a figure or figures in the bed
er and when you saw the figure or figures did you say anything then
yes i did yes
what did you say
i said armed police put your hands up
a and did you say it in the voice you've just used now to me
no er certainly not er i shouted my lord
did you shout very loud
very loud yes
a and again but why did you shout armed police was there any particular reason for using those
well firstly we need to it it's part of our training
every single operation we go on whether we are in uniform or in plain clothes er and we are carrying a firearm we need to identify ourselves as police officers
because if we don't we then run the risk of being injured ourselves erm somebody UNK that they didn't realise they were police officers and therefore shot at us because they thought we were UNK their territory or something
did you upset him
definitely yes
mr is it possible that in fact the on this occasion you forgot to shout armed police
no i know that is definitely not the case
as you shouted armed police where were your hands
certainly er by then perhaps i forgot to mention as we went through the front door my weapon was already out of the holster and by the time we'd got the bedroom door my weapon would already have been under er my eye level hence literally aiming the weapon and from there the gun was out my arm was out whether i still had hold of p c i can't recall
you shouted armed police and was there any immediate response
yes there was yes
and what was that response
er the man in the bed put his hands up
er the woman put her hands up as well and then we started to move away from the door er across the room er to avoid being stuck as a UNK in the doorway
mr what was the what was the lighting conditions when you shouted armed police
there were no lights on er in the bedroom itself
certainly not as bright as here er sufficient light for me to be able to see that there were people in there and to differentiate between a man and a woman but er at that time not enough to be able to clearly define anybody
did you try to switch the light on
i did yes
were you successful
to begin with er i couldn't find the light switch because my UNK was directed er at the people in the bed but then er i asked the man in the bed where was the light switch and er he helped me back towards the area where the switch was and we eventually succeeded in getting the light on
by the time the light was on where was the man that had been in the bed
he was still in the bed with his hands up
when you got the light on what did you do or say
the exact words er i can't recall but er i talked the man out of the bed still with his hands up and he took a few steps away from the bed
pause there
did the man have any UNK on
no he didn't no
did he have anything on
no he didn't
as you your way talked him out of the bed did he talk to you
he did but exactly what was said i can't recall i was just concerned at that time to er to get the man safely down onto the floor and secure him
w were you concerned to secure the lady in the bed
no
so he got away from the bed he had his hands up
what did you say to him then you were talking him down
yes er he took a couple of steps away from the bed er then i told him to lower himself down onto his knees and then eventually lower himself down onto his chest down onto his front
pause there a minute
at that stage in the operation
in addition to yourself how many other officers were in the room
just myself and p c
had the others still not come into the room
no
are you about that
absolutely no doubt that wasn't part of the plan
it didn't happen because there was no need for anybody to come into the room
what did you then do
er once the man was down on the floor er he placed his hands into the small of his back
i told him that i was going to come forward er and UNK him and then something along the lines of er not to move er and then once he was down on the floor erm i UNK the weapon into my own holster
can i just say that's something that we don't normally do
we would normally prefer to put er the individuals officers firearms ho id
you don't want him to grab your gun
no but on this occasion we didn't have a spare holster to put the weapon into
you'd better explain why that is
that was because p c firearm his revolver was still in the holster because he was carrying the shield and it was only as er i started to move forward that p c er came up to the doorway to cover me whilst i went forward
did you call p c
yes i did
he came to cover you and what weapon was he carrying
er he was carrying a shotgun and his revolver was in the holster hence there was no spare holster
you UNK your gun and then what did you do
i then went forward to the man on the floor er UNK him and stepped back
did he say anything to you as you went up to him
he did but once again i can't recall exactly what was said
did you say anything to him
er yes erm i told him to calm down because he was quite UNK and to just stay there and somebody would explain what it was all about
did you arrest
i did yes
did you tell him you were UNK him
yes i did yes
when did you arrest him
in the meantime as i recall er i asked him who he was and i asked his wife who he was because he had asked what we were doing in his house and when he said his house i thought then for the first time that perhaps this wasn't who er we had on the floor
but i have to say that at that time i still didn't know i had a good idea that it wasn't the man we were looking for but therefore he was still arrested and he was arrested on UNK well for UNK an UNK
i if you can remember can you tell us the words you used throughout the or the UNK of the words
the UNK of the words were you're under arrest for UNK an UNK and he replied along the lines of you've gotta be joking mate
was he still naked
yes whether he was naked at the time of the arrest or just er what i'm getting at is er that i put some trousers on mr
was that after you took the UNK on or before
yes after the UNK were put on yes
and again why did you put trousers on him
well mr er mr er wife was in the room there was a child in the room erm which at the time i didn't even realise there were two children but er there was one child in the room and er really for UNK more than anything
there seemed little point in er a wife and a child sitting looking at their husband father er with no clothes on
i mean it's
did you have to assist to get his UNK on
yes that's right yes
he still stayed on the floor he was still UNK
but er we found a pair of jeans er and having made sure that the jeans were empty of anything er we sort of UNK himself into the jeans a he lay down and we pulled i pulled the jeans up
by the time you had arrested him or put his trousers on
how many people were in the room
there would still have been er p c with the shield and p c with the shotgun
giving you cover
that's right yes
did you point the gun or shove a gun into the back of mr head
no definitely no
w why are you so certain
because the only time i approached the man was when my revolver was the holster and the holster was done up
as a matter of police practice firearms practice what would you say about a police officer who stuck the gun at any at the back of someone's neck
well it's against all training that we receive there is no need for it is just something that we would not do
not only because of the risk and the safety factor er of the gun going off because of er a movement by that person on the floor but so there's no getting around it that should a firearm be discharged against a solid object in as much as er the barrel is right up against an individual and the trigger is pulled
there's a very good chance that the person using a firearm will suffer injury because the barrel could well UNK
so that's something that we we're all aware of
did you see p c shove a gun into the back of mr head
no i did not no
did you see p c do that
no certainly not
after you had arrested him and got his trousers on what did you do
i then had a responsibility as the team leader to ensure that the rest of the house was secure and that none of the other units were having any problems
i hadn't heard any shouting so therefore i didn't believe that anybody else was having any problems
did you go anywhere
i started to walk a way out of the main bedroom and i heard p c say words to the effect of get down and i turned round to see what was going on and the man was trying to roll over to get up or that's what i thought erm not kicking or fighting or anything but just to me it looked as though he was going to get up and i went back and with my hands just pushed down onto him and said stay there it will all be explained er and then walked away
did you then leave that room
sorry
did you leave the room
i did indeed yes
and who did you leave in the room which officers did you leave in
er p c and p c
and where did you go
er i then went back er back down the UNK er into the lounge checked the kitchen checked that the rest of the firearms officers were okay
now when you went in you were carrying out a plan with you very close behind going down to the bedroom
yes my lord yes
er what was the plan about the others for all you knew who you believed was there might have been somewhere else in the flat
yes my lord er as soon as we went to the main bedroom which was the back bedroom at the same time as that bedroom door opened so the second team UNK of er p c p c would have gone into the second smaller bedroom and at the same time as we went in er p c and p c job er was to cover our backs in case of anybody in er the kitchen or the living area the living room area
and after leaving the main bedroom did you learn that the rest of the flat was secured
yes i did yes
by secure what do you mean
i mean that er all possibly threats had been secured by use of UNK and that there was no likelihood of anybody hiding er in the premises or certainly nobody in the premises with a firearm
and when you arrived at that conclusion what did you do
i then got straight onto the radio to sergeant and superintendent and informed them that the flat was secure er one person er arrested er and requested c i d and their presence
now again i but give us as to the length of time that UNK between flying the door UNK and you UNK
very few minutes perhaps three or four minutes at the absolute outside
was there anything about the way that you carried out the operation in the flat that caused you UNK
it was a shame about the er the door opener not working correctly subsequently er i discovered the incident with the other team going into the other bedroom and er a young girl being in the bed that was missed and erm
just pause there what do think about that girl being tipped out of the bed
well it was something that shouldn't have happened and it's very UNK without a doubt very UNK
mr wait there there'll be some more questions
of course
getting back to the briefing if you would sergeant
there's a plan rough plan of the flat
that's correct
and at that briefing who were you given to understand in the flat
i was given to believe that would have been in the flat also we thought that st was going to be in there possibly a wife and it wasn't said whether there were any children
we didn't know whether there were going to be any children
when you say a wife you mean mrs there wasn't any suggestion that lawrence had taken his own wife
no not at all
you had a plan of the flat
yes
looking at it there's one master bedroom
that's correct yes
who did you expect to be in the master bedroom of the three
there was mention made that we thought or somebody thought was in that bedroom
now what pray were the grounds for that
i have to say i have no idea
because you see all that we've heard is that gentlemen just before mr he listened at the door before but of course the front door is nowhere near the master bedroom
they couldn't have come from that
but the best you can say that the jury there was some information that be in the master bedroom you don't know where
i'm sorry i don't
i have to put it this way but there aren't any alternative
was there any by chance any information that mr wasn't only sharing his flat with mr but was also sharing his wife with mr
i hadn't heard that no
right
okay yeah right
so you can see what you go into the master bedroom there's a man and a woman in bed isn't it obvious in a second that it's not that it's mr and mrs
at that time no i'm afraid not
personally i've got better things to do like being at home
but i believe that the decisions made to go on the trips this autumn have been good ones
i would apologise UNK if i thought any of them have been a mistake but i don't believe they have been
any decision that has been made has been with the best intentions of the people of at heart to maintain as a leading european city and to derive benefits for the people of this community
i'd just like to say a few words on the conferences that i attended
the euro cities conference in and this is where the tories fall down on the facts because councillor doesn't really understand what euro cities is about
euro cities is a group of independent cities who're putting pressure on brussels to maintain funding in urban areas after the review of the structural funds in UNK
and because of that pressure the pressure that's already been put on we got good news at
the european commissions director for regional policy said that he'd accepted the submission from euro cities that funding would be made available for urban areas
we need to make sure that pressure stays on because urban areas as we know with the city challenge bid and others have got distinct and unique problems which we need to address
the euro cities conference was also important because it was the founding of that organisation formally and it was important to go there and say to the big UNK that's emerging between some of the western european cities the big six birmingham UNK and strasbourg that they weren't gonna get it all their own way and they weren't going to UNK those funds that were available for links with eastern europe
i also went to UNK hardly sun UNK and sea councillor but one thing i'll say about UNK and this is where all the arguments about brussels fall down it's alright to go to brussels and not to UNK
UNK is a sleeping giant as a city in europe
UNK will be the major city between western and eastern europe in the future
there's tremendous under development in UNK at the moment and that's gonna take off
we gave the paper on our links with UNK
we also made links with the region of in poland to develop tourist strategy and also links with a number of cities who were very interested in UNK participation and are going local initiative
there are a number of reasons why we need to make sure that we are in at the starting post in terms of links with central and eastern europe
because the european commission is making a number of funds available to develop those links the UNK fund the UNK fund funded by the foreign office the fund the enterprise fund the fur fund the UNK fund all these are in the UNK which i'll UNK give to the press and also the opposition if they'll bother to read it
but i think there's something more important than funding that was realised at that conference between eastern and western local authorities and that is that we need to be there to assist because we can assist
one of the last speeches that the conference heard was a very emotional speech from a delegate from russia within a winds breath of chernobyl
he explained to the delegates there the mountain they have to climb before they even reach the status that we have in britain as local authorities
ten thousand people left the city last year and UNK is on the up
the tremendous problems that they have need addressing and we should be there not because we can UNK the benefits necessarily in funding although of course that would help but because we can lend a hand because we can reach out local authority and in my view that is also what the people of would want this council to do
councillor
thank you
lord mayor may i begin by UNK so many from the majority group for taking the time to attend today's council meeting
we know that many of them may well have UNK long and UNK journeys having travelled many miles across many UNK and indeed possibly even across many UNK just in order to be with us here tonight
i'm sure i'm sure that the good people of will be the first to appreciate the great sacrifice made on their behalf
lord mayor i would be the last person to criticise either councillors or offices who attempt to represent this district on foreign UNK whenever and wherever such trips are perfectly legitimate
whenever and wherever they result in a lasting benefit to the whole of our district
i would find it difficult for example to criticise the three visits made by councillors and officers to brussels
it would be naive for anyone to suggest that politicians in should not be seeking to gain the maximum advantage from the european community
indeed in recent years has done rather well out of its visits to brussels by both politicians and officers
the millions of pounds this district has been able to secure through i d o is testimony to this despite the rather luke warm support received at the time from the labour group
if councillor as a director himself or through senior council officers had bothered to keep the UNK opposition party fully informed of his visits he may well have found us perhaps to his surprise in full agreement and support
but politicians generally have very suspicious minds and when things are kept hidden from them they tend to want to know why
they tend to ask questions in t in an attempt to find out what is going on
leaving the visits to brussels aside for i assume that these were entirely legitimate what do we find when we start to UNK the UNK surrounding the civic UNK to far off lands
we find three trips all of a rather dubious nature to attend what are officially described as conferences on european co operation
one to UNK in UNK a second to florence in italy and a third to UNK in UNK all at a total cost of five thousand to local tax payers
but why and the people of this district have a legitimate right to ask why did it take three people to represent in UNK
and why did the air fares to florence total in excess of six hundred pounds each
didn't councillor travel tourist class
and it does not end there
what is the assembly of UNK european unity policies and regions and why was it necessary to send two representatives to UNK to attend at a cost of over one thousand five hundred
but perhaps my lord mayor most UNK of all what exactly did the people of UNK let alone the people of gain from the visit by councillor who is said to have undertook an economic and social audit of that country
came to asked for a briefing on what we did in UNK and then said can we give you seventy thousand pounds so you can spend on projects in UNK so they got seventy thousand pounds off your government
one two nine
do i take it councillor that they would not have received it without your visit
i would have thought lord mayor that a country like UNK currently has enough problems of its own without councillor
but at least the people of UNK are not stupid
they made sure that the two thousand six hundred and seventy pounds cost of councillor was fully met by the long suffering tax payers of
at a total cost to local charge payers of around twenty thousand some people may think such civic UNK has been terribly excessive but the truth is lord mayor that this is just the tip of the UNK
this is after only eighteen months of labour control and is rapidly becoming the of the north
how long will it be before our labour councillors are spending a quarter of a million on trips abroad as in
the controlling group is UNK guilty of UNK its proper role the government of our district
at a time when we have child prostitution in our child children's homes labour councillors are entertaining themselves to sun sand and UNK in UNK foreign locations and in conclusion i would like to make just one comment that this UNK brings to mind a famous quotation in circles
it was made famous by the then labour education chairman who said and i quote i am a UNK i love to spend the rate UNK money
thank you

those in favour
agreed
councillor
the council my lord mayor
my lord mayor i'm really going to enjoy this one
as somebody who is still under thirty and er like my good friend mister young enough to have a positive approach to europe i am UNK surprised that the people opposite are gonna make my job a lot easier because the UNK and the anti UNK attitudes that we see on the benches opposite explain why in the last euro elections the labour party won a UNK victory on the issue of europe
now i'm making a very strong argument in this motion as is the group for UNK
the reason we want UNK is that we are the only country within the european community as it now stands bar UNK and ireland not to have regional government regional co ordination of our economic policies and a proper role for the regions to link across europe
but had done brilliantly
we have got over fifty million sixty million pounds worth of grant and aid out of europe
but as we look forward into europe post UNK we have industries in this city that will be vulnerable
we have a need for regional economic initiatives and what help do we get from the british government right
we don't get any help at all
if we'd had half the help from british government for UNK schools we've had from europe we'd have had a lot more done
there is up and down this country a crisis in the regions that is UNK by the british government over UNK
it's a long a complicated issue but it's got to such a head that the complete scheme for UNK the and the very badly affected coal fields in is being stopped
the commission is stopping it because the british government will not make up its mind on whether it's gonna back the money
it's like the little boy who's got a toy he don't wanna share it don't wanna share it if forced to share it he'll smash it rather than let somebody else have a go with it
now i was one of those people that represented this city at florence
i represented this city at florence at the cost of two days' leave and having my pocket picked at the station
yes oh absolutely it's not all great fun
but i'll tell you what the conference it about
you UNK don't seem to realise it but if we hadn't been there at that florence conference would not be in the leading position it currently holds with the commission to guarantee further funds and to create a positive role for britain in europe with the commission to UNK look at the issues that are gonna come up in UNK
and the private sector are very happy for us to do that
we have the best policies to get this across and the work that we've done with and the european commission and we want to UNK that is very positive
and to hear members opposite talking about the dead hand of bureaucracy and all these UNK that oh europe y'know i mean y'know we're going all the way back to ancient history here
i mean what help has the british government given us for preparing for UNK
british rail british rail that institution we all know and love
they have wasted because of the government four hundred million pounds building a station at UNK that isn't even going to be used because of your government
that money could have UNK railways that would've given industry a chance to get its goods into europe
university
one of the reasons we've got a very good language link is the language UNK courses that the university did in the east in the european department the UNK studies
it's been cut again as a result of your government's policies so the technology and the support that we need to go into europe to win in europe to help industry is being UNK once again by your government
so if we look at the positive effects of europe
if we look at regional governments across europe that don't have to go cap in hand every time to some UNK in white hall right they go straight to europe and they network across europe and they exchange ideas and things happen
what we have to do in and we've done it very well and it's a massive tribute to the quality of staff that we've had working on this that we've done this
we can do one hell of a lot more if the whole of is combined in europe and fighting it's corner because as sure as hell that golden triangle in the south east is not gonna give us a slice of the action unless we take it and for the members opposite to site their with their ancient out dated ideas of liberalism right
the single market needs the social charter the labour group backs the social p charter the labour group is ready for UNK and the sooner you lot get out of the way and let us get on with it the better
councillor
i'm very glad to be having this debate as the last council meeting we er put a motion down on p r which the labour group refused to discuss and councillor in the summer ma put some release out said he was in favour of it
so i'm actually glad that this is one that you're actually prepared to discuss
now people have been looking at this for a long time
it may or not surprise you that there is already an element of regional government actually in the u k already and since development is the issue that the labour group has raised we'll take the work of the development association which i was involved in the mid eighties and which actually does some good work to actually bring industry actually to this region
and that is a regional body that's been very successful
nobody can argue it
under a labour chairman
under a labour chairman who's got a nice job somewhere else now i understand
it's not just about development there's also a regional bureaucracy actually already in the u k and i'll give you two examples
there's a large department of the environment office in
if we want to define where our urban programme areas are we c we find it very difficult to set them ourselves
it's not an elected person in who actually sets them cos although he might present heseltine doesn't know that well
there's an UNK civil servant in who has a large element in deciding where they are and that is wrong
that sort of decision should be under some sort of democratic decision making ability
UNK tonight it was mentioned the actual the work of the regional health authority and again i worked for the regional health authority a long time ago
er and it is actually doing a useful job
but who actually UNK people to the regional health authority
do people y do actually local people in actually pe appoint people to the regional health authority
there is another regional body that should be under democratic control local democratic control
but so i mean i think the case for regional government is definitely there and i'm surprised by councillor i'm surprised that you said your group isn't seeing it
they are actually a long way behind the rest of europe
this is really happening in the rest of europe
there's gonna be a lot of changes at the end of this century the beginning of next century in europe and if we're not with them then we're gonna be left behind
now i know i've actually seen the paper that the labour party is actually putting out in discussion documents on regional policy and it's very good
it's been a long time coming but i'm glad you got there eventually
but the person in charge of it is roy UNK
now what's roy UNK record of regional decision making
well the last time he was in he actually went to a group of people who were determined to make their decision were determined what their decision was
he refused to listen to it influence his own decision
if you haven't guessed the last time he was in was in and he doesn't trust folk to actually select parliamentary candidates
now the effect is that if you make a decision from london if you impose a decision from london the people you impose that decision on are very UNK
and the labour party in is very UNK
and what was a twenty thousand majority has cut UNK
it will be seen as a marginal after this
the only question is who will he put up next time
now i mean the emphasis is on development
i'm not quite sure the labour party's picked that out and i may be unfair to them in s it's not enough if you only see a regional policy d just development and economic led
somebody mentioned somebody a name from the past tonight who would be very proud of this very proud of this statement would agree would agree with it fully
david owen would agree fully with this statement which UNK which does surprise me but then may y'know then may be not
the labour party's changed a lot of it's policies already so maybe they're getting close to david owen i don't know
i do take on i do take on one point that the conservatives have begun to raise to make in their in their motion which what we don't want is another heavy tier of UNK bureaucracy
and wh y'know we thought about this for a y'know a long time t and what we do want is a thin tier of bureaucracy
the one thing in the labour document and this is in the statement labour made i mean they're actually talking about paid councillors on a regional authority which is a y'know which is would be very unpopular with the public but erm
a developing regional democracy is erm is a difficult thing to get to get across and it's one of those things that liberal democrats talk away for hours about at their conferences
the labour party talk about the class war presumably or whatever
the tories th the tories talk about UNK the unions or whatever
liberal democrats actually get in corners and say we hate government y'know what can we do to get po power away from london
and i tell you just what i just wanna do is give you one thought which is in our motion
the difficulty will be in getting regional policy through and in some areas of the country do not have natural regions
some areas of england do not have natural regions
if you can tell me which region hertfordshire is in or UNK is in i will find somebody else who can tell you it's in a different region
and so there needs to be a way forward to break this argument
the way that we've found it in this year's liberal democrat conference was to actually put forward the suggestion that regional government could be brought in a flexible sense
you don't need a regional authority all the way across the country all at once and you can actually bring a regional authority in and it's certainly that scotland should have its own parliament
you could then bring in regional authorities with less power for the north west the north east and to yorkshire and humberside and i do hope you'll actually join me in supporting our motion for an independent
finally the best people to implement liberal democrat policies are liberal democrats
thank you
councillor
thank you lord mayor
vague and UNK
as a textile man i don't mind UNK too much but i do object to UNK because this motion is so vague that it can mean as much as you want it to mean while at the same time it says to little as to leave an escape route for it's supporters
it produces no facts no economic forecasts to UNK it's ideas if you can call them ideas
it merely UNK that the world will be a better place if we support it because the UNK benefits which will flow from it will put us on a level with germany and france assuming of course that we wish to be on a level with germany and france
the motion speaks of regions and UNK
the labour party have committed themselves to establishing regional government that is if britain decided to commit suicide at the next election
they say that if they create regional government they will do so at the expense of national government and not local government but that isn't true because mister has already said that erm strategic services such as passenger transport will b will be handed over to regions and if that goes obviously fire police and strategic planning will be lost to us
the theory is also that the regions might be able to bypass the national government and deal directly with regions of europe
well i can understand the labour group wishing to bypass national government if that government were headed by mister UNK but without that particular incentive i don't think that international negotiations should be taken by any organisation outside national government otherwise we'd cease to be a nation
here
the labour group often speak in general terms of gross strategic UNK of the economy of these regions and we know from experience what that means
and subtract from that figure the corresponding figure for an engine capacity of one thousand and one to fourteen hundred c namely one thousand two hundred and fifty three pounds and thirteen pence for the vehicle i find she would otherwise have run
to achieve a figure of two thousand and thirty five pounds seventy five pence for annual UNK
i allow six hundred and ninety two pounds fifty five pence for standing charges excluding UNK and thus these two heads total the sum of two thousand seven hundred and twenty eight pounds and forty pence
to that must be added the running costs of a at a si at a similarly discounted rate UNK from the a tables of nine p nine point four eight tenths of a mile
i assess the annual mileage as six thousand which then gives a total for running costs of five hundred and sixty eight pounds eighty pence
the total for all running costs is therefore three thousand two hundred and ninety seven pounds and twenty pence
applying a multiplier of eighteen to that figure i arrive at a figure of fifty nine thousand three hundred and forty nine pounds and sixty pence which is the award i would make
it is neither the ninety seven thousand nine hundred and fifty seven pounds claim by mr nor the forty seven thousand one hundred and eighty five pound figure UNK for by mr but i find it a fair figure for the cost of the plaintiff's transport in the years ahead
sub heading medical expenses
on evidence before me i find that the plaintiff will require regular physiotherapy speech therapy and UNK throughout her life
i heard evidence of the one UNK visit per week of the UNK had been stopped in september because of lack of resources
i heard evidence that regular speech therapy at six monthly intervals was necessary for the plaintiff particularly in view of her UNK and UNK problems
equally i'm satisfied that her UNK is both reasonably necessary and beneficial
it follows that for si physiotherapy i award the sum of one thousand seven hundred and sixty eight pounds per annum
for UNK a similar sum and for speech therapy the sum of two hundred and twenty five pounds per annum totalling three thousand seven hundred and sixty one pounds per annum
applying a multiplier of eighteen the total sum is sixty seven thousand six hundred and ninety eight pounds which is the sum i would award
sub heading administration costs
i am satisfied that the plaintiff is in a state where it is reasonably necessary to provide for the costs of setting up and maintaining a trust to handle the plaintiff's financial interests over the years ahead
the costs involved are agreed at the sum of eight hundred and eighty one pounds and twenty five pence to set up the trust and an annual cost of three thousand two hundred and thirty one pounds twenty five pence
applying the multiplier of eighteen to that figure one arrives at a figure of fifty eight thousand one hundred and sixty two pounds and fifty pence which when the additional costs are added in comes to the total of fifty nine thousand and forty three pence i'm sorry fifty nine thousand forty three pounds and seventy five pence which is the figure i would award under this heading
sub heading agreed figures
the figures claimed under paragraph two c of the plaintiff's schedule for transport costs are agreed at six thousand seven hundred and ninety four pounds
those at two e for the schedule for mr costs are agreed at thirteen thousand four hundred and forty seven pounds and ninety pence
those at three e of the schedule for mr costs are agreed at a total of a hundred and forty four thousand six hundred and fifty nine pounds and fifty nine pence
i should also UNK claims which were made under two heads which have been satisfied by interim payment
there was a claim for forty two thousand seven hundred and eighty six pounds and eighty six pence for the cost of alterations to the plaintiff's home already carried out as i have indicated already that was discharged by payment and by local authority grant of nine thousand eight hundred and forty seven pounds and an interim payment of thirty two thousand nine hundred and thirty nine pounds eighty six pence
there was also a claim for medical treatment and therapy in the sum of eighty three thousand three hundred and seventy nine pounds and twenty six pence which was paid by a further interim payment
neither of those sums of course has to be taken into account in any of the UNK which now have to be done to total up the awards which i would make
the addition of the individual awards which would be made in the course of the UNK this judgement achieve the total figure of one million eight hundred and fourteen thousand six hundred and fifty two pounds and twenty eight pence
from this sum there must be deducted a total figure of two hundred and ten thousand seven hundred and seventy eight pounds and ten pence
to give credit for other interim payments totalling one hundred and twenty one thousand five hundred pounds
for interest on interim payments totalling seventeen thousand eight hundred and seventy one pounds and thirty pet pence and for statutory benefits on the relative multi relevant multiplier of eighteen coming to a total of seventy one thousand four hundred and sixteen pounds and eighty pence
when those credits are deducted from the total figure for the awards covered by this judgement the overall total figure would amount to one million six hundred and three thousand eight hundred and seventy four pounds and eighteen pence
i stop this judgement at this stage for two reasons
these figures do not allow any sum for interest and therefore it may be that calculations will have to be made by council to include that figure or alternatively i am informed that both parties wish to consider the possibility of the UNK of this judgement into a structured settlement
that is not a matter where the parties are sufficiently advanced for it to be addressed to me at this stage
it follows that i UNK do not give judgement at any figure at this stage but indicate merely what the findings are which i have made and what the sums which those findings lead to are
if there is to be a time taken for a further hearing before me in relation to the question of interest and or a structured settlement i regret that the parties will have to follow me not purely from chelmsford to london but thereafter to UNK
i am sure that the arrangement can be made and er i conclude what i have to say at this stage
my lord i am very grateful for that
my learned friends and i will therefore er seek to resolve as soon as we can the matters that are outstanding
i know that everybody involved in the case is conscious that matters should not be left in the air although the amendment to leave the cost of the
i now speak for my learned friend when i say that he will expert that
er my lord we will obviously calculate such interest that has to be calculated er and figures have to be sorted out and will be agreed if that is appropriate er and we'll also consider whether it's proper er to seek to achieve a structured settlement
very well mr i'm grateful
do not feel at all shy about seeking to correct any figures that you think are perhaps in error
my fingers on my calculator are not as UNK as they should be
my lord m may i add one further matter er my lord may i say on behalf of the family er the that your lordship's comments will be very UNK received er neither mr or mrs although they've sought recognition for what they've done for their daughter they did it out of their fond love for her but nevertheless having such a and such comment from your lordship will be very good
well that's good of mr
i don't think there was any word that i said that wasn't fully deserved by both the parents and their other daughter clare
my lord the final matter is my learned friends and i agreed that it would be proper for there to be a further interim payment er in the sum of twenty five thousand pounds
yes mr
we consent to that and your lordship one direction to help us when we come to calculating interest is one of the earliest figures that your lordship came to and it was dealing with care to date
yes
your lordship split into two periods
the first one was done on an UNK basis it's the second one where your lordship applied the multiplier of two and half to a figure taken from miss calculations of thirty six thousand pounds one hundred and fifty
er mrs figures my
sorry my lord er mrs figures yes
yes thirty six thousand one hundred and fifty pounds and seventy two pence
my lord i
multiplied by three point five which i brought to a figure of a hundred and twenty six thousand five hundred and twenty seven pounds and fifty six pence
my lord the only point of interest and it's really one that i took in the of the submission is that if you use an up to date nineteen ninety three figure for calculating it when it was first back to years three and a half two and a half and one and a half years ago then UNK it wouldn't be fair if interest is awarded on that as well because in a sense the increase in the figure that inflation and the increased cost of living has produced because you use an up to date figure probably UNK with the interest and we can the figure an up to date one to avoid just that otherwise it would be getting the figures for each of those years and then working out interest
that your lordship would direct it would be in our task that figure shouldn't have interest added to it because of the way in which it was approached
i think that's probably a logical conclusion because of the way the figure was reached in submissions
mr what do you say
my lord my initial reaction is it sounds logical as well and i wondered if what my learned friend has said i if and also what your lordship's initial view is if the matter can be left in that way er i if after further reflection it seems right then of course that's the way that we will approach it
i if there is any problem that can be mentioned it won't take more than thirty seconds i would have thought
shall we leave it that i will consider making a direction at the next hearing in relation to that figure and the question of any interest UNK but will defer any such er decision until you've had time to consider it
my lord i'm very grateful
there isn't i think anything else that can be done this afternoon
in that case may i UNK by wishing the parties and their advisors a very good christmas
claiming for damages for breach of contract and your negligence against their former solicitors in relation to their handling of the purchase of a business by the plaintiff in late nineteen eighty five but all the say is on the nineteenth of october of nineteen eighty nine er my lord the matter is complex
it has er generated a great deal of documentation er which i hope that your lordship has with him now in court er the documentation has been divided for trial into two parts part a and part b with your lordship's leave erm my learned friend and i have discussed erm how your lordship may best be helped in this matter
erm what i have in mind to do my lord is to open the case now for you to indicate the scope of erm and will you then know agreed that we would invite you to adjourn that for some time to enable you do some reading of the witness statement and UNK reports because of course they are long and that would take considerable amount of with your lordship is able to UNK himself with the matter which is contained UNK
er and if your lordship is happy to do that then i can open it now and indicate what the case is about and invite you to take some time
thank you
my lord part a erm of the documentation contains three separate UNK
bundle one is the pleadings bundle which i hope your lordship's had an opportunity to glance at er this morning part a trial bundle one is the pleadings bundle
my lord the pleadings bundle runs to almost a hundred pages erm this is due principally to the fact that there are something like four sets of particulars to statement of claim which have been served over the years er where the plaintiffs have set out their claim in er in detail
my lord the second bundle part a bundle two contains the witness statements
there are statements from both the plaintiffs
does your lordship have the it should be er a small red file bundle that looks rather like that my lord
part a
part a trial bundle two it should say on the front of it
yes thank you
thank you

well then er there is the documentation which is er entitled part b and part b which is also er contained in three files one two and three comprises what are essentially all the relevant UNK er evidence which is arranged UNK and events run as your lordship will see in due course from approximately nineteen mid nineteen eighty five through to the end of nineteen eighty six beginning of nineteen eighty seven in the
my lord erm just to tell your lordship what the scope of the bundle is
bundle one er starts in er in fact in nineteen eighty three nineteen eighty four with documents which deal with the er first plaintiff previous employment and his general financial situation before then turning to nineteen eighty five and to the events that led up to his purchase of the business around which this litigation centres in september of nineteen eighty five and the documents in that first one will go up to mid october in nineteen eighty five
they continue then in bundle two from er mid october to mid august nineteen eighty six and the final bundle takes the picture up to the end of the relevant matters in this case er in the early part of nineteen eighty seven after the business was re sold by the plaintiffs at a loss
if i can er start first of all with the pleadings bundle and with the statement of claim which erm er sets out all the er upon which the plaintiffs and your lordship will see from paragraph one that this claims relate to the purchase by the plaintiff of a lease of a restaurant and wine bar business at and er it is alleged that the defendants were retained by the plaintiffs to advise them in relation to that transaction in early september of nineteen eighty five and that the contract between them er contained the usual implied required for the defendant to exercise or deal with the proper and care in relation to their conduct of the transaction and er to the advice given to the plaintiffs throughout
and my lord the fact that their UNK and the existence of those implying terms are admitted in the amended statement which starts on page thirty eight of the bundle
my lord on page three of the pleadings bundle
my pleadings bundle isn't UNK but er
i'm sorry my lord
i said my pleadings bundle isn't UNK
oh i'm sorry my lord then
but erm no doubt we can put that right
have difficulties but we can certainly provide you with a er numbered bundle
see that er paragraph three of the statement of claims sets out the history of the transaction a and UNK the relevant facts
my lord by way of facts the first named plaintiff mr is now er fifty eight years of age and he and his wife live in UNK er both are named as plaintiffs because their joint monies were UNK in the purchase of the this business and they were both parties to the purchase erm but it is clear that mr in fact did all the negotiations for the purchase and the planning and the running of this business and he is er the prime witness on behalf of the plaintiff
he's a man who erm is qualified in the field of computer sciences and if your lordship will hear has worked throughout his life in the fields of computers banking and er in march of nineteen eighty five he left employment with a company known as data logic limited where he had been employed as a banking consultant and decided at that stage er on a change of career erm and he was looking principally to acquire a wine bar restaurant country house hotel something of that nature and er you will hear that after some early UNK in the earlier part of nineteen eighty five when deals that er were on the horizon for premises in UNK and then in UNK erm in early september the plaintiffs er saw and liked the wine bar in and offered the price of the asking price of seventy five thousand pounds with stock er which was accepted
it is clear from the statement of claim that the er plaintiffs retained the defendants from about the ninth of september to act in relation to the purchase of this wine bar which was then known as er the plaintiffs were obtaining finance from the national westminster bank in order to purchase this business and the plaintiff mr had been engaged in long standing discussions with his bank from the earlier part of nineteen eighty five with a view to er agreeing financing facilities for the purchase of the various opportunities that UNK present themselves and er he will say and that he makes clear in his witness statement erm that he certainly had understood that from these negotiations the national westminster bank were prepared to provide the financing that he required to run this business
now on the seventeenth of september mr met peter on the defendant's firm er for the first time at his office where they had er a general discussion about the business and about what needed to be done in order to secure it and er the plaintiffs at that stage told peter that there should be er no problems over finance as he understood the bank were willing to assist and at that stage he wanted to move as quickly as possible to exchange contracts on the business erm for two reasons
principally there were at that time other interested parties in the premises er and also erm mr saw it as essential er that er they were in and running the business er well before the time of the christmas trade which was rapidly approaching then it being late august and er he wanted to make sure that they were in time for them to be able to take advantage of those bookings that they anticipated
the meeting of the seventeenth of september at the defendants offices is admitted by the defendant erm but there is no admission as to what was said at the meeting
now er on the friday of that week the twentieth of september my lord erm peter wrote a letter to mr er dealing with the matters related to the preliminary enquiries and so the documents from the vendors solicitors they have pleaded in the statement of claim er that there was no er reference to or discussion of conditions in the contract of sale and in particular no reference to condition twenty two a national condition of sale which appears in paragraph three two of the statement of claim and which was a condition which er gave the purchaser the right to the contract in the event of the non completion by the vendor after the service of a special notice to complete
er the er facts set out in that paragraph are admitted by the defendant er in relation to that letter
my lord the er case moves on there over the page now to the twenty fourth of september and on that day mr was notified erm by his bank on the telephone that head office had approved the finance proposal in principal and as a result of that mr then telephone peter the defendant told him that the financing for this deal had been approved in principal and mr asked mr to provide a bankers draft of some seven and a half thousand pounds in order to enable exchange to take place as a matter of urgency
the matters obviously moved fairly rapidly because the parties were then almost ready to exchange contracts
on wednesday the following day the twenty fifth of september there was then a meeting between both the plaintiffs and mr at the defendant's offices when the contract for sale was signed by both plaintiffs
the bank draft was er erm and it appeared that at that stage mr was told by the er by mr that the UNK consent to the assignment of this lease erm had still not be obtained
that is admitted it the defendants also erm that mr had told them that he the bank had approved the loan facilities an and that he wanted to move quickly to er exchange of contracts
the plaintiff's case is that despite the difficulty with the UNK consent at the time the contracts were signed it was made clear to them by mr at this stage that ought to be a UNK and no one anticipated to expect this
so my lord on the twenty sixth of september a thursday contracts were exchanged er and that completion date was then fixed at the eighteen of october and those facts are admitted there is no dispute about those
and deposit was paid was it
deposit was paid my lord
now my lord it's at the beginning of october things start to go wrong in erm and as it is pleaded on the first of october er the plaintiffs were told the in correspondence from the bank that the financial terms that the finances that had been approved in principal were only going to be available if security was offered in respect of a number of properties
one of which was the property in UNK which was owned jointly by mr and his step mother who was an elderly lady who was then UNK in that er property and er around that time on the first of october mr er UNK mr and er told him about that but at that time was not anticipating that there would be an difficulties about the security on UNK for these he had always added his case made it perfectly clear to the man at the national westminster bank with whom he was dealing mr that property was not a property which er could er be offered as security because of the joint ownership and er while in conversation with the bank he understood that this letter had been sent and mrs had been on holiday and that it was simply UNK on the part of the bank at this stage and that all would well after mrs returned which was expected in two weeks time
that my lord the matter moves on to the fifteenth of october on which day er the plaintiff together with mr attended richmond magistrates court and obtained a protection order from the UNK in relation to the premises and then on the sixteenth of october erm this was the day when things started to go very badly wrong for the plaintiff because mr by now had returned from his holiday and come back UNK he apparently attended after his holiday and on this day mr was told that by mrs that it was not possible to proceed with the financial er dealings that had been agreed between them unless the UNK property was offered as security
now at this stage er it is the plaintiff's case that mr er considered that this caused major financial problems because the property at UNK was simply not one that was open to him to offer as security it was clear that the bank would now as he saw it on the deal that he understood that he'd struck and he knew that without the UNK help he would not be able to er proceed with this purchase and operate he business in the way he had wished to
how much was the bank going to provide
my lord the started sum of money originally sixty thousand pounds was the total loan and there were further UNK facilities and it's the plaintiff's case that without it was simply not going to be UNK and as a result of that having thought carefully about erm position it is his case that he rang peter told him that there were major problems in the financing of the deal and asked him if he could get him out of the contract because the finance he anticipated was no longer going to be available and it was his case that peter advised him that there was no way out because contracts had been exchanged er mr was told very clearly that he was committed legally now to the deal and that he'd better try and rearrange some finances since clearly they were moving towards er the completion date
well that's since denied by the defendant and that is a factual major factual dispute which is obviously what you'll have to decide
my lord the er plaintiff mr er UNK the national westminster bank the following day in order to er make an appointment to discuss the finances further and an appointment was made for the twenty second of october
now on the friday the eighteenth of october er peter UNK the plaintiff's home to speak to mr erm but on this occasion he spoke to his assistant june and er she was someone who at this stage was involved in the planning and the running of the business together with acting very much as his personal assistant and mr had a conversation with june on the telephone in which he told her that he had received a letter from the solicitors which indicated that they had not yet er the landlords er licence to UNK had not yet been given
it is admitted that there was er such a letter and er on this occasion er miss evidence is that having heard that the landlords consent for the assignment still hadn't been obtained asked mr again whether it was possible in view of that er to withdraw from the contract and er it is case that again mr repeated the advice he'd given to mr two days earlier and told her that it was not possible and that again is denied
on the same day the eighteenth of october mr came back and spoke to miss about this telephone call and he rang peter in the afternoon of that friday and he asked again if it was possible to withdraw because of the UNK failure to consent to the er assignment and again er after what will er be described as a fairly easy discussion between the plaintiff and er mr er he was told very clearly that it was not possible for him to withdraw contracts had been exchanged and he was advised that what the landlords er failure to consent did was in fact er provide mr with more breathing space in order to obtain proper funding and re arrange his finances er that again is denied
my lord the er plaintiff's case is that as a result of the advice that he was given by mr er it was clear to him that he had no way out of this contract that he was committed to it and that he had no choice but to proceed with the matter and there was then er further discussion on the telephone on this day friday between mr and mr to where they were going here and mr said he would now write to the plaintiff setting out what his options were to him and the letter than was sent by mr was dated the twenty second of october and the letter the relevant terms of this letter are set out in a statement of claim expressing at paragraph three eleven of this statement saying and of course er that is admitted by the er defendant
your lordship er will see from paragraph three eleven that what the letter er says is as we discussed on the telephone the advantage of the UNK objection is that it gives you time to put your finances in order if the licence was forthcoming now you would be obliged to complete the transaction which at this stage you are unable to do
the courses of action open to you following letter are as follows
one application could be made to the court that mr the landlord is UNK consent to the lease if the court finds that this is in fact the case they will permit the assignment of the lease to you not UNK the UNK objection
if such application was to be made to the court i feel that further references to your business UNK would have to be supplied beforehand
two the could proceed without the UNK licence it would then be up to the landlord to apply to the court to have the lease UNK when you could arrange the defence that you were a reasonable tenant and as such the assignment should have been allowed to permit this course of action but of course you are using bank money as well as your own and the bank would be unhappy to lend money in a situation where there was a possibility albeit a slight that the lease would be UNK
three you could arrange payment of the deposit as requested possibly for a certain period of time and possibly for a smaller amount than demanded this would no doubt by in the process of the licence
four you could do nothing at all and leave any course of action to the solicitors comfortable then you should be using their best UNK to obtain the licence
now at about the time that letter was written on the twenty second of october er mr had the meeting at the national westminster bank that had been arranged between himself and a mrs and it is clear from er this meeting that the bank would no longer er given that the UNK property was not to be offered as security prepared to offer the sum the substantial sums that they had originally agreed to do and they were now only prepared to offer very much smaller sums and the plaintiff's case is that the only way that they were going to be able to proceed to complete on this matter was er by selling their homes their family home at and it is the plaintiff's case certainly in relation to er the losses that they have sustained as a result of the breach of contract alleged in this case that er if they had not been forced to go ahead to complete on this deal they would not have been required to sell their family home
the bank were prepared to pay for the business to be purchase only on condition that the home that the family home was then sold and the proceeds were given straight to the bank so with that eighty thousand pounds of equity in the property and the purchase fund for the business was about twenty five thousand pounds
now at that stage my lord mr er UNK mr on the afternoon of the twenty second of october and it's his case that he explained what had happened at the meeting of the bank to him and er asked him again in view of the fact that was having to sell him home if it was possible to withdraw from the contract and it is the plaintiff's case that he pointed out to mr er quite definitely and quite clearly on the telephone on this day er that without er the funding that he had required to run this business er he could only see that this was going to be potentially disastrous for him er and once again my lord as he said this was a fairly heated conversation and er the plaintiff was told by mr once again that there was no way out for him and he should now concentrate all his efforts on achieving completion er and once again we were
my lord er in paragraph three fourteen of the statement of claim there is an important fact er which is a fact that is admitted by the defendant which is this that had the defendant on the plaintiff's behalf taken the opportunity which was open to the plaintiff by virtue of national condition twenty two which should say and served a special notice to complete upon the vendors on about the eighteenth or the twenty second of october the contract would in fact have been UNK on the thirteenth or the nineteenth of november nineteen eighty five and the plaintiff would therefore have been able to get out of the contract and that as i say is admitted in the amended UNK
what is denied by the defendant and what is the issue of trial is that they deny that they were ever instructed by mr er to save such a measure or that it would have been appropriate to serve them or that at any stage mr ever asked to be advised on any way open to him to get out of the contract er as alleged
it is the defendant's case that the plaintiff was at all times pushing to proceed as a matter of urgency on the deal
so as i say there is clearly a substantial er factual dispute between the parties as to what was said on these relevant telephone conversations
now my lord as is er then made clear in a statement of claim paragraph three fifteen erm between the twenty third of october and about the twenty second of november the plaintiff then acting upon the advice of peter that it was not possible to withdraw on this contract did endeavour to complete upon the deal as soon as possible very much with the timing in his mind and eventually after some UNK and UNK which er will be demonstrated in the course of the evidence agreement was reached with the landlord for his consent to the assignment to be given er on condition that there was payment of some advance rent by the plaintiff
that was done and completion actually took place is pleaded as the twenty second of november the er defendants admit completion took place on or about the twenty fifth of november
so it appears that completion was around that time although the date is not er is not certain
my lord er those are the facts which er form the background to the allegations of breach of contract with negligence that are named in paragraph four and five of the statement of claim
my lord the paragraph four of statement of claim contains the allegations of breach of contract and paragraph five makes effectively exactly the same allegations but under the heading of negligence in breach of the deal of the care owed to the plaintiffs by the defendant
now there are two areas where it is alleged that the defendants were in breach of their professional duty to exercise skill and care in advising the plaintiffs throughout their handling of this transaction
firstly it is alleged that there was a failure to advise the plaintiff er before the contracts for this business were exchanged as to the necessity for ensuring that there was adequate finance to er complete the purchase granted on terms that the plaintiff could meet and which were set out clearly in a letter of offer from the bank and there was a failure to advise the plaintiffs as to the risk of relying upon oral offers of financing from the bank
it is it has been pleaded at various points throughout paragraph three in UNK the history that at the various meetings between peter and mr that no advice of this nature was given and it is the plaintiff's case that failure to give advice of this nature even if they did not ask for it which they did not was a breach of the professional duty owed to them by the defendant
my lord it is pleaded as being a matter of er common practice amongst solicitors in this kind of situation er for such advice to be given and my lord er if you turn to the UNK of their particulars erm which were given i think it's the final book what are called the voluntary further and better particulars which in fact were the final particulars er given towards the end of the bundle of documents
this is this is further and better particulars we're just finding the document in the bundle
we undoubtedly your lordship because er i'll be referring to er one or two other parts of the further and better
thank you
it's page eighty two my lord
and on page er eighty two the erm plaintiffs were after perhaps in matters which it is alleged the defendant should have UNK relating to the financing of this transaction prior to UNK contracts and the base of the claim is that as set out in the on page eighty two that the defendants should have UNK whether the plaintiffs had a defined source of funds upon terms which the plaintiffs were able to meet
this they did not do and they should have UNK by sticking writing into the national westminster bank to confirm that sufficient funds were available for the completion of the proposed transaction and that the terms upon which this finance was to be made available had been agreed
my lord the defence admit that no such advice was given to the plaintiff but they deny that they were under any duty er to give such advice and it is pleaded in the that er the defendants will rely upon the fact that mr er held himself out to be er an experienced man of business and as such it was not necessary on their part to advise him upon the UNK and arrangements for the financing of the operation
my lord that is in dispute it is in dispute firstly that in fact as a matter of fact mr had ever held himself out to be an experienced man er of business that peter believed him to be as such er and in any event even if he was to seem as such it is the plaintiff's case that there was still a duty upon the solicitor in that situation
well the solicitors couldn't very have written to the to the bank could they
as it is alleged here
well my lord it would be the plaintiff's case
if they had done the bank would have written back and said mind your own business
well my lord the plaintiff's case would be that had the solicitor UNK from the plaintiff that it was alright for him to just check with the bank this could easily have been done and if the bank had given authority by the plaintiff for
so really it's understood in these allegations that you're saying that the solicitors should have invited your client to provide them with the authority to write to the bank
yes after
and get independent confirmation from the bank independently from their own client
either that my lord or er as it's pleaded in the alternative should have advised the plaintiff to do that to get that confirmation in writing and in any event even if it is alleged as the defendant say that the er that mr is an experienced man of business and both these plaintiffs were purchasing the business er and mrs it is the plaintiff's case was clearly entitled to that advice in addition
well that is the first area er in which it is alleged the breach of duty on the part of the defendant
the second area is the failure to advise the plaintiff as to their right to UNK of the contract in the event of the UNK licence not being obtained and the vendor being unable to complete
my lord the plaintiff's case as you can appreciate is that mr had very clearly on several occasions in mid october er requested a way out of this contract there was a way out er under the terms of the contract by service of special notice to complete erm and yet he had been told that there was no way that they could withdraw from the contract
er the plaintiff's case is that there was a duty to advise them of the opportunity er which arose from the refusal of the landlords to grant a licence for assignment erm and that their failure er to er give that er advice was in breach of duty and my lord on page eighty five of the pleadings summary er page eighty five my lord again er in answer to the request for what advise it is alleged the defendant should give the plaintiff on the twenty second of october nineteen ninety five at the top of the page
the answer is that the advice that should have been given in the circumstances that UNK on that date was that if the plaintiffs wished to ignore the contract then they were entitled to serve a completion notice which because the vendor was unable to obtain that would have meant that the vendor would be unable to comply with the completion notice and accordingly the contract would have come to an end
now my lord the defendants say of course that they were never asked by the plaintiff to get him out of the contract so that the duty er never arose
but they also say in the alternative that since the plaintiffs themselves were at this time by mid to late october of nineteen eighty five not ready or able to complete it would have been UNK erm for the defendant to advise the plaintiffs to serve a special notice to complete and my lord the question that therefore arises er whether even if that were correct er and it's not admitted that it is that UNK the defendants from given the advice er and whether they should still have advised the plaintiff erm of the opportunity which was open to him that the plaintiff could if necessary take that course himself or be advised to go er elsewhere and be advised independently is er this is this the point of the matter which he regarded as UNK and was not willing to do it on the plaintiff's behalf
the case of the plaintiff is that he should still have been told and advised about the er availability of this provision particularly when he was clearly er fearful of the financial consequences to him of completing this and when he was expressing those fears UNK er to mr
my lord er obviously all the allegations of breach of contract and negligence are denied and er in paragraph six of the statement of claim on page nine
the plaintiffs claim that they suffered loss and damage as a result of the defendants breach of contract er my lord erm essentially having completed on this purchase they then tried er to run the business financially and in accordance with the terms of the lease erm but it's all been the plaintiff's evidence that right from the start erm he was well prepared that there was insufficient working capital and insufficient funds er to run this business properly and efficiently and indeed shortly after purchasing it advice was sought about er re sale and er if your lordship looks at page eighty eight of the pleadings bundle which twenty one the plaintiff's case on page eighty eight the top of the page my lord
it is said that the plaintiffs UNK to run the business because of the UNK advice received by them from mr on the twenty second of october the plaintiffs were unable to withdraw from the contract
they therefore faced no option other than to make a go of the business
the alternative was either not to commence running the business or to cease running the business shortly after completion which would have meant in either case that the landlord would UNK on the lease and the plaintiff's investment in the business would have been entirely lost
faced with that dilemma the plaintiffs chose to endeavour to run the business to an early sale and that is what they did my lord and er the premises were put back on the market er in the early part of nineteen eighty six and er it is pleaded that er in paragraph six statement of claim that in may er a buyer came forward but that sale did not go ahead er because there were unreasonable delays on the part of the purchaser erm and er the deal fell through but then again in july er after the business had ceased trading another buyer was found and then there was a lengthy period of negotiations at the conclusion of which the sale price was reduced because at that stage the plaintiff's landlord was going to increase the rent er and the plaintiffs were at that stage under threat of UNK and eventually contracts were exchanged on the sixth of november nineteen eighty six the sale price being eighty one thousand five hundred and er completion was on the fifth of december nineteen eighty six
my lord the er plaintiffs UNK that they suffered considerable losses as a result of er their completion of er the purchase of this business
their case is that if they had been properly and correctly advised as they were entitled to be under the contract they would not have proceeded to exchange or to completion
if they had been advised as to the necessity for clear offers in writing with terms set out from the bank their case is that they would have taken that advice they would have waited for the bank offer and if and when it had not been suitable for them they would not have exchanged and their case is also that er once things had gone er very badly wrong and they wanted to get out of the contract if they had been advised as to the way out er then er they would have been er of that they would have served notice and they would have got out of the contract
their case is that they were effectively forced to er complete UNK without the or the finance to make a go of the business and they suffered the losses which are claimed er set out in heading form initially on page sixty two of the pleadings bundle in further and better particulars
and your UNK see that erm figures are there set out which represent the losses incurred during the trading during that year from er november to december nineteen eighty five nineteen eighty six
the loss on the sale of the business er various selling purchased expenses loss of the profit potential profit on their home the cost of borrowing er loss of earnings of the plaintiffs loss on surrender of insurance policies er and er then some UNK sums relating to pension and credit UNK and ill health and loss of business my lord those er headings are taken from and dealt with in er much more detail in the report prepared by the UNK accountant mr for the er plaintiffs which is of course in the erm bundle c the third bundle
sorry bundle three part a my lord er again on page eighty one of the pleadings bundle the er plaintiff set out erm in their answer to request number nine on page eighty one what they say er about what happened to their business
on page eighty one as at the twenty fifth of september nineteen eighty five the plaintiffs did not have any confirmed offer of finance thus they were unable to achieve completion unless the bank offered the finance in accordance with the telephone conversation of the twenty fourth
the plaintiffs were ultimately only able to complete on the basis of the terms subsequently offered by the bank which were financially UNK and effectively deprived the business of any chance of surviving because of the lack of operating capital and er many of the losses which are set out on page sixty two erm are based on that intention and are dealt with er in full
this is what sort of business a w wine bar did you tell me
sorry my lord
what sort of business was it
it was a wine bar and restaurant
and restaurant
yes
my lord er more detail about the nature of the losses which were incurred appear on erm page sixty seven of the further and better particulars
sixty seven of the pleadings bundle which are the further and better particulars this year and you can see that er looking back to page sixty six what the plaintiffs have been asked to state was to give particulars of the change in financial position which had been outlined to mr on the telephone and er your lordship will see first of all that in answer eighty little a there is a reference to er a letter of the twenty seventh of february nineteen ninety two which was a letter from the plaintiff's solicitors to the defendant's solicitors which this is been incorporating in the front or ought to be in the bible erm i don't think it has been but there are copies if i can hand your lordship it was missed out in error i am sorry
my lord will see that there are details given erm as to the er financial requirements of the plaintiff
so what is said is this
our client's initial requirements were for a loan of eighty six thousand pounds being sixty thousand pounds for the business and a further twenty six thousand pounds on house mortgage to cover any monies the bank had required our client to provide UNK facilities were also required
the bank provided finance for our client to exchange contracts this the deposit and then subsequently the attempt to obtain full security over their proposed UNK by including security over a property at UNK on sea which had been left in part only to our client upon his father's death
our client had it in telephone conversation with the bank on ninth of september only proceeded with the proposed purchase on the express understanding that UNK property was not to be included particularly as his father's UNK a mrs eighty years of age was UNK in the property and owned a half share of it
furthermore our client had given mrs through solicitors an undertaking at the time of the transfer of his late fathers half share interest to himself that he would not use the property for purposes of charges being placed upon it
the bank were aware of this
in order to comply with the directions being given by mr to our client to rearrange his finances your client's letter in may er a buyer came forward but that sale did not go ahead in which to put your finances in order
our client met his bankers on twenty second of october and was only able to obtain funding as follows
the bank would give him facilities to purchase the business to the extent of seventy five thousand pounds if he agreed to sell his property at and from the proceeds of sale to UNK the UNK facility in its entirety and they would provide a sixteen thousand pounds business loan and UNK facilities to be reduced by five thousand pounds within a few days and if the six thousand pounds rent deposit was not required then the business loan would be reduced to ten thousand pounds
the bank finally agreed to loan sixteen thousand pounds for the business plus UNK facilities and a further nine thousand pounds secured on our client's home UNK over five years any further mortgage over a future was to be arranged elsewhere and my lord er will hear that in fact the having the sale of their home having been completed on the fifth of december the plaintiffs were then homeless for some three months living with their daughter until such times as they were able to arrange a mortgage on their present property with the halifax
and er move into that new home
and er the er those figures are really set out again er repeated in the further and better particulars which appear on page sixty seven and page sixty eight
they're really setting out in great detail what is contained in that letter
my lord the er defendants deny erm that er if there was any breach of contract or UNK on their part as that caused the losses which are claimed and also er do not admit any of the losses or damage er i consider the damage which was claimed by the plaintiffs
my lord erm there are er in my submission er a likely there were to be five key issues for determination in a court of this trial
that the first issue erm were the defendants in breach of contract in failing to as is admitted a unitary UNK unitary authority and county hall is made in a unitary UNK unitary authority and county hall is made into a be put to be theirs
provided from the bank
er the second issue is did the plaintiff mr ask peter to get him out of the contract between exchange and completion er that is clearly in dispute but if he did then the further issue is this were the defendants in breach of contract in failing to advise the plaintiffs at a stage as to the effects of national condition of sale twenty two and a way out of the contract which was open to him
er four er if the plaintiffs had been so advised would they have taken er that way out thereby the contract and UNK if the defendants er were in breach of contract and your lordship decides all those questions in the plaintiff's favour then er what is the basis on which they are to be awarded damages
my lord the er plaintiff's case is that you must er UNK now the actual situation of these plaintiffs and compare it with the situation that would have UNK if the UNK of contract alleged had not occurred
now the case
the damages i suppose might be different depending which er what kind of breach you succeed on
yes i think that may be right my lord indeed er if we succeed on the way out get out of the contract point then of course the plaintiff's case is that they would have taken that advice and would not have entered into the contract a and therefore on that basis they are entitled to be UNK on the basis that all the losses they unnecessarily incurred by having being forced to complete should be UNK subject to er litigation of loss and
but that's the basis on which they erm content er it is also their case that
well what would that damage be in er
well my lord in my submission it is all those items which are claimed the trading losses of having to run the business erm operating at a loss for that trading year er the loss on UNK
the loss of profit because they had been UNK to sell their home in order to complete on the purchase and the cost of borrowing and er the UNK matters that are set out in the claim and dealt with by the accountant
it is the plaintiff's case that all those losses were losses they would not have incurred erm had there been no breach of contract
because had there been no breach the contract would never have been entered into in the first place and the er plaintiffs will rely upon that erm recent court appeal decision between and er against where the court of appeal indicated that if you are dealing with a case where the plaintiff was saying had there been no breach of contract this is a transaction we would never have entered in to then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover compensation on that basis
erm on the basis that they should be put back into the position that they would have been had there been no breach
now erm i understand that talking to my learned friend mr this morning that erm he will be UNK for a different approach as to the basis of compensation
namely he will be inviting your lordship to er look at whether or not the business the plaintiff's would have failed in any event er because it is the defendants case relying er extensively upon the opinion of their expert mr er that even if the plaintiffs had the finances which were originally anticipated and had completed the deal in accordance with that the UNK are that this business would have failed in any event and that they would have incurred the losses they did er so i anticipate there is going to be a dispute between us as to the basis in which your lordship is to determine compensation in this case
er my lord i have to say that as far as the expert evidence from the accountant is concerned it is only mr who has er offered an opinion expressed an opinion upon that issue
the plaintiff's accountant mr UNK himself to UNK the heads of loss and doesn't speak with reference to the er allegations that are made in any way
it is erm alleged it is to be alleged as i understand it by the er defendant relying on mr opinion that the business would have failed in any event er because of the plaintiff's general lack of experience in this trade and what is described as a lack of financial expertise or caution er to which the availability of extra money as envisaged in the original proposal would have made absolutely no difference
er my lord er i my observations on that issue at this point be that erm it seems to be the defence case that for the purposes of er the defendants avoiding a duty to advise the plaintiffs as to the need for clear financial offers their terms from the bank mr was an experienced man of business and er had considerable financial UNK for the purposes of considering er whether under the banks original proposal for finance he would have been successful they would be trading as a financial disaster
er my lord er the second observation i make about erm mr opinion erm and the facts upon which it is based is that his opinion is UNK er not least because of what it would be submitted is the highly speculative nature of this enterprise er when you are being asked to consider with the benefit of hindsight whether or not a business entered into some eighty years ago was likely to have failed and er it is also an exercise which in my submission is entirely irrelevant if your lordship would find the basis of compensation which i UNK for is the one because the logic of not having to become involved in any investigation of whether or not this business would probably have been unsuccessful in any event
erm my lord there is one other matter erm which we invite your lordship to deal with now erm a at this point before the case proceeds further and that is this
my lord there was an order on the UNK for directions erm in august of nineteen ninety erm provided for experts report to be disclosed with expert evidence to be limited witnesses or each party
my lord in addition to erm the evidence from an expert accountant dealing with er the plaintiff had obtained expert opinion erm on the extent of the duty owed by the defendant in this sort of situation
it is an expert er report prepared by a partner of the solicitors firms who has since qualifying been dealing primarily with commercial and residential conveyancing
erm my lord the defendant's solicitors were told in correspondence that we would be calling a conveyancing expert
this report was disclosed in accordance with the direction of the trial on the twenty sixth of september of this year er the defendant had not obtained er a report themselves
erm that report is not in the bundle of documents before your lordship at present because we were notified er as the sixteenth of november er that UNK a unitary UNK unitary authority and county hall is
what is a conveyancing expert
my lord the er
solicitor who UNK conveyancing
my lord the report deals with the extent of the duties which are by solicitors engaged in commercial conveyancing er the duties that is practice and is adopted by a majority of solicitors in this field which relates to the extent of the duty to financial security and to advise as to er the availability if asked of the way out of the contract and the meaning of and interpretation of the national agreement of sale
now my lord the report er in my submission goes to the issues which are at the heart of this
the rule i in my submission is that expert evidence is admissible er where there are matters at issue before the court which require expertise for the analysis and these criteria to be satisfied in my submission are that first of all the evidence must be relevant and secondly the witness must be competent to give it
ar are you saying that the defendant was or ought to have been a conveyancing expert himself
mr
my lord mr was a conveyancing the defendants firm are a firm which UNK in commercial conveyancing matters and mr was an experienced solicitor within that field and therefore the report addresses the duties to be owed by somebody working in that field and advising clients as to what the extent of the duty is
er and my lord er in my submission there is er no good reason why your lordship should not receive that in evidence
the reports from solicitors dealing with matters of what are professional standards and duties in this particular field are er regularly accepted in evidence in these courts in order to determine those matters
my lord we are not dealing here er with erm general UNK
for example where it is alleged that a solicitor
are you seeking to introduce er some solicitors practice rules of some kind
well there's nothing as i understand it there is nothing in the law society guidelines but there are certainly references in the professional conduct guidelines which mr has referred to in the course of this report er which referred to the extent of solicitors in the situation
and that's all part of the evidence the expert evidence that he will give
and this are the UNK professional conduct guidelines in dispute as they apply here
well my lord all we know is that erm when the report was served on the defendant it then came through court they were going to have to call mr and then last week it was suggested er that er not only did they not agree but that they were going to try to prevent it being admitted in evidence
i know no further erm than that
er but it may your lordship if you hear what my learned UNK objections are to er the report going in
yes
my lord er the basis of this objection is that this evidence is not admissible under a sign of authority and erm i wonder if i could start er my submission on this by referring to er on evidence
in er chapter UNK of november er that UNK a unitary UNK witnesses are admissible what if or experience
the principles as civil proceedings and the topic is now run by it goes on and that mainly deals with criminal material and then one can pick it up at paragraph thirty two er seventeen when er the authors addressed themselves to civil proceedings er and that er following passage deals with effects of the civil evidence act and the relevant procedures and then moving on my lord to er to in fact thirty two thirty nine on page eighty hundred and twenty nine the expert has UNK the judge or jury with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of her conclusion so that to enable the judge or jury to perform their own independent judgement by the application of these criteria to the facts proved in evidence
that er goes on in relation to er criminal matters again and er paragraph three hundred and thi thirty three forty one er it picks up the subject of expert testament namely er science art trade technical terms handwriting foreign law er the UNK pages in fact deal with that and then at paragraph thirty two fifty one er in the er section of subjects which experts may not UNK on
the first is what we that passage the questions of destruction whether of domestic or
he should instruct particular terms of the
the instructions that is the general rule
for example when foreign documents relating to professional conduct the opinions of experts not UNK on disputes of policy in professional to UNK to UNK the rules of a particular profession english law UNK and probability of human nature and all our opinions of law is that which english law though they may prove the proper costs of particular legal proceedings neither expert or ordinary witnesses may give their opinions upon matters of legal or moral obligations or general human nature or the manner in which other persons would probably act in the interests and my lord this director points at the policy it is in fact the authority UNK which is mr justice then was
this is a report at nineteen thirty nine the UNK reports one UNK at page three hundred and eighty four
this was a solicitors pick it up and my lord so you can you can see what the dispute was
lot nineteen sixty one an option to purchase your honour for three hundred and eighty five which at that time was at a rate of nine hundred pounds a year and they went to this friend of the firm of solicitors and there of the document which UNK signed and was dated march twenty four nineteen sixty one but my consideration one pounds penny by thereby granted to for the purchasing of
the option is expressed and remained effective for ten years
for one pound and unfortunately as he the option of the contract and on a number of occasions question whether he should exercise the option
on seventeenth of august nineteen sixty seven object of UNK the option and having discovered through the result of his solicitors that the option had not been registered sold and been paid the farm five hundred pounds and after the sale by UNK the option under the land chartered act and on the sixth of october nineteen sixty seventeen could have UNK the option and neither or his wife UNK with the notice and on march twenty eighth nineteen sixty eight wife died and on the twenty seventh of january nineteen seventy commenced proceedings against his father against his mother's executors the declaration of the option was
on the eighth of february of nineteen seventy two died and on the eleventh of may seventy three died and the plaintiff's continued the action but the action failed so he was awarded damages from the sale of his estate and on the twenty first of july nineteen seventy two commenced an action against solicitors for negligence or breach of professional duty in UNK to register the option necessity of so doing
UNK point er it was held at one of general or continuing duty obtain an independent firm of solicitors to the option on every occasion on which they were consulted as to a possible exercise on such occasions whether in fact be issued it goes on
was imposed on the defendant client existed between the defendants were therefore liable to be taught
the defendant contract for their negligence is UNK to register this option before the and just before that submission i wish to make
lord may i pick it up page four hundred and two erm at lesson b er there's a plea of breach of duty this new plea does however raise the issue not of the original not apparent on the original fee then what is the scope of the solicitor's duty that part of a particular aspect of a problem
is he entitled to UNK himself to the particular matters for which he is retained to advise or was he to consider all the circumstances affecting the underlying data including hypothetical circumstances or risks which attention directed from one and not specifically sought
as i've heard the evidence of a number of practising solicitors and mr committed himself
mr no doubt of what is said to be the divine preference for called three
i must say that i doubt the value as it seems to me become UNK in cases of this type
it is then the legal duty in any situation must i think the questions for the court clearly there's not practice so accepted standards of conduct as laid down by the professional institute
evidence of that had thought to be at
but evidence really amounts to no more than expression of the opinion by a particular UNK of what he thinks that he would have done if he had been paid UNK without the benefit of hindsight the position of the defendant with a little while the evidence of the witness is due what in the matter of law the solicitor's duty was in the particular circumstances of the case i should have thought being a solicitor the very question which the functions to decide
the authority if i may refer you to it is the recent report of the british er UNK supreme court erm courtesy of professional negligence er in the updating section it's a
just one moment
yes
my lord british UNK supreme court erm and er UNK
erm my lord i don't think it's necessary to go through the rather complicated UNK potentially gives you though i can see it from the er
what the erm give me the reference again
my lord yes nineteen ninety two forty six b c l r open bracket two little d closed brackets one six four
er my lord it's rather a complicated of transaction and the essential heading this case was that he failed to advise in relation to title er the person who goes from with respect to a land transaction he's entitled to expect that the lawyer UNK the state of entitlement to arrange the matter and to explain to the trial exactly what that is what it is that is portrayed by the state of the title
the defendants were UNK in breach of duty of not carrying out of that part of that duty
and my lord a short part i wish to refer you to and that is on page a hundred and seventy nine which is er the section when the judge was dealing with er the law of duty and the judge mr justice said during the trial i express some concern to what evidence has been called it is not necessary to refer to lawyers professional liability by
the issue is whether or not the defendant's lawyer should have told his client about the state of the title and the risks arising UNK and i didn't have any difficulty in coming to the conclusion on that matter without the aid of expert evidence and erm the judge then goes on to deal with the authorities
my lord er the final part of er my submission on
well that doesn't take us very much further does it
that particular case i don't know who this judge is judge what court is this in
british UNK supreme court my lord
it is approved er approval by er the UNK of which is the technical or professional negligence
yes
my lord there is a final part of our submission on this is because i don't know whether your lordship has a copy of the report this is the report of the fact that my lord erm what i wish to refer you to if i may is erm that paragraph three one of the report which is erm that solicitors and er he instructed himself er from the law society who told him that the law society in paragraph three page five don't issue any specific UNK guidance duty of care in relation to the plaintiffs transaction the law society view obligation to be have to be considered on the basis of and he then goes on from there to depart from that approach to speculate as to what his approach would be erm
but he goes on he goes on and the body of his evidence my lord is to speculate as to what he would have done and what mr should have done in the circumstances of this er case and reference is made to the professional conduct guide in paragraph three two
guide but what we do dispute is the relevance that erm this solicitor is seeking to give
