mr in respect of item seventeen the environmental strategy
thank you
item seven members allowances cash limits
erm i'll like to deal with this in a if possible in a number of separate motions so that we can deal with the various bits of work that need to be done but i'll call mr first
thank you chair erm in likelihood that i mean you may wish to these separately as well but i'll group wish to see is to a is to approve an extension of the maximum UNK by five per cent b officers continue to monitor expenditure reporting to group leaders monthly and c officers and group leaders look into the allowance scheme to see if any suitable alterations need to be made
yes erm i had in mind that is there a seconder to that my own view is that erm and that goes for most of the way for dealing with the problem but i think it would be appropriate for this committee to make it clear that erm any extension of the maximum UNK for the current financial year will be met by an appropriate reduction or a corresponding reduction in the expenditure for ninety four ninety five erm and i'm not certain that that's absolutely clear to the public or indeed to all members of
chair
as you say it is legally required
i mean if the principal of the five per cent is acceptable then if you wish to qualify the being put in from the words you said then that is acceptable by the labour group
okay but i just wanted to go on to say that i think in reviewing how the budget may be brought more closely under control in the coming year officers will need to look at the erm size of the committees because we are working with committees at the moment that are larger than those committees which used to exist when this year's budget was set and that has had some impact and we need to have the implications of any change of committee size whether that might affect the budget how that would affect the budget also whether there is any potential for reducing the number of committees further and also whether the rates might be changed i particularly would like officers to report on what whether there would be any significant saving from er setting the rates at the round figures they were at a couple of years ago erm
ten pound and twenty pound and twenty five pound which apart from anything else i found easier to remember when filling out a form but i think that may think it's not worth doing
i think the most important thing is to make clear i'm hoping to make clear somewhere that next year this council will have a members allowance budget which is one and a half percent more than this year at the maximum and it may not even have that i'm not certain that we've agreed that with the policy committee i don't know if anybody knows if we have
yes
we have well i would erm let's see how do we do this we've got a motion on the floor erm anybody else
mr
chairman i have an amendment to that motion because i believe it's important that we start to identify a lot of councils publish at the end of the year for public consumption a list of the allowances drawn by members and i think that would be very useful and i would make as an amendment i would add to the proposal put by mr that we call for a report to be pu er to be presented to us of the amounts of allowances drawn by members each member
would you accept that should be for the financial year
more than happy chairman that it should be that
can i can i if i if there's a second can i
speak to my
i view with considerable concern erm what has happened since may in the field of allowances
over the last few years the members allowances have been reduced er have been UNK quite considerably on the amount that's been allowed
each year the amount has gone up by inflation and yet we see something approaching thirty thousand UNK on previous years and here we are looking in the first year of this council to a at least a five percent overspend and er i wonder if we've erm excluded the time when there weren't many meetings at the beginning if we wouldn't have seen a considerably larger overspend
i'm in my own mind i'm sure this is due to a UNK of working parties extra committee meetings a and seminars and i personally think it's typical of when your party get anywhere near control that there is always more talking and less action but i do believe that we we're we are not looking good in the eyes of the public in this UNK of our own allowances
i think you've got to do something drastic at the end of last year a considerable number of working parties and committees were actually reduced or eliminated and i look at education and i look at the sub committees of education they've all been replaced by working parties now that meet more and more regularly
we can't go on paying ourselves that sort of money we can't go on and mr i know in a minute we'll talk about the number of people who attend committee meetings erm and sit in on them and that's increased considerably erm so i think it's important that we do get down to this problem we grasp the UNK and i believe that will mean that we start to look seriously at reducing the number of times members come and talk here and perhaps we let the officers get on with the action that they should be getting on with
thank you chairman erm i've heard what mr said then i think it is worth reminding ourselves that a significant number of members of this council are new to this council and it's therefore quite right and proper that in the first year of the business of this council that there should be a significant number of seminars and UNK to enable members to fully UNK themselves with the business of the council the working of the er operations of this council so that we can in fact make informed decisions er in the future
i entirely accept that if er four years on we were still doing the same thing that then they'd be er some erm requirement for er cutting back but i think it is also worth reminding ourselves that due to the action of this conservative government in er forcing the local government review er we are facing the UNK er of an additional full meeting of this council and indeed we have had to er respond to that government initiative
so it's by no means only er arising from the erm need to get on with the business of the council some of the work that we're facing at the present moment has been forced on us er through no fault of our own because of government action
thank you chairman i second er 's motion erm trying to be not political about this i got some figures from the er county council which indicate that from the first of april ninety two to the thirty first of december ninety two eighty six members attended committee meetings of which they were not members
from the first of april ninety three to the thirty first of december ninety three that figure is a hundred and sixty five so therefore it it's doubled in effect
now if you assume that they were paid somewhere between a half day allowance and a full day allowance you're probably looking at somewhere up towards fifteen hundred pounds
now there are occasions where members legitimately need to attend committees to speak to something in which they have an interest but the difficulty is that in the past when we had permanent chairman a member who wanted to attend the meeting had to ask the permission of that permanent chairman and there are occasions when that permanent chairman thought well there is no need for that member to attend and he has said no
in the present situation the officers find themselves in a very difficult position i cannot imagine an officer saying no to a member and this is what has happened if we run out of money then the very thing that we are seeking to do in other words to implement the democratic process to allow people to come to meetings and speak will go by the way and i can remember some time ago when i was a new member on here saying i would be prepared to attend property sub committee UNK as a deputy and not be paid and i was very UNK brought up by a friend in the labour group who said that's all right for you can afford it but it's not alright for some of us UNK we can't and the difficulty is if we run out of money and we either have to stop the allowances or we have to slash the allowances yeah knows who it was we have to slash the allowances then legitimately people will be able to say that the democratic process is being UNK because they are not going to be allowed to go to meetings and therefore i think that situations whereby a member UNK to speak to a an item a specific item and then stays on for a double length meetings and claims double length allowances that sort of thing has got to be stopped and also members attending just to nod approval at something that has happened that they've been associated with that should stop if they want to come they should come at their own expense
but if we're not careful the real people the real people who should be are going to be the losers because they would not be able to draw the attendance allowance which they need to attend
so i mean what i'm saying is that i think we should have a league table if you like of attendances i recognise that may not be popular but i think it's going to be one way of sorting out those people who attend every opportunity and sometimes just to pat an officer on the back
this is not something that attendances allowance should be should be used to pay for and i think that unless we look at it very carefully indeed and we perhaps get around to having a proper chairman for each committee instead of this sort of er UNK chart er we're going to be faced with lots of difficulties
i wish you two lots over there would get your act together so that people who chair the meetings were of the right UNK for a chairman and not just because it was their turn
hear
yes let's not open up the debate about UNK of meetings er got a couple more people
yes thank you chairman
obviously one of the er critical things is actually reduce the er length of time at meetings er with that in mind i'll be very quick
unclear
as i say when you become a councillor you do not do it for money i mean i think probably to be a better reason to become a councillor these days
it affects your job your job prospects your family life and the hidden costs such as letters telephone calls leaflets and the rest of it you do not do it for money
you seem to be sort of trying to encourage a guilt complex by this idea put forward by the conservatives which is not the case people should not feel guilty in trying to do the benefit that they can to benefit the people of wiltshire
and i also don't think that there's any need for this extra recommendation in most UNK that a question and that is to actually find out the expenses claim by individuals
written question or shall we give them a written answer
there's no need to actually to put it down as a recommendation that stays forever more there's just no need for it
the other things i'd like to put forward is the things that mr actually put forward the idea of reducing committee sizes reducing committee numbers
perhaps maybe a cut off time for when a meeting should finish which i think we'd all UNK love maybe that very common in business maybe it's about time we put it into council life as well so those of progress not trying to make people feel guilty but trying to serve the people they represent
mr
mr chair
erm i seem to find myself in this committee in a minority of one
it's a little like listening to those debates in parliament where parliament vote themselves extra salaries and i feel very uncomfortable in this process i thought i might be coming here this morning to disagree with my own group or those members of them that don't agree with me perhaps joined with the conservatives in opposing this motion but i find in fact that everybody is saying oh let's put up the er the heading i feel very uncomfortable with this having spent six months in the budget review UNK officers up hill and down UNK every time that they exceeded their budget having told them that either they balance their budget or that they came in next year with a budget with no more than a one and a half percent increase or their UNK would be doing it for us
i feel very uncomfortable therefore to sit in a room full of members sitting here proposing to add five percent to the limit for members allowances simply because we've been unable to control our own behaviour and to come in within that i think it's a very poor example and it's an example that i'm not prepared to set
i am going to vote against the motion i'm disappointed with the liberal group not come in with a more constructive amendment or even a proposal as i would say asked you to do
i'm even more disappointed in the conservatives for not opposing it i don't object to their list of members being published i don't see that would do any harm as far as i'm concerned every employee could have their wages printed up on the wall
we are elected by the public to do a job and we shouldn't be ashamed of the amount of money that we're paid for it and what i would say is that no manifesto in UNK election said we were going to come here and vote for more money for members nobody put on their leaflets vote for me and i will raise members allowances by five percent in the coming year i didn't and i won't support that and you will argue perhaps some of you that that's not really what we're doing but it UNK like it doesn't it
and i think it's close enough to looking like it that the public may believe it and i hope the public won't believe it but certainly i'm not prepared to allow them to think it of me and therefore i will vote against the motion
okay mr
thank you mr chairman just one point mr we're not voting ourselves five percent more we're taking five percent off next year's allowance and putting it to this one so it's a negative UNK so we're actually spending some of next year's money this year
the point i'm going to make is that erm if we aren't going to get through the year and we're all going to have to take a percentage of our march allowances because the money's run out and we're cash limited even if we give ourselves five percent extra erm could i get an assurance from the officers that the people that haven't put in their forms will get a note to remind them to do so that everybody is in there you won't suddenly find that because you haven't had your claim form in by the fourteenth you're gonna get nothing and everybody else is gonna get something
thank you i think actually we've been debating mr 's amendment which seems to have widespread approval and i was ready to put that to the vote
mr
i was just going to settle up to you that was it
i think that just a few points that needs to be made
first of all i think at the end of the day that we all know a democracy never comes cheap it's erm there are cheaper alternatives for UNK decisions but erm but UNK doesn't go well and therefore democracy will never come cheap
i do agree that there are some particular areas this year that are for concern
there has been i think has put it adequately very well that there are members who've turned up really for no real reason but to speak on a minor item which members of their group could've taken on their behalf and therefore erm i do support that we need to look at that particular issue and i think that can be dealt with under the present chairs arrange arrangement without having to have permanent chairs
i also support the proposal to have a list published i know who's gonna be top of the list it's possibly going to be me and i'm not ashamed of that so erm let's go ahead and do it UNK it is public money and the public have a right to know where that money's going so i'm not ashamed of that
i think that also that said to me at the point that there is people need to er be paid attendance because otherwise you deny people the opportunity to be able to stand for council there otherwise you are going to end up with those that are either rich or retired as the only people who can attend a council which and therefore we must remember that and make sure those who want to have the opportunity to participate in local government are actually UNK for their for their erm for their work
okay taking a vote on mr 's amendment which is to ask officers to publish a list of allowances claimed i think that's all allowances but not UNK not UNK and including travel and subsistence
okay not travel
for the years ninety one two ninety two three ninety three four
those in favour of that amendment please show
and the against
and that is carried before taking the motion
amendment which i hope will financial control which is that the of financial services shall have no discretion to accept claims for the financial year ninety three ninety four submitted after the thirtieth of june nineteen ninety four that effectively means that two month rule which he does have discretion on he will not have in the case of late claims in this financial year that means we'll know exactly what the figures are by the thirtieth of june
can i put that does anybody want to debate that
i thought actually we had a standing order already that claims had to be in within a certain time limit
yes
and i believe that three months is the time limit
two months
two months but he had discretion
well oh i see you're removing the discretion ke
in this particular case we're removing that discretion to try and tie the year down
right well debated
do you want to speak on that
yes i would if i may
can i just reassure mr that if actually we were not er if we were discussing an increase in members allowances then i would be fair square with him
we're in a position where we're going to borrow a bit from next year that actually puts the pressure on as i see it's about nine or ten thousand extra this year the allowance is about a hundred and eighty thousand the total erm we're adding nine or ten thousand to that we're taking it off it for next year so we've already got ourselves something like an eighteen to twenty thousand reduction in members allowances next year so the pressure is on to resolve the problem and er perhaps mr might feel that actually that extra pressure might make us resolve it
i got the dates wrong it's the thirtieth of may that's two months after the end so the amendment i'm moving
thank you er mr
on the amendment on the amendment as you're seeking to amend standing orders is this committee able to do that
i think the particular point about the two month rule which may be extended at the discretion of the director which obvious taking his discretion away i don't think that's a standing order
yeah i don't think it's a standing order sir i think its part of erm i'm just trying to find it it's part of the UNK allowances and this committee is charged with dealing with UNK allowances
can i put that to the vote say aye
aye
well now i think and i think we may i would say that erm i improving the qualified budget as well but there's no doubt i put the motion to the vote those in favour please show
aye
and the against
agenda item eight mr 's appointment to the sub committee of the west regional association with deaf for the deaf should be an approved duty for the payment of travelling and subsistence allowances only
on the grounds that this is erm now appropriately remote from the county council's work
mr
yes chairman i think that before you UNK that motion you might have UNK as to the circumstances of this and everything that UNK it
er it is not just an additional committee on the part of the west region it is in fact the total reorganisation of a number of meetings and getting down to a far more business like thing
erm in the past the constitution of the west region association has allowed for it's council to meet twice a year one of those was an a g m and for an executive committee to meet four times a year
the representation is three people per authority it could be three members sometimes it's two members and an officer
very few counties apart from wiltshire have ever actually sent three
most of those have attended at an a g m once a year
the membership of an executive has been one member from each county
i've served on that one and the whole business of the organisation has generally speaking been run by the executive and not by a full council
therefore there's been no real problem on this one as far as allowances
that has now decided that it will have one meeting of it's council a year which will be it's a g m it has not for the moment elected an executive committee
it has put in it's place a er a general purposes and finance sub committee this is this one referred to it has not made allowances for who shall serve on it per county all it did it called it together very quickly and to cut costs to authorities it's based the meetings in bristol instead of exeter and it was suggested by the chairman of w r a d that perhaps any volunteers coming onto it erm would in fact come from the surrounding counties
now the membership of this particular er special purposes committee if you like erm is the core officers and three other members and they called for volunteers and one came from UNK one came from UNK put his name forward from wiltshire
now i am one of the officers on there which gives two members from wiltshire a seat on this particular committee
however we have no executive committee and we have only one other meeting a year erm if you i would like you to suggest that if you accept this restructuring of er the organisation and the fact that the members will not be attending other meetings during the year you might see fit to allow the attendance allowance on this particular sub committee
thank you er mr that was quite erm was quite informative very
i just wanted to check what the position of the old executive committee of the w r a d which been appointed whether that was in fact erm something that qualified for a full allowance
miss
yeah but i mean i was just erm i found that very informative as well i was very disappointed that if that much money er information was available that we were not given it as members because it would have made decision making far more sensible but erm
i as an amendment as i am involved in the attendance allowance
er i must i always claim the attendance allowance when it has been as executive as i've been the one member from wiltshire attending
whenever there's been officers get together then w r a d itself paid for my travelling expenses and i have never claimed that from the authority as i didn't believe that was proper
but as the organisation has seen to be when it meets generally speaking the council and the executive are one and the same dealing with exactly the same business i've considered it a meeting of the organisation and the organisation now basically is going to be the seven sub committee plus an annual general meeting of it's full council
miss
well i mean i think er from i mean certainly i don't know how you feel chairman but my view of this has changed if what mr says is correct then it seems that this seems that this is the basic sort of day to day decision making erm group erm and far more central to the purposes of w r a d than previously appeared and there would seem to me therefore to be some case of paying an attendance allowance or else erm UNK the decision erm until we have even more information but i think if it really is the sort of decision making bit then attendance allowance ought to be paid
who seconds
i'm happy to second
members please show and the against
the members say aye
aye
against
attendance allowances for members i would move that er a scheme be commenced from the first of april ninety four and that the wording attached to the paper be altered in two respects in place of the phrase is a person over sixty nine years of age the words is an elderly person and more significantly at the end of paragraph four and normally lives with a member as part of the UNK family and be able to be left at th be unable to be left UNK be added and that er power to delegate a director of financial to amend the rates of allowances from time to time rates of attendance allowance for members and that the scheme be met from the overall UNK allowance to which we recently referring
okay miss
erm yes well i'm very glad you've moved the amendments about the scheme
i don't quite know what's what happened because i remember very well UNK these details the last time it came to policy and resources and that was agreed because the changes you have made use the working wording of the thamesdown scheme it seems to me far better erm as you have moved it because er very many people who are elderly who are sixty nine years or more or less don't need any supervision at all
erm indeed some eighty ninety year olds don't need any supervision on the other hand some people in their early sixties may need to be looked after and you know i don't fancy the idea of anybody being able to claim allowances because they've fit granny erm on the other hand anybody who needs to ought to be able to and i think this wording UNK that
thank you chairman
erm i shall oppose er your motion erm on two grounds
erm firstly we are looking at carers for employees and we're unlikely to come up with very much because we haven't got much money to do it
and yet we are seeing as members coming back to mr 's point making a setting an example which is opposite to that which we force on our employees
and the other one is financial
if members allowances are a hundred and eighty thousand this year which is somewhere around there mr may correct me but i think i'm not too far out we've already UNK those this year to a hundred and eighty nine so next year there'll be a hundred and seventy one and the thirteen thousand cost of this will reduce it to a hundred and fifty eight i actually don't think that is possible we can't afford it within the terms of the present set up unless someone's going to dramatically reduce the length and the number of meetings in this council which i think is highly unlikely i think we've got to set a good example to our employees i think that this would give completely the wrong message
we're looking after ourselves er but we're not prepared to look after them and i'm afraid i have to oppose it
i'll just make a UNK point i've got a sick dog but i see that isn't er covered
yeah well mr
what point in having i suppose it's my fault i should have read these erm bits added to it more carefully earlier but it doesn't seem to have anything in their about anybody who is actually claiming a UNK allowance from looking after somebody at the time and whether we should have a phrase in there that it doesn't include anybody that is collecting from the d s or anything else for a UNK allowance anyway because you don't want to double pay anybody
mr
thank you chair
i'm slightly disappointed in erm 's attitude especially his last comment even though i'm sorry to hear that he's got a sick dog at the moment
erm i know that for many that people will find this very helpful
i believe there's two aspects to this
there's the firstly that of young children and it's something that i remember putting a motion to in the last administration about a UNK or whatever or looking into this facility in the fact of erm trying to encourage more people with young families to erm actually get involved in local government and politics
but i think there's also the other end of the scale which is which is what you've slightly amended this year is the fact of elderly people erm i know recently that myself have gone through the fact of my gran had er was going through a very sick period and if she'd have come back home it would have been very difficult for me to have had to look after her at the same time as trying to attend my council duties and this would have been the same for my dad and the additional income which this would have brought to have paid someone to be able to look after her whilst we were at council meetings and you can remember that these meetings sometimes go on you can say well this meeting should be over by one o'clock then it goes on till three o'clock or whatever and then peop the problems mount up for that person left on their own and i think that those things have to be taken into consideration and i believe that this is the first step forward in trying to recognise that people have responsibilities outside of the council chamber
thank you mr
thank you very much mr chairman i would like to endorse what mr has said erm i assume that this UNK allowance is aimed primarily er at er women with dependant children
erm and i feel very strongly and i urge members to consider that we should support this as a matter of principle to help er that group of our society i me i was going to suggest an amendment that we ask for the average age of this council erm
to be published along with the expense claims
yes to be published along with the expense claims
although joking apart i urge members to support this on principle i think we should put this in and then it will have to be considered next year how where the money will come from and i think that we should establish it that married women with dependant children will get some allowance to help them to stand and represent their communities
thank you
sorry i'd better re er remove the word married women with dependent children should be helped to represent their communities
thank you
yes i'd p i would personally prefer the word people or parents
no i just a cover note i think it's quite true that this is one of the small steps one can make to make it a little bit more possible for people with UNK to take a full part in local government and the majority of the people who are excluded at the moment are in practise erm women with dependent children but there are many other people including men and including people with dependent elderly relatives and i think we need to make it the rule rather than the exception that local government has a UNK allowance scheme
i'm confident that the scheme won't cost anything like as much as the estimate but i'm sure it's right that it's been having done some background work to see how many people might claim it i'm confident that we've UNK on the safe side here by a substantial amount and that's why i'm sure it can be met from the overall budget
but i would agree with mr that it does add a further pressure it means we have to have a real review of erm how we pay allowances in order to stay within our budget limit which i think is two hundred and two thousand for the current year and erm a little bit more for next year according to the previous paper
did you want to come in mr
thank you chairman
erm i wanted to pick up the point mrs said i don't think this will necessarily this will be one of those allowances which people will er claim on a regular basis
er i am UNK chairman that i embarrassed you UNK at the end of education meeting on friday erm and i know that i have a circumstance coming up in february where i have a child who is UNK on a training day erm on a day where i actually have two meetings of this council now either i get UNK or we arrange for a one off carer situation
now i'm not for a UNK i'm not for a moment suggesting that it's something that would be picked up on a regular basis but i think it does mean as you rightly say that er if such a procedure does arise then i'm conscious that i'm in a one off situation i know there's at least one of our colleagues on our benches who has this on with children on a more regular basis
erm i think we will encourage er people with dependants to play a more active role in the er business of this council and in i think it is something that is worth er considering and it is worth carrying forward
i i'm very sad to learn that the committee may not fee feel quite so constrained to assist er employees
i think er we need to er look at this issue of carers far more UNK and i'm very sad that the government having made a great play about back to basics and er encouraging family values erm are not in fact prepared er to do something to er UNK unemployment by encouraging employers to make adequate provision to ensure that people with dependants can actually work
okay i'll put the motion to the vote those in favour please show and the against
that is carried
nine one supplementary capital estimates of the magistrates court
letter circulated this morning from officers to amend the figure i think all members should have had that and i will move that a capital supplementary estimate of fifty five thousand and four pounds be approved for expenditure on the UNK court services described in the report and in the letter circulated this morning
chairman you've got to allow me because by the time i've finished you won't be able to stop me er but i mean if there's a lot of money floating about in this area then i think that er some committee or other should be looking at the refurbishment of the courts in UNK which are a disgrace and partly the fault of this council when th they were allowed to get into such a state and i mean at some stage or other something or else is gonna to have to happen to them and i would hope that the magistrates in their wisdom in some committee or other are deciding to take these courts back into use
thank you mr
we don't have much control over what the UNK court committee do as we could tell from our efforts to appeal against the closure of some other UNK courts erm anybody else on this subject i'll put this to the vote really since it's a UNK
it's a pure UNK mr chairman but i did ask at the previous meeting er that the erm director of property services respond to me on a matter relating to UNK court if we have such a large amount of money that we can spend i think the questions that i posed then er are relevant and i would appreciate a reply
er mr erm i think your point is covered in the next item on the agenda where there is a reference to twenty five thousand included the ninety three four budget for UNK
can i put this to the vote
those in favour please show and the against that is agreed
nine two you have a paper from the which is a copy of the paper th that the director of financial services submitted to the UNK court committee management board a response from the UNK courts management board for the county council erm i will move to note the response of the UNK courts committee and to confirm our previous recommendation to the county council regarding this part of the policy resources committee budget
those in favour please say aye
aye
and the against that is carried
item ten which i think is the UNK committee budget i will move to accept the UNK committee's budget and to agree an increased county council contribution of twenty six thousand pounds
aye
i see nobody wishing to speak those in favour please show any against
that is agreed
right for the next item members will need to note the statements from the joint trade unions liaison committee and the non domestic rate payers group and to find item twenty one two today's papers the minutes of the budget review sub committee meeting held on the eighteenth of january agenda item twenty two brackets one
there's a recommendation from the budget review sub committee for us to deal with at er minute seven little at the bottom of page two
the fifth paragraph of that has the proposed council tax bands the county council services but these have been amended by a letter you've been sent dated the twenty first of january as a result of information from council regarding their tax base
and i will move from the chair to recommend the county council erm as shown on page three that is to say paragraphs little one little two little three little four and little five with the amended band figures
and i would like to say thank you to the people who sit on the budget review sub committee a committee which actually i don't attend as often as i probably ought to particularly to the labour UNK for the way he's guided the committee both from within the chair and at other times on it's work this year to be able to propose a budget which erm so well UNK the aims that many of us had when we were elected in may which were of course to maintain services er to squeeze efficiency out of the UNK into the system and squeeze any waste out and to get our officers working towards zero base budgets
and to a very large degree that has been erm achieved and i think that erm the prospects for the county council for ninety four five are now much better than they appeared to be a year ago and er i think the prospects for ninety five six will need to be looked at through the budget review sub committee and this committee at an early stage and i'm sure that the UNK like way in which it's addressed it's business is a good sign for the future
i would like to thank all the members erm who've served on that committee and indeed the officers who've worked for it because a lot of the background work and a lot of the er consultation with departments has been necessary to get us to the erm reasonably satisfactory stage we're at considering the UNK extremely severe restrictions on government ex er on local government spending er resulting from the cap
that's UNK a few hands
i'll take mr
you're getting me worried
you UNK two of my members on friday another one today you after them or something
can i thank you for those generous comments that you say towards er i think they're totally true he's worked extremely hard in making sure this council has a budget which balanced and it's due to his expertise and bullying tactics that we've succeeded and he should be fully UNK for that and i think it's the determination of those who were elected in may as well to make sure that we protected services and jobs and make sure that we actually carried out the mandate which the UNK elected us to do that we have such UNK achieved what we have achieved today
er mr
thank you chairman
i er you would not expect me to continue with the UNK which you were trying to create earlier and er i have to say that i suppose that you wouldn't er be proposing any different budget to this would you in the circumstances that you've got
but we wouldn't be starting at that at the point that you did because we did not would not have spent the approaching five million that you spent in the first er month or two of this council
we note that you have addressed the problem on social services in your re in your erm proposal er and that we we're grateful for
we were faced as you reminded me with a projected twenty four million pound shortfall
that projection of course took into account the fact that you'd raised the base and therefore you had extra money to find
but when you look carefully at where that twenty four million disappeared to you start to find the problems with your budget
there was a six million pound erm er difference on the s a assumption
there was an assumption that inflation would be higher than it was and that was cut back to one point five percent which i think that i would actually support was a sensible way forward
but there was a UNK projection of eleven point two million in that you're not funding that eleven point two million projection and we need to look underneath to what that means and that means that you're not funding schools and that is particularly secondary schools to the extent of a one million pound shortfall because the increase in pupil numbers
now we'll here very quickly from people who say that we've UNK more money to schools
we've UNK the money to schools but they've got to spend most of it back with the council here
what the thing of course is and we all know what it is it's an effort to UNK those secondary schools who've gone grant maintained but they don't get the extra money they get a hundred pound a pupil less
don't shake your head mr read the letters that are coming to me from those schools like who can see the reduction in their budget next year
look at the police budget and we shall be discussing the police budget later on you had a windfall UNK on police pensions but we all know those police will retire at some time or other and when they do there is a commitment to their lump sum payments and their pensions
you've had a bit of luck there you might turn the other way next year and you might find that you've got an increased number of police retiring and if you have you're going to find extreme pressure on the police budget and you will see that there is the reductions that the chief constable told you he would have to make if that happened
you're already short funding the police budget without that factor as well
you've got a reduction in this budget of three and three quarter million pounds on highway maintenance
that actually is an awful lot of roads that are not going to be maintained in the coming year
you've reduced highway maintenance from six point two million down to er a figure of two point five
that's jobs that's where you say you want to support the private sector and the building trade to bring more jobs
that's an awful lot of jobs in that aren't going to be in wiltshire next year because you've reduced it and it's also a considerable reduction in the standard of our roads
i will be reminding you as the year goes on and the other items of pain start to appear in the budget that you would think you have so UNK put together and that with no problems
we will continue here reminding you mr chairman we will be opposing the budget that you have presented
mr
thank you chairman
er first point i'm not absolutely certain when you moved your proposal you moved from budget review the clauses one to five
i'm not sure that you also removed clauses c d and e from the order paper and if you haven't i'll so move
thank you i'll accept that amendment
members are clear what mr spotted which is that in addition to the from budget review we also need to agree some er effectively some UNK in c d and e of the recommendation laid out in pages two and three of the main agenda
i think that's what mr 's moved as an amendment and i'm happy to accept that so that forms part of
thank you chairman
i mean wha what i would like to go on and say is that er which the change of administration it has been necessary to er adopt a different way of developing the budget and i think you're quite right to erm pay credit to the effort of the er budget review er sub committee
i think we also need to recognise that there has also been a er high level of er commitment from er officers employed by this council to achieving the changes that we have asked in terms of financial management now i'm not going to pretend for a moment that er we've gone all the way there yet
but i think in the few months that this administration has er has been in office it is encouraging to see that the county council is operating inside the budget er which i believe was actually set by the previous administration erm er over which we had no influence whatsoever
now clearly we're not going to pretend that there aren't going to be problems in the future that we may have to address
not least i think the er if the government find themselves faced with much higher pay er settlements erm as a result of the deliberations of the pay UNK bodies
i for one will be most curious to see how the chancellor of the exchequer UNK out of that particular i issue
but nonetheless i think we as county councillors can be proud of the fact that we have set a spending target for committees we are prepared to allow the officers to manage their departments inside the targets that have been set and that does mean that they have to look at er what they're spending and create priorities and i as a councillor am not in the least bit impressed by arguments that paper UNK have increased by five and a half percent this year and that felt l er pe felt line erm pens have gone up by seventeen and a half percent i think that's largely irrelevant consideration we're not in the business of UNK budget we're in the business of providing money to deliver high quality services to the people of wiltshire
i think the people of wiltshire recognise that we have been able to set a budget that enables all the departments to have more money in real terms to spend on delivery of service for next year and i think that's something that we can some credit in and i think it does reflect a new partnership between councillors officers and those that are delivering services to the public across the county
thank you er mr
thank you mr chairman
it might not surprise you that it's the highways budget that concerns me
erm i think it's a false economy to cut on maintenance you only leave trouble there you're putting off the problem for our UNK
the young people following us will have to pay for our mistakes if we cut on maintenance now
and i do i'm more concerned with the lack of capital in maintenance that'll we'll we're going to have on the roads and infrastructure this year i think there's always a reason to put a little bit of capital maintenance into both our buildings and our roads
it needs to be done now and it's going to cost us more if we leave it till later on that point i can't agree with your budget so i'm afraid it's roads that put me against it
well i will just come in here because i think mr wants to get his figures a bit more accurate
i don't think even in our UNK dreams we managed to spend an extra five million in the first few weeks of this council i remember a couple of million going into schools and few hundred thousand for voluntary organizations and er and old people's homes
but the other figure i think he's he'll have to UNK is his figure on highways structural maintenance because in fact two and a half UNK in the base budget and one and a half UNK in the approved list of thirty seven bids at er priority number two
it seems to me entirely up to him if he so wished and his group if they felt there needed to be more money spent on highways structural maintenance to have moved other bids up to priority order when discussing the capital budget
and i do think it's unfortunate when people try and confuse capital and revenue expenditure in order to try and er support their own rather weak political position
erm but it's impressive that he now feels we should be allowed to spend more money to create jobs because of course a lot of us have been trying to point that out for years to the governments which UNK cap authorities so they can't actually carry out the infrastructure improvements that are needed to enable the economy and the society to function properly
i'll call mr to
thank you chair thank you particularly for your kind words they are appreciated
erm doesn't a lot change in a year really or even in six months
in may mr and his group had the opportunity to vote with us in spending another two million pounds on the education system of this county and now he is complaining only six months later that we aren't spending enough and i think we've said before the conservatives have and continue to have the opportunity for action but they will not support their words with deeds
erm we've seen it also through the budget process where all the way through and it's been a very open process we have no alternative proposals from the conservative group they have complained and have criticized but they have offered no alternatives
this morning they offer no alternatives other than to spend more
i mean it might as well be perhaps i don't know UNK council in the nineteen seventies that they are representing along with john major there
they're simply asking for more money to spent with no concerns about the value for money and surely it was the conservatives who used to tell us ten or fifteen years ago that you couldn't judge the quality of a service by the amount of money spent on it
the fact that we are providing the services for wiltshire that they were providing and we're providing them for less money is surely something to be UNK
we all know that the task we've set the officers is to manage within the budgets they've been given and to have no cuts in services and no compulsory redundancies and thi this is their challenge and this is what they seem to be achieving and i think we should applaud them for that
i think we should note that in the current year and you've corrected mr that it's three million pounds extra that we've spent even though we've spent three million pounds extra in may with our decisions then to restore the sheltered workshops and to give more money to education and to keep elderly peoples homes open
even though we spent that money we are projected to come in with balances of three million pounds in excess of the budget figure set by the conservatives and that is a six million pounds difference that's come straight out of the twenty four and i think it tells us two things
one is that the then conservative group and i think by reflection the current conservative groups since everybody sitting here was here last year don't know enough about budgeting to set a budget for a county council and it also tells us that they don't know enough about managing a county council to manage even a budget that they have set
and it surely is som something that the people of wiltshire can be glad that they made the right decisions in may that they haven't got that administration
hear
i think also the people of wiltshire will be glad that it us here setting the budget and therefore the UNK and their council tax next year and something that people will be looking at is their council tax bills and noting that they go up by six point three percent or are proposed to with the provisional assets aim which is set by the government
and people may be wondering why they're going up by so much when after all the s a and that is the figure that we're restricted to set by the government is only going up by three point three percent and half of this is for care in the community money so that all that care in the community money remember pound for pound in that it's added to our budget is knocked off the budget of social security that is not any extra money spent on people
so in reality our s a is going up about one and a half percent and as you know our budget has gone up about one and a half percent so why is the council tax going up six point three percent
well as usual it's all there in the papers that mr has prepared for us if anybody cares to read them and you will notice the national non domestic rate the business rate as it's known the contribution that the government are passing on from the business rates paid in wiltshire back to the people of wiltshire is dropping by seven point nine million pounds it's being cut from a hundred and eighteen point six to a hundred and nine point three million pounds and again this is pound for pound
pound for pound it's coming off the people of wiltshire and it's going to fund kenneth UNK budget deficit
kenneth clarke has UNK the people of wiltshire of that money
that's nine point three million pounds of business rates and i'm sure i'm not the only person here that pays business rates in wiltshire and i haven't noticed any sign that my rate bill are going down course they're not
the government is taking the money and it is not paying it back to the people of wiltshire
now if we had actually received a one point five percent increase in the business rates we could have cut the council tax
so we could have reduced that and i think that is the criticism that i make of the conservatives not that the conservatives in this council have done that but that they should be UNK for it
they should be standing here now as the party of high taxation and saying sorry to the people of wiltshire for supporting kenneth clarke and his team for supporting john major and his team and they should be saying sorry for the part that we pa played in lying to the electorate at the last general election
hear
well follow that erm
i think that er i'll be very brief because a lot of it's already been said and you've already mr chairman picked up mr on his dodgy figures erm with his five million erm because what that was about just under three million was actually fulfilling our election UNK which is something we have UNK failed to see from this conservative government
erm mr goes on about UNK items of pain in a really rather sort of strange way erm the only reason why there's any pain in this budget is because of the constraints that this tory government is putting on us
and if we were able to make a budget erm without the constraints of the s a and so on we would not erm you know and without the cuts of business rates as mr said there wouldn't need for any pain anyway
erm we have as you would have seen and has already been noted erm balances considerably higher than the seven million we've previously set at the at the moment and these will erm be able to make provision if necessary for police pay should happen to be higher than er we are told than the one point five percent which has something that people have raised with me and erm have said that oh of course you lose grants if you don't decide it now but that is not in fact the case
erm i think that we have a very UNK sensible budget proposed here and i trust that every sensible councillor will support it
i oh i'm sorry i didn't see you
erm could i go back to what mr was saying of course the main thing is really that er the difference in this budget and previous ones is that we are not paying projection costs million
erm what mr very carefully very carefully failed to mention of course is that the rates of has in fact gone up by eleven point one percent
very UNK not mentioned
yes i the
can we erm can we move on
the motion i moved needs to be adjusted because of our decision on the probation committee earlier
little three erm where the reference to drawing from balances is made
that figure needs to go up by twenty six thousand to read nought point two three one million and what's left needs to go down by twenty six thousand at ten one four o million
erm i'll put the motion to the vote which consists of the whole of paragraph b of the budget review sub committee's recommendation with this being a recommendation to the county council and with paragraphs c d and e from the original agenda paper
those in favour please show and the against
that is carried
thank you very much
er item twelve
i'm going to take these two together that's twelve one and twelve two
twelve one deals with the recommendation for economic developments and tourism sub committee er the er projects and twelve two with the er capital budget report from the director of financial services which is in the budget book i refer to the recommendation on these items from the budget review sub committee which is in their minutes at agenda item twenty two one at the bottom of the third page and going over to the fourth erm a number of paragraphs
and erm i'll move those recommendations from the budget review sub committee a b c d e f g and h
in doing so i would erm particularly like to say how much i appreciate the success of the bid in erm as an example of county counties working together erm and indeed officers working together and indeed of getting a positive response from the government
i think from time to time little bits of the government do work reasonably well and do respond reasonably well to county council and local authority initiatives and although i couldn't pretend that a hundred and that twenty five thousand pounds is going to solve the unemployment problem in wiltshire nor indeed solve the problem being created by the run down of defence industry nevertheless i think credit should be given where UNK due
a lot of credit is due to our officers in this respect for er securing the success of that bid and indeed for securing a back up capital resource facility in the unlikely event that we don't get the supplementary credit approval er for the er for the expenditure
so i've moved the motion anybody wish to speak on this item
okay those in favour please show and the against
nobody else er agenda item thirteen treasury report
aye
thank you
agenda item fourteen i recommend that the county council approve the recommendations of eleven a b and c
aye
those in favour please say aye
aye
and the against that is carried
item fifteen i move to approve the supplementary capital estimate of twenty five thousand pounds for the st mary's infant school special nursery unit
those in favour please say aye
aye
and the against that is carried
item sixteen the district auditors management letter and audited accounts for ninety two ninety three
mr
thank you chair chairman
i have a particular over the management letter and i'm sure mr will be aware that in fact i refer of course to the facilities management contract
erm this management letter was distributed er to all of us so i suppose some of us at least will have read it
and the district auditor is particularly concerned
he says i remain concerned that it is not yet possible to agree an implementation plan for recommendations made in his previous report
now this is in his key messages and towards the back there are two pages where he UNK that many promises were made for the facilities management contract and in particular erm he says it is still the case that work to take advantage of the development UNK facility has not yet been identified now i think this is the thing we spent a million pounds on it and are not using it
and he says that progress towards down UNK has not yet been planned to meet the target deadline within the con within the contract
now how long ago was that contract
eighteen months
and this is a letter dated a couple of months ago is it
erm what's been going there
now the facilities management contract is being held up by mr as an example for the property out UNK
well i don't think it's a very good example if it's being criticized
perhaps it's the kind of example in the same way that westminster council was held up as an example and it's now being criticized by the district auditor
erm perhaps it will be mr 's policy to UNK all district auditors that their findings are not worth erm UNK with
well i don't suppose this UNK costing us twenty one million but it's costing us several million and i would hate to think that er any of that is being wasted or not spent in the best possible way and i would therefore recommend chair that we refer the matter of the facilities management contract to the budget review sub committee for consideration of the way it's not being implemented
right thank you
referring to paragraphs one hundred and four to one hundred and nine saying miss also wishes to comment on this
erm yes i do very much indeed
i'm extremely disappointed that erm we don't seem to make any progress towards getting the savings erm that erm we were promised
i hesitate to suggest i mean that i'm quite happy to support what mr is saying because i really hesitate to suggest UNK the old computer and financial services working party because i think that was probably my most miserable experience on this council with the single exception of the budget review er parallel or whatever it was when it was led by
erm but it seems to be the case that when there are not councillors here UNK away at officers saying why isn't it working nothing happens it all gets sort of forgotten or something
and we've got to do something about it we were promised these savings there aren't any it doesn't look as if anybody's working awfully hard to get them and i'd like to know why not and what's going on and i'm quite happy to support what mr proposes that we refer it all to budget review
you might have noticed there is an officer response
mr
can i just say sir we are er the manager is preparing a report tonight plans a report for the february the twenty second meeting of policy resources committee on the first well it's not the first year first UNK of the f m contract and dealing with these points of the
it started at the end of march it's the first nine months it's the first UNK of the erm the f m arrangement and your members will be getting a report in february on that
mr
you would expect me to defend it wouldn't you chairman and i will
i still remain convinced that the that the contract that we wrote and we undertook remains the right
i don't know where mr UNK his ideas from
but there UNK we undertook remains the right
no chair i would very much like it to be looked at in great detail by the budget review committee actually you'll see in the report that many of these problems were identified as areas of concern by the district auditor prior to the signing of the contract and he was given it seems various assurances which may or may not have been met and i would like to go into much more detail than would be possible with this committee
i'm actually thinking in terms of an hour or two with the responsible manager reporting in detail to the budget review committee
we're talking about a lot of money here that has been spent and has continued to be spent and the sooner we get it sorted out the better and i'd like to see it on the agenda of the next budget review committee which would prior to the policy committee i believe next and so we could perhaps UNK er mr 's report with some findings of our own
right now i'm told that the report to next policy committee is coming anyway it won't be ready for the next budget review but you'd like erm so cou perhaps you'd better word your motion so that the officers completely clear as to what you're proposing
yeah i i'm suggesting that the facilities management contract be referred to the budget review sub committee for consideration and in that way we can actually consider it and obviously if the report is not yet prepared erm perhaps we can put some input into it i have to say that it UNK me to be given an answer that don't worry everybody there's a report coming and then we suddenly say well we might like to look at it in three weeks time we're told actually it's not written yet
that was seconded i think by mr
right well i mean i think it it's actually quite UNK by the fact that i don't think there actually is a firm date for the budget review before the next p and r anyway
erm but i think p er budget review or somebody needs to have a look at it if you've got budget review and you've got people who most of the people who were on the old working party know the background there anyway seems as good a place as any to look at it
i mean i actually voted for this contract erm rather UNK but it seemed better than not doing so at the time but we were given assurances and it was very well understood by absolutely everybody that UNK management would be needed in order to achieve the UNK and that was the only way that the savings were going to be made and it does seem that erm that has not been going on
i would support what mr was saying
yes we have a small problem with the dates that's all
the budget review sub committee has a provisional date of thursday the third of february which was in the minds of members and officers to deal with anything urgent that needed to be dealt with before county council budget making
erm i'm happy to take mr 's view on this
whether he wants to get f m onto the agenda and firm that up as a date for a meeting
well i think it's that's a meeting that we were thinking of not having unless there was some sort of panic caused by yet another change of the government's position on budgets
so it's still in UNK isn't it
what i'm suggesting really is let's get it on the agenda for budget review whenever the next meeting is to be considered in depth and if that gives an extra couple or three weeks for officers to write the report fine if it goes beyond the next policy and resources a week or two won't matter in the scheme of things it's detailed consideration i'm looking for rather than a fast fix in ten minutes at the next p and r
okay everybody clear what the motion is
those in favour please show and the against any further points on the district auditor's reports
miss
erm yes
i would like to draw attention particularly in the light of the next item on the agenda er to paragraph erm paragraph forty two to forty five talking about environmental management
erm in particular in paragraph forty four
he is er strongly er suggesting that we ought to be rather more pro active than we either are or than anybody is suggesting that we ought to be in the paper at number seventeen
and i'd just like to raise this now because i'll be saying more when we get to seventeen
thank you miss
erm mr
thank you
i would like to erm talk to ninety three on page thirty one and er this is education UNK primary school education
i think there's er a dispute er erm that's my er choice of words between the district auditor and ourselves over this
and i think that it might be useful mr chairman to emphasize the fact that we are a rural county and a rural county has specific rural problems er and i don't think that the district auditor has recognized the particular problems that we have er in a rural county
so i wonder whether er as UNK er a matter arising out of this erm er the director of education could erm er perhaps address this issue and put forward a paper to the next education committee
well i think i will ask the director of education to comment on that paragraph because to a large degree the district auditor's report that he refers to there in his section matters previously raised his report entitled UNK primary school education was published in december nineteen ninety one and it is being addressed through a working party of the education committee which involves representatives from the church as well as of the political groups
but i do think that the district auditor is beginning to be presented as a UNK man erm UNK in the faces of people in rural areas as a sort of threat that even if the council doesn't want to close your school it might and i think that probably isn't a very proper use of the district auditor's image nor of his report and i think perhaps some direct contact with him er to show what progress we're making paragraph by paragraph and what we think of that report from december ninety one probably needs to be made
but i will ask UNK the director to re respond to you on this mr er did you want to also put this to vote
no well i i'll ask them to hang for mr
chairman ye yes it is a recurring theme of the district auditor an and i told him in the past that erm where this council has a policy that they would support village schools and keep them open wherever possible erm that decision had been discussed and er i have to remind that i did remind the district auditor that he doesn't have to get elected every four years as some of us do and er those in rural areas know very well that is the way not to get elected to be talking about shutting village schools
but he doesn't acknowledge and what this is what i find concerning the fact that we have in some areas of the county amalgamated schools into a new school west UNK and UNK for example and taken surplus places out
in the UNK area we we've built UNK first school into an UNK and we took surplus places out so we have done something and he doesn't seem to even acknowledge that which i find concerning
i doubt whether the working party will get any further than recommending the status quo because i'm absolutely sure in my own mind that it is a duty that this council has to support village schools where the parents support them and where they're UNK beneficial to support them in the village communities because they are they have other importance than just education
they are also a centre of the village
dr
thank you chairman
erm if i could just bring the committee up to date on one or two things that have happened in relation to the district auditor's report
firstly er i could assure the committee that the working party on provision of secondary and primary places which is published by the education committee is taking the auditor's report very seriously and has been through it in detail and has er drawn up a programme of analysis erm over the next few months very much taking into account the district auditor's comments
there have been discussions both at education committee and at county council which relate to the district auditor's concerns er county council want a full discussion of course about the place of small schools in the county being a predominantly rural area
and also last friday at education committee there was a long debate both on the procedure which would be adopted by the working party in UNK it's remit and in particular the policy which it recommended regarding small schools and also an extended debate on one of the areas which was a subject of recommendation by the er district auditor which concerns the organisation of first and middle schooling in the UNK area and there the working party did look very specifically at the recommendation that was made by the district auditor that decided on balance that wasn't likely to produce the best and most cost effective education in that part of the county
so i think that the er education committee has taken the report seriously and quite recently has looked at it in depth
the other thing perhaps i could just say chairman is that i did meet a representative of the district auditor last week to bring you up to date on the work which the education committee was doing
erm mr
thank you chairman
er throughout the management letter to members the district auditor er makes suggestions and indicates that he will be monitoring our progress on a number of actions
specifically i notice his comment in relation to the UNK controversy and also in relation to certain matters involving the police
erm i wonder if this is a matter which budget review might wish to keep on a continuing brief so that to satisfy themselves that the this council is in fact making progress and will be in a position to satisfy the district auditor in future years that we are er taking on board the comments that he's making and er moving forward
i'm conscious of the fact obviously that individual departments are taking them on board but i think we it is important that we actually do have a consistent approach and it might well be that budget review at some future meeting might want to consider the monitoring of progress in order to satisfy the district auditor in future events
i've looked for example erm to his comment on the police communications rooms which will actually have a significant impact on er the budget of the police committee in future years
yes i mean i think i don't want to come in there but i think the difference between the point that you've made mr and some of the others is the district auditor hasn't put a thing in a box
if he puts a thing in a box it means you really have got to read this and worry about it but i think he's fairly happy with the progress on police training and police communication arrangements
if it had been up to me you'd have one police communication room not two because i've worked in operations control and you want to have a single control room for your authority if any other system is less efficient than that
but i appreciate there were good operational reasons why he did what he did but that's just from my own experience
mr
thank you chairman
it's just that i think the district auditor knows what the cost of local schools is and not the value of local schools
what i and i having heard the director what i want to be clear about is that any decision which relates to closing local schools on economic grounds comes to the full county council and is not dealt with by education
if it doesn't come to the full county council then i will make sure it does but i one would hope that a decision such as that which is of UNK importance in a rural area would be taken by a full county council and not by education
well that would be a change in procedure i think i don't recall that the closure of UNK st james school was dealt with by county council but UNK st james was closed i don't think we can pretend in either way about that
and i voted i think if i had a vote that day i certainly voted in favour of that and so did members of all groups
some members voted against
but erm i certainly mr had the right through standing orders to ensure that er was er taken to county council wouldn't he
yes sir county council could make that decision it would first though have to consider a report from the education committee under the education act
it's all very hypothetical
mrs
thank you chair
i think education committee is quite capable of making those kinds of decisions and members erm that er are representing rural areas are allowed to come along to education committee and i think that's perhaps the better way to go along those lines
but i would like to point out the difficulties that the audit has the UNK the difficulties that the erm er local authorities have or local education authorities have in that the government are er the government UNK on taking up surplus places and this is inconsistent with their also with their UNK on choice and diversity in education and i think those points could be made quite clearly to the d f e some time or other
mr
thank you chair
can i echo the comments that people have made on the value of rural schools to villages
it's something i think everyone recognizes at their own that village school plays more than just the function of UNK children in small village communities
but there is the other argument that has to be taken off is that of there is money and i we all would like to say that we'd like to pour as much money into education as we feel we could spend
but it doesn't mean it's not reality says that's not possible because central government will not give us additional money to spend on education
therefore we're left with a certain pot and we must manage that the best way possible in providing the best education not only for children in village schools but in towns and every of large or medium size throughout this county
and why should the education of those who live in large towns suffer to finance UNK schools in rural areas of this county
i'm not saying that they are UNK but there may be the odd one or two cases like the of UNK st james is a fine example when it became UNK to maintain that school for the number of pupils which were attending or proposed to be taken in the near future and it was a sensible option for those children and economically to close that school
and that has to be maintained in the future
i don't support this blanket band of reducing surplus places for the sake of reducing surplus places like the district auditor and if quote right it's an accountant looking at erm looking at figures and nothing else and i think that is the problem with the issue erm we've seen in other schools in larger schools where they've developed erm classrooms into a decent library or resource area but in the in the in the overall spectrum they're still counted as classroom spaces and if that classroom was put back er in into a class the school would suffer environmentally because that school would have no library facilities no resource facilities which it's able to appreciate at the present time
i believe that this group the labour group will continue to support rural schools where we feel that they are viable and of benefit to the children
our arguments on friday and still are that we believe the two tier system is UNK beneficial than the three tier
but that argument we lost on friday and i'm not going to pursue it today
but what i we are not prepared to do is allow the schools that we represent to suffer just to maintain small schools in this county which are no longer economical or viable or UNK beneficial to the children that attend them
we are not prepared to stand by and let schools in areas that we represent get closed or re organised or whatever at the expense of small village schools which should be re organised or re UNK before schools in large urban areas
we will not take the UNK of the district auditor's reduction in surplus places
it has to be done UNK across the board in the rural and urban areas or else we will fight every tooth and nail to make sure that we our schools that we represent do not suffer
and i give that clear warning
the labour party in this county values the role of small rural schools but we are not prepared to see urban schools suffer to make sure that UNK rural schools are kept open for the sake of being kept open
can i remind members of a fact that in the sake of a county where there are more small schools there is four percent more spent on education in the south of the county than any other part of wiltshire
right erm i move that we er having dealt with the f m under a separate motion that we note the district auditor's report
those in favour please say aye
aye
and the against that's carried
item seventeen
well now i'll move the recommendations at seventeen and eighteen but erm i feel something further is required to try and get er our officers working with our committees on local agenda twenty one and indeed in bringing forward the environmental audit scheme
i don't want to have a working party but i'm wondering if we should lay down some sort of set of timetable and dates
mr
thank you UNK er mr chairman
er sorry
sorry about that er erm
actually i was yeah
erm it's just on the big print on the bottom of page one g two
er what's the point of UNK fuel for it's su er diesel fuel for it's sulphur content
it's much more economical both for th and good for the environment to buy low sulphur fuel
because you know it it's cheaper to run your vehicles on low sulphur diesel and it is because you don't get the UNK in it and it's better for the it's better for the atmosphere
so i would have thought would be better to buy low sulphur UNK diesel rather than analyse it and in c thirteen it worries me a little bit because i believe that the district councils are the drainage authorities with the right about land drainage and it was taken away from the county council several years ago
so are we actually putting our feet into what's being done by the district councils over c thirteen
i totally agree with what they're saying but i'm just worrying that we're trying to do the job that the district councils are supposed to do
i would wonder if mr 's questions need to be erm taken up with the chief public health inspector because i think that or it that appears to be or possibly the trading UNK standards trading standards officer neither of whom are here
erm because er it does seem that erm though we're not talking about our own fuel we're talking about testing other people's fuel and erm there's an it's an UNK point about district councils
miss
erm thank you chairman
yes i mean it's a nice report but it's erm it's not very sort of UNK or UNK is it
erm you know it's saying that UNK is a good thing but let's not UNK ourselves too greatly to do anything about it
erm
oh sorry i've got sex on the mind
erm i think you know when it says at the end towards the end of paragraph eleven talking about the environmental management scheme for local government could be UNK as tools to help improve the management framework for the councils UNK and initiatives in environmental matters
i would have felt much happier if the word had been will rather than could
erm it's quite clear from the district auditor's letter that he thinks that we're not being systematic enough about what we do about environmental improvements and it seems fairly clear to me to that if we just push the to the service committees erm nothing will ever happen except possibly on planning and that erm it will just sort of quietly disappear because it's not the top priority of any of the other service committees
and it's only if this committee decides to take a hand in pushing environmental issues forward that they will actually come about except almost by accident
and i would suggest therefore that what we ought to do is to ask not only for erm the service committees to have reports but for there to be erm a at some point a round up report of policy and resources
i don't know if we ought to put a timetable on that on what's going on this erm UNK management erm business but also i was wondering could we not ask for a report to the march or april meeting of this committee on what actions we could take to make progress on the recommendations of the district auditor in paragraph forty four
erm those are specifically that there should be a formal framework for monitoring the UNK of our policies that individual service committees should UNK individual policies based on consistent criteria and that there is the need to make staff aware of the UNK environmental policies
these are all things that we can take specific action some easier and cheaper than others to do something about
but i think we need to have a report to this committee saying what we could do and then we can decide what we will do
and i would like to move that is added to your recommendation mr chairman
er i think miss you're moving er an extra paragraph nineteen as it were to er that a report be made to shall we say the april meeting of policy and resources committee on progress in implementing the district auditor's recommendations er paragraph four
but what i specifically worded this what actions we could make could take to make progress
okay
because if you still want the answer to progress the answer will come back none
erm if you ask for what actions we could take then we'll have to work out a way of doing it
is everybody clear on that amendment which i'm happy to accept into er my motion
i call mr
thank you chair
erm i don't know if it's worth speaking now i i'd like to second everything that has said and what the auditors have said erm in the management arrangement
i do thank mr for this report but i would have liked to have seen that the chief executive had been a UNK to it as well
because
hear
it is something whi which affects the whole council it isn't the UNK of any particular service committee and though on environmental matters and public health matters another mi may be responsible and know more it is an overall policy which erm is being developed and needs to be erm needs to be brought into play
erm there is a need as said to make staff away of the authorities environmental policies
erm i dare say on all our staff our staff could make us more aware of environmental policies and you know are aware of erm the need for the environmental action erm than erm than the action we are taking ourselves
that er little action has been taken in the last thirty forty years since this has been being discussed erm i think the first international conference erm produced their own report in nineteen sixty
erm we had the UNK conference in nineteen ninety three erm we'll still doing very little about it
we the local authority i think people of wiltshire expect us to be the lead agency in promoting sustainability and environmental highlighting environmental issues throughout the county
erm not just taking a back seat we need to actually promote these
erm i recognise that erm within the report it does state erm that there is the cost of it and erm and in lancashire it may have cost three million pounds etc it doesn't say what it specifically was
since having said that erm i'm not immediately looking erm for high expenditure but i would hope that possibly one particular area or w er council erm as it were could start operating the system erm on a trial basis and preferably erm not one which is erm under planning and highways though planning and highways and environmental officers would need to help them
would suggest erm would be libraries and UNK
and i suggest libraries and UNK because i dare say they have the greatest experience in information co ordination systems erm within the within the council and i think er and of course they're highly involved out in the community
you'll find a library in absolutely every community and reacting with people and i would like to suggest that erm a pilot project is erm promoted within the libraries and UNK committee and that libraries and UNK committee consider that at it's next meeting
okay erm mr please
thank you
if we look at the paper before us mr chairman er g two and c thirteen
er g two is something which is specifically an UNK part of the environmental strategy
but c thirteen about the conservation of the water environment and water resources is a matter which could be incorporated in the county structure plan
as opposed to g two
i was wondering whether erm the director of planning and highways could in an update as proposed by erm councillor erm suggest other ways in which our environmental strategy could be UNK er could be UNK
i have already suggested that c thirteen could become the formal part of the county structure plan and that would strengthen it enormously
but because g two can't become a structure plan issue i was wondering if the erm environmental strategy of this council when it is adopted er wh when it's UNK and adopted er could that be incorporated as an appendix to the county structure plan
i think there are a variety of ways mr chairman in which our environmental strategy when it's UNK could be UNK and that's one way forward and i wonder whether director could perhaps incorporate an argument for or against that i in i in the paper that councillor has suggested
thank you mr
i'm going to bring mr in a minute but i think mr
firstly chairman er a comment about the district auditor i do find it a little UNK that in fact on the last subject when we were talking about small schools he doesn't take into account any other erm item than the financial argument
and then suddenly we find the district auditor making comments about an environmental strategy which i would have thought was if he worked on the basis of the last one rather outside his remit
erm i think sometimes if he's prepared to talk about such things as this he should be prepared to consider the advantages to villages of small schools and not just work on the financial item
erm when we look at the environmental strategy i always think that environmental strategies are common sense to people and that sometimes the involvement of large organizations is sometimes counter productive
erm comment was made of c thirteen we do when we design our roads actually already put catchment areas in so that if a lorry load of diesel happens to split on it that there are drains to hold it
i saw that when i when we opened the UNK by pass
or went to it during construction
there are pits down the hill as you come into UNK which actually would take the contents of a UNK if it if there was an accident
so already these things have been done as common sense in the past
er and i just wonder why we're trying to re invent the wheel sometimes at these things
it's probably maybe UNK ignorance that they don't know that already a lot of work has been done on it
but we're in danger very often with environmental strategies of taking quick decisions that are UNK
erm and i've been involved in lengthy discussion on behalf of certain people in the trade one of the largest er chains of UNK do it yourself UNK
and some of the things that are coming through there are common sense some of the things are a reaction which erm is mis informed
but this is particularly in the timber trade
timber trade world wide is doing an enormous amount of work already to make sure that sustainable timber is supplied and the horror stories are slowly going away and a lot of people now do not buy timber in this country from those countries who've got a bad track record but are buying from countries like denmark and UNK where it's a national law on their UNK policy
i believe that a lot of work's going on
i think we have to be very careful we don't take reactions which actually UNK some of the work and the common sense that has been undertaken at the moment
mr
thank you chairman
if i could just briefly address three or four of the points
firstly miss 's correct
it isn't being approached very vigorously at the moment er in a general sense because of two things
one is none of the departments are UNK to give this a lot of attention and secondly we have been waiting for further guidance from the government on the outcome particularly from local government in respect of agenda twenty one
now this week the government are publishing four papers on and i quote the u k's government first strategy for sustainable development
so miss 's point is very appropriate to bring a report back to a future committee in the near future er that covers the queries that have been raised by members and the government's new policies or new proposals i will take instructions from the chief executive on that and will er subject to the chief UNK review also cover matters such as structure plan and the co ordination of this er within the local authority
and to try and give options for members at different expenditure levels of how we may move forward because it isn't a cheap process or not if we follow the lancashire model it isn't a cheap process but of course we can scale our proposals down
so subject to me taking advice from the chief executive er i feel we can do what members require
thank you chairman
may i just i think that this has all party support erm the actual scheme was produced erm f and if the government is a UNK to that erm unfortunately the UNK to it was the UNK environment minister tim UNK who has now UNK but
it you know it does have it does have government support so that it isn't we're not trying to do anything which erm the government isn't supporting as well
and er you know that's just so that mr is aware that we're trying to do what john major agreed at UNK
okay i er we've got a motion let's put it to the vote
it's paragraph seventeen eighteen and the additional item added by miss about a report to the april meeting on what action can be taken to implement the district auditor's recommendations and from what we've heard i think that report will also contain reference to today's the correct response to today's government four papers erm on the policy with regard to the UNK summit
and i hope that and indeed the point about the er what might be added from the environmental strategy into the structured plan which mr made
erm so we'll look forward to that report er those in favour of the recommendations please say aye
aye
and the against
they're carried
miss
thank you
erm as the person who mo moved the original motion i would be very happy to move the recommendations and to thank mr mrs mr and mr who are the only members here present who voted for it at the time
erm it has actually worked erm in that it seems that there's a very fair chance that er in spite of the very UNK things that were said by some of the people on my right when i moved this erm there is a very good chance now for a reasonable er settlement in south africa which i think should erm make everyone in this chamber very happy and it is that undoubtedly the case that economic pressure had a great deal to do with that
thank you chairman
miss moved
you have already second but i was going to second it and say how very pleased i am to have the opportunity to second it
those in favour please shout it
aye
and the against
that's carried
item twenty funding
er we have erm
thank you chairman
yes i would
erm and in fact i would move my original motion as an amendment to yours
and the reason i do that is that er i believe that you've er actually misunderstood what is going on and i UNK to some of that during the debate earlier on the budget
i think it's wrong in paragraph a of your motion to say the police committee has received privileged funding
it's privileged if you don't want it maybe
the funding was a matter of assessing priorities and each time when that assessment came the police were UNK as to receive the funding that was thought correct to undertake the duties that they do in this county
and we know that through that period there has been a steady increase in the number of police officers the county have got and this county has always up to now UNK funded those police officers
part b of your motion
yes we know that from the first of april ninety five it will probably no longer be the responsibility of the county council to set a budget for the wiltshire police authority
that's all the more reason why you should not be cutting their budget below what they need for next year
you've used er an UNK from this year rolled over but you haven't increased the base budget to pay for the projection costs which came from erm this year's budget
and we all know that if you put the police into the er budget next year in at a low level that is the level which the government will assume this county council thinks is correct to fund the police force
so your under funding next year and your use of the UNK will actually have a long term effect on the funding of the wiltshire police force and i suggest that there'll be problems er ahead on that basis
you refer in part d erm to recent government announcements which you say will make the fight against crime less effective
a freeze on the number of police officers but we know that through the review of the police UNK system that the home secretary has said that will mean a considerable number and i think the figure of two thousand was mentioned extra officers will be back on the beat
that's where the public want to see them not sitting in offices pushing paper
the reduction in the paperwork undertaken by officers will mean a further number of police officers back on the beat where the people of this county want to see them
not pushing paper in headquarters and divisional headquarters and police stations
but the announcement made by the home secretary went further
and it went further into things like erm giving more thought to the problems of the victim and a little less erm consideration of the criminal who UNK such terrible da er harm onto their victims
i can think now of two elderly people i know who never ever got over a burglary
one died recently but she couldn't ever come to terms with the fact that her house had been UNK and that the er that some of her most valued contents had been taken
and i'd want to know that the person who did that was going to be punished and punished properly
and i think for too long we've listened to the UNK who want to think of the rights of the criminal all the time and er and don't worry too much about the victim
i think that the genetic er testing that was that is now law has to go a long way towards finding criminals who once they've been tested will find it very difficult to commit crime again because they're on record and they'll be on computer record
many announcements made by the home secretary are moving in the way that i have always wanted it to move and i believe that er in wiltshire this will have a very positive effect
we have already we believe accepting in wiltshire for two of the new parish constable erm appointments
i only hope that the police committee will actually support those and get on towards introducing them because that is a way of using some of the people in our village communities to erm to keep an eye on the community and see that those people that shouldn't go round
i hear that maybe we're not going to support that policy
i hope and i shall be bringing it up at the next police committee that we will commit ourselves to that initiative will a view to bringing in those two pilot schemes in the county and extending it at a later date
so chairman i move my original motion as an amendment to yours
mr please
thank you chair
i erm i think it's worth UNK some of the financial mistakes again that mr and then perhaps give him some more facts on that
the paper circulated demonstrates that since eighty eight nine through to ninety three four whereas county council spending as a whole has gone up by thirty eight percent spending on the police has gone up by eighty eight percent and that's more than double
now i think that you know if mr 's got any complaints about that and he says that isn't privileged well i think he can only blame his own administration as well as anybody else's
i think surely we cannot deny the facts that the police have received very good funding from this authority and indeed in this current budget they continue to do so
we've given them three hundred and sixty four thousand pounds of extra funding which we could legitimately have taken away as particularly in the way that it was done and as i understand it they er revealed their v i p protection two months early to the home office and therefore cut our s a by a substantial amount and i would even perhaps start that as a as i could as a series of criticisms about the way the police maintain their budget and about the way that they have responded
it's perhaps the only committee if one dare call it a committee of this council where the chief officer hasn't UNK to come to the budget review and represent the interests of his committee
i can only take it that he wasn't that concerned that perhaps the chief constable doesn't share mr 's concerns and is perhaps happy that he has received the generous funding that we state he has
it seems to me that he can't be that unhappy because he's currently managing twelve vacancies deliberately in order to produce UNK so that he can re surface his car park maintain privileged UNK for his erm senior officers chauffeur driven car for himself and build a new UNK for his helicopter
this produced even despite that two hundred and thirteen thousand two hundred pounds of UNK in ninety three four on just general expenses on operational expenses now i think if the chief constable says he hasn't got enough money to do what he wants to do he could start by spending all of the money he's had this year in recruiting all the officers he's been allowed to recruit
i think in fact it's a bit of a cheek for the chief constable to go to the home secretary here ev home secretary again this year asking for more officers when he hasn't recruited all the ones that he was given last year
and that's perhaps why he's been turned down
i don't think mr 's actually got any very reasonable criticisms at all and we must again say as we often do to conservatives now who do you think's been running the country for the last fourteen or fifteen years
are the dangerous UNK or do you mean liberals that you UNK of running the country
are the people like margaret thatcher
i hadn't noticed her being soft on criminals soft on people
but i think the point that you're really missing is that only one in fifty crimes is solved
if you concentrate on UNK criminals you're still leaving most crimes UNK and it is prevention that people are concerned about
yes it's prevention you've got to prevent the crimes being committed not just chase after the people and hang and UNK them once you catch them
and i think that's the problem with your focus because what has really happened over the last well i suppose since your government's been in power even or even before
more and more money has been spent on the police and it hasn't worked and that's why everybody's looking round for new initiatives that's why patrick UNK who after all is chairman of a very successful commercial corporation was asked by your government to put forward recommendations that a lot of very unsuccessful police forces rejected out of hand
your government didn't have any courage then to back up it's own man and force through some changes and so i don't know what your policy is it seems to change every couple of years
but one thing you can't do is criticise this county council at all it's simply not our fault
hear
i certainly can criticise what mr said
i'll just pick up first of all one or two of the points he made
erm he er UNK the building of the UNK in fact that resulted in an UNK cheaper and better contract saved a lot of money doing it
er i can assure him the chief constable more than shares our concerns about his hi his under funding
erm this idea that the police had more money yes they have had more money what er has been very UNK ignored is the enormous amount of money we've had to spend on special protection duties
that is where most of the increase has gone
now erm mr refers to er privileged funding
this is a total UNK of the true facts
in fact erm there's been less funding per head in wiltshire than many other authorities in the country
until eighteen months ago
wiltshire it's no use you keep saying it's not true
until eighteen months ago wiltshire was the most UNK force in this country and that's not our figures that was the home office formula which produced that and because of that eighteen months ago the home secretary actually granted this force an extra sixty seven policemen and he gave none to anybody else
i think he gave one other county to be fair
and that was the reason why and in fact the total shortfall the total UNK was something like a hundred and thirty five hundred and forty which is why the police authority has a bid in at this moment for a further sixty eight policemen which has in fact been backed by the county council who are prepared to pay for it
now the home office has said the home secretary rather has said this year that he's not UNK any more policemen this year but he also said that if county councils wished to fund more policemen he would certainly look at that
the true fact is we are no longer prepared to fund them because we've cut the police budget
and erm looking then at base budget which has been mentioned
go on john you gonna start
er in general terms er there was no big UNK or UNK as far as i can see there's very good eye contact er throughout er you kept the person's attention
er we then take this as the actual structure er social qualities we're okay then you jump straight into the statement of the purpose er because you're
the thing i noticed was that they're all close questions you like the area now martin was very fair to you because you he was very me most you could've got very much did you move because of your yes
again you UNK you gave er a good idea so erm you went on there er martin to a certain extent was then taking control simply because he was UNK nature
er then he made the i'd better cut back to the business card because you jumped into the statement of purpose erm you UNK er there was an assumed er was okay erm i put superb and i can't remember what that actually was there
that was the
oh that's erm your objection er was nobody had seen me and you didn't really answer the question clients by coming in to their homes you know martin made the comment er that in actual fact nobody had seen them seen them in six or seven years so i thought that was a possibility for a just er oh n maybe not as deep a but nevertheless erm there was a good pause er how did you er come to be with friends provident er you it was good that you asked er if the wife would be attending the second meeting that was an important thing
you completely the wife actually what erm another good point was that you got in are there dependants there were certain close questions again the fact that the wife smoked a pipe gave you the opportunity to turn round and say well that's good that's a benefit because she could be classed as a non smoker there's just wee er opportunities there and that's as much as i had if anyone else wants to add to these comments
i agree with a lot of what john's saying
i actually disagree wife's erm employment service cos i feel asking things like that
he actually he actually seemed to miss it and go back to s saying i know what you're actually thinking
the one the thing that i actually picked up on is tt erm in the UNK part of it you started very well and then martin seemed to take control and you almost felt as if martin was interviewing you at one point and erm you tried to get the control back and that's when you went straight into the statement of purpose because martin was taking control
erm i thought that erm i mean i was getting some things that john hasn't mentioned erm when you mentioned the wife being there erm when you when you were introducing the c q you then assumed that you would be coming back with recommendations
mm
erm and i think maybe that you jumped in shouldn't have done that er because obviously m martin got quite defensive at that point you know because you were only going there to do this financial planning service and er selling them anything you were just offering this financial planning service and then you jumped in with these when i come back with my recommendations erm tt i also thought that erm you know it was a little bit dodgy actually to say you well you know erm tt we have found that our records are incorrect and i thought well then that maybe and erm you went ve you went very o when you were talking about the dependants erm you didn't seem to get into er erm how many children have you got and is there any other dependants it you it seemed to take you a long time to actually get there
and the other thing
i was writing the information down
yeah and the other thing which i actually i've been laughing at here is because you were laughing at yourself when you were asking the questions
i was thinking about all the
so erm wh which you know made me smile and i'm sure it did everybody else but whenever you were asking a question to martin you started laughing as you were telling it erm and that's i don't think that i would actually have to
apart from all of that
erm it's like the UNK closed questions there was no real no real commitment er with the questions you were asking you seemed to be afraid to ask them
you know erm you know what sort of gross salary and you know and there was you were holding back in a way erm tt and why you didn't wanna discuss your hobbies you know where you were losing it
mm
well he didn't wanna di discuss his hobbies you didn't wanna reveal any of yours
erm what sort of UNK do you actually get up to this is what we wanna know now
erm and the willingness to proceed erm it seemed it missed something no i didn't think it you sort of said you know can we go for it there was no real that's what i picked up on
okay
okay sally
could i just make one final
yeah
i know where i was when i wrote assume superb he assumed the friends provident policies were good
mhm
now someone could turn take e exception to that
right
cos these blooming policies are not doing as well as i expected
well this is an
and then and then you're splitting yourself you're building a barrier up for yourself
that was that was the one i think assume superb was actually policies
yeah
okay fine
er right then tt here we go
erm as well as all that erm i'll just try and add in the extra bits that erm what was oh sorry how did i come to friends provident then
how did i come to friends provident
through his company
yeah
presentation
mhm
er and who did that presentation
presentation
he said i should like to redeem this i f a
well
and you've got to stop you've gotta back off
mm
okay so that wasn't er explored
mhm
i thought the was very good and i liked the way you introduced that you introduced it came to agreement by acknowledgement i thought that went really quite well
erm the statement of fine
erm maintain to maintain contact is not as good as what it should've been but that was fair enough
you did actually sort of make when i said well i've not seen anybody you did say that but i'll come to that later on okay so it wasn't a but you acknowledged and you answered it
okay i that would have been okay in that particular case but you did come back to it as benefit you say we haven't seen you for such a long time that was a not just look at your policies but to put a face to the name so i can become your point of reference
mm
right now or some time in the future
erm the buyer's guide and the business card erm yes it is a legal requirement but i mean you know don't hammer the fact this is a legal i've gotta give it to you okay so it came across in that particular vein
and again as jimmy said don't knock the system you know there are mistakes made but we don't hang it up and say look know we've made lots of mistakes you're UNK your own erm performance
yeah
mm
the reason i said smoking a pipe okay you assumed that she smoked cigarettes
she could've smoked UNK er UNK she could've smoked a pipe yeah erm tt with regards to working you did ask did she work but is sh she is a tax payer she wasn't because it's pin money
again the temptation to become UNK
although that information would've come out with her salary wouldn't it
yeah but you did say on that base oh well you pay tax but obviously you must do as well then
mm
but she didn't she was a non tax payer in that particular scenario
they would have come
yeah
out later on but again try not to be too UNK
tt and what else did i put erm yeah when you are writing things down try and maintain some sort of eye contact the only time the eye contact was fine but there were
yes
occasions when you know you actually turned your shoulder to me your head went down and obviously
yeah i was aware of that
you're trying about the erm
point okay that was a bit of wide ball but i might have taken offence at that
yes yeah you could've done
i mean why
yeah
you know you had a but be aware of that
yes
good to see you checked to see if the wife would be there okay pretty UNK going through the whole process if she has all the facts
mm
erm especially budget and so that was good
erm you look fairly fit thank you very much you know very sweet of you dear erm tt and i think to carry on with the regards to well how much do you earn you went all around the houses don't apologize and say well i have to ask you because you know you know you need to know
mm
cos if you don't know how much money that he's earning what can you do
tell me how much do you earn end of story
you did go round the houses on that wasn't to get the point
yeah
yeah so you know get stuck in there
er and i think that's all i have to say
all in all very good lots of good aspects there but again be aware of erm you learn the c q
yeah
cos you were taking UNK when it should be UNK
yeah i know
you were putting in information that shouldn't be there okay you've gotta grip to the c q before we
i think the other thing also i found it a disadvantage actually having it on the table i think if i'd just left it on the like that
yeah
and then done it
yeah you could've
you know i just put it on the table and left it there and as i say it's certainly better to because when you're looking like then it's easier do that
okay you could yeah
yeah
any other comments
i mean what were your thoughts sally
erm
yeah it went er it went it went a bit wrong at the beginning because as i say you did it with business card and er buyer's guide that came in a after the erm statement of purpose really
mm
erm but i felt because we were sitting there the appropriate sociability went on longer
i think if you're actually th when you when you go into somebody's house and you're talking once you actually sit down you more or less then accept that you're going into a business situation
possibly
and er and i it's easier to do that er sort of i mean certainly you were very forthcoming to
you might you might
yeah
come and sit down and get to business now he may not he may still want to have a chat about the weather or whatever you know so again be aware that to cut too soon to business
yeah
like well i want to know you do i mean what you picked up
yeah
oh sorry well i don't wanna talk about that because i want to get to business
yeah
i could've taken offence at that
yeah
the other thing is as well though you could've actually got more out of martin by talking about that because you may have mentioned something that he's enjoying and says oh i do that or something like that
right
mm
so it would've led to other things as well
yeah i mean to be honest on that i was more conscious of the fact that we'd only got fifteen
minutes and we wanted to get into the thing
i mean it's not er it's not something that i would normally do i mean i would be quite happy to chat to somebody probably for too long
and that could be just as bad
i know yeah
yeah cos you find you're cutting the too short
that's right
and then cutting business too late cutting them off as things are starting to flow
mm
so be aware that you don't want to UNK on too long or this appointment could go on for ever and a day
i thought that was brilliant is there somebody at the door
but i but i think you know the thing that i found erm most difficult as you say was actually completing the c q and i think part of it and asking the question but it is certainly it would be easier to do it using that on your knee rather than doing it at the table because i was aware that i was turning away
yes
from you and i was looking at that and ticking boxes and i was i was almost not listening to what you were saying at times
erm
yeah
that that's the c q
that's right
but as i say it ce it would be better to do it that way
good
any other comments
er actually that's the position becomes important you see that wouldn't present a problem because i was like that
mm
yeah
yeah
it's just an observation
you see avoid these particular problems
yes that's a good point
and just wherever you sit
see you could sit that way interview
yeah
but your point about not being very er positive the interviews that i do i do in a very relaxed manner
mm
oh yes
i think erm i think it may have been that er you they assumed you're lacking confidence because you were laughing at yourself so much when you were asking the questions
away
yeah
and that made them laugh
it was actually i nearly UNK up and fell off the chair at that stage
i'll just pass these to
yeah give them to ron
they're for you
that's for your personal development and er
ta
but try and keep you know try and get some good feedback this is something to go away and look at in conjunction with if you wanna view the video again then say
good get the idea
yeah
right okay
so what time's the next one start
er we'll start in fifteen minutes i think
sorry seven minutes
no
yeah we've got five minutes
the first one started at quarter past
past we should be starting the second one at ten past
so we've got a minute
right
cos you've got five minutes preparation
but who's my customer
er it will be erm
did you hear about my erm my friday afternoon with robert as my customer
no
well
you know that we wer we weren't allowed to see our customer's briefing
now well i'm sitting there UNK my customer and like i'm sitting there and he comes out with this fabulous UNK right as this objection right that was word perfect and he's sitting there after he's finished it as UNK as anything and looking at me as if to say so what are you gonna do about that then
oh dear
you know
and at this point
sorry to keep you waiting
that's okay
the timetable doesn't appear to bear any UNK to what er i've got on the programme
you're not looking like steve
steve is downstairs
is he
oh right well
well he well i dunno
we don't mind
we don't mind
martin came in and told me i was supposed to be upstairs steve was has gone into where i was so
oh well they've obviously UNK round
anyway i'll just finish er telling you this so UNK then sitting back UNK with himself and looking at me as if to say what do you think about then and i'm thinking i've heard these words before where have i heard these words before
right and i look over to roger and roger's UNK through his notes like this and as you were UNK through and he's trying to find out what he's talking about they're not looking at each other and anyway at the end of it er we went through it and at the end of it he turned round and went how was it what were you playing at what was that UNK that you gave it's in my brief that's one of my objections
and you know what it wasn't one of his objections at all you know the video that we saw that morning
yeah it was in that
and he'd remembered this UNK and he'd got it word perfect and he's UNK it off as his one objection
you just need people like him don't you
you really do
it was excellent though wasn't it
it was brilliant because
he didn't miss anything out
right
it was just oh dear
are UNK gonna start the
i'll start the camera
i'll wait till maggie finishes her danish
please
steve came in with a danish and a cup of coffee and i'm thinking
i know
where's mine
i called in at the wrong time
are you going to be my customer
er my sales person
unfortunately
never mind
it could be worse for you
i'm not quite sure how but i'm sure it could be worse
mm
alan's going to be very dodgy
well if i start being
no i'm not i'm not
carry on
are you ready
joan
are you ready joan
a minute
have you finished your danish
yes thank you very much and don't put that
okay have you got both of us in
yes
i did check earlier hang on i'll just er as you've moved the chair i'll just check it again
yeah you're both in
the red light is on
off you go
action
good morning mrs it's joan from friends provident
oh right yes
nice to see you
yes it's a lovely area around here actually isn't it
i didn't know this part existed actually
yeah it's fairly new actually it's a nice new development
well i think it's quite quiet as well
well there's a few children around but erm they generally tend to be the older ones
oh right
have you lived here long
erm no we moved in eighteen months ago
oh right so you're still settling in then
yes
very much so
you're not new to the area though just to this bit
no we heard that this development was coming up so we came round and looked and liked it and took the UNK
okay if i can just erm give you my business card that tells you who i am
alright
erm i'll just give you this buyer's guide erm this tells you erm that i'm a representative of friends provident and can therefore only recommend the friends provident products which er suit your needs
okay
okay
so tell me mrs how did you come to with friends provident in the first place
ah i think it's when martin and i were taking a top up on our mortgage the last time erm the building society suggested we took the policy out with you
right
so really you were recommended to us then
well yes i suppose we were
good
cos that's the usual line you see that er that i get you may have heard the phrase that we've grown big by being recommended
i haven't actually no
oh right
well erm i'll tell you what it is we actually build our business by word of mouth and it er these sort of introductions means that we rarely advertise erm and the money saved can be used to benefit policy holders such as yourself which sometimes means that it can reduce charges and erm increase bonuses wherever possible
how do you feel er about that way of building our business
yeah i suppose that's makes that makes sense yes
oh good
because during the course of our discussions today i'll ask you to introduce me to others if and only if you think this meeting with me today has been of benefit to yourself would that be okay
mm yes let's see what you can do for me first
well i can understand that
okay
as i said to you er when i spoke to you on the phone i wanted to come erm one to introduce myself because i'm now the new financial adviser for this area erm also to review your existing policies to make sure that they are doing what they were originally designed to do
what we find is that sometimes people have taken out policies some years ago and they've actually forgotten what their money's doing for them so erm that's another side of it and also to introduce our new financial planning service erm and in doing so we may be able to highlight areas in which we could save you money er for example erm saving you money on tax or increasing your income either now or some time in the future
is that okay
well yes that sounds fine
good
good
well tt during our discussions i'll be taking notes on your current financial situation but also why erm your thoughts for the future and erm and in doing this i'll be using this form to actually assist me to actually take down these notes
it also keeps me on the right track as well
is that okay
it does look rather a big document you know
well it is but er what we do is we we've got the one er we've got the one erm pack that actually we use for all kinds of business and not all of this would actually relate to yourself but what we do is we combine it in into one pack
so a lot of this would actually be irrelevant to yourself
what are you going to do with the information though
i mean erm does this get s given to other people
no any information that i actually take from yourself and put down here is completely confidential
it goes back to our branch and erm everything they tell me it's completely confidential and erm you would be able to see this and sign whatever i wrote in here as well
okay
is that okay
yeah okay
good
okay then
have you got any middle names
no just er just the one name
okay
your husband's not in today
er no he's at business
oh right okay
could i have your husband's name please
his er name's martin
your both tax payers
unfortunately yes
i know i feel like that as well but never mind
can i enquire your husband's date of birth please
yes it's the fourth april nineteen forty seven
okay and children do you have children yes
yes we've got two erm eight and ten
my daughter's the eldest susan
okay
and
john
could i have their date of births
erm susan is the seventeenth of august nineteen eighty two and john is the tenth november erm er nineteen eighty four
eight four
okay you've got no other dependants financial dependants
er well martin does have an elderly mother she's not financially dependent on us as such but we do try and keep a track of her finances and if she needs help we erm help her out
oh right okay
er she lives with you
no she doesn't live with us but she does live locally and that was one of the reasons for being here because it's a little bit easier to get to her
okay
but this probably makes her feel a little bit more secure as well doesn't it
yes and the kids can drop round and see her from time to time
UNK her up
yeah
okay erm your children go to the local schools do they
er well UNK erm gone to obviously gone on to senior school now er she's she went she started this year
john we don't know what's happening at the moment he's we're not we're not at all sure
there are a few problems there
right
have they got any ideas about what they want to do in the future
yeah
er well UNK very much into music and erm i think she thinks she'd like to earn her living that way but it's a very hard way to earn a living
i can imagine so yes
it'd be a very difficult business to get into
okay
erm so maybe they'll be going on to university college university
susan i think probably will john's more on the practical side
okay
you always say that you never get two children the same they're
no
always it sounds as if they've got completely different personalities
yes
yes
susan takes after UNK family and unfortunately john takes after my family
okay
your state of health
erm mine's good but UNK been having some back trouble
is that only recently is it
mm no he's had it over a period of time we think it may be UNK cos his father had some back trouble too when he was alive
oh right
so he's going for some more tests next week
right so he's under okay
do you smoke
i don't but martin does
cigarettes
yes
far too many that's a source of contention
my husband actually said to me that giving up smoking was easy because he's done it plenty of times
yes martin has as well
so erm what do you do in your spare time
well i don't have actually a lot of spare time
erm as a family we tend to erm go camping
right
you're not into any of this UNK jumping or free fall UNK jumping of anything
oh
UNK the thought you have to be UNK to do that
i don't know how they've got the nerve actually it's quite UNK just to watch it
okay
wha what is it that you do for a living
i'm well i work part time down at the local library
you are a UNK
i was yes i er i got my degree in was qualified and er the hours they were offering happened to fit in with the family so i was quite glad to get the extra income
right
and that's just down in the library is that it
yes
yes
okay and what does your wife tt your wife your husband do
er he's the sales manager for erm software company
oh he's into computers is he
yes that's why i've got one upstairs
they drive you round the bend
my husband works in computers as well
they're worse than children
who does he work for
erm it's a p c erm they moved their erm business out from erm er liverpool decided to come back here cos it was cheaper
and that's just down near
yes
okay what's your gross salary
oh couldn't tell you my gross straight off erm i do twenty hours a week and i bring home er bring home about thirty five pound
and your husband
erm well he's expecting a rise in the spring erm but last year he was on twenty five and a half
obviously neither of you are at retirement age so you won't be in receipt of any retirement benefits
no
okay do you know what your actual take home pay is out of those
yours would obviously be thirty five pounds a week
i'm not sure because erm martin has a number of things that come out of his er salary there's erm his pension of course and erm there there's some insurance scheme they run at work as well
okay
is that er erm a contracted out pension scheme
yes
i is it a non UNK
no he does contribute
right
and the insurance
did you say there was an insurance
yes there's some sort of insurance scheme it's erm UNK and UNK som something like that
right
what's that actually UNK for
erm if anything happens to him quite a large lump sum comes to us
so it's a life assurance
mm oh well yeah i suppose so
okay
have you any other source of income either you or your husband
erm well i've got a little cottage that was left to me up in erm north wales that we rent out
erm is that seasonal is it that you just rent out in the summer
erm no it does get rented out sometimes in the winter as well but it tends to be more in the summer
right so you rent that out on a weekly basis
yes
aha
i go through an estate agent up there that acts as my agent but erm don't make any money out of it
no
well no the cost the rent more or less covers the cost of maintenance
right
what is the rent that you're actually charging
erm it's er si sixty pound a week
erm but you've maintenance charges to come out of it
i've got to pay the estate agent as well
your husband has he any other source of income
no
okay
i think that's it
i've come to the end of the form
fifteen minutes
two minutes
have you er has it gotta re be UNK right back to the beginning
no because i've got my erm interview from
oh right
from friday
do you know exactly where it is UNK on there
oh it'll be zero won't it
alright
you're not
hidden UNK you see
it is
it's a good thing you didn't have me doing it
the camera would have fallen apart by now
i did it there was this one group on friday
really
yeah we had one that broke and
well UNK group was probably okay
well one of their videos erm martin had got the position of the camera set up wrong so all she got was erm arms
are you not gonna play it back to
yeah
oh right
we are what do we want just press play
yes
UNK
you don't like that one joan do you
yeah hold it
sir patrick UNK became the new northern ireland secretary
his appointment is thought to herald a UNK security policy particularly so since it was announced that the back bench
i think that's it
right who's going to start
are you starting robert
i'll start yeah
in UNK
right
erm UNK and appropriate sociability although it UNK a lot of it was actually sort of statements and or closed questions
right
oh i'm sorry i aren't supposed to talk am i
well no you're not really but don't worry about it
erm it did sort of get going but i felt that maggie held back a little bit on that whereas you might have got er you know a bit a bit more information with open questions
erm ha having gone through that you moved on er and gave out your business card fi first and then the buyer's guide erm don't know whether you're happy doing it that way or whether it's better round the other way i you tend to think if you give somebody the buyer's guide first when they start to look at it you give them your business card and take it away perhaps if you do it the other way round they might s start reading the buyer's guide
mm
but oh no i mean you gave them both out anyway that was er that was no problem
erm the link to referrals and introductions that was very good
erm you went into that very well
the only the only bit i did find was the very last part during the course didn't sound as natural as the rest of it
the first part the build up to it
no i
was very good
sorry
but as i say the last bit where you sa UNK during the course of the of this conversation it almost sounded as though you were gonna you're doing it UNK fashion whereas the rest of it was superb there was no problems in that
erm your statement of purpose was good in fact excellent
erm the UNK benefit you put in at the end of that you said is that okay and maggie said yes erm the answer could be UNK i thought in that basis well yes it's okay so what whereas if UNK said is that of interest to you
mm
UNK known that you know she was gonna be interested in that
erm checking the willingness to proceed you did that as you went along
maybe a little bit too often though
no erm maggie arranged an objection about the c q erm and you UNK that very easily no problems at all really you went through that well
erm she said about you know the UNK or the UNK er the information and worry about giving personal details and that was good that was fine
erm so as far as the you know the steps was concerned that went through good very well and you went through them all in er in the right order
other comments you didn't actually ask at any ti any point through there i don't believe whether the husband ought to be involved
no i didn't
i forgot
erm it turned out in the end that you got some information about the husband particularly about a pension scheme but you almost got the impression was well you know was it really right
mm
i think a lot of er a lot of wives may not have given you as much information as maggie did
erm also as far as the husband's back trouble was concerned i f i felt that perhaps you should've got a bit more information about the fact that he was going for tests next week at the hospital
you've gotta look at it as an ongoing er on an ongoing problem but erm you could've perhaps have gone into it a little bit more then just to find out erm there was also a mention of an income rise in the spring
which i made a note of
yeah but you didn't a actually sort of UNK in on any particular date
the only point i felt w you know we mentioned the other day that if there's a rise say on the first of april then you wanna get in a couple of months before then
mm
it could've varied you know any time if you like from march till may and without knowing the exact date you might be a bit late or a bit too early er for future business
as far as the cottage er was concerned the information about that erm the answer was oh well you know i don't make any money out of it erm you asked about whether it whether it was erm whether it was making money but you di you didn't actually ask bearing in mind that maggie had already said she paid tax whether she actually de declared it for tax purposes and what sort what sort of figure it showed
whether there was actually any income there and er as a result of that
erm bearing in mind that when she actually came and spoke about her part time job her income was thirty five pound a week and yet she said she was a tax payer well take home pay was thirty five pound a week and talking about being a tax payer
erm she said that her husband was a sales manager you didn't clarify you know whe exactly what that was
whe whether it was involved in whether there was any travel involved or whether it was all desk bound or anything else you know whether he goes UNK off all over the country or whether there's a possibility of travel involved or any danger in it in the job unlikely but
okay
alright
yeah
erm as far as UNK are concerned the only one i picked up was that you say okay quite often
right
okay
but other than that it's fine
maggie do you wanna go if you've gotta shoot off
no
is it time to change over
no we just we finished a bit early
oh
i see
oh
anybody else want to add anything
erm not really
i thought i thought it UNK a apart from all that i think it UNK
mm
well
yeah
and of course you know like yours yourself bob and probably both of us it's we're not used to the actual c q as such
mm
which we need to be and once we get into the rhythm i'm sure it'll all be a lot easier but you seem to have a UNK about your how you speak which is good and you know i'm sure i'll go to pieces but erm yeah it was just and what i've picked up on as you say where it's er how did you come to friends provident bum de bum de bum we're going through erm a structured erm UNK if you like and then they're saying well i don't really wanna give you any you know recommendations at this moment and erm what we should do there is i suppose UNK that isn't it
we're just saying oh well we'll see how it goes and we're sort of putting it down whereas i suppose we should hit them straight away
well she didn't object she just wanted to see how it went so it wasn't a
yeah but it's i don't know
right okay fair comment though fair comment
okay
i mean you know it's both you and me
yeah
and we're probably the same you know
yeah
i could quite easily miss it
right
okay
anything else
no
not really
bill
er never asked about full names er of everyone whether it be yourself the husband or the kids the full names
er who do you work for is it a local library is it district council is it gr er regional council
i asked that
i thought she said local library actually
she said local library and the local library could be run by the regional council it could be run by the district council because although you work part time you've got to look at pension if you've got other income er to use the revenue maximum
erm never got to what your annual salary was at all you just said thirty five pounds was take home pay erm confidentiality yeah you'll be able to sign it but that doesn't give confidence as to whether anybody else is gonna see it
no i did tell her that it was completely confidential
you said it was completely confidential but i mean i would just say well it's between friends provident and yourself end of story
erm does er UNK mother own her own home
wee question and i mean she's dependent upon them but she may own
but she isn't dependent on them she's i did actually clarify that
yeah
dependent in the sense of looking after them but she is independent so therefore she may own her own home so there's obviously the opportunity what happens
one thing i picked up maybe rightly or wrongly well there's two there's two actually maggie said that john was like them and he had problems maybe you've got problems maggie has problems i mean
erm where do you go when they went camping
camping in the UNK
i don't know i mean er maybe these are minute but whether you should explore them at that moment in time i mean only experience will tell
okay
finish it off
i th there was there was one big point that i actually missed out as well that neither of you have picked up on and that was that maggie actually said that they were having problems with john in school and i should've come back and said well she di she actually said that she was having problems with john full stop and i should've actually come back and clarified whether it was at school or not and hence led to the private education and i missed that one completely and realized that i'd done it afterwards but none of you picked up on that one
erm well you haven't heard me yet
no
no obviously
right
okay maggie
erm UNK and appropriate sociability fine you were a little bit nervous so you tended to sort of talk over me a little bit but that's not a problem it probably wouldn't happen in real life
you said about the buyer's guide that it's that you were a representative of friends provident you're an employee and it's very important to stress that because people like abbey national were appointed representatives but we are employees and that's one of the things that's one of the good things you can get out of the buyer's guide
erm i thought your link to referrals was excellent
however i did throw in a little bit of doubt there was a possible objection there that you might have UNK you sound a little bit doubtful mrs do you have a problem with that
mm
and find out what my problem was
your statement of purpose was excellent there was a good explanation erm the fact about the existing policies and what you might be able to achieve in the future very good
your UNK benefit was not perhaps as clear as it might have been which would have made it easier to lead into my willingness to proceed
mhm
erm the point that both the others raised about my objection with the large document and my objection regarding what you were going to do with the information you could have UNK and come out with a stronger result
erm a lot of cl closed questions but that's UNK to a certain extent with this part of the c q however you didn't ask about whether there are any other family locally or otherwise
mm
yes there was my mother in law but there's a probability that there's quite a few others living locally
erm i said it was unfortunate that john took after my family and that was your UNK to ask a bit more i said we were having problems erm and also the business about UNK back the tests what problems how long it's been ongoing what are the possible future problems arising from that
with the camping yes where do we go who else is involved again the UNK for referrals
erm the rise was also the UNK to check on erm pension increase and i felt you should've asked a little bit more about the life cover most companies do have arrangements for quite large sums of money to be paid out to dependants this will have an impact on life cover planning in the future
erm you asked about the cottage and the amounts yeah there was you could have asked a bit more perhaps about the tax there but otherwise you're very good
i felt relaxed felt you knew what you were doing
mm
er there are some areas on that all of you picked up on that i actually thought that when just dealing with that part of the c q like finding out about details and everything
mm
i knew that there was a problem and made a note of it erm that it was UNK and that he was seeing a consultant but there's other parts of the c q that would actually relate to that and go into it in a lot more detail
mhm
so i mean erm and that is the reason why i didn't go into wanting to get all the details at that point erm
fair enough
you know so there's a lot of things that you bear in mind and you take notes on them as you're doing it
yeah
but they're not relevant to that so when you actually come to that you fill in all the relevant details
let's yeah and i thought
cos you can jump around you see you can
yeah
actually move on to the page you don't have to go page two page three page four oh right john has problems is that related to
yeah
your husband's back problem could you give me a little bit more detail
yeah
but i know that i missed out on the private education one because i should've come back on that
but good and relaxed you got all every part of the structure there
and that's the important part
like the
thank you
wage rise
yeah
i mean i thought UNK made a note about oh i must come back to that later
yeah
but i think i mean
but you know later
yeah
that's it
not at this point
as UNK talking to me i mean you can see like my here i mean i've got all sorts as you would use that those pages for there's notes as i'm going through of things that we were doing and er the university and everything like that and there's other parts of it that i mean the things that you would come back to and elaborate more on
mm
but not necessarily within what we had to do today so
that's fair enough
so that was why
that was good
i'm not saying that i would've picked up on all those points because
no
there were some of them that i had missed er completely but
okay
right
right
thanks maggie
thank you
thank you
you're welcome
so nice atmosphere
right i'm in
downstairs now
oh it's bill now isn't it
it's bill now yeah
have none of you got your er
whereabouts
right
on me way
is there any coffee
there may not be any left
you came in
i suppose you're ready to top yourself now are you
who
ready to top yourself now
who me
i don't mind criticism as long as it's constructive
and you learn
well i thought you did alright there
pardon
i thought you did fine
was quite interesting
pardon
what did your parents die of
nothing serious i hope
has he done this
no
no
oh well i'd better not oh good stuff
we had horrendous problems with the tapes on friday
we've not met before have we
oh no sorry joan
hi i'm steve
hi
whereabouts are you from joan
leith in north edinburgh
edinburgh
ah so that's ron isn't it of edinburgh
there's the two UNK
the two UNK
yes ron and ron
yes
i don't know ron but obviously i know ron
the UNK a UNK actually
well i it could be glasgow couldn't it
unless i suppose if you come from up there you i would presumably you would know that's an edinburgh accent and UNK glasgow has got a different accent has it
to be qui i can't actually tell the difference
no
erm they all sound very similar to me
so have you been in this business before
no
so what was your background
i worked for group four before moving to edinburgh erm tt i was the accounts manager for the retail division in group four
nothing to do with the prisoners though
no i wasn't gonna say anything about that
so how are you finding this
erm
doo de doo de doo
parts of it erm are not too bad and other parts of it i find a lot of them actually quite confusing erm
is that the technical side
well some of it erm with some of it is i mean it's like the taxation side and things like that i can understand quite easily because i'm used to dealing in that but when it comes to
excuse me
and the products so it's
did you have two weeks sort of training leaving before you joined the branch
three weeks
three weeks
i think because everybody else was erm already in erm and knew a lot more i sometimes
yeah
erm because erm completely irrelevant and as soon as i go away from it er erm you know there's times when it's quite confusing really
erm i mean martin UNK very good and he'll you know stop me there and go back over it and but it the was already there so it's already got you thinking about other things and you know things that were completely irrelevant and it confused me at times
but
it'll all come clearer i'm sure
maybe it's just a question of practising
bill did you know that there's nothing on this tape
yes
right
yes there's absolutely nothing on it that's the problem we had
right
on friday
i was just checking before i actually erm
no problem
went ahead
are you ready then
well it's thee and me
as ready as i'll ever be
i'm steve nice to see you
you're bill are you
that's right that's right
yes
UNK action one two three
and we're doing exactly the same it's just the first bit isn't it
first part
right
okay
well i'd like to do the introductions
mhm
okay
okay
sorry
mr bill friends provident
oh nice to see you
nice to see you
nice to put a face to a name
erm thanks very much for the directions er you gave me it's quite awkward coming off the main road there cos you really have to
yes it is isn't it
how long have you been here
been here about five years
yeah and was this of your own choosing or did your have to move to this particular area
oh n no we've been in the area for about fifteen years but we've we needed a move up so er that's why we've come here
was it an increase in the family that caused that
well there has been an increase in the family you're right yes
mm
good
er it's a lovely garden who looks after the garden
your
oh that's my wife
oh
she's the gardener
she's the one with the green fingers
absolutely
that's great
oh well that's fine
er well before we proceed er there's two pieces of information i'd like to give you
mhm
the first one er explains that i'm er employed by friends provident and as such could only er recommend or advise on friends UNK products
mhm
that's the form there you can read this at your leisure or you can read it later on
do you ever find that makes life a bit difficult for you only recommending one company
well i it can yes but i it can but at the same time it we have a good detailed knowledge of every product and we only sell products to your needs
mhm
er the other thing is i'm going to give you a business card if
oh fine yes
at any time in the future you need er con to contact me er that's a point of contact you can
okay
you can have
okay
erm and proceeding to business you know tell me why did you come to friends provident in the first place
erm it was a UNK i received oh must be about twelve thirteen years ago from friends provident
yeah
and er you just er answered the advert
yes that's right looked like a good plan i was looking for a savings plan and er i suppose it's one of those er fortunate circumstances friends provident sent some stuff through it looked good so i took it out
oh that's good
erm well in actual fact friends provident er actually built their bus business by recommendation
mhm
er we built our business by word of mouth introductions er which means that we very rarely advertise
this means that we can pass on the benefits to policy holders such as yourself by either reducing the policy charges or indeed er increasing the bonuses wherever possible
oh i'm all in favour of that one
so you think that's a good way of building business
oh yeah definitely
well erm what i'd like to do during our course of discussions is er ask you for referrals
mhm
er of others that may benefit from this but only if and we er you find this of particular benefit er to yourself
mhm
is that alright
yeah perfectly reasonable
great
now erm the reason why i'm here is really to put a face to a name
mhm
er there's a new er thing started with friends provident by er following first call i'm now responsible for looking after you as a policy holder that's the first point
mhm
the second one is that er we want to make sure that the policies you do have are doing the job that they were initially designed to do and it's thirteen years since you er took out the policy
mhm
so it's about time we actually saw that the policy was doing
yeah why's it taken so long for friends provident to get round to doing this
well it's the industry in general er feel that er this is this is the proper way to go
mhm
i mean you've now had twelve annual statements a piece of the policy has gone but you've never
mm
and we feel that this is the correct er way to do it
in addition what we're actually doing is we're building in this new UNK financial planning guide which gives you the opportunity to just look at where you are just now and where you want to do in the future
mm
now er by doing that we actually use what we call a questionnaire
yeah well before you go any further
yeah
you talked about these erm these statements these bonuses
yeah
would you be able to explain how they work to me
well er let's just look at the policy there er what type of policy do we have here
you call it i think it's called a UNK plan
a UNK policy
yes
now that's technically it's a with profits policy which means that there are bonuses added annually to er to it
yeah that's the piece of paper you sent me isn't it
that's right
now that one was for ten years
mhm
now you ha you must've converted to a unit linked policy by continuing after the period you
oh yes i that's right i did i got something from you to say i could
exercise some option to switch it over and i didn't need the cash at the time
right
so i just rolled it into to something else i guess
so you're actually continuing on the savings fund
oh yes
so we want to do is look at that one and we see that it's keeping on track and er it's doing the things that we actually want to do
yeah
that's good
that's fine
now erm tt what i would like to do is er take a few notes in what we call this questionnaire
now this is really a road mark in my opinion
there's a lot of it how UNK this gonna take by the way
you've got
it's gonna take
stacks of paper in there
yeah it does look frightening doesn't it
mm
er in actual fact er it's a UNK multi purpose form so that we cover everyone whether they be self employed so on and so forth so many of the actual parts to this may not be relevant to your situation
right
mhm
okay
but er it should take about an hour and a half
erm yes er my wife will be back
back in about an hour and a UNK time so erm that's good timing actually
good
good
er right now there was just a few things that er i've got to ask
erm now you're married obviously
mhm
and er is it UNK steve your full name
geoffrey UNK are the er middle names family names
right
and is that er j or g
g
g
and UNK as in UNK
now er your wife is her full name please
deborah UNK and that's b r i d g i t
d
b r i d
g d g
d g i t
that's unusual
yeah
you usually spell it
that's why i spell it because most people get my name wrong and get her name wrong and it's a source of UNK to me
well let's get on correct at the at the outcome
is there any unusual name
was there er
who whose hers or mine
an UNK
oh yes yeah they're family names yeah the UNK and the geoffrey UNK are family names
right oh that's interesting
now erm tt we have your date of birth but i'll just confirm that er just to make sure that our records our correct
mhm
er twenty one eight fifty
yeah your records are spot on
grand that's well that's fine and your wife's date of birth
yes her date of birth is the twentieth of the first nineteen fifty eight
nineteen fifty eight thank you
er and do er do you both pay tax
erm i pay tax she's a non tax payer
she is a non tax payer
okay
erm what dependants do you have
i notice a photograph of your children there
yes yeah we've got three children
three children
names
yeah there's sam er UNK the eldest boy er and he's nine years old
and is that samuel his name
erm i it's samuel yes sorry yes it is samuel
yeah and any
no other names no
right
and
then there's max he's the er the middle boy
and UNK full name
er it's UNK
and er he's three
he's three fine
thank you
and there's UNK who is er well she's three months old
the new addition
yes indeed
that's lovely
right erm can we go back to samuel and just ask his date of birth please
oh well now you're asking me a tricky one
erm it's rather embarrassing i can't to be honest i can't quite recall his da i can't recall any of them
i always get my wife's
none of them none at all
date of birth right but the children erm that's i mean that's how old they are
right well that's no problem er when your wife comes back in an hour's time
don't no don't say that to her or i'll be in the dog house
if i can't remember their UNK
okay that's fine
are there any other dependants at all er financially dependent upon you other than your er immediate family
erm
in laws
no i can't think of anyone
no
there's no one at all
right
erm what's the your future intentions regarding the children
i mean obviously er you said eight six and three months er any future ideas as to looking to their education in the future
er well there's a good state school here so er
i mean it's one of the reasons we moved here we wanted to get into the catchment area erm so i've got no thoughts about private education
fine
but what about further education if they show an UNK to go to university or college
oh most definitely yes i i'd like them er i if they're bright enough to go then er be very happy for them to go to university
well this would be the ideal opportunity to look at that because obviously planning now for the future gives you an opportunity just as you've done with your UNK endowment
mhm
built up a wee nest egg at least there's money there to assist er
yeah actually that's a good point because i'm i had something from you the other day your erm you know the magazine that you sent
yes
round and it was talking about erm was it university fees
yes
and er actually that is something perhaps we ought to be talking about
that's something we could look at in the future because we can actually UNK the payments for that and it
mm
it UNK on a year by year basis which may be of interest
yeah i was thinking about you know fifteen twenty pounds a month might be er a reasonable investment to put aside for the children
right i'll just make a note of that
thank you
now erm the wh if we go into your the health your health situation how er when was the last time you saw the doctor
er last time i went to the doctor was when i hurt my back
and when was that
er well just over a year ago
a year ago
has that been a recurring thing or was it er was it just a one off situation
i hope it's a one off i'm sure it is
you've never had any problems in the past
what with my back
with your back
no that was that was erm a com a completely er something which had never happened before
right
i was i was just being foolish in picking up er one of the children and my back went
mm
your wife and her health apart from the pregnancy and the new arrival
mhm
three months ago er how's her general state of health
oh she enjoys good health
no problems at all
no
fine
obviously during the pregnancy she was visiting the doctor so she would get a good check up
that's right
yes
ah that's fine
do either of you smoke
erm i smoke er a UNK a UNK probably once every two or three months
and your wife does she smoke cigarettes
no she doesn't
not at all
no
fine
er what do you do for relaxation
erm i like to visit the theatre the cinema erm play a bit of tennis squash
good
so you're qui quite
that's about it really
quite active er as well as passive
well it sounds like a lot of things but actually getting a game of tennis in it can be quite difficult because you know the UNK turned against us now so
yes
you make an arrangement to have a game of tennis but the weather you know i it's UNK or it's raining so a lot of them get UNK off which is er quite sad
oh that's a pity yeah
yeah
er and what do you do for a living
er what's your occupation
oh UNK manager
UNK manager
erm and what does that actually involve
erm there are networks throughout the u k and europe erm for my company and i have to make sure that er all the UNK systems are up and running
right
is that er a central based or are you travelling around
i do a bit of travelling yes
right er how many miles roughly per annum do you do
mm well erm i do a bit of fly i mean do you mean flying
as a er as a fare paying passenger you're not er doing that
well this is bu these are like business miles that i
business miles
yeah
aye well i mean er in on the ca er in a car or something the mileage
oh in a car
oh er probably about twenty two twenty three thousand
right
and the UNK manager is with whom
who is your employer
UNK
UNK
and they're based
erm well they're based actually in america but i work for the u k division
and their head office is
in er UNK
UNK right that's super
obviously your wife er with the new arrival she won't be working as yet
no
has she any intentions of working
no
no
no
coming to your er employer what's your gross salary per annum
tt er well it's thirty five thousand
does that include bonuses
there's a few other bits and pieces to be added in to that
right so there's the basic salary of thirty five thousand
basically thirty five
er fine thank you
right erm and is there regular overtime involved
no there's n there's no overtime i do get erm some performance related pay
right
er last year wasn't too much it was about two and a half thousand
and is there any er share participation in er
yes there is i've been yeah i've been i've been buying shares er UNK shares in a share p er a share purchase
that's a very sensible thing to do because
yes it's done brilliantly
yeah because you're on well in some instances you can more than double your money
well we have done yes it's been very good
yeah and so i believe it's what two hundred and fifty pounds per month is the maximum
mhm
i don't do i don't do the maximum
how much do you probably
about a hundred and fifty
okay chaps that's fine thank you very much that's er fifteen minutes
fifteen minutes
yeah it UNK through didn't it
wow unbelievable
it is according to my watch anyway
well let's see what
still haven't got your coffee steve
god
i'm UNK
there's some juice on the table
yeah want some juice
yeah i think i'll have to have a
here you are that's a clean one
it's better than nothing
can i go away and hide now
how was your journey this morning then
it was not too bad
alright was it
erm yeah got stuck on the m ooh on the m twenty five for about thirty five forty minutes erm heathrow was the bit round was heathrow was alright but it was
is that where the roadworks are
yeah although in fact the roadworks were not slowing us down it was it was the approach to the m three junction was really very bad but the erm the road the roadworks at heathrow we just sort of UNK through that
oh
oh that's right i got stuck there the other the other day
well i was expecting to be when i got there
when we went to erm UNK erm tt to er UNK
ah
i'm not really supposed to say anything about my UNK two thousand
erm right i'm new to the area and i'm sort of wanting to move into the garden city
great take a seat is it still as cold out there as it looks
absolutely freezing out there
oh UNK oh horrible
okay so you're looking for a house or
well i'm actually i'd like something UNK if at all possible but erm i'm quite open minded at the moment erm i'm so new to the area i'm actually in UNK park at the moment
right
but my house is on the market
okay has that been on there long
it's been on for about the past month
and what sort of response are you getting on that
not too bad had a couple of people round in the last week and one seems quite keen
all fairly encouraging then
yeah you know quite hopeful so what i as i say what i'm really looking for is i've got a preference for older properties but you know try not to pin myself down to too much at the moment i've got about a hundred and thirty to spend so ideally i'd like a cottage old style but i do need three bedrooms
o k right
erm ideally would like something in villages
o k
but something on the UNK of the garden city might be o k perhaps on the northern side
right o k that's fine
um i've heard the west UNK nice
yeah west side is very popular and it tends to be the area where we get the older properties as well so that's encouraging
that would suit me then wouldn't it
o k with erm other than the three bedrooms do you have any particular requirements do you need a garage or anything like that
a garage would be nice and as we've got two cars so although a garage is vital if we as long as we can get them off the road that would be an advantage
and with regard to the three bedrooms do you actually need three bedrooms or if a two bedroomed cottage came up with perhaps an extra room downstairs or something would that be okay
erm yes it should be okay perhaps you know if obviously if one bedroom a box room wouldn't be any good to us but that would be consider that
yep it's just that some of the cottages tend to be a bit smaller so that it might well be that we can get you something where there's a perhaps ground floor extension or whatever okay
do you need to be or have access to the railway station or to the main roads or anything like that
it's an advantage but with cars it's not really a problem so
that's fine okay smashing
what sort of timescale are you looking at to move really just waiting to get a buyer on yours or
well yes as soon as things get moving there then we would be ready really so hopefully in the next month or so
good okay well let's take some details from you and what i'll do is i'll register your details onto our mailing list so that erm anything that's coming onto the market you'll get a phone call on straight away to let you know but also i'll then check and see what we've got that might suit your requirements at the moment
so what's the name please
erm it's erm
okay and what's your address
erm it's
and the postcode there is
okay is there a home telephone number for you
erm yes it's erm would be
okay and is there a day time telephone number a work telephone number
yes you could probably ring me at work yep that's more convenient so that's
okay any extension on that or do we come straight through to you
that'll come direct
that's smashing okay
now you just said you've got your own property to sell and that's on the market at the moment okay erm have you had any advice on mortgage and what we should be able to obtain on the mortgage side of things
er yes we have actually but erm
is that from your own building society or
well we were actually going to be going through the halifax but have you got any other suggestions
yes erm we've actually linked with a firm of independent mortgage UNK erm so rather than being tied to a particular building society as most estate agents are erm what they will do is they'll shop around and tell you which UNK are offering the best terms and particularly good schemes at any one time erm it's literally free information they simply phone you up and say get some idea of what your salary is and what your requirements are and then they'll send through some information for you
can i ask our adviser just to give you a free phone call
yeah erm it certainly wouldn't do any harm erm i'd rather not be rung at work if that's alright
no that's alright we try and keep it confidential so they work evenings they'll contact you is there
yeah right well you know any time after sort of six thirty you should be able to catch me then
okay and is there a particular evening that's best for you
erm no most evenings it doesn't really matter no
that's fine okay smashing
right well as i say i've got your details here so what i'll do is if you bear with me i'll go and a have a look through the UNK and see what we've got available
okay
do you just have the one office or
no we've got another office at UNK which is a village approximately six miles north of here what i will also be doing automatically is passing your details through to the office so that as you're looking for character property and village property they'll be particularly appropriate okay but also to make life easier we actually carry their details here so anything that they've got available i'll be able to give to you now
oh fine okay then give me a ring if anything new comes in
i'll give you a ring if anything new comes in
well thanks very much indeed
thanks
okay thank you bye
court rise
i'm sorry for the five minute delay most of you i had to seek out about a administrative matter an administrative matter nothing to do with the evidence or the place for mr you had told us earlier in the week about several situations as the management company
in nineteen eighty seven and into nineteen eighty eight was there any other management company apart from dealing with projects
no there wasn't
and at that time i think owned developments and also
that's correct
were some of the directors of p l c also directors of developments
they were indeed
and also of
yes
yes would you wait there please
i've heard of tactics mr but
but it's a bit hard to stay awake
well of course it is i mean er it's er it's essential really it keeps you
mr have i got it right that you er do all the estimates for the management the budgets
yes that's correct
that correct what sort of time scale was it er a block of er flats or UNK er that are going to be built on the site er when were the estimates made or when were they made in nineteen eighty seven
they're usually made between six and eight months before the first person would move in
so what stage of er building would be reached when the estimates are made
er the building er effectively would have only just commenced at that stage
what you're considering a four month's building or a of that kind
no the building plan was normally about ten months
ten months i see so somebody might move in before the building was complete
er there was there was a criteria to meet before anyone was er permitted to move in it
well obviously
the whole block might not have been completed in its entirety before somebody moved in
just to get the general picture let me an exact period let's get estimates because we have no idea er so estimates might be made or the management costs four months or six months would you say before anybody moved in
er six to eight months
six to eight and again of course it's hard to say but er when would the brochure the sales brochure for that development be printed and available
the sales brochure would normally be available for the day that this the show flat was open on site er
and again roughly when would that be in with the building
that would roughly be er three or four months into the building or six months before first occupation
yes
forgive me mr if i want to ask somebody some questions about the brochure and er the layout and so on and i find out counsel hasn't i gather from mr that mr would be the person i ought to ask is that right
my lord
that would be great yeah
i'm sorry
i'm not sure about that my lord
oh is that what mr said i'm not stopping you asking this witness at all i don't want you mention the brochures and i don't want to ask him questions the kind i want to ask er with which they're not asked by counsel i shouldn't ask at this stage anyway but by all means ask mr about it i just thought mr said when i tried asked him about it very UNK mr the man cos you are totally free to ask about it of course
my lord these are the matters i would like to explore at time
very well thank you
can i go back to where we were
yes mr i'm sorry
what's wrong
the UNK in the back row has asked if the witness could speak up
if i may give you a word of advice you may think it's rude but when mr is asking questions try not to turn down towards him if you try and face across the jury that's what carries the voice if you're looking at them if you turn to your left a bit of your head goes down a bit it's only natural you're not as used to courts as mr is er he your it your voice UNK it's not a question of shouting it's just looking in the right direction yes mr go on
now mr what i'm asking you about is the space see how i'm speaking out so try and speak up like this so the jury can hear
the brochure is published printed and published about four months into the building is that right or not
that would be approximately correct yes
and again as an UNK that is when the show flat is available the public are coming on site to view
the brochure is usually prepared for the show flat opening yes
yes and what and i'm talking about nineteen eighty seven before eighty seven what was the time schedule i know it will vary from development to development for the final sales so to speak how long will it take
i appreciate it varies
it will vary depending upon the number of flats in the block but UNK
obviously
generally you're looking at an eighteen month's sales period
yes so will this be right that somebody towards the end of the sale period er might be looking at a brochure that was printed at least eighteen months ago and maybe longer
not generally towards the end of the sale period because you would be looking at er the brochure or the costs been put together eight months before the first flat was sold erm a new brochure following a new estimate probably would have been prepared after about twenty months that is to say er that would have been prepared before the last people entered the er flats
are you saying i want to clear my mind that in the course of the sale period from first to a different second additional brochure might be introduced is that what your saying
the brochure may well have been updated during the sales period
may well what was the company's policy to update in the sales period or to use the same brochure
it depends on the length of the sales period
well what was the criteria used whether to have a second edition or not
er if the if the er service charge costs had gone up in the meantime obviously after you reached the end of the first accounting period you have some accounts to go on and you have a much better idea of what the costs are actually going to be
well i wo wonder if you could forgive me address the question if you can what was the criterion or what was the basis on which a decision is made whether they have a second additional brochure or not
it's not a second edition of the brochure it's just an updating of the figures that are included within the brochure
well can we look please at one brochure er take er c thirty one c page thirty one it actually begins at twenty nine i want to ask you one or two questions about this have you got page twenty nine
i have
do you know the site at er
yes i do
on page thirty one that rather grand building shown on the left hand side is that
i don't know
is that building anywhere near the site
i don't know
but i thought you knew the site
i know the site i don't know that building
do you know the lake on the right
i do not
there's is a no lake near the development is there
i don't know
but how many times have you been there
once
i see well er when you talk about updating er on page thirty one we have there set up at er mr service charges service co service parking costs total and then personal costs total estimated weekly total are you saying the rest of the brochure was to remain unchanged and that portion of it would be changed
that the portion relating to the service and apartment costs would be updated certainly erm
well in other words that means UNK that page doesn't it page thirty one
it would
or sticking on top of it er UNK er amendment
that's correct
well what course was adopted by if it needed updating
i think the page was usually re printed as i recall
but you were the person who actually worked out the what costs would go in this document weren't you
we supplied the figures
no not we you
people who worked for yes through me yes
but you were the person at most directly responsible for the provision of these figures is that
correct
right
correct
thank you and you would accept wouldn't you that if we have a brochure let us say printed for next january nineteen ninety four alright and i came along as a retired person in the spring of nineteen ninety five or indeed the summer of nineteen ninety five fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen months later those brochure figures will inevitably be out of date in the sense of being UNK wouldn't they
those brochure figures are updated each first of september now
no not now i'll come to now i'm asking you about then
oh i'm sorry i thought you was talking about ninety four ninety five
no i was giving you an example to what would happen on the time scale but let me go back to january nineteen eighty seven if the brochure was printed in january nineteen eighty seven if the brochure was printed in january nineteen eighty seven and i went to buy in march april may nineteen eighty eight the figures in the service charges would be out of date
they would be yes
but the brochure would still be on the desk so to speak of the sales office
as far as i'm aware yes
you said you now update once a year is that right every september
that's correct
when was that policy implemented by the company
erm i recall that would have been probably nineteen eighty nine
a year after the article
yes
am i to understand from that answer mr that at some stage after the daily telegraph article there was a review in the about er what should be published in the brochures about service charges
yeah there was a continuous review at all times on such matters
what no doubt but it slightly UNK the answer was there a specific review about updating service charges after the telegraph article
i can't say that it was linked to the telegraph article obviously this matter
well when did it take place this decision to update once a year
as i recall nineteen eighty nine
who took that decision
i think it was a decision that was er suggested by our board
now er limited company's don't really make suggestions who from the make the suggestion
myself
ah thank you made the suggestion to whom did you make that suggestion
i can't recall
well would it be to mr
i'd be UNK if i said yes i can't recall
well who would you need to make the suggestion that the brochure should be updated once a year to whom would you normally make that suggestion if it needs to be made
it would be the matter that would have been raised at our board meeting and UNK on to
does mr sit on the board of
he was a member of the board but he didn't usually attend the meetings
and what is your present position now in terms of
i'm managing director of
managing director who's your chairman
er there is no chairman following the er management buy out the position is still remains open
i understand but you were a director in nineteen eighty nine
yes
well who was the senior director at in nineteen eighty nine er apart of course mr who was a member of your board
in nineteen eighty nine if i recall there was a divisional structure which er UNK of a number of companies within the division and there was a managing director of that division who would have reported back to the board
who was that managing director
i believe that would of been mr
mr but you must have therefore suggested it to them then that er the service charges needed to be updated once a year
as i recall that would be correct yes
now what gave the reason for that so we can all follow it quite clearly see if i've got this right was the reason for the updating of the service charges once a year in the brochure the fact that if you didn't update the brochure might mislead a prospective purchaser
no the brochure would not necessary have been out of date it depended when the first occupation was if er the first occupation was in july or august it may not have been necessary to update the brochure on UNK on the first of september
that one but you see you've introduced a policy of updating once a year
mm
and that policy hadn't existed before
well the brochures became were dated each year the service charge a date was put on the service charges each year that's not to say they were th they automatically changed it depends on how long the scheme had been open
i wonder if we can get to the point of my question it may be my fault but i will try again the reason i am suggesting to you was the decision was made to update the service charges once a year was because if you didn't update the existing brochure might mislead is that right or not
er the existing brochure might become out of date depending on how long the scheme had been open
i didn't ask you about out of date i said might mislead a prospective purchaser that is the reason isn't it why you would update
we would update so that we would have current figures in the brochure yes
er but the logical consequence of that is if you didn't have current figures the existing brochure if used might mislead
it is possible
but that was the purpose of updating wasn't it isn't it
mr
the purpose of updating is so that you have current information yes
and avoid misleading the prospective purchaser about the service charge
yes
thank you got that
it therefore follows as night follows day that before you started updating your brochures anyway there was always a risk that the brochures that were on site might be out of date and therefore i'm not suggesting deliberately but UNK might mislead an elderly purchaser because the figures were out of date that's right isn't it
but it was also stated very clearly that the brochures were based on a budget figure it was an estimate and it would be er the subject of an adjustment at a later stage
you see lord is here very UNK to argue the case and at the moment i'd like you to address the question i'll ask it again the question is i think it's a simple one it follows from your answer about why the brochures had to be updated but when there was a time when they were not updated before nineteen eighty nine there was a risk wasn't there that with the brochures printing service charges towards the end of the sales period someone might have been mislead by the brochure that's right isn't it
i don't believe that to be the case because further information was provided to the er legal representatives of the prospective purchase indicating very clearly that the brochures were an estimate or the costs in the brochures were an estimate or the cost in the brochures were an estimate and therefore it would be subject to adjustment
you mean a solicitor's letter to another solicitor during the conveyancing period
yes
that's what you mean
yes indeed
but if the elderly pensioner doesn't read all the solicitor's correspondence or the solicitor doesn't communicate every fact of the correspondence but relies solely on the brochure they're carrying in their pocket or their UNK the brochure taken in isolation might mislead might it not
i don't ever believe that the brochure should be taken in isolation
i see let's look at page thirty one please are there hidden costs do you see that
yes
whose wording is this are there hidden costs the answer to this is definitely no whose wording
the wording of the company or the person who put the brochure together
yeah it's not the wording of a company cos companies can't write it's only human beings that can write which human being is responsible for this wording
the wording would have been put together by sales and marketing people in conjunction with their agent
mr you see various people are giving evidence and mr wants to ask the right person certain questions namely the person who er devised those words and er you are er somebody in a very important position er and er he's trying to get it from you and as he's pointed out to you a company can't sit down and produce in some corporate way a phrase someone or two human beings or more have got to do it and he wants to know if you can help us er who that was that's all you see he doesn't want to ask you about it no doubt er in the same way as he'd want to ask a person that actually devised a word d'ya see
i understand
now try and help him
yes i would suggest that i don't know the particular individual who put the words together but you would have to ask mr the marketing director for that information
thank you
is mr sitting in this court room
is he
and you think he is the person from best able to say whose work is in this brochure
yes i do
did you have anything to do with the wording
no nothing at all
in fairness mr that is what mr said
i understand
earlier on
i do understand that
yeah
but i i'm just making sure with this witness
oh course
what the position is
oh we don't want to lose him before explore it of course do explore it with him that's what he said you'll have to ask mr about it
yes and i've just UNK that this witness agrees on that matter and that he has nothing to do with it is that right
correct
but what you have to do with it is the UNK of the figures that go into the little table under so what would it cost those are your figures aren't they
the figures er relating to the service and er maintenance and management costs yes
you mean the first half of the table
the first half yes
you're responsible for those
well not even the UNK security that was agreed that's the decision of the er p l c board and as to what level that will be at we are responsible for the service and management costs
so is this right not should we try avoiding we and talk about i cos it if it's we it might be somebody else you see
yeah
you probably understand that is it you who's responsible for the seven pound thirty five figure
i am yes
and equally responsible on that one for eleven pounds five p
that's correct
and for the fourteen pounds seventy
correct
i am grateful now will you turn to page seventy eight in the centre this is you know is the brochure for er UNK on sea
correct
and on page seventy eight there is one of those tables it follows from your previous answer that you would be responsible for the figures of six pounds thirty five at the top nine pounds fifty five and twelve pounds seventy
that's correct
i'm sorry page mr you said it
page seventy eight
i was looking at something else thank you very much
yes
and you say p l c somebody at p l c will be responsible for the UNK security
that's correct
they remain constant though don't they
for the first twenty one years
yes that isn't variable no er
now can we look mr at the print below the table costs questions and answers we find that many people considering purchasing a apartment have similar questions can i ask you this would you personally ever deal with people who were considering purchasing a apartment
er only on occasions normally er it would be dealt with by the sales and marketing people
why that's what i thought but would you on occasion have dealt with people who wished to buying or considering buying
only if there was a particular question relating to er the management of the scheme
the management
the management of the development
yes what i simply don't know if had an on going site where the public was going in would you visit it in the normal course of your business
i would tend not to until the scheme was actually in management and running
up and running
yes
so you intend to deal more with people who already bought and were in
that's correct
is that fair
that's fair yes
yes it says we would like to take this opportunity to answer some of the questions you might have and then the question comes will the management charges greatly increase did you have any part to play in the UNK of this question in the brochure
no
but did you know it was there
yes
but come as not surprisingly i assume you have read the relevant brochures
that's correct
read the answer the answer is no have appointed the u k's leading management specialist management services limited for several reasons the firstly because of their profession and caring attitude to the management of housing secondly because time has shown the management charges rise at a rate either slightly below or in the level of inflation did you have any responsibility at all for that sentence and secondly the time
i didn't write that sentence but i was asked if er that was a reasonable er if it was reasonable for that statement to be made and i agreed it was
when were you asked that question and by whom
i was asked that question by mr erm prior to the production of the first brochure with that statement in it
when was that statement first incorporated into the brochure what year approximately
i would have said er nineteen eighty five or nineteen eighty six but cannot recall precisely
something in that time
yes
er is this fair was it mr idea that it should be incorporated into the brochure or somebody UNK
it was mr that posed the question to me and i understood that it was his idea
and who would take the decision as to whether it should go in the brochure on your understanding
that would have been a decision of mr
but you were consulted
i was
did you have the power of UNK it if you wanted
yes
if you thought it had
yes
you did
yes
so it required your UNK and approval that was the position
yes
be it nineteen eighty five or nineteen eighty six it may not matter did you know previous to that in february nineteen eighty seven he as chairman had given instructions that this brochure should be withdrawn did you know that
i was aware of that yes
aware of it at the time at or about the time when the instruction was given
i can't recall as to the exact time when i learned of that instruction but i was aware that the instruction had been given
well not exact obviously i'm not saying you remembered if it was a tuesday morning or a wednesday afternoon but he gave you instructions according to mr in february nineteen eighty seven would it be about that time that you learnt of the instructions
it would have been about that time yes or soon after
by the spring of nineteen eighty seven
yes
were you aware of the reason why the instruction was given to withdraw it
it may have been because i had raised some concerns concerning that particular er statement
ah you had raised that concern when and with whom
i don't recall precisely with whom but i raised the concerns towards the end of nineteen eighty six or at or at the beginning of nineteen eighty seven
and what were your concerns
my concerns is my concerns were at the time that we might not be able to continue with that statement because it might become UNK
yes and might therefore mislead
if it if we continued to keep it in yes
because it might mislead a purchaser
well i anticipated that the management charges would rise over and above inflation and i suggested we should not continue with that statement
and the reason for that was because if left in it might mislead a prospective purchaser
correct
thank you so within either a year or maybe something approaching two years of the existence of the brochures with those words in you raise the concern that it might be misleading if left in
yes
with whom did you voice that concern
i've already stated i do not recall er the person i UNK that concern with at the time
but to whom would you normally address that concern in the normal course of your business
it would have been a matter that i may have raised at our board meeting again that would have been passed on
i understand erm mr because you realize in the short time that wording has been in the brochure that it would not be possible to keep the management charges at the level of inflation or below it
there were pressures coming on the company which would mean that we could not continue to do that
when you known exact reasons why but the conclusion was you couldn't keep the management charges at a rate of the level of or below inflation
i came to that conclusion at that time
right
were you present when mr gave evidence in this court
for most of the time yes
were you present when he defined for the benefit of my lord and the jury what was meant by management charges in that sentence
yes
i think he gave a figure of one pound fifty nine was what was referred to by the phrase management charges in that sentence
i recall that figure yes
is he right that is what it intended to be referred to
yes he is
well can you explain please as the man who devised these charges and assessed them and work them out how by some process of reason anybody reading that sentence gets the clue that when it says management charges will rise at a rate below the level of inflation it refers to one pound fifty nine how can you understand that
you could not work out that it was one pound fifty nine you could you could assume that it was a proportion of that six pound thirty five
well why do you assume that
because it's talking purely about management charges a the cost of the service being provided by
now mr look at the wording at the top service apartment costs well that means the cost of running the apartment doesn't it apartment costs
yes and then it says ordinary management services
no hold a moment the first line apart from cost that's plain english isn't it
yes
what the apartment costs right
correct
all maintenance warden and management services six pounds thirty five right
correct
look at the sentence below will the management charges greatly increase the answers no because time has shown the management charges rise at a rate below the level of inflation i suggest it to you to the ordinary person they would think that the management charges there meant the costs that are listed above see
i knew what i understood by it and that was that it was management
oh
charges
well you had the advantage of inside information i'm talking about the ordinary UNK if you forgive the expression the ordinary customer you realize don't you that there's no clue in that sentence that management charges is limited to a small element of the six pounds thirty five
i agree that in hindsight it could have been clearer
well that's very kind of you that's another basis on which it might albeit UNK had mislead a prospective purchaser correct
it UNK entirely inn UNK yes it could
yeah i'm not suggesting it was done UNK and deliberately i'm suggesting with hindsight it's UNK and UNK misleading you follow the point don't you
as i said it could have been worded better
yes well i expect you'd say that worded better in the interests of a vulnerable section of society to take this
er
correct
right
okay
not long before the end of term now UNK looking forward to er going home to get some real food inside you i dare say as opposed to the UNK you've been getting in hall
right
okay let's just er pick up from where we er left off last week
cast your minds back last week we were looking at the relationship between price elasticity of demand and marginal revenue and what that relationship could tell us about er prices and total revenue in an industry
if you remember i used the example of agriculture right where it is generally observed that agricultural products have a price UNK demand okay
so that any changes in output right lead forget that diagram it doesn't really show what i am about to say but er when we have a price UNK demand changes in output lead to changes in price but the changes in output are UNK changes in price so
let's just do the diagram like that
okay
in that sorry in agriculture when there was a good harvest prices would fall more than UNK to the change in quantity
as a result total UNK would be lower in the industry in years of good harvest and when there is a very poor harvest prices rocket through the roof because of the UNK demand and therefore the change in price is much greater than the change in quantity er UNK on the market
right and that was the result we generally observe in agriculture in that for example if you have ever been down to er the west the west of england where there is a number of apple UNK you will find that when there is a very big harvest right apples just left to rot on trees right simply because it is not worth farmers UNK er those apples because they won't get er price to cover their average UNK costs
right
prices are so low in the market because there is such a UNK crop that it is simply not worth them UNK as a result it is rational for them er just to leave the apples um UNK and what have you on the trees
right
however in a very poor harvest year right prices rise very dramatically and as a result total income of the industry ri rises
however as i said before erm if you are the farmer or the UNK the apple UNK whose crop has been completely UNK you won't be able to er benefit from the very high prices if you have got very little output right so your as an individual your income may be very low right in bad years right but on average when we look at the industry as a whole industry incomes will be very large
right
what i want to come on to now is just to talk about UNK and still with reference to demand elasticities
so far we have just been using linear demand curves with a linear demand curve the slope is constant however elasticity varies everywhere along its length
now with a UNK demand curve right that same relationship doesn't hold
with a UNK demand curve it is the slope that changes along the UNK length but the elasticity in some special cases right can remain constant
right
now i just want to look at a simple class of demand function right which we could write if i can get a pen that works we write the demand function as p equals a over q to the beta
right
now this is a special class of UNK demand curve right because this implies constant UNK constant elasticity alright
now to prove that result we just note again the elasticity formula d q d p so if we differentiate that expression on the demand curve we'll have we'll have d p d q okay and that equals
minus beta a q to the minus beta minus one
right simply because we can rewrite this top expression as UNK to the minus beta
right so if we differentiate our demand function we get that alright nothing that for our elasticity we want one over d p d q okay so our elasticity you could write as one over minus beta a q to the minus beta plus one right times our price quantity ratio which if we now just substitute in the price so that we have got a q to the minus beta right over q right that equals a q to the minus beta minus one over minus beta a q minus beta to the minus one right which UNK to give us minus one over beta
right so our elasticity in this function right is simply minus one over beta right
now if we note that beta is a constant then that implies that our elasticity is going to be a constant
right so it doesn't matter where we are on this UNK demand curve right elasticity will always be the same
and in empirical sorry and in empirical work we tend to use these UNK demand functions simply because they have this nice property that they have constant elasticity and it makes subsequent calculations considerably easier and you may think in actual fact that linear demand curves are quite restrictive
we may not expect consumer behaviour right to be the same at all prices and quantities basically but er nevertheless you will probably see more linear demand curves than UNK ones because they are somewhat simpler
right
what i want to look at now a new sub heading and it's the relationship right between total average and marginal functions as you may be aware that UNK are obsessed with the concept of the margin and there's a neat relationship a couple of relationships UNK alright er UNK in this relationship between total marginal and average functions that is applicable to all total marginal and average functions whether we whether we be looking at marginal cost marginal revenue marginal products right the same relationship will hold for all of them
to explore what these relationships are let's just use the example of total product right so we will be looking at total product curves right t p okay and lets assume that our total product right is simply a function labour and capital
now in order to look at this relationship between labour and capital and output total product UNK we need to draw a 3 d diagram alright but because my diagrams are bad enough in 2 d what we are going to do is we are going to UNK one of these factors right so what we will do is we will pick a level of ou a level of capital input right and we will see what happens to total product as we vary labour
right so we are going to assume effectively that k is our fixed factor of production and l is our variable factor
okay
right so if you er draw a make sure you have got at least half a page right you are going to be drawing two quite familiar diagrams right you er first of all just draw a normal total product curve what we are going to do because we are looking at a fixed level of output sorry fixed level of capital what we are going to be UNK is the relationships between the total product of labour the average product of labour and the marginal product of labour right for a given level of capital okay so the total product curve just tells us what happens to output as we increase the level of our variable factor labour keeping capital fixed at some constant level
right so as we increase the labour ou er input by one unit the change in total product right is going to be given by the marginal product right so quite simply the marginal products of labour
as we change labour by one unit what's the effect on total product or output well that effect is measured by our marginal product
as a result marginal product is simply a slope right the slope of the total product labour function okay let's define average product of labour as simply total product of labour divided by the amount of labour we are actually using alright an average product to be measured by slope of a cord right from the origin total product curve er to the particular point on the total product curve
right so if we just the origin of the particular point on that curve the slope of that the origin to UNK the average product of labour
let's just have a look at what happens as we increase the lab the labour output
first of all let's have a look at the relationship between total product and marginal product making a diagram we can see the total product rises up to l 3 units as a result that implies a marginal product positive throughout the range to o l 3
if we now look at what happens to total product between o and o l 1 units of labour and we can see total product rising at an increasing rate right which implies our marginal product positive but increases over that range o to l 1 right between the range o l 1 and o l 3 right the total product is rising but at a decreasing rate a decreasing rate that implies that the marginal product is still positive right but falling
there is a between l 1 and l 3 units of labour total product is rising but at a decreasing rate that therefore implies that a marginal product of labour between those two UNK levels is positive but falling notice that total product curve UNK at l 3 right so it's maximum at l 3 units of labour of that curve at that particular point zero therefore the marginal product labour is zero
if we add more labour beyond l 3 units the total product is falling the total product is falling and the slope of the curve is negative what's the slope of the curve it's the marginal product therefore the marginal product of labour is also negative beyond l 3 units of labour
let's now look at the relationship between total product and average product o k the slope of a ray from the origin alright along the curve rises all the way to l 2 units right so the slope of the cord ray rather the slope of ray from the origin rises right to o 2 sorry to o l 2 units of labour as a result the margin sorry the average product of labour is also rising over that range
at er l 2 units of labour the slope of the ray from the origin right is UNK to our total product curve
at l 2 the slope of a the ray from the origin is actually UNK i'm sorry the ray is actually UNK and therefore the slope of that ray is the same as the slope of the total product curve at that point
as a result marginal product which is the slope of the total product curve and average product must be the same at l 2 units of labour
beyond l 2 units of labour the slope of the ray from the origin on the total product curve starts to fall
right as a result average products must fall beyond o l 2 units of labour
okay it follows therefore that at l 2 units of labour the average product is at a maximum
right
rising prior to that falling after therefore the average product is at a maximum for l 2 units of labour
okay so that's what you learn in micro economics this year and which should be fairly familiar to you ask now is why that is the case
why do we get this these relationships in particular right why does the marginal product curve UNK the average product curve at the average product UNK maximum
this relationship isn't just common to product relationships it's the same in cost revenue relationships as well okay so what that diagram is saying in UNK terms is that if the slope of the ideal product of labour curve right if d l p d a p l by d l positive then the marginal product of labour must be greater than the average product of labour
right and if the slope of that average product curve right is negative that implies the marginal product of labour is less than it's average product hence if the slope of the average product curve is zero that implies therefore the marginal product equals the average product of labour
so let's show why that is why that is the case
what we are going to do is differentiate the average product function the average product right is the UNK of total product right and the amount of labour actually used and as a result if you want to differentiate it you can use a UNK rule of differentiation
right general notation right d y d x equals v d u d x v squared minus u d v d x all over
that's our UNK rule so let's apply that to this particular problem
right what we are going to do is let's say that y equals er total product labour x equals labour u right equals sorry y is the average product let y equal the average product of labour x labour input u equals total product of labour right v er equals l as well okay right so differentiating the average product curve and average product function in respect to labour alright we get l times d t p right by d l minus q p l all over l squared
