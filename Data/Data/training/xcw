let's rewrite that slightly differently and just say l over l open brackets into d t p l over d l minus t p over l alright what's that in economic terms well that's simply right marginal product of labour in the brackets right minus the average product of labour okay so if the marginal product of labour here is greater than the average product right the UNK side is going to be positive right therefore average product is going to be positive okay the marginal product is greater than the average product ah change the slope of the average product curve is going to be er positive therefore average product itself is positive and rising let's write that down as the marginal product of labour is greater than the average product of labour that implies changing slope of the er average product curve right is positive implying that average product is positive itself and rising okay if the marginal product of labour right is less than the average product right that implies the slope of the average product curve is positive therefore the average product itself right is positive and falling sorry right so we can rewrite that somewhat UNK using the following d a p l over d l right is greater than equal to or less than zero if d t p l over d l right is greater than equal to less than right t p l over l the average product
yep er well you read it just go along the top the line here alright the slope of the average product curve right will be positive right greater than zero if the marginal product right is greater than the average product right the slope of the average product curve will equal zero right if the marginal product equals the average product and the slope of the er the average product curve will be negative right if the marginal product is less than er average product
okay now that result holds right for all erm for all marginal relationships okay so if we are looking at a marginal cost curve right we have got that's our marginal cost that's our average cost we we're UNK here when in the case it is a minimum so marginal costs cuts through average costs at its minimum value we are looking at average revenue and marginal revenue average revenue function marginal revenue function this is our total revenue function and the same relationship is embodied there but notice that between the average and the average revenue and marginal revenue functions right don't UNK simply because we have got a linear relationship here right average revenue is always above marginal revenue in this particular case
right but nevertheless the same relationship is embodied in that UNK i think what we will do is er leave it there before we start partial UNK
see you next week
there is concern about funding for the children act and it's too important to start scoring political points whether there's a general election or not t and i must admit i was off i was off ill off work during the week of the tory party conference
it was actually something that happened before the tory party conference but it didn't it didn't actually help me recover
and nearly every day nearly every speaker actually attacked local government in some way
what the children what the children act does at least recognise in the conservative government passing the children act is the importance of local government
these are very important services and they are placed just like care in the community will be when it eventually is put into practice
they will actually responsibility of local government and er we've tried to put in here something that even conservative councillors could support even though it's attacking conservative ministers cos they must actually believe in local government to actually serve on local government one would think but er but th the problems of under funding are th could be very serious
during the summer we had serious problems we had a report on children homes which erm which y'know which pointed out a few things y'know that hadn't been doing well mainly in defence of erm because they did put in a lot of effort into UNK y'know and the children homes y'know need as councillor would y'know will they did a very good job actually representing at the time
yet i listen to the television and virginia UNK with th within er hours of the r the news breaking in trying to make political capital out of threatening to come to inspect UNK children homes
clearly that's what worries me about this government's implementation of the children act
i mean our motion you can do with it what you will but like i say we have actually aimed to actually get something which UNK all party support for the children act and UNK concern about the funding
thank you
councillor
d i've put i've not gone too political on this and you're running me down already i don't know
there is as has been said all party support for the children act and it is nice to see the labour party agreeing with conservative legislation as with the care in the community asking us to rush our legislation so it makes a change for us to be united on something
probably the act the act will work as a framework through which our children's UNK and their needs will be of UNK importance in all our decision making
one of the key points of the children act being that gone are the days of parents' rights
the children act clearly UNK this with parents' responsibilities
i think that's one of the things that we're all pretty much in agreement on
what about the responsibilities of the councillors to the children in our care
we all know the grave problems in some of our children's homes but we can't run away with the fact that er they're unique to or the problems don't exist elsewhere because we all know they do
it's nothing new it's an age old thing
speaking to one of the workers in one of the children's homes said do you think that child prostitution in the children's homes is something new because it's on the front of the t and a
i've worked in these homes for fifteen years and it was going on when i first started there
so it's just a problem that's come to the surface that obviously needs addressing
as UNK of the children we've a legal duty to take care of UNK of the children that we in our care
one of the major problems for us whichever party's in control and i think if councillor had gone to the press after this report was done and rather than trying to score points and saying it's all because it's lack of government cash if he'd UNK if he'd said let's all get together on this let's try and solve the problem the UNK been going on UNK let's try and s he might have gained more credibility
but of course he came out with his usual dry UNK of er not enough government cash
the major problem being if one of our children gets out of hand one our own children we've got our own ways of dealing with it
some parents still give their kids a clip round the ear some of em send the children to their room or whatever but when the children are in care you can't do any of these things because if you lock the child in the room if the child gets sent to the room you're accused of UNK when there's a report done
you can't physically UNK the children
so the problem is if your child wants to go if one of our children wanted to go at midnight i'm fairly sure that everybody in this council chamber would have quite a reasonable way of er of retaining that child in the home but of course we've all heard the stories of what happens when the UNK children in the children's homes want to go out at midnight and i do think we have a problem because with the report and the new legislation we're in the situation where there's plenty of advice for us as to what to do what not to do should i say we can't we can't use UNK you can't shut them in a room you can't physically UNK them so how does one of the workers in the home stop them from going out
i'm meeting virginia UNK next monday afternoon at central office and i'll be putting the i will be putting UNK i will b i will be putting the very question to her as to we've had a lot of advice as what not to do how do you UNK the children in the homes
so what of councillor claim that it's all down to lack of government cash
i'd rather be constructive about this and meet virginia UNK put these points to her as an all party thing cos we've all said in social services that is the problem that we're faced with
but what of councillor claim then about government cash
it's the children themselves in the homes who'd UNK the walls broken up the fabric of the homes
no amount of money would have stopped them or is that if there was UNK on the walls they wouldn't bother UNK it
i don't think money will solve any of these problems
would more government money in the home stop young girls going out to engage in prostitution
i don't think so
may be councillor UNK be better employed asking his leader to stop wasting public money and direct a bit more into social services
hear
you talk of the you talk of er wo should we take it out of this should we take it out of that councillor
received a thirty two point seven million pound increase from the government compared to last years' i revenue support grant and this doesn't include the additional money given for the community charge
but your group sold the children's budget UNK short
you were told at the time you did and councillor told you at the time that th it was totally inadequate was the children's budget so how can you expect more money from the government when your sense of priorities is so UNK wrong on the money that you're already handling
i make a plea for councillor not to use the children as a political football
this matter could have been put forward
we could have tried to address the problem without all this talk of more government cash more this more that more the other
let's all get together
the policies are starting to work as we've already heard from councillor
we're very far advanced in our social services department
the policy of trying to get more foster children is picking up momentum
let's all work together to promote more UNK get the children into family environments wherever possible
thank you lord mayor
councillor
thank you lord mayor
er i er hope councillor has got his pen ready because there are one or two things i'd like him to mention to virginia UNK and i wouldn't like him to forget them
but er i'll deal first of all with the children act
whilst most UNK are agreed that the children act UNK is in the main a good act all of them all of them councillor are critical of the fact that the government has not properly provided local authorities with sufficient resources to implement the act
the government deserves no praise for the act
it was not their idea
it was an idea which UNK from pressure groups and voluntary groups as well as social services departments not to mention the house of commons all party select committee in UNK
but i want to ask the tories i want to ask the tories and i want an answer
if the act is as good as it is claimed in their motion why hasn't the government UNK proper funding for it
of course of course the opposition won't
of course the opposition won't answer that question but the truth is that it is the usual UNK of the tory government not to fund anything properly
look around you
is it not we can mention this to virginia UNK
it is not only the children act which is under funded but the entire spectrum of local government and the national health services
the fact remains and will become more and more evident as the year goes by that the deliberate under funding of the act was an act of incompetence by incompetent ministers
ministers who should never be allowed to UNK this country again just as the tories should never be allowed to run again
and while i'm talking labour running i notice that the original seconder if this motion was one councillor the former arch cash cutter of social services
will never be allowed to forget that she cut the social services budget by one tenth
money incidentally that we shall never be able to put back
she UNK social services and now has the UNK to congratulate the government for this under funded act
if it was not for her this council would have had more opportunity of addressing some of the deep problems the tories either created or left behind
now what if i support in the main the aims of the act there are one or two areas i think that some things are not a good idea
i'm concerned about the loss of the access of parental rights panel and the handing over of this work to the courts and the lawyers
i take this opportunity to thank all the councillors of both major parties who served on our access parental rights panels
i feel that they did an excellent job
putting this putting this work to the court will not i fear help the situation or improve matters for children or their parents
in fact i think that making this a court issue will UNK some parents from seeking access to their children which is a very bad thing
i do not believe that magistrates will be able to show any greater compassion or understanding that our own elected members
in fact with the involvement of solicitors i think the whole business will be less personal with much less UNK and genuine understanding
i must also say that i resent the tendency of the act to line the pockets of lawyers out of the tragic situations of families and children in trouble
if i was a cynical person which you all know that i am not i would have said it was the government's intention to help lawyers make more money out of the act
however i shall UNK myself to believing that it was an UNK consequence
another area of this act which i disagree with is over the definition of need
i remember in UNK attending the same conference as councillors and councillor hearing from the principle civil servant in charge of the act that the government had not defined need and that would emerge through decisions made in court
in other words the government were too frightened by the cost of the act that they refused to name a price
however at the same time the government UNK left local government to exposure of the law and the high cost of UNK reviews and high court actions
only a tory government would be so irresponsible and UNK
only ministers who have no understanding of either local government or social services would UNK from their own responsibilities in this way
it was their duty and their responsibility to protect local government but instead they acted like UNK and ran away
is that the order of the day
isn't that what we've come to expect from this worn out useless government that at the moment of decision making they run away
didn't they do just the same with the community care act
when the all party house of commons select committee reported in UNK and suggested a further review of child care legislation was needed did the same select committee envisage the incompetence of the government ministers of the day to so UNK deal with their duties
councillor time's up please
yes thank you
it's time for a change
it's time we had ministers who will listen to social services and in a few months time we shall have them a labour government

at this stage in the proceedings i'm going to adjourn cou the council meeting so that you can all have your tea
we shall UNK at er five minutes to seven
we now under er the powers to choose and the right to own
lord mayor i'd like to firstly say why i refused to sit and listen to this next debate
i think it's the worse example of pure political self UNK that i have ever come across in the eight ye nearly eight years on this council
i think i regard it as an insult to the people who actually elected us to come to this cou these council meetings
i apologise on behalf of council to the members of the press who are here and to the council officers who have to UNK this and i am only grateful that there are not members of the public here to witness this total UNK
now councillor you're entirely out of order but er
however i call upon councillor to move the motion together with amendment k standing in his name
lord mayor
are you going to move formally move it
i'll move it
UNK
is the is there a seconder
remarkable
i call UNK councillor to move amendment g standing in his name
i so move my lord mayor
is there a seconder
in accordance with standing order a thirteen e the opposition group has specified this motion as the one to which a minimum debating time of thirty minutes is to be allocated
so we will proceed
councillor
thank you lord mayor
as i was saying if the labour group would like to leave the chamber we don't really mind if they stay out for the voting at the end of this debate which actually contrary
contrary to what contrary to what councillor er erm what's his name
councillor said is extremely important to the people of and we've learnt a lot in politics over the last ten years
one that i look a lot more like the prime minister wearing my reading glasses than the prime minister actually looks like the prime minister and two the hidden benefits of wearing your reading glasses group here is that i can't see a thing over there and for the first time in ten years i'm gonna enjoy delivering a speech
the power to choose and the right to own
the power of the individual to choose and the power of the individual to own is the central political plank of the conservative party and in fact goes back to UNK and one nation
if councillor had actually stayed he would know why this is so important to the people of whom i may say he has UNK by walking out of the debating chamber and what he's saying to the people of is that liberal councillors a won't prepare speeches like his colleague earlier on or they won't stay in the debate they are not going to be properly represented when we take important decisions both nationally and locally
the right to buy given to all council tenants opposed by the labour party has allowed one point two million council homes to be sold to their existing tenants and make them home owners and home ownership is a central plank of our policy
it is no it is no coincidence that in a question asked today to the labour party we will find that we a year ago when the UNK proposals were still being implemented over eleven hundred people were granted in the right to buy their own council house
this year UNK under a labour controlled council only two hundred and fifty people approximately have been allowed to exercise what actually is their legal right
we've had a debate on local management of schools opposed by the labour party where we have seen that the right to choose their own children's quality of education and where school governing bodies can direct their cash where they want has been extremely popular
and i don't apologise to the people of that i voted with councillor to take a hundred administration jobs out of education and direct that money to the provision of education in the schools cos that is what running the education department is about
hear
the city UNK college was given the right has given the right of education a quality of education UNK of by a n by the people who live in the inner cities of particularly the asian population of opposed by the labour party a labour party committed to UNK and closing the c t c's and if they can't get
oh you my UNK if you can't get your way what UNK you are
we're not having the c t c playing football against our schools god how low can you actually sink
hear
what is wrong what is wrong with increasing the levels of education in our schools up to the quality and level of education offered by the c t c
and why does the labour party in always want to level things down
under the conservative government the green belt in england has doubled in twelve years
if it was up to the labour party it'd be UNK in two
and we've seen we've seen the commitment to local government haven't we on the planning application on the where two local councillors two labour councillors sitting there listened so much to their electorate that they UNK when it comes up to the vote
they UNK
now where's people's commitment to local government in circumstances like that
under the conservative government the people in great britain including people have been given the opportunity of UNK of before opposed by the labour party
and what does say about that says that we will keep the level of charges down in the now privately owned companies providing public utilities so there'll be nothing for dividends
i hope he's gonna put that in your manifesto
i hope the eleven million who own shares in those operations know that under a labour government there will be no dividends
the citizens charter announced by the conservative party has been one
of the most outs you may laugh at least you stayed in
try reading it try reading it some time because what it says to the people of is if you don't like the level of services being provided by your council if you feel your council are not giving you value for money then we're gonna give you the right to complain about it and do something
and that brings us on to the question of money
we've heard tonight and i do not believe it a plea from councillor the chairman of social services that he wants ring fencing of local government money i e the government sends us our money and says you will spend it on that and that and that and there will be now power of local councils to decide what the needs are in their areas and what their priorities are
now if you want to serve as a local councillor where you are told by any government what the priorities of people are on the services that we deliver than i want no part of that in local government
no more than i want any part in local government where councillors and officers can spend twenty thousand pounds UNK all over europe and let's put something straight the t and a tonight which we all believe says councillor has no right to complain about that cos he went on a UNK plane to brussels
there was nothing in our press release in fact the contrary UNK the labour party officers going to brussels where we've had tremendous support over the last ten years
and if we did spent twelve hundred pounds on an aeroplane and came back with fifty million pounds worth of grants i'm not UNK for that
i actually don't think i actually don't think that the community charge payers of should pay for councillor to go and watch a circus in denmark
if he wants to watch a circus he can attend the labour group labour group meetings every month the labour group meetings every month
we don't think we don't think that the citizens of are doing UNK at sixty four thousand pound being spent on a benefit bus to tour round this district and certainly if the festival UNK two years ago could commit themselves to breaking even within two years and were happy with that why have we spent two hundred and forty thousand pound on a festival in when that money and that's four hundred thousand pounds worth of money could have been spent on the salaries and training of our officers who work in children's homes
no we didn't sack anybody who worked in children's homes we didn't sack anybody who was at the front line of s services and we certainly didn't expect other people to pay for our circus tickets
didn't sack anybody
we actually believe that the people of would prefer their money spending on the environment and front end services
and we actually believe that it's the individual's power to choose
what is now worrying us extremely about local government in britain in any labour authority which is spreading now like a cancer in that officers are not trusted now to even take the sick list of decisions so there has to be another sub committee
i mean i'm not that rude as to say that's for the payment of allowances but some people may say that
officers are paid to implement
you can speak in a second
officers are paid to implement our policies
they're certainly not paid
nursing homes
where's the power to choose for those elderly people that want free at the point of service national health service treatment
it was or it has been a believe that the n h s was for all of us from the UNK to the grave
it's now a sick joke in the health service it's from the UNK to the UNK
the trusts are in serious financial difficulties and may well be one million pound or two million pound in debt before the end of this financial year
and quite rightly it's gonna be the subject of a parliamentary health committee enquiry which starts next week
meanwhile it's chief executive it's brains it's driving force is getting out
he says quote there's UNK business for the trust but not for me
and he's so desperate to get out he'll take a twenty thousand pound a year pay cut
he's obviously UNK the UNK ship cos he knows what's happening to it
now what effect is that gonna have on the staff who can't leave
having said that three hundred are been forced to leave three hundred are being sacked as we've heard before
nurses are actually being sacked at
the official term is released not sacked released made redundant
but that's been consistent because there are three thousand less nurses this year in the n h s than there were last year
i don't believe that's because people are being treated better or more people are being treated better but at a cost of eighty million pound there are four thousand more managers or accountants people brought in from business people who will do business people who will sort out privatisation
now the trust refuse to publish their business plans
these are the multi million pound supposedly public money going into it
UNK do they do that
because they're in the business of competing with other hospitals competing for treatment competing with doctors
that's not co operation that's not a comprehensive health service that's moving towards privatisation
now i think it's a bit rich t to UNK the liberals for walking out on the last debate because the tories didn't attend the health trust select committee which council set up
i wish they had have attended the tories because there were very few people prepared to come and speak in favour of trusts
even the UNK from the trust would not come and talk to the public
not surprisingly i heard today that in there's to be a UNK review on the supposed trust because they've not given enough information to the public on which to start their enterprise
the survival of the n h s is going to be a major election issue and i know who's gonna win it
nobody trusts the trusts it seems except the conservatives and i fear that we're only a general election away from a fully UNK health service
well give us the power to choose at the election
the position of the conservative party is clear
opting out hospitals two tier health service an internal market competition for business competition for people's illnesses and UNK less accountability and privatisation
it's already happening
labour party will bring these trusts back into health service and to public control
one of the reasons why they're having such a hard time with trying to UNK the health service is because the british public actually feel they own it they feel a part of it they feel it's theirs they know where the hospitals are they know they can get treatment and they don't abuse it
the government are steam rolling these reforms through but the trusts are failing in they're failing all over
it is true
for the first fifty seven of them to be set up at a cost of half a million pounds did a survey and found that only twelve of the fifty seven were financially viable and that didn't include the trust
the public do not believe the n h s is safe in tory hands
hear
give them the power to choose at the general election and they will decide the future of the n h s the future of the n h s is safe with the labour party with your lot it's privatisation it's started already and we're a general election away from the end of the n h s
councillor
right to the very bitter end i assure you
lord mayor we've always been opposed to trusts because of their independent nature which we see as really making it impossible because of that very nature to plan for health care properly
the two are really UNK in the way that the trusts are deemed to operate
but one of the problems with attacking trust i mean it may be possible to envisage some sort of modified trust with some local input at some stage without the contracting apparatus
it may be possible to envisage a trust that could work and could operate
there are many UNK similarities after all with the d n UNK anyway
and really we ought to be concentrating far more upon the other changes which are proposed other than the trusts and the things that in fact are fo far worse in my own opinion
most of the problems that are arising are not just because of the trusts but because of other things like for instance the contracting process that is proposed the t the changing in the financing that is incorporated and of course the general under funding which there is within the n h s these are far more important problems in the long term
now paragraph four of our amendment here is not really designed to knock the labour party
it's really more to do with the er means rather than the ends which i think we sh we all share and so i it was actually included more out of sadness than anger and we UNK put the word regret not UNK but regret really the way that the campaign has been launched against the trust
what we feel is that by going at it like a bull in a china shop we all sorts of UNK of widespread privatisation has actually UNK
it's been a classic g case of scoring a lot of home goals here which the tories have actually benefited from
talking about UNK the national health service and opting out of the national health service is not actually very helpful because people don't believe that they don't believe it's er n h s p l c they do not it is not a british gas it is not a british telecom they know it's not and it UNK your argument if you talk of it in those terms and it allows UNK to stand up and to UNK and reject your statements and UNK your case
the impression is that the tories are winning the debate because you're having to amend some of your earlier statements
you're not walking not about widespread privatisation but creeping privatisation and you're now talking about not opting out of the national health service but you're now talking about opting out of local national health service control
people know this they identify with this they recognise that you're back tracking and it looks as though your ke case is UNK
now the problem is that the tories do not have to UNK the national health service to damage it
there are lots of other ways that they have found of doing it
the contracting system is damaging to the national health service
the proposals to do away with nationally negotiated pay and condition will damage the health service
the attack on funding levels will damage it
the g p's are in UNK at the moment the g p practices they're in UNK at the moment that's damaging
it's interesting there is no doubt no doubt you are there's a very learned journal called the liberal democrat news which
which you are no doubt
now it reports in here a survey carried out in the doctor september the twenty sixth and it was asking there who they actually supported in terms of the national health service changes and you may be surprised to hear who in fact came out on top of that
from doctors
that's from doctors
doctors themselves saying that
on what the labour party have claimed for UNK as being their issue
now that would worry me
that would worry me if i was a labour party member because you have got a good case but you are not putting it across in a way that UNK doctors themselves
you are actually i know that many doctors traditionally vote conservative but you are actually behind the tories with only twenty one percent support
that must should worry you in terms of the case that you're putting across
there are lots of things to attack the conservatives on and it is a question of how that is actually done
we don't need to make things up
we don't have to
all we have to do is tell it as it actually is and then trust the people themselves to decide
councillor
my lord mayor i'm delighted to have this opportunity to debate the government's health reforms again
i'm disappointed by the two er contributions we've had so far
we've had a list of UNK designed to panic the public and patience of councillor and i was disappointed that liberal don't seem to understand that the health authorities have now been given the op the responsibility for planning and provisional health care in er in health authorities
this planning is being done in a way that it has never been done before and i'm surprised they haven't UNK that
i'd like to have a look at the er to examine labour's motions today
the three sections of it
the most important part of their the first section of their of their er their motion is opting out of local n h s control
now this is a UNK lie
hear
again designed to er to panic the public
government and hospitals are not opting out of the n h s at all they are every much of it a as part of the health service as they every have been and you all know that and it's about time you stopped saying it
they are now under local control not opting out of local control they are actually being managed locally and that is quite obvious to anybody
they are no longer being managed by the health authority across the road UNK no contact between the two or not enough anyway no longer being managed by a region fifty miles or forty miles whatever it is up the road to
what way is that to manage a hospital
ma trust hospitals are being managed locally within the hospital building and that's the way to do it
they're being managed by the staff who work there
it's sensible
how can anybody disagree with that
and i know a lot of labour people do agree with that
who spoke so UNK in this chamber two years ago has now joined the trust staff
she was a candidate at north a as your candidate there and now she's joined the trust
some people are seeing the light even from your own side
what would what are labour's plans for the health service
well we haven't heard any have we
all they w all they're saying they would do is restore it back to what it was
well we all know what it was under labour
under labour under labour waiting lists are always
under labour waiting lists have gone up every time we've had a labour administration
every time we've had a conservative administration waiting lists have gone down
it's not as if the contribution of labour councillors to th to the management of health authorities has been very er productive
i've sat on the district management board of health authority for four years and watched labour councillors coming sometimes often not coming at all sitting there saying nothing debating very little in the way of useful contributions until i have to say councillor came along and er a er sorry to get you unpopular with the rest of your colleagues
they seem to be there just to guard vested interests
it's no way to manage a health authority to have to have people coming along there to t guard their own vested interests
trades union members
as councillor said labour keep altering their story about the health service
they started off saying opting out of the health service now we're opting of local n h s control
we started off with privatisation now we've got creeping privatisation
well labour were the first to introduce charges to people in the health service
they were the ones who started charging people for glasses and UNK appliances UNK things that are necessary and actually help in the management and care of patients
they're the ones who started charging people
all conservatives have done is put out services to tender such as cleaning laundry and UNK and allowed those services to be provided by the company or and sometimes the health authority that gives the best deal
there's no expense to the patients no charge to patients no cost to patients
there are advantages to patients better quality control greater efficiency and financial savings UNK back into patient care
now if that's creeping privatisation let's have some more of it
however the government has no intention to UNK health care
we've had it straight and true from john major
i believe him
i agree with him and i would resign from the conservative party if it were anything else
i have worked for the health service for twenty six years and plan to carry on doing so and i fully expect to finish my work in the health service where it's still in government hands
let's look at the second section of th of labour's motion
stated policy of labour party
when i read the first six words of that i thought good lord we're going to get a bit of policy here and but no none of it
it's hardly a policy to say that they're stating we're intending to return the trust to n h s when it's never left the n h s in the first place
labour has no constructive policies or at least we haven't heard any
councillor came to a meeting in and spoke for th for twenty minutes or whatever it was
he didn't give us a single UNK of UNK any labour policies
all he did was suggest that the er the health authority chairman and the district general manager should resign which he got the headlines for as designed but it was no contribution to the discussion about the health service whatsoever
one of th one of labour's own party the supporters has called the labour policies for health care if they exist a process of UNK
as i said i've worked in the health service for twenty six years
i've seen strikes under labour
i said this at the last time we discussed this
i've seen labour UNK trade union control of hospitals i've seen the patient to be the last in labour's priorities
hear
let's move to the third section
considerable opposition in to setting up trusts
well this is a real joke
everybody knows that the community health trust had an extensive consultation exercise with the public
they had m several public meetings
less than ten people turned up
and then the biggest joke this trust select committee councillor committee
it was planned originally that there would be three whole days packed with people coming to coming to pass an opinion
it was UNK down to three half days
four hundred and seventeen individuals were invited to come a hundred and fifteen organisations were invited
who turned up
a few labour councillors a labour m p two or three trade union representatives a g p a g p who happens to be a councillors labour UNK wife and one or two others
does this really show that the public of are worried about the UNK hospitals
it's not my experience sitting there in the in the UNK
the practice of medicine is carrying on the same way as it has done before but we're addressing issues like quality and standards and timing and waiting lists in a way we haven't done before
i don't expect you to know this because you don't work there
i do
so perhaps you'll take it from me
the truth the truth is the truth is that more and more people and organisations are UNK the benefits of local control of n h s hospitals as in the trust hospitals
the public and especially hospital consultants are rapidly UNK and UNK that trust hospital status is a genuine attempt to address local health needs which is providing increasingly successful health care
if we look at cons sa take UNK views i'm afraid that hospital consultants are not the quickest to grasp the advantages of reform
they didn't want the health service in the first place but we rapidly came round to it
we didn't want the reforms it seems but now sixty to seventy percent of consultants are wanting the reforms
and we heard some figures about g p's ninety two percent of those g p's who've got their own budgets are seeing the benefits to their patients and their patients are saying so as well
undoubtedly benefits are coming from those sorts of changes that come from the health service reforms
and then we come on to the final point the whole issue of n h s changes in the final section
are councillors and against all the changes in the health service in the government health service reforms
have they read the white paper
are they against medical audit
are they against financial audit
isn't it good to know the results of treatment
isn't it good to know the costs of it
i've said g p budget holding is a success and so are trust hospitals
my lord mayor i totally reject this motion as a load of UNK
trust hospitals are very successful and will continue to be so
hear
councillor
lord mayor i've only been brought up under the national health service for thirty two years and i feel sorry for that poor doctor
he started off as doctor in the house then he moved to doctor at sea and now he's doctor in trouble as a result of these government policies
and it's clear we're seeing already that health authorities haven't got the money to refer patients to the trusts unless the government steps in and says that's not government policy so you won't see the problems councillor because they won't get referred to you will they
the government's policy is like an UNK comedy carry on except it's carry on regardless of professional and public opinion
the government's UNK over the national health service has turned into panic
the second wave of trusts has become like a second hand car sale
it's UNK by a wave of UNK
some government ministers denying privatisation under funding they've even denied those holy UNK of ownership and choice which are the foundation of the tory party
but the fact remains we can't trust the trusts
and i'll tell you what the problem is about the trusts and i'll explain why they are opting out of the national health service
because the powers responsibilities and assets of the national health service will be vested in a private trust
that's right we'll be waiting as we did with the planning applications to come in on hospital
they're not democratic nor are they accountable
only two have decided to hold their meetings in public
not many councillor not many of us are gonna have the choice to see the minutes of those trust bodies
the decisions that they make are gonna be based on UNK commercial considerations not health so i'm sure the doctors won't be won't be bothered with decisions councillor because the accountants will be making them for them
the fact is that it won't be an integrated service
we'll all be separate cost units won't we
like the ambulance service who is having to go out and find income having to do health and safety checks at factories just when you need an ambulance
yes who can refer to the ambulance service when they're out making money and of course the staff are gonna suffer
as has been said only one in five trusts have said they'll honour the terms and conditions of the national health service workers and we've seen the disgraceful decisions that're being made in
i'm sure we'll be seeing more of the same to follow down the road at
the trust process has been a UNK
there's been consultation
i waited UNK every morning would it drop through the door this trust leaflet
i was wa i needed the information for that debate councillor
it didn't arrive even after had given me assurance every household in would get a leaflet
they got them in
i don't know why it's outside the area
we didn't get em
so you can consult people in about what's happening in and wider UNK
the fact is there's been a complete lack of consultation
it's only this authority that the consultation process in this district and you've had the answer a UNK no to the trusts
i won't beat about the bush about creeping privatisation because in it's become a UNK
it's unique amongst health authorities
every part of the national health service in is gonna be placed under the UNK of the trust
that isn't creeping that's a UNK
and we're gonna see a three UNK attack against the public service
privatisation in three ways increasing compulsory competitive tendering and we know what that is at we've seen it plan quality control can't clean the operating theatres
yeah that really helps patients
they'll be coming out with more diseases than they went in with
specialist services specialist services UNK off
let's talk with water let's talk with b t anybody providing we can get a bit of private income in there
and a greater role for private health insurance
we know who's jumping the queue and we know which directors of the health authority have got private health insurance in
we know who they'll be jumping over yes the people who haven't got the choice of private health insurance councillor because they can't afford it
and what UNK about it is vested interests to the fore
was a great man but the only problem was he left a vested interested in the national health service and that's coming to the fore
and yes a district general manager should've resigned because he had an interest in the decision to go for the trust status
had the UNK to resign in but not in
we don't trust the trusts
we know what it means
i can't give you a strategy on how to fund the national health service
we know that the british medical association say it's under funded to the tune of six billion pounds but we'll say what we said before we took control of this council we'll open the books and we'll direct resources to priorities
and chief amongst labour priorities is the national health service
councillor
still not a sign of any policy from them on the health service par for the course
lord mayor the conservative group UNK this opportunity to debate reforms in the national health service
the only disappointment is the lack of substance in councillor motion
i must confess to be somewhat surprised to see the labour group wanting to debate UNK this issue again after their lack UNK performance in committee and council on the previous debates on this subject and today's been no different
let's look at this issues
at the last council meeting i quoted figures on comparative performance of the conservative record on health against labour's and i make no apology for UNK some of these figures and you can UNK and you can UNK and you can say what you want these are facts
no these are facts that can be borne out
nurses pay has risen by forty eight percent ahead of inflation
under labour it was cut by five percent
doctors pay is up thirty nine percent after inflation under labour it was cut by seventeen percent
the party that are the UNK of the health service
just over one million additional hospital cases were treated in UNK compared with seventy eight
the number of in patients treated has increased by one point two million
waiting lists have risen as councillor has already said under every labour government and fallen under every conservative government since the n h s was founded
that is fact
that is fact
it's ten o'clock
that is fact lord mayor and these facts will bear out
i challenge councillor to bring me the evidence saying otherwise
so
if it's doing so well
c p policy between nineteen forty six and forty eight the rise and fall of absolute egalitarianism
during the course of the third revolution and civil war between nineteen forty six and forty nine land policy of the chinese communist party UNK a process of UNK followed by UNK and was UNK by measures that attempted to UNK the party itself
in april nineteen forty eight mao wrote whoever argues absolute egalitarianism is wrong
it appeared to many that the of the c p was moving away from one of the most fundamental principles of socialism
indeed by this time mao is specifically advocating that the party ought to take a more cautious and less radical approach to land reform so as to not UNK the interests of the middle and rich peasants
but surely the aim of all communists is to UNK capitalism and eliminate all class UNK rather than working round them
in this paper i will examine the reasons behind the c p policy through this crucial period of land reform in china
due to the anti japanese war of nineteen thirty seven to forty five the united front was formed which was committed to the maintenance of a broad alliance of classes
there was a severe UNK of land reform policies to only rent and interest reduction with restrictions in and taxation too
there was a hint that this was a short term strategy mao at the seventh national congress in april nineteen forty five argued the c p has made a major UNK to land to the tiller
the communist want to return to this old policy but had to UNK his position first with rent and interest reductions
in fact a moderate policy continued after the war but there was increasing cases of the landlords UNK peasants in order to UNK rent reductions
the newly liberated areas from the UNK er in the newly liberated areas from the japanese the sit situation was more UNK
the peasants were taking things into their own hands through the anti movements in their settling of accounts
in effect land redistribution was happening in advance of c p official policy
an attempt to regain control over the UNK movement
was passed nineteen forty six
although the document land to the tiller it was essentially moderate in its tone and protected the interests of mi rich and middle peasants as well as industry and commerce
moderate land reform was a UNK cautious approach in that how that the communists had to maintain a UNK balance between the two fundamental aims of the maintenance of support and the increase of production
the moderate proposals of may the fourth would not have held however due to the UNK of the civil war
given the limitations of UNK in the may the fourth directive it was to be revealed that the provisions were largely ignored and land was taken
most of the c p areas UNK reform in a few months
about sixty million people received land through redistribution
early in nineteen forty seven mao wrote the land problem has been solved and the policy of land to the tiller has been carried out
this is a great victory
this comment UNK where many of the UNK that led to the official UNK of land policy towards which ended up in the land october nineteen forty seven
provisions of may the fourth had been seriously UNK but the communists did not realize this and thought that more land was available for redistribution
this was based upon their assumption that how that eighty percent of the land was owned by ten percent of the population which in actual fact wasn't the case
so the c p decided to press ahead with mor with the more radical campaign to get the mess UNK support and essentially their power
in my opinion the rise of absolute egalitarianism was a tactical move the c p hoped that land reform would be the key to the rapid mobilization of peasants which would enable them to defeat the superior forces of the k m t they thought that the advantages of UNK peasant mobilization UNK the UNK of UNK its support base
the involvement of land reform would bind the peasants to the communists and these hopes seemed to be confirmed in a rise of the p l a and UNK when land reform had been re UNK the land had been UNK
the c p hoped that the peasants would increase production of food and when working on their own land because of erm because of desire to increase production that the c p left commerce and industry UNK
they wanted to get rid of the feudal not capitalist elements of landlords which had to be destroyed
in many of the rural areas however reform tended to be UNK
progressive landlords still owned a lot of land and redistribution often didn't go to the poorest peasants but to peasants who were members of the communist party
it would seem that their the party had been UNK
indeed argued in his nineteen forty seven document that the may the fourth directive ha dire directive hadn't been thorough enough
he saw three main problems one the lack of UNK in the guidance of the movement two UNK in the party organization and three bureaucratic leadership i e the cadres were very UNK rather than giving the peasants political education
it was UNK that landlords and rich peasants had en entered the party erm but wh which had increased from tens of thousands to two point seven million in eleven years
according to mao this had allowed the wrong people to enter therefore in order to advance with reform UNK of the party was necessary
this th w UNK actually calls this the UNK of the party which can be cross referred to the nineteen thirty seven policies were happening
this self criticism also con er this self criticism of the party and UNK also contributed to erm the rise in absolute egalitarianism which thought would thorough and satisfy the peasants but problems arose from er absolute egalitarianism in that how that the interests of middle peasants were UNK upon and rich peasants were severely under attack
the result was a support base in the c p which was UNK and production decreased
over enthusiastic UNK led to the UNK party m morale and UNK and therefore the ability of the communists to fight the civil war was threatened
this period can be seen as almost a power struggle between the k m t and the c p competing for peasant support and the policy changes during this period reflect a change from mass mobilization and smashing local UNK agricultural production
the reasons towards this sh erm the reason why that you had the rise in er absolute egalitarianism was that the communist party thought that they'd be able to keep the speed up for the process of land reform
however they seemed
to realize that it was UNK other sectors of society when the c p could least afford to
they had to UNK the interests of poor peasants with the larger national goals of providing for the war and this meant that how the c p had to take a more moderate erm policy
erm they were hoping to use agrarian reform to mobilize mass support as well as economic and social change
it never associated ma agrarian reform as an end it itself
ideal UNK it was committed to a nation where private property was abolished
if its policy seemed more or less radical at different times it wasn't necessarily changing its view of land reform but it was keeping its final goal of socialism in sight so it had to make short term UNK
the UNK c p par army was a quarter the size of the k m t and had little money and no tanks therefore it needed mobilization of the peasants in the villages they needed the peasants to volunteer to join the p l a and to protect their own property so they thought that this would be an incentive for them
by the UNK policy the c p hoped to appeal to those peasants who still hadn't received much or any land
erm however absolute egalitarianism showed that it couldn't actually work in practice because there wasn't they UNK the amount of land which that could be UNK and you had UNK and UNK where which meant that how that industry and commerce was being threatened and landlords were just being UNK killed
erm this meant that how that er erm some of the problems actually arose from the outline landlord itself er by land law itself in that it discussed land reform in very general terms and the policy towards middle and rich peasants was left unclear erm which meant that how that classes were being mis classified and the movement was getting out of hand
erm it may have been deliberate in that how the par party couldn't be seen as too radical in order to maintain er as broad a support as possible and allow the peasants to erm give them UNK to do what they wanted to do but erm it's quite interesting though that whatever the communist party did people were going to respond in which ever way they wanted to whether or not there was a law there but they still had to sort of erm establish their UNK
erm UNK other problems which arose from the outline land law was in its deliberate ambiguity er in its deliberate erm tt sort of ambiguity because it left reg it left the law to be interpreted by regional areas which meant that how that erm in some places they totally UNK the law but the communist party had to have this flexibility because china was such a vast country and you couldn't just impose one policy per se across the country
erm the problems of the implementation of the nineteen forty seven outline land law arose from two UNK by the party leaders
one firstly if equal distribution was to be achieved peasant mobilization and increase UNK erm if equally distribution was to achieve its goals of peasant mobilization and increased production there had to be enough land available to bring most peasants up to an independent pe peasant status without UNK upon the existing er middle peasants
erm and two aware of this UNK the c p leaders saw that the UNK of the local party as a problem while that though this played some part erm the c p play was actually exaggerated according to
he said that how that the real problem was the expansion of the c p between nineteen thirty seven to forty seven and the inadequate training
the in effect the communist party had to choose between either equal distribution or the preservation of the middle peasants
however in nineteen thirty s nineteen forty seven this wasn't actually realizing it was only later on that they saw the UNK of the two aims
and so throughout this period it was them er trying importance upon these two goals
erm as the scale of the problem became clear however the party was forced to react and in a series of directives between february and may nineteen forty eight the leadership established more moderate ground rules for land reform
the new aims we was the abolition of feudalism and increased production
mao specifically said in april nineteen forty five that whoever argues absolute egalitarianism is wrong
erm the communist party needed the approval of the majority of peasants erm before land reform could take place and there was there's this sort of chicken and egg problem in that how that do you have land reform in order to mobilize peasant support or is it the peasant support that's going to enable land reform t to take place successfully
erm by nineteen forty eight erm the communist party had argued that three conditions had to be there for land reform to take place and that was that how that the area had to be UNK stable the majority of peasants erm rich peasants had to be UNK er had to want to be demanding land reform and the party cadres there had to be adequate in numbers and quality
where these three conditions weren't met then policy erm reducing interest and rents was to be taking place
erm by nineteen forty eight the military situation had changed in favour of the communist party and their policies reflected this
erm by nineteen forty eight no in nineteen forty seven with the rise of absolute egalitarianism the policy of UNK its base had helped them to erm get the peasant support and to get into power but that was no longer necessary erm and the UNK of land reform it appears had been based upon false premises which had created problems in the countryside and the party
however through this UNK of land reform the party had learnt valuable lessons and that was the UNK of egalitarianism with the demands of middle peasants which couldn't they UNK one another
however this UNK in land policy had allowed them to defeat the k m t and essentially led them to get into power so one has elements of UNK in their ideology and that how that you've got to realize that the communist party was in a very UNK situation throughout these years that how that although they did have a kind of er policy in th there ultimate aim of socialism and although it UNK appeared s quite strange that they were almost promoting capitalism that how that their aim during this period was to eliminate feudalism which was the s and then to establish capitalism in order that socialism could take place
fine thanks very much
erm that's good but there's an awful lot there it needs breaking down a bit
erm your
in a sense what you're what you're arguing is that y you start off here
with a s as we were picking up from last week a c a c in a sense that land reform is already taking place there is this sort of UNK from the masses that to move beyond the moderate policy and that is then UNK in the may the fourth directive which marks like the return to land reform going back to and then y you've got the implementation of that may the fourth directive and then out of a very difficult position in nineteen forty seven when they are under attack from the kuomintang and i in the spring of nineteen forty seven is actually taken by kuomintang
they needed a sort of a set of more radical policies to get full mobilization and it's out of that the outline agrarian law comes and then they realize the mistakes of that and there's a there's a pull back to the right so it's that kind of move to the left and then back to the right
okay
erm now can we go back to the may the fourth directive
erm h how erm dunno how many of you looked at the may the fourth directive
how did it strike you as a document
i mean what was your
your feeling from it
that there was a that they were gonna be UNK behind the peasant movement and that how that they had to sort of get a hold over all the all the changes that were happening in the country
there was a real desire to get power and that how that they thought that mass mobilization was the only way they could do it
er right
so i is i it is quite a UNK movement in that it is it is calling for UNK calling for recognizing the need for mass mobilization
it's calling for getting better control over what's happening in the country
erm it's not it's not
right
necessarily calling for UNK cos it was forced erm i it appeared to me that how that the communist party would have continued a moderate policy had the peasants not erm been demanding further radical change and in actual fact the tone of the UNK quite moderate and it's protecting middle peasants rich peasants even some landlords who had remained loyal to the party so it's not at all radical but erm it's just it's radical in the sense that how that it wants to get rid of feudalism but it's not getting rid of landlords per se as a class
right
s so it i it's a radical document but it's moderate at the same time
they're mm
it's erm i think it's quite interesting cos it's a different style in a sense it's just setting out some goals that they want to achieve but not really giving any clear instruction of how you can achieve those goals
so it's unlike a law
well it's it i mean it's a different kind of style which is
yeah
quite interesting and it's quite vague in a way
right
it's just a speech given and this is
yeah
supposed to be adopted
mhm
as i don't know in what sense it was supposed to be taken but it's just sort of UNK some objectives
mm
but it's n i still can't UNK why it was kept secret cos surely this is a fundamental point cos it is because they can't openly declare that how that they are moving away from the united front but if they're trying to show that they're moving in line with the UNK demands surely they want to show that to the peasants an so there there's it's more that how th the party cadres have been acting out of step rather than them making it clear to the peasants
mm
but er
cos if they were trying to get peasant support and erm showing the importance of peasants instead of the united front they would've made it public
wh why
well so that the peasants realized that how that it's a communist
i know but how many peasants are gonna be able to read it
they probably read it
but you're going to have erm peasant associations and their leaders are gonna be able to understand erm
but who was the directive given to
it's given to the party itself
party cadres
yes
right
so then party cadres are going to implement it
yeah
right
bu but surely this is something a at this stage you can't make public because you are still committed to the united front
there's still a sort of UNK six month UNK
i in the sense that so if you come out public with this you are you are breaking the united front and you would be seen to break the united front
so somehow you you've got to get these ideas through th that you you've recognized that it it's necessary to move on beyond the UNK the moderate policies of the united front but you can't be seen to be doing that
so isn't the only way you could do it would be to issue it UNK to cadres you would then expect the cadres to take this up and promote it but you haven't actually broken the conditions in the united front
if anything it's probably more just a suggestion
erm cos i think a lot of the i mean a lot of land redistribution had already been taking place in since about the since about january of nineteen forty six so i think the may the fourth directive is just erm an official well a secret official acceptance of this
because
you said suggestion
well a suggestion in that
because it well because it was secret and also because it was quite vague it didn't actually set out that land redistribution was supposed to take place
how was a er y you're a UNK and you receive this how do you take it
erm i suppose i mean it would depend on where you were going back to where you which region then because i mean there was such a difference in what the villages were going to erm accept
yeah
bu but would you take it just as a suggestion or would you take it as a
no they'd probably take it as an a as a er n okay to just go and just
yeah
go for it
yeah
i mean quite if 's saying this you do it
i mean there's no oh i might just a suggestion i
to do what
basically they're just telling the party to consider the demands of the peasants and do what the peasants want but then er then in the first paragraph they say that you ought to erm they ought to support the masses in their erm implementation of agrarian reform you have to give them planned guidance so it's almost that how they're telling the cadres to go out there and almost UNK the peasants demands into more of a communist one
yes but surely if you're saying in UNK chinese UNK settling accounts with landlords and reducing rents and interest the people have UNK the land directly from the landlords thus realizing the principle of the land to the tiller where the mass movement has been thorough the land problem is being or has basically been solved
in some places the movement has progressed to the point where the principle of equal redistribution equal distribution of land has been put into effect with everybody even the landlords getting of land
now if i was a UNK and i received that i think i would be thinking right erm if i really want to be at the forefront of this that's the policy that i want to promote erm and if the peasants in my area are not demanding this and not achieving this well we i can't be seen not to be going it i've gotta go with this
i mean would wouldn't you think it is a directive that if it's not happening in your area you make it happen
oh but i dunno erm cos there's always this thing about following the mass ideal what peasants want
i mean er it's a i it's sort of er you can read into it various sort of suggestions for UNK but at the same time it's got a lot of erm you know sort of and stuff about the rich peasants erm land of the rich peasants should not be UNK
yeah
yeah it doesn't really say how you how you could achieve the goal i mean it just says you know don't hurt the middle peasants give the poor peasants land it doesn't say you know
but it yeah i mean i quite take all of these qualifications but if sh if you take the first couple of paragraphs doesn't it seem to be a call to radical land reform
yes but did the party want did the party mean it at this stage
well i don't know ha haven't you got a position where er as we began to see last week there is this UNK coming in but the er i it's the peasants who've moved to the left of the party you're right that they are inappropriate to this very moderate policy of rent reduction erm a tax on UNK land is being UNK and isn't saying right we i in the same way that mao was identifying the problem in either you follow the masses or you lead them but UNK we are behind them and a sense the party has gotta recognize that it's gotta catch up with the masses and isn't that first paragraph saying look this is the way you should be going that there are peasants who are UNK the land and land reform is in effect taking place and that's what we want to see
i mean surely i it does clearly mark the return to land reform
and there is this directive to cadres saying we are returning to land reform
now i think if UNK received this UNK thought right we're off
erm and then okay you a bit later on you'd say well yes w we need to be a bit careful about this erm we mustn't be too hard on the middle peasant etcetera
bu but basically we are we are now going for land reform and if the if th the momentum from this is coming from the spontaneous actions of the peasants themselves and if it's not coming then we've gotta give them the guidance to move in that direction
but in that case is it a bit like the report where you you've got this quite radical introduction and then when you come on to the bits at the end it's it is really quite moderate
erm in both of them it's they're saying that how they're falling behind and they ought to lead them as opposed to joining them
right
in both the documents
yes
the report and this one
yes
yeah
yeah i think it's quite constant throughout the sort of what eighteen different points about how things should take place
and they themselves aren't well they have similar characteristics i think a lot of the points
yes
but i if you just started erm if you just started on sort of the second page of the directive with the twelve points if you just go through those they are all fairly moderate
i mean even the first one firmly support the demands of the masses realize the principle of land to the tiller by taking land from the landlords as they combat UNK settle accounts with landlords reduce rent and interest and get landlords to UNK to return the average half portion of rent and interest
now apart from by taking land from the landlords which is pretty in UNK all of the others are s are straight very moderate very limited acquisitions and then if you go on where you've gotta protect the middle peasant etcetera then they are really very low key methods you would not see that i think as being the return to land reform
but you're given this very general instruction to begin with that yes we are returning to land reform and that the peasants are UNK land and this is what you should be supporting and then when you come on to they as you're saying that they really are quite moderate
and there maybe there is something of a conflict between those two bits
but there's the potential for it to be interpreted quite UNK and
right
because they don't give a specific definition as to what a landlord is or a rich peasant or a middle peasant meant that how that there was a lot of flexibility within that and it's only later that they have to UNK those two documents on how to analyze the classes which erm which had been published in nineteen thirty which they felt that you know the party's moving too far away but why didn't they do it at the time
erm well i don't think you'd want to presumably you wouldn't want to UNK it
yeah
so it was all deliberate
that's what is says isn't it
it says in order to keep ninety percent of the population on our side
it actually just says that in the directive
yes
yeah
isn't very specific it gives eighteen different things you should do through all of them you could just get
mm
i mean that's the
yeah
i mean wou would as a UNK receiving this would you have been happy to take this up and implement it
yeah i think so cos it's well i mean i think it would probably be impossible to implement to satisfy a lot of the requirements in it but yeah it's quite it's
right
they but the party cadres particularly in the newly acquired areas from the japanese they wanted to seek revenge and they
yes
they wanted to er you know given these guidelines i'd think right let's as you were saying just go for it and
right
so certainly if you were
i think that would give them the UNK to
if you were a fairly radical UNK if you erm really did believe in land reform etcetera this would this would give you the go ahead to promote land reform
right
er yeah and if you were a if you were a UNK that had doubts about all this and actually wanted to go the slow more moderate line you could also find enough in here to be able to sort of UNK things a bit
i mean they've already made the mistake once of trying to lay down the law too heavily erm th this might seem this seems to accommodate most i mean how erm if you've got a UNK in a village i mean how supportive is he and how is he going to implement er radical change
i mean what does what means does he have at his disposal
erm only through working with the peasants surely
right
erm in terms of taking up their ideas UNK them encouraging them etcetera an and saying look you know this is okay er i mean to an extent that would depend on how much military security there was in the area
erm in terms of if you if you've got a very strong presence you might adopt a different line than if you haven't
mm
so you've got er those kind of problems but er there ought to be some UNK support for you
erm but basically you would be going in to a village to try and encourage land reform with this document or knowing that this document existed
so it's consistent with this grass roots initiative that
yes
happening now
okay
yeah
yes i mean it's it is very much growing out of that
okay was there anything else from the directive itself you wanted to raise
come to the situation here where it says you know it could be
yeah
and it's vague enough to be able to do that
i mean if it wh what it is trying to do is to is to UNK the fact that land reform was already taking place and therefore you you've got to give the go ahead to that
yeah
but you can't make that public and you are still worried that it can go too far to the left and therefore you you've got a range of erm quite moderate proposals which come in which i if they were implemented would UNK and would maintain the su the support of the ninety percent th that you are still only seeking to UNK really those landlords who are not going to be prepared to come back within the system
an and in that sense it's quite moderate and in the sense of protecting middle peasants it's quite moderate erm but in terms of encouraging the move back to more radical land reforms it is an important step forward
mhm
i was just thinking could you consider it a panic measure
rather than something which is and calculated you know
i don't think that i wouldn't see it as a panic measure
it's just that they were worried that they were losing they were worried that they were losing support of losing cos the peasants are off on their own you know what's the logical path
you're a party
i it it's your means of getting back in control then
yeah
that it is happening you've either got to just let it happen
yeah
or you've gotta try and stop it or you've gotta get in there and sort of organize it take it on your shoulders and i think this is a recognition that erm changes were taking place which were taking peasants beyond the straight moderate programme
because th there there'd been statements from mao until the end of nineteen forty five where he's still talking about land to the tiller being some way off
yeah
i in that our present policy which will continue is simply the rent reduction interest rate reduction
erm now given what less than five months er before this may the fourth directive mao is still saying that this marks quite an important shift in policy
and i it's a clear statement at least to the cadres that moderate policy has now been abandoned and we are now off into land reform because this is what is happening anyway
because these very moderate policies have allowed the peasants to come through with actions which in effect mean land reform and we need to get back in control of that
yeah
that's what hanging on to there cos like it's just like erm the party's worried that it's getting a bit left behind and needs to
yeah
catch itself up
yeah
not because you know it's a revolutionary strategy but
right
it's just the pure political aspect that because people are moving on and you need to be seen to be you need to use that for your own advantage
right
which is itself
right
but i think he's a bit worried i read into this that there's a current there where you know the peasants are getting very radical our is we can't be too radical and therefore we need to issue something which is gonna
yeah
but it's also fears that the party itself is becoming too radical too they always want to control two elements and i mean on the last page point number sixteen it says that how that erm tt that how that the communist party members ought to UNK from securing undue benefits by taking advantage of their leading position
ah right
and so that shows that how that they i mean it implies that that's happening and that ought to be controlled
so they're UNK they're falling behind the peasant movement but they're also losing control over their own party members and that was as important as erm following the peasants
i mean they need to have UNK i mean they need to UNK their own party before they can even go out there and try to direct the masses
cos
right
the UNK gonna be UNK
how are the party members taking advantage of this
erm by the land that's being UNK they are actually keeping it for themselves and that how that they're
mm
perhaps UNK more revolutionary erm ideas in the peasants
how were they taking more themselves
well just when the UNK they would give their own families UNK more land
or perhaps through erm UNK in that the landlords are paying UNK to them so that the landlords were left in effect with more land than they ought to have been
mm
right
wasn't it erm also that the people who got in there first often took the most
mm
took the wealth and they were often people that were elected to cadres because they showed initiative
right ho hold on so this is taking place within the village
yeah
that i it would be the people who stood up first and accused the landlords and took the lead in the settling accounts procedure they were more likely to be able to get more in the way of than anybody else that they would get more land more erm better quality land the animals UNK etcetera and those sort of th those peasants who were taking the lead were actually members of the party were they
mm
right
well that's what
if er in the anti UNK movements it was
also that it was the party cadres that were taking the lead but in the settling of accounts the peasants
themselves in advance of erm what the communist party was
i in what sense were these people party cadres then
i mean i the these are individual peasants from a village who are standing up and taking the lead in UNK landlords etcetera but they are not the party cadres coming in from outside
because i if you're from outside the village you would have no entitlement to land in the village at all would you
so i it's peasants who have been UNK by party cadres who themselves are then becoming members of the communist party and are taking advantage of that position by getting more than they're entitled to
right
okay
i mean wh do you think this was a widespread process
well yeah
obviously yes because of the amount of land that was UNK
i it's saying something about the motivation of the people who are doing this those peasants who were taking the lead and becoming members of the party
because i in theory presumably they s they shouldn't have been abusing their position they shouldn't be gaining more because the whole point was to do it for the masses particularly i mean if you were a party UNK erm you shouldn't be getting more out of it than anybody else
according to 's account there was quite a lot of abuse by the party members who had actually managed to UNK and UNK different peasants or
mm
landlords and they used to do whatever they wished to do
erm
right
either you know gain land or do things with people
i didn't think there was that much UNK but there were sort of women UNK young peasants who'd come into a bit of money
but i there weren't any accounts of like actually communists UNK
yeah there was a
i thought there was a there was a full chapter on how the cadres and the party members sort of went beyond their allowed position and took
yes
advantage of their position
so is at least providing the opportunity for that
oh yes
well it was also how they distributed it as well cos it needn't necessarily just be the cadres it was dunno there's a scene where they the house like you get in a queue take what you want
like a car boot sale
but er wh why from the point of view of the peasants was this UNK taking place
because in a sense the whole our analysis of the was that this er very moderate policy of rent reduction interest rate reduction of building up reductions that in itself was producing the required results wasn't it
well why was it producing the required results because it in fact it was beyond what it erm you know it specifically was set out to do
cos in actual fact there was a lot of sort of de UNK redistribution because er some of these account settling things were just so ridiculous you know make them pay for crimes their family had committed over the last sixty years or whatever
so in actual fact they
they didn't pay it back they give up their land
mm
and so it was just another way of
right
during rent reduction
yes
was it during
accounts it was
was it
during
mm
bu but why is that happening
because wh when we were looking at the i mean sort of things the implication to me seemed to be that this in itself is a successful policy rent reduction interest rate reduction methods improving er productivity increasing input in themselves are satisfying the demands of the peasantry and you would not need to go beyond that i mean well didn't need to he isn't the ideal but he didn't need to go and he was doing very well out of it
s so where is this UNK coming from
i mean is it that the rent reduction interest rate reduction is not working and in order for the peasant to get enough for themselves they needed to go further
or are they just greedy and saying well we're doing quite well out of rent reduction but if we you know if we the landlords we're gonna get some more
i think the fact that the japanese had UNK must have something to do with it cos then they probably had a chance to attack the people who'd er UNK with the japanese
right
they wouldn't just accept rent reductions from
right so after nineteen forty five there cer there certainly would have been a momentum towards this in the areas where there'd been a strong japanese presence because there would be more UNK and there would be some more obvious targets
mm
but in the old liberated areas like say around i in theory none of this should be necessary very little of it should've been happening
yeah
but it might also be happening where the communist party have provided some sort of secure physical presence and where if as a result of past exploitation there was a substantial degree of UNK towards landlords which it would be that was carried out
but it needn't necessarily be erm the kind of direct material gain in terms of well we need to go beyond rent reduction because rent reduction is not hasn't given us enough because in theory rent reduction ought to be giving you as much you need
maybe the erm peasant er their UNK are just growing and you know
reduction i want a bit more
right
a subtle change in psychology
yes
they also had
i just think it was a momentum that was caused by some villages feeling safer from the nationalists as they got further and further from the front and therefore more and more people a bit f erm being willing to sort of talk again shout up against the landlords and as they saw as they saw that their neighbours were getting land all the others decided well they're getting land we might as well talk to have a talk about them the problems and the harsh treatment that we've had in years before
so what's happened to our moral economy
cos you're an UNK
yeah
mm
just like that almost
yeah i think
well you've got a lot of nationalism as well cos er a lot of them article forty seven when they said that the problem of the nation was the result of the landlords and so there's all this sort of nationalist and there's also
mm
party erm line saying that identifying anyone with any power in the community as er well you can identify them so therefore you've already got that directive and then you've got
yes
you imply that it's er i mean quite easily
right yes
yes
but if we if w we accepted the moral economy which was that the peasant has a view of what is right and fair and once that fairness is established for him that's it he doesn't want to go any further than this
what we're in effect what we're saying is that for a number of years the communist party has provided has made that moral economy work i in a s and made it work very well because rents have been reduced more than the peasants would expect erm er interest rate is extremely low
the conditions of the moral economy have been met okay the landlords have been forced to if one accepted that was the way in which the peasants saw the world they would not have gone beyond that
i in a way th that they're going beyond it not because the party's encouraging them to do it but because they're doing it themselves
now does that call into question the moral economy at all
does it call into question the fact that was really what the peasants did think and believe or were the peasants UNK and if they felt they could get away with anything they would get away with anything
isn't it more the case that it's not so much what they're trying to get away with it's just that how what was happening the peasants did see the world that they were in but with the communist party and the revolution that the idea is to change the way the peasants see the world and how they view themselves
right
which is what
right
so they're changing the way
structures their possibilities i mean at one stage they would have been at a certain level hadn't got a landlord their income but that's within one particular moral economy now the idea here is to break that down you know just get rid of the circle altogether
but also the moral economy low rates so presumably means less of the sort of loyal
so presumably you know with all this in the earlier period that erm people are gonna be you know have less ties towards with people traditional ties it's much more so they would just see people who were higher up in society with more other people with you know rather than
right
yeah
within oh sorry
within the moral economy there was potential for them to be revolutionary though because erm you had this sub culture which was
yes
very much part of which ran alongside this moral economy
mm
and so when the system clearly wasn't working the peasants would form their own UNK and
yes
erm supporting agencies and stuff so it's not necessarily running against the idea of a moral economy just that moral economy developing its revolutionary potential
yes
and that's what mao saw in nineteen twenty seven
right
yes
so obviously there are a number of
one is that i it may be that the old moral economy worked because the peasants recognized that in a sense that was the way they w well they could not stand up and criticize the landlord th the most they could do was to try and get the landlord to behave in a reasonable way and that within that there would then be the sub culture the counter culture of UNK of mutual aid and what is happening in is in part that the communists are making them think the old moral economy work but in part they are picking up on those sub culture bits because the whole of mutual aid idea is coming from existing peasant UNK
but what they're doing which is more important than that they are beginning to change the way in which the peasant sees the world
er that they are changing a whole range o of non economic variables which allow the peasant the world to see the world doesn't have to be like this we can actually question the landlord and not only can we get away with it but we can get something out of it
and once that has begun to change the peasant is off because he he's begun to see a new world that he can realize
how widespread now is erm the education movement now in you have much more schools now is this spreading
erm tt yes but not er w once the war
education
finishes we are talking about the whole of north china right the way through UNK
right
erm i e you've got an enormous area where sometimes you're moving in very quickly and particularly in UNK y you're trying to get there extremely quickly and you haven't got the time to build up that kind of infrastructure but that is gonna come later
so i don't think it's there er and it can't be created quickly enough
mm yeah
also what struck me was now that they they're not fighting the japanese erm they're not required to make the UNK of war that they were so perhaps they're going to think right let's see what we can make out of this i don't i no longer have to pay x tax because
right
there are no more soldiers to maintain
yes
what can i do well i mean the there are but i mean well they're not it's not as expensive is it once your
the party's not gonna reduce its tax but it's fighting the at least as expensive as fighting
but surely the some of the UNK on the peasants surely gotta be less now that they're no longer fighting the japanese as well
but then why would mao in nineteen forty five say that how that they'd made a major UNK to land to the tiller but that this is a correct one and they're going to that land reform has to be taken in stages and they're going to first of all reduce rent and i mean er
yes that's
what you're implying is that how that they had a radical policy in mind but because of the war it had to be UNK but i somehow i tend to believe the reverse that how that they may have continued the moderate policy but was forced into it because of circumstances to forced to erm into UNK their policies
the they certainly moved back to UNK much more quickly than mao had expected
mm
erm and that presumably in part is because there is this radical UNK from the peasants in part because it would need a new policy after nineteen forty five wouldn't you because not just on the financial side but er a lot of your mobilization has come through a as you say nationalism now once the japanese are defeated that's finished
you've also lost your easy targets in terms of up until that point you could always very legitimately attack japanese UNK
now you y you you've gotta find a substitute for that
don't you also attack the church
in effect you you've got the church you've got erm you might sort of move from UNK with the japanese to UNK with the kuomintang i e the counter UNK
so you would still be able to identify targets but those targets may become a bit more general i e because in the past the landlord as a class had always sided with the kuomintang then i it gives you the opportunity to go back and attack them almost the landlords per se in a way you couldn't during the japanese war because clearly loyal landlords were fighting the japanese
but you need a new set of targets anyway and somehow you y you've gotta and the may the fourth directive by returning to land reform is beginning to open up those as possibilities
how widespread were the accounts described by
i mean that's just one village or one county that he's described but how widespread throughout the north
yes
it's almost a bit
no i think there is there is a lot of evidence that this is happening in all of the villages
right
er and in some villages they went a great deal further than they did in
right
erm but certainly the er the period has given the communist party er quite a large number of trained cadres which will be able to go out into the villages in a way that they hadn't been able to in because it would that was all too soon
but through erm the period particularly after campaigns in nineteen forty one forty two you you've got a l a lot of people coming into the party then they've all been UNK with the spirit you can then send them out into the villages
erm they are going into the villages they're making contacts with individual peasants erm it's those peasants that they get to stand up and make the first UNK it's those peasants who join the party erm and the process can build up in a way which was more difficult before then
so you have got this basis for mass mobilization together with some of the education
mm
okay shall we s stop there and have a
we'll go on to the itself
right
okay so we we've the may the fourth directive er we we've now got the may the fourth directive operational
tt erm and the next thing is the outline agrarian law so let's have a look at this
first of all what is the outline law saying and secondly why is tho those particular provisions necessary
what's the outline er agrarian law all about and what's
well in effect it says that how that it's now the party is UNK absolute egalitarianism the aim that landlords k m t officers everyone's going to get equal distribution of land
it also erm pr it's protecting commerce and industry and that
UNK essentially i it's absolute egalitarianism means that everybody within the village or the
mm
the everybody will acquire the same land and the same quality of land
yes and that no gonna be given to c p cadres or to or to landlords
right
it's just
is that different to any other land law before is well is this a new idea or is it just picking up on other
UNK quantity and quality that's an old idea isn't it
yeah
mao's policies
right
is it any different at all from that land law of mao's in nineteen thirty
in effect
was this erm differences in quality to be made up by more land
or was it the same amount of land
erm i in theory if you if you balance quantity and quality everybody should end up with the same
but with mao's law it wasn't complete erm egalitarianism because landlords erm rich peasants were to receive less they were meant to be UNK weren't they
no not within that's within the nineteen forty one law
surely in the nineteen thirty law mao's policy was in effect absolute egalitarianism in that everybody within the village in including depending how you read those definitions
mm
but including possibly landlords or at the very worst their families would have a share of land
mm
so i in a sense this has gone back to one of mao's early views except that there is a difference now in that er the land is being UNK for ownership whereas for mao earlier it was it was for your use
although it's slightly unclear to me you know because if you take article two it's land ownership rights of all landlords are abolished but then you're distributing land back for their ownership so it's not quite clear what's happening with that
the way to do it
yeah
yeah
maybe it's their past rights over
yes
right so even landlords within this absolute egalitarianism policy are now to get land
so ev everybody in the village will end up with the same amount
few exceptions
criminals
right
yes fair enough yeah
okay
so
it's they
have it for ownership instead of state owned
yeah
because of their erm desire to increase production
the
right
communist party thought that how that by giving peasants their own land it would give them the incentive to increase production which
yes
they needed to
right
and as you said the one exception to all of this is industrial and commercial property
mm
so anything that a landlord or a rich peasant had owned in terms of industry or commerce would be left alone and i it would still be his
so you were in a sense UNK land ownership but you were not UNK incomes
you were not UNK assets
in many ways there's well there's as well is that repeat a lot of the things that are said
yes
word for word but just sort of changing the vocabulary isn't it
yeah
yes
yeah
right
because landlords were seen as progressive and they might want they di the erm communists didn't want to get rid of them as a class but in their feudal capacity
right
so this is very much part of the mass line
th this is it is a mass line at work th there's very little in here in terms of class UNK
erm i it's more about landlords sort of being UNK into a new mass society
isn't it well i mean isn't it more about just keeping production up
mm
i mean that's what i thought this movement towards egalitarianism isn't doesn't actually reflect any change in ideology at all
right
yeah
okay so wh why then do we go from the may the fourth erm directive into this specific idea of egalitarianism
what why i mean
well
i in a sense it is a it is a shift to the left because under the may the fourth directive erm rich peasants in particular would've been left out of it altogether and there would still be some landlords who were who would maintain their property but now he's shifted to the left and this does represent a further attack on landlords cos everybody comes down to the same level
well i think you can look at it on two levels and one reason is to change the party structure shake them up a bit cos there's evidence that they were erm you know moving to the right and UNK with er rich peasants and landlords and the other on the level is actually having a policy which would get mass support and this obviously would require incentives in the form of land to peasants
right
so that is the basic drive behind this to provide a greater incentive for the majority of peasants to support actively support the party
mm
why is that needed though
wh why is
cos the military situation that it er well from er says you know they realized apparently that it was gonna take at least seven years to win over the nationalists so they
right
might need more support
and this
right
was one way of getting it
right
so th there's a UNK need for support because of the nature of the civil war now and they are under quite substantial pressure and therefore you need to mobilize the population behind you and to get that mobilization you you've got to offer more struggle fruits to the peasants and absolute egalitarianism is the way to offer them the maximum
but their two aims UNK because on the one hand they're trying to protect production and to allow erm er UNK private enterprise and capitalism to develop but on the other hand they're erm trying to UNK all the land er because the may the fourth directive wasn't going far enough they needed to be more severe upon landlords
yes
and erm and so it appears if you just take this document at this time that how that they're placing less emphasis upon production i mean if their aim is to if their primary aim is to mobilize mass support that how that production was going to decrease because it was gonna UNK upon rich and middle peasants
right
right
so but w why is that you need absolute egalitarianism
why have you got to go for equality
cos that's one of the communist
perhaps i mean it's we don't know in nineteen october nineteen forty seven whether the communist party actually really did think that absolute egalitarianism might be able to work
so
it was only the events afterwards that proved that it didn't work but they weren't clear at this time
so it's ideology which is driving it
so that we are now back into socialism we we're sort of now back into our communist ideals
well that's a possibility
right
it certainly wouldn't be against the ideological er ideas of the party but i mean that it was an ideological it was more practical cos it was it was related the UNK campaign of the party cos we know they're having these campaigns
right
yes
the may the fourth directive after
right
and they found a lot of you know serious crimes going on in the party and stuff
yes
like that
right
it could be both it could be pragmatic but also erm UNK the communist cause
well why did they just why was it rejected
right
two months later then
because it was shown to not work
yeah exactly
well in other words the pragmatic UNK far more important than the ideological one is
yes
but we're looking at it with hindsight we can't just say that because of this that and the other erm that UNK did UNK at this particular point in time
oh i dunno i dunno
i think mao was quite UNK up on the whole situation i think he realized that to win the war they had to erm adjust the mass support very carefully and i think that's basically what this i think that's why two months later they er they er gave up this document cos he was worried then they'd lose the middle UNK support
is yes is there another element to this though that what in your new more difficult military situation you need to mobilize the mass of support behind you which er essentially means UNK the poor peasants is it possible that within the may the fourth directive although the poor could have done much better they need not necessarily do very much better
i e th there is no guarantee within the may the fourth directive that the poor do significantly a as a group all do well because th they there's nothing to guarantee that they all share properly in the fruits of struggle
no
no
after they had come forward with this
right
directive
right
but that's but the this actually sets out that everybody will get the same it doesn't it has absolutely nothing to do with people coming forward
so it's a guarantee that everybody
yeah
will get the same you haven't had
in effect they are they're appealing to the poorer peasants hoping to get more mobilization
yes
but i think two months later mao realizes that this is UNK
right
s so the position as of say the summer nineteen forty seven when you're you this law was being UNK the reports coming back are that although there is the opportunity for the poor to do better as a as a matter of course they're not all doing better
now that's a bit of a surprise to you in the sense that you believed that ten percent of the population owned eighty percent of the land and therefore this kind of erm a attack on the rich was happening through the may the fourth directive that would've produced enough to bring everybody up to a reasonable middle peasant status
and it doesn't seem to be happening
now if you accept the ten percent UNK the eighty percent there must've been enough but the poor are not getting it
so why weren't they getting it
this is one of 's questions isn't it
when he says that erm that sort of that's what the c p leadership thought and so they thought that if they weren't getting the land then something must be going wrong with the policy
right
and the thing that was going wrong was this erm was this problem of the operation of the cadres
they
right
were basically erm UNK upon and this sort of er all the landlords and rich peasants UNK the whole process
right
s so it's either that the cadres are being UNK they are protecting the landlords so they are keeping too much or the problem is that the cadres what we looked at earlier the cadres are getting in themselves and they are taking too much for themselves
mm
right
so the may the fourth directive is not working because it's not UNK that the poor get enough to bring them up to the middle peasant status which is the aim
mm
so th the outline agrarian law is simply a means of ensuring that everybody will come up to a middle peasant status
no
but surely that's not possible
it must be possible
but if you accept this ten percent and the eighty percent that it
yeah
is possible
must be possible
mm
i mean if you've got if
if you've got that much land there must be enough
yeah
but argues that how that in actual fact by this time land reform had already taken place and there wasn't enough any more land to be UNK
th there's going to be some
yeah well some but not as much as the communist party
right
expected so although
right
th there were cases of cadres being UNK and taking too much land for themselves the communist party actually exaggerated this problem and that the main cause was erm the very low UNK land ratio
right
so a as you say that the problem is that erm as this process gets under way and er i s so i think it's not just absolute UNK in that everybody will get the same i think there was an assumption that there would be enough for everybody becoming up to a middle peasant status
and therefore i it wasn't just the poor s saying well i want the same as everybody else i want as much as a middle peasant
now wh what were in your introduction w were you saying that there simply wasn't enough land for that to happen
and therefore in the process of trying to bring the poor up to er some of the land of the middle peasant had to be taken and that's a problem isn't it
oh very much so because i mean all through this er through this period the communists are making they want to unite themselves firmly with the peasants
right
and so that anything which will possibly UNK the middle peasants would be would be disastrous
right
so at the point where it becomes clear that absolute egalitarianism is going to UNK on the interests of the middle peasants you need to stop it
but
but it could also be used to their advantage in that how that erm absolute egalitarianism would speed up the process of land reform and eliminate feudalism whereas a moderate policy would just take ages for this to happen so
yes
right
it was an UNK at the time
a UNK one
mm
so the outline agrarian law policy was the right policy
i no i get the impression that you know everyone just everyone just kind of UNK out end of nineteen forty six forty seven and they were just oh god what are we gonna do now wh what can we do to get some more support oh excellent yeah let's go for equal distribution what a great idea and then all of a sudden they think oh no it's not you know perhaps it's not such a good idea after all
i really i really get the impression that there's it's incredibly sort of nobody really knows what to do you know there's this big UNK thing just happening and people are very confused about the whole thing because the m may the fourth directive isn't particularly er it didn't give anybody an absolute guideline guide to erm what to do
in october nineteen forty six mao says to the cadres look get land reform sorted out don't worry about the war just get land reform sorted out
you know and they probably went well yeah what do we do
what exactly
are we meant to do
can't blame them with the k m t knocking on your though
what
well you can't really blame them that much with the k m t knocking on the door
well i dunno i mean on the one hand in nine in nineteen forty five i think it was they were saying you know well in order to do have s successful land reform you need three conditions they said the same thing in nineteen forty eight they said you need this and then we have to be UNK secure but then in nineteen forty six they're saying no don't worry about it just get the land reform sorted out just do it
and i really get the impression that for a while you know there was there was just this incredible rush and they just thought oh we've got to do something and tha that's what and this idea that you've gotta be right
but why was there an incredible rush
i mean
what
where was that incredible rush coming from
the war i reckon
yes
i reckon it starts with the war
yeah
no they all of a sudden really need support
they saw that you know the this wa wash your face campaign and all of a sudden their cadres were pretty unpopular and they thought goodness me we're really doing something we're just doing something wrong and we've got to try and mobilize support we need a radical policy
right
isn't i this is back simon
they have th that they need sort of a radical policy to mobilize support erm when all the oth all the other radical policy
that do you it it's this sort of catch twenty two between erm land reform and mass mobilization
do you need mass mobilization in order to get land reform or is the only way in which you can achieve land reform to have UNK mass mobilization
well i th i get the impression that there's sort of a there's an assumption that the communists are making is that you know you get land reform sort of like give these people a bit of land
yeah
and fight for me
have you got a better idea
well no
there is no better way but er the problem with that is that you know okay you might get you might get some peasants who say well we're really grateful we'll go off and fight but some of them might just say no look we've got some land i'm not gonna leave it
but they should put in little sort of qualifications like er they gave people land and if they went off to fight then it would be guaranteed that the land would be UNK
i think that's very important
right
because i think one of the most worrying things that for the soldiers at the front was will their family be looked after and will their land sort of be alright when they get back
yes yeah
cos it was quite a respectable position as well wasn't it
and also i think not everyone was accepted in the army they sent a lot of people back
yeah
that's right
yes
because of what
because they weren't fit enough physically even mentally ill i should imagine will be sent
what cos they weren't committed enough to it
er now w we've got this position during the course of nineteen forty seven and it's really the first half of forty seven which i think is the crucial one when the launch its offensive erm it's a very big shock for the communists th they you know itself is UNK and
mm
th they defend that against the japanese and then in early in forty seven the come in and take it over so it's an enormous psychological shock erm and they recognize that erm they do need to er they recognize that the way is through mass support they think that's what they've gotta get and they've gotta get it quickly
in a sense they were back now in the situation that they needed support from the peasantry quickly and surely the way to do that was to offer them land to give them land reform because rent reduction interest ra interest rate reduction is not enough
you've got to go the land reform
and if you go for the land reform if you promise the peasants the land erm and you're moving towards a position of y you you're still thinking exactly what your policy is but under that might come a realization that absolute egalitarianism is the best way of doing this look th there is enough land for us to be able to do this is the simplest process which will guarantee for middle peasant status it will bring their living standards up to acceptable levels
i if we go for land reform we will get mass mobilization
i mean i it's a fair enough strategy isn't it
i think that's what i think
yes
in the end of the speech about you know if agrarian reform is thorough
right
you know i think that was very much what they had in mind
yes
mobilize people
yeah
but it's all based upon their assumption that land reform was the erm the solution to the agrarian problem
they saw that how that they saw the chinese problem essentially as one of exploitation and that how that as soon as that they saw it as the land problem
mm
erm now if they i mean they didn't even consider that how other options which might have increased the living standards because land reform
right
would enable them to get into power
yes
and that was what i mean if they had erm decided to take more te point of view and to increase production through improved methods of farming and so on that UNK erm i mean we can see that would've created higher yields and that because we've assessed the situation now
yes but how long would that take
that would take ages so they're having land reform as a means to an end and that how that it's improving living standards of peasants so that they get mass support land reform was the only political option they had
right
fine
but is i mean w what we've said so far is that the problem with this is that there isn't enough land and therefore it UNK on the middle peasant and that's the problem that's the reason you had to change your policy
but was that the only problem
what about the poor themselves
you know y you're a poor peasant and the party's coming in conditions of civil war and we say right erm we've gotta get land reform and the land reform process is being done not by the party coming in and imposing it is very much done by the party encouraging and enabling the peasants to take the moves themselves to stand up and begin the criticism
ho how can you going to be to do that i mean right you're a poor peasant and i explain to you all the benefits of land reform what are you gonna say to me
well it depends you know it depends if i expect erm my landlord to come back and chop my head off or something
right
i mean that's very important there was a lot of suffering i think it's about the people who i can't remember returned to the villages
yes
yeah
and they UNK out some terrible UNK of people who
absolutely yeah
communist
yes
so
especially if the k m t
exactly
so if you are a poor peasant you are thinking hold on the party expects me to stand up to this landlord and UNK him of this and this actually point a finger at him when there is a chance that you know the kuomintang is twenty miles away and they i know they've come into other villages as they come back m of land to peasants s in the form of land
there must've been with erm in forty seven was it the UNK campaign where they allowed the nationalists to sort of drive through the i don't know the defences they must've been fairly certain of their support in certain areas by then
because they actually allowed the nationalists to sort of drive a an attack through into villages and take over erm and they assumed that they would drive too far erm
yes
so they must've been fairly sure of their support to allow them to come into an area of villages
they acknowledged as a mistake later on didn't they
i mean in a sense they were just UNK peasants for that strategy
but once the stories get around that the communists have not created a strong enough military base to guarantee that land reform will hold
mm
and you know what happens i mean i and therefore you er there might be a problem within in that you might not get the necessary mass mobilization support from the land reform because of the of the possible consequences
well it did up the UNK somewhat didn't it
yeah
if you were gonna go for it but then they changed it didn't they
when they had their sort of semi liberated areas and stuff
right okay so out of this comes a
yeah they realize that
a different set of policies but as of forty seven the strategy is we need to mobilize the masses quickly behind us now there must be enough land to give the er peasants enough
th the only reason there might not i if they're not getting enough it is because erm ei either too much land is being held by the landlords because the cadres are or the cadres taking the land
now er out of that comes the view well maybe this is
maybe we've got to guarantee security first and then go on and secondly a realization well maybe there may not be enough land
and therefore more protection for the middle peasants
but that would ex at least explain why the outline agrarian law takes the form that it did and what was the thinking behind it
but we're saying if you look at right these two factors one is the you've got land reform er on absolute UNK dunno what you call it grounds the other is that you're getting the peasants to do it themselves
yeah
they're just simple really measures of the urgency of the situation
yes
yeah
otherwise erm what did how did they mo mobilize enough er forces then
because we decided that they didn't have a strong enough military base er w what erm gave the peasants the incentive to join
well er quite a lot of peasants did join because they presumably they were motivated by land reform er it's clear that did happen
mm
and i it wasn't in all areas that the came back i mean in some areas there was enough security but you wouldn't know which area was going to be secure
right
but it was er i mean i it's clear that the policy was successful in that they do mobilize a lot of peasants and they
the nationalist offences so i mean that bit of it worked
it's just that the costs involved in a lot of peasants being killed and you then begin to UNK on middle peasants
so y you're weighing the gains of it's a success it is successful in terms of mobilization but there are costs involved
oh
i would have thought it's it would be harder and harder to mobilize the peasants
i mean weren't they getting quite tired of these land reforms years
er mm i don't think so because the we are with all of this we are still in north china so this was the first time land reform has come
erm and therefore the peasant wasn't yet in a position where my god this is not another land ran land reform
er i mean i don't think that had begun to build up but yes i mean that is coming to be a problem
i mean er and if you go through it goes on and on and on erm and the changes in policy come to be a problem
erm one thing before we move on do you think there is a distinction or a difference between the outline agrarian land reform which is essentially 's creation and the speech that he gives at the end of the conference
do they conflict at all
in that i in the speech isn't recognizing some of the difficulties isn't he recognizing the need to protect the middle peasant
and are there points in the speech where he specifically says you must protect the interests of the middle peasant
mm
the speech was written before the er which speech are we talking about
the speech UNK the national land conference
yes but the national land conference approved the outline agrarian law erm and then it be it became formal policy in october so it is after but it was the land conference which actually UNK it
yeah is what you're saying is that on the one hand he was saying right let's have absolute equality of distribution but at the same time he quite clear that peasants
right
so i
yeah
i mean i in a sense i think he was he's been criticized UNK for this because he UNK all the blame for absolute egalitarianism whereas in fact if you look at the details behind it he was aware of the dangers of UNK on the middle peasant and was warning against that and saying look this shouldn't happen
so if the cadres had taken the law and 's speech there UNK been the sorts of problems that we came up against
i e the middle peasant shouldn't have been UNK upon
but then if the middle peasant wasn't UNK upon the poor UNK got enough
mm
so that y you couldn't win either way
right
so the law was implemented it became fa clear fairly quickly that in the process of that implementation it did lead to UNK on the r middle peasant
at that point you have to call a halt to it
well what you consider the er middle peasants to be and obviously the erm
right
communists er placed a great deal of importance
cos as a class they were a great body
yeah
cos as land UNK more and more successful then presumably more people were becoming middle peasants
right
they made up almost forty percent of the army
right
erm i think there was there was erm they definitely made the decision by then to sacred cow and they can't harm the middle peasants
right
yeah mao said we support the UNK demand for equal distribution of land in order to help the masses of peasants UNK to abolish the system of land ownership but we do not advocate absolute egalitarianism whoever UNK absolute egalitarianism is wrong such thinking is UNK backward and UNK in nature
yeah
it's a pretty nasty criticism
yeah
the whole basis of
then he goes on to explain why
and this is in nineteen forty eight is it
yeah
but at the same time so presumably he would've supported it
yeah the l that's the UNK thing as well he tries to criticize it on ideological grounds
mm
right
which they admitted work cos it was a load of rubbish
right
yes
but what about when i dunno i it in his speech he's being very honest and saying well look we really need the support blah and the and then tries to put this er bit in about erm marxist UNK
that's life and is er well wh what's all that about
i think he's trying to do a number of things here
yeah
and this is the problem an and as you get into them they all do begin to conflict
but in terms of the change of policy does this fit with the kind of UNK view of excesses
that is to right a wrong you need to go to excess
no i don't think so i think there's a difference because the other excesses were on the UNK part now it's okay whatever the peasants did you know it's not terrible it's fine to let the peasants do that and also erm into the war period the peasants are gonna but mustn't do it this time it's like okay now we're the party that's saying let's go as far as we can
right
it's the party actually saying that we should promote rather than allow
who's er who's doing the excesses
who's taking
well it's
it's the poor isn't it because they
yeah but it's on the instruction it's on the instructions of
not no not
cos the poor they can do what they want
sort of bits i've got a bit here and it says all landlords may be UNK immediately you know
right
yes
so the leadership
right
did get it all wrong and
well but e bu but that i is inconsistent with what is telling us th there's nothing in 's speech which whi which UNK that kind of excessive violence
i mean if you take his view it's fairly moderate
you're quite right that a number of er statements are coming out which do really give erm UNK to this kind of violence bu but basically the violence is still being created or led by the poor in their attempt to get more
now
no but that was a result of the er UNK land law in itself wasn't it
yes
well i it certainly it allowed you to do that
yes
but i think one might still see this in terms of mao's ideas on excesses that clearly the situation was not right in the first half of nineteen forty seven
the may the fourth directive hadn't gone far enough you needed to go beyond that
y you needed to right that wrong
now in order to move yourself forward you might need to go to excess you might need at least to tolerate excesses
once you've gone too far and i think this is where the centre is crucial the centre has got to say we have gone this is the point where we have gone too far and we need to stop
but you then ended up somewhere which was better than where you started off from
and in order to get from a to b you needed to go to excess
mm
well yeah but the reason i think you can condemn the excesses is because it's
middle peasants to UNK
yes
er
bu but er but you're not unhappy with those excesses taking place because th they may be necessary in order to move you forward
more and more saying look and let's try and kill a few less people
ah but only when it's realized it it's gone too far
yeah but w too far because it's affecting the middle peasants
peasants
that becomes your criterion
yeah
mm
yeah he didn't really care he wasn't too bothered but at least that's what he said at one point
but if you've got that idea of what mao's idea of excess is you know that you can have excesses then you go f forward and then you come back there
yeah
that in itself is the party saying we should do this
i mean it's not just letting the excesses go which i think understand it when you first said it so that idea in itself is a party idea it's not just letting the peasants do it and say well okay what you're trying to say now is that okay that we have got this strategy we'll let the excesses go and then we'll stop it we get to about stage b and stage c and move on and move on
that in itself is a party isn't it
er yes the i think the one bit of it that is not mao's is that is that you do unfortunately in a sense have these statements from the various UNK and this is a th this absolute terror is okay
erm er i mean if you go back to 's view i it is it's legitimate for the for the masses to commit excesses it's not legitimate for the party to promote them
now i think in 's view those party s those UNK statements were excessive and i think you wouldn't probably have gone along with them or at least he UNK to within his own terms of reference
erm but without that as long as it's the masses who are committing this it's okay because you need that in order to create the when it's gone too far when it's counter productive in a not for the individual UNK poor peasant because he's doing very well out of it but in terms of the movement as a whole you begin to stop it
and who makes that decision
it's mao's
how much how much erm by a landlord cos i mean they didn't even attend the conference
apparently
i find it difficult to believe he would not have known that
i mean for christ sake it's a conference lasts three months
erm
i mean o okay it's a difficult area but i just don't believe the communications were that bad that he didn't know what was going on and wasn't in a position to say look this is wrong
i think he knew about it i think he was happy with it because i mean as we've seen th one can build up a quite a convincing rationale for it
mm
erm if you if you if you take this view of excesses you're not unhappy for that to happen in order to move it forward as long as you maintain the control necessary to stop it when it's gone too far which is exactly what he does
i mean as soon as it's clear that the middle peasants are coming under pressure december nineteen forty seven he begins to issue statements we must protect the middle peasant and as said the nineteen thirty three class documents are UNK er which make it very clear that middle peasants must be protected
so do you think that erm when this law was erm pushed through in nineteen forty seven that er perhaps mao you know well i think there's been a bit of excess now i think we'll do some we just need we just need a bit of a rush now just to take us through a bit and then we'll stop it in a few months time
mm
mm right
it's either that deliberate or a sort of er one stage back where well if it leads to excesses it won't actually matter because we may it might be necessary and we can stop it anyway
mm
it's like
giving the appearance of the party following the peasants but in fact the party's got a good idea where they will probably go anyway
yeah
erm a very subtle very behind the scenes
but if you followed mao's speech it there shouldn't be much in the way of excess anyway
i it it's you've got these other statements now i think the they're the real problem those are the ones which really do lead to not just UNK but support and encourage the excesses which are the problem
cos i mean i mean i think that there is there are two things one is the excesses in terms of landlords being killed and the other is the UNK on middle peasants er they are different things
there's the t the violence of it and the excesses in terms of the effects on the middle peasant
we we'd better stop there
can we we'll pick this at this point
quickly that if what you're saying is true that how that erm they wanted to er that they didn't care that this could lead to excesses because they could control of the situation wasn't that a bit UNK because supposing they couldn't
yeah
well i wanted basically to determine UNK with the main ones
sorry
the main the two main ones there
yeah
different UNK presume yours are old and er
it seems to be er
what how bearing in mind we're after ten er ten horses and fifteen how many erm how many would you let us have
well the maximum
certainly
yeah
erm i mean horses probably have two horses
i think we're gonna
this is good news we can actually let you have all the cows
we've actually got quite a good er cow stock ourselves
are you sure he give fifty notes
yeah he did
yeah effectively
positive
look at this
within one or two
did he
depends who er need to discuss that
yeah i'll send him round nearer the time i think
well erm well obviously we've got some as you know we've got the timber all the material
yeah
we could certainly erm we could certainly address some of your needs in that respect but erm not all
erm so effectively it's a we'll be negotiating without a balancing of horses and on our part
mhm
erm timber and materials timber and materials on your part
and you don't want my cows
er we'll certainly be er after some of your cows yes
but er
we could throw in quite a lot of er extra manure
yeah i mean our UNK actually work better with horse manure erm then they do with er cow manure
the thing is we gotta got a slight problem in the transport
back isle of UNK a certain number of years
yeah it's the same with our blokes erm so i mean we're perfectly willing to help
yeah
if you would with us on the point of transport
yeah
that's not a problem
so rea UNK really erm bearing in mind we can't satisfy your need your full need for ten UNK and fifteen timbers
yeah
i mean what are we sort of what arrangement are we working within
well
fingers crossed
yeah what no tell us what's the maximum amount of timber you could theoretically give us on a good day
well on a good day erm we could give you ten
yeah
but that's it on a good day we could give you ten only and we couldn't give you any more
basically we've only got ten
right
and we can't give you any over five horses
are you sure
positive
so you're saying you've got five horses and ten
yeah
on account
and we can give you on account
which was
i'm buying
ah right
mm
presumably you can give us either fifteen or twenty
ten
yeah
we can certainly give you ten
he wants to make an offer on our UNK
maybe we shouldn't have had them and left our horses to five
yeah i mean we couldn't certainly couldn't give you any more than five
right
so basically we can give you ten for ten timber and
five UNK
and five UNK for five horses basically
much as that
what about er fruit and veg
five pounds
is there any chance of getting five veg and five fruit
mm
what was the maximum number of cows you could let us have
we could let you have five
five
isn't there a figure higher than that
what we could do
yeah
no
we could give you five
give you ten sheep
we could also give you some coal
yeah suppose to be reporting to industries in coal power station no
wool and UNK makes you
yes
eight comes to mind
no
eight horses maximum of ten horses maximum of five cows
ten horses
ten horses
sorry ten horses ten horses that you need
we can give you a maximum of five horses
five horses and five cows
how many cows of sheep
oh you said sheep
can't spare the sheep
we don't want sheep
i still think we're falling short of what we need
mm
erm you interested in our veg and fruit
yeah
erm if we were willing to throw that into the pot
mhm
erm would you UNK the offers you made on the horses in the offer
how much if we definitely decided
oh it's an attractive amount
we can
oh do you now
the sheep are very attractive
we can't we can't give you we can't give you more than five horses on i think i think UNK out of the bargain anyway because we're both sounds that we both got an over supply of the sheep
mm
i can't give you a pound
it's all i've got
oh
but we wouldn't agree that erm the lives the UNK is UNK now
negotiating UNK
UNK of five
the maximum we can lay is five yeah
and apparently UNK
so you want to in respect of us offering you sort of fruit and veg into the bargaining is er
make you change the horses
we can't change the horses
can't not that we won't
we can't do we can't
what do you only have five horses
well no right
but we need something to power of appeals
yeah but we don't need er
to society
would be UNK so to speak in sort of units of horses or electricity
okay if plough the fields if we were to supply you with erm fruit and veg erm obviously that would some of for you to plough the fields in which case you would have more to offer us
mm
i mean she coped nicely because providing we maintain a breeding stock of horses cows and sheep we can perhaps help you out a little bit more on that if you could erm help us some more on the timber
mm
because as well
okay if you're interested in it
so what how what could you increase the horse quantity to
i think probably be seven horses
would you reckon eight
i really anticipated breeding two horses to keep a breeding stock
to breed
i think we'd want you know for that we'd want to push the two you know your offer of ten erm
okay we wouldn't settle for seven horses then
for
we've
okay we'd be willing to up the be willing to up the ten to twelve
mm
i working on the training timber directly for horses and then talk about UNK
so
we'll exchange your seven horses for twelve of our timbers and we'll throw in a quantity of barrels i think
barrels
barrels
barrels
what empty barrels
in which to store your oil because of the heated
having transported
excellent idea
er forget out it
i mean i mean i'm in charge
to be honest empty barrels just take up space on the
mm
yeah
we could possibly could probably er we could say we could probably give you fifteen
all your own
mhm
if you forget the horses for a minute
mhm
we could give you fifteen if you want your timber to maximum
i think your priorities obviously well okay it's pulse
horses are my life and they're the two priorities
so we say we give you horses
mhm
could you give us say fifteen in timber and we both reduce the
we still need we still need some fruit and veg but er i don't see that being a problem you know
we'd strike a bargain at erm at twelve to timber and seventeen we're after
what about the er fruit and veg
erm
couple of units each of those
yeah we can throw in a couple of units each of those
so let's just summarise
so you'll give us twelve timber two materials two veg and two fruit
mhm
we will give you seven horses fifteen oil
five cans
five cans
well let's take it or leave it
any chance of you giving us another five units of something
and a jack pot
well i'm giving you a total of er twenty seven units
you're giving us a total of twenty three
and we're giving you boats to transport it
we'll be we'll be we'll be willing to give you
well you haven't said that yet have you
i think transport being the problem
you could say we should agree with our sums
that's fine
but erm we do seem to be coming out a little bit light
okay how many units we go after
well we've i would like we're basically giving you all your cow requirement and all your oil requirement
yeah
we're getting not all our timber requirement and not all our UNK requirement no
we're getting
so what if we can erm three more timber
we can't
i don't think we can erm talk about timber and UNK or be willing to up the
compensate with a little bit of extra veg and fruit
would you give us all our requirement for veg and fruit
what would you need
or would that be impossible
three of each
three
three of each
yeah
no another three of each
yeah
so you want five of each like
and then we'll give you and seven horses
it's not really interesting
okay
right
okay
so let's you're getting fifteen oil
yeah
seven horses five cows
mhm
we're getting five veg five fruit twelve timber and what's it seven
so you've got a surplus of we're giving units
yes
erm
manure if they're
manure
yeah
throw in a after a bucket load of manure
what's a bucket load
it's about as much as you can carry
erm
want some sheep they're not expensive
no we don't want sheep
don't want sheep do we
no
we'll have the manure
yeah
i don't want any sheep
up to their UNK
okay we'll take our own couple of units couple of units
couple of units
and we'll be alright
right er we need er we need thirteen units of pole UNK because we've only got UNK you've given us twenty nine units
we want sixteen units of pole UNK
right
so you either sell back to our sixteen units of UNK and let us stay the night or come back again tomorrow
oh
it's an UNK
oh right sorry right
we can help you shut yourself over if you don't want to
yeah that's basically
i believe two journeys so we've got to come to you vice versa so i think
well if you've got if you've got sixteen units of space if you come over with effectively sixteen units of your you know agree to supply us with
yeah
erm then you can take sixteen of our units in your boat and we'll take the surplus which is i imagine two of our boats erm if we come over with all three effectively which is twenty one if you can of ours
making us a space to come back again
yeah
mm
i UNK see why that's
yeah
which won't mean that sixteen units
so if we send two boats over
mm
we then asked them to already booked
so do you have all you want know
erm no but we're ready to settle on what we've got
same here
mm
where UNK are you short
well obviously we would have liked a erm a lot more oil we got the oil ain't we the horses
yeah the horses
but erm
so you got seven horses
mm
got enough to get us by
yeah we've got it all no problem
yeah
UNK pleasure doing business with you
the pleasure was ours entirely
i'm afraid the tide has now turned and er this negotiation will have to come to an end
there are some friends who are a get who get UNK whichever ones that travel so
thank you for your negotiation
in terms of sort of feedback with er in the er provisional way of
sort of
yeah
okay let's start with the objectives
what sort of things were you
hoping to get out of that negotiation
perhaps we'll start with and then we'll ask
what was some of the things you were after from that negotiation
we knew what our were something like what they're requirements were
okay
so you had UNK
yeah
for each item
mm
there and you want to ascertain their requirements
mhm
any other objectives
some negotiating with achieving some compromise at the end of the day
okay so to negotiate and achieve some sort of compromise what are your objectives
er what we didn't get a discussion what we decided was erm because it was in negotiation
right
so i would be best to lay down the law straight away what we needed and what we didn't need
right
erm we knew UNK we knew what we wanted what we got
right
we thought that's the only thing possible and flexible as possible
right
because at once that we intend to satisfy okay
so we could have sold like have the UNK and the timber
so that there was some key objectives within that some more important issues that concerned the others
okay
can i ask generally how did you feel at the end of that negotiations
did you both feel you got what you wanted got more than you wanted less than you wanted
we didn't get what we wanted obviously
right
got top line maybe
got more than the bottom line
yeah
yeah
so some satisfaction of the outcome
mhm
yeah
yeah
yeah
so you were somewhere between the top and the bottom line again on this
yeah
this negotiation
there's something there's something
sorry
perhaps we had or we had no idea what they had to offer
yeah
right okay
so you felt you were probably nearer the top line than the bottom line
perhaps not trying probably knew
because if you did there's no
top line
shot myself first
we did we did sort of with only the horses erm so we lost out that way
obviously they couldn't give us
i mean some of these who could be passed round to see to get the size but some of these in fact the grand total does not equal by the teams needs in courses that's why they are unsuccessful
in fact fifteen horses was it fifteen horses
er yeah
yeah
sacrifice the horses
sorry ten horses
ten horses available
fifteen needed
so some of those are items you can't satisfy what you need anyway so it's gonna obviously have to be somebody's got to go and satisfy some of those
but look at the negotiation you did what were you doing well what were some of the things that you needed most strength
we were gonna have if both sides knew that it was mutual benefit we would handle say furniture
right
what do you think to establish that
how do you establish that
erm
well the initial boundaries
yeah
you know the UNK
well i suggested to so
right
i think you're right we were saying a little bit earlier that
at the outset some things are bit like a first round of a UNK match
didn't come across like that i think
there may well be because of that
right
well let's have class three on the table and the on is erm
yes but we decided that we would ask them what they could offer us first or what they wanted that is
right
before we actually
put your cards on the table
for our part we wanted to know what they wanted first
so that was a deliberate strategy in fact they did it early anyway
yeah that's right
okay
so it was never been an honest sort of work relationship from the outset
so that's working well
what else
that's working well
okay i think you both recognise that we're gonna have to make but we realise it then in the case of horses there are only ten possible
yes
and fifteen were needed
right
so we would have to make UNK in some respects
right so you recognised early on that you would have to make a move for some of the UNK that you wanted
so there's er there's er an important movement actually
yes
any other things see you doing well
we actually saw alternatives to what we were after
we could sacrifice ought to get rid of some of the horses and the cows and we were quite willing to throw in the sheep because that would reduced only to UNK
right
in the hope of perhaps pushing up the timber and the fruit and veg
right
i mean there were certainly elements of UNK i think there's was at the beginning i heard about coal fire stations
that was me
yes
i mean there are plenty of options with this station including in fact you could actually float the timber across you don't actually carry it on the boat you tie it to the back and float it across
same with your barrels if you want to transport barrels
maybe get your horses to swim across
all those sort of things that are maybe options creative options the ways round it linking issues together
maybe you find a new any others
strengths
things that are working well
right the actually yeah
the UNK record within negotiations
can i just check out how do you think roles within the teams
we both erm needed a UNK
right
chief UNK here another chief UNK there
yes
any other roles you'd delegate
in fact that was only done as i walked through the door
there was something i saw and i don't know whether it was deliberate or not
erm but take this team there was somebody feeding information into the UNK person
mm
they were actually say no we can't do that or yes we can do that
erm that may or may not have been deliberate but it's very important particularly within a group erm of people in negotiation who were clear about roles and when i was out on the road i used to occasionally take the out and i'd go and see my UNK and erm i'd say oh we love to do fish and chip shops we love UNK fish and chip shops
and the sort of had a blue fit and sort of say no we don't and very quickly you've got to mixed message
if you're not clear about the roles and who gonna say what you can end up actually totally competing each other
anything else that we
erm no
so save a lot of things going to areas that you might do different then
limitations
areas
i don't know if it's a UNK but it's certainly a weakness that i didn't trust them that's what they were saying they surprised
so you actually found yourself not trusting what was going on
even now i don't know i don't you just said that there's stuff finance survive
it doesn't matter
no until you said that i still didn't trust them
poor tim
i'm sure you trust
i'll cover you
were you aware that you weren't trusted
yes
yes
in what way
a bit UNK with the horses you know are you sure you can't you know
yeah
it's this sort of thing i well i'm sure you said that
and get quite didn't you say eight horses or something fifteen
okay so you felt didn't trust them they were aware that you weren't trusting them
how do you think that helps under negotiation
can't do anything
right
what would you do differently in the future
try and get more trust in the outset
i bet you reach a certain stage where you realise i don't trust you which
i suppose we could have asked him UNK how many have they got and how many we need
yeah i mean it could have been done with real honesty but
mm
but then we still wouldn't have known
well that's right
the specific answer or not
but is it driving a business
they got what they wanted they got
decide that
i mean you could have asked the same about us on a lot of things
and it maybe about a relationship that will build up with these people over a period of time and i know it's expensive as negotiation
you think about salesmen who've got ongoing relationship with their client
it maybe faithful for a long time perhaps you build up that trust and it's only once you've got beyond that you can then begin to actually influence er negotiate with them
i think would have probably had more if we'd had more time and reversed all and been clearer on our roles
right
so that when they said are you sure you've only got x number of horses
we would have said well of course we have because of you know we would had reasons and facts
mm
perhaps to back that up
albeit lies but convincing
right
so you reckon if you had more time to think about an overall sort of UNK if you like of
UNK
UNK
well now you've put the words in my mouth convincing lies that is a UNK i mean nothing but the truth
i'm sure it matters
yeah i think you're right but i think you had certainly time there enabled those to be dealt with more effectively
any other areas didn't do so well
we really needed a bit more of an introduction
erm another day when you tried to set some and we were all dying and we kept carry on going but we could have said somebody would on to each other or whatever
mm
sort of priorities
this perhaps ties into to that one a bit as well
it's about the UNK it's about the introduction it's about how we actually settle the thing from the outset
yeah
anything else
a little bit more when somebody said to me
yes
you said welcome to wherever it was you know we thought you came to us
yes but that's deliberately set up that is
to get you to work at that
we see when we're introducing negotiation
if you're giving things away give things away of low value to you but of high value to them
were there any things that were given away that might be of high value to the opposition given away for less than nothing
fruit and veg
fruit and veg might be one example
there's another one as well and it was actually from this side given away but wasn't received by this side
barrels
yeah the barrels i mean of no value i think to a UNK
because
craftsmen are experts in making barrels from the wood of trees you have the use of barrels except for storing the oil you now have a large quantity of barrels available
i think we oil so we didn't want them
right
we're UNK
oh right
i think this group but we don't want to attack it
don't want them it actually UNK
mm
the value to this team
erm i can't remember what happened at the end if you were tempted to the barrel as well
no we didn't
in fact you probably needed some barrels and i'm sure or were given away
it's UNK it's thinking about you know barrels yeah well everyone is giving them away
perhaps your was thinking
see we'd given away all our oil so we didn't need any barrels and they were aware that the oil was a storage problem
yeah
but there wasn't normally storage problems normally had spare UNK out of the ground in so we'll be alright
okay
in terms of the sort of negotiation were there any stages when people were not telling you about
it got a bit confusing writing it all down
yeah
and trying to and see who was winning it and who was losing you know what the score was
right
three more units
you know we don't eat confuse would it
come on see what you a bit
i don't think
certainly confused about is how many horses
yes that was
our side
we started off ten UNK ten
right so i think on some occasions there was some confusion although towards the end it was certainly quite
yeah we do summarise where what the mistake was
yes
and see if there was any further room
certainly i think there were UNK in that note
yeah it was difficult for to be negotiating and to keep up with where we were
mm
right
yes
yeah
because it's going along so fast
yeah
yeah
i mean there were a couple of occasions when he got a cheap UNK other people joined in as well and then i don't know you got three or four different
all got views as well
i know it's something that's particularly welcome here but it's quite important to think about seeking positions rather than negotiation otherwise it's set up in here
this negotiation
space
it's very them and us
might be worth just thinking about that for me actually have a future negotiation
when i negotiate this person they always go and sit across the desk
maybe they don't like that
maybe that comes in with a hat that says authoritarian UNK type of interview
and if i did come and sit face to face across the desk it would have a discipline
i think if you were gonna s use any other situation to this with the quantity of information that you'd have to record as we're going through
mm
would have to be er probably a lot lower this would probably be a maximum because i felt i needed a bit of time to just sort of you know pass information
yeah
and obviously if you playing cards close to your chest you need something like this to sort of be able you know
yeah i mean that's going that it's actually quite powerful situations normally er you got roles worked out and exactly who's doing what
at times i just take a UNK actually stop and say yeah hang on a minute let's just walk through and work out what's going on
okay any other sort of areas you'd like to think about for the future
no
not somebody else
this morning
this morning
i think preparation is quite important
yeah
erm we tend to get it it's just an exercise but it proved a point that even in twenty minutes we were we'd only got through only got through to doing ideals
right
or fall back and realistic we didn't get any further than that
just making it up as we went along
you're right erm certainly an exercise twenty minutes is about time special timescale but again a bit more time might actually
yeah
well i was doing
yeah you gotta be the same
he used to spend hours
yeah you end up UNK in because you think oh i've got a timescale i've got to do something and actually UNK in
i think because maybe you haven't been flexible at the outset and all you've ended up doing is scoring points off each other
mm
for the first nineteen and a half minutes
quite like that
then again if you're i think the only thing on that i would say is that UNK in as a positive erm that your there are loads of possibilities about how you could actually try and create situations which would actually break down barrier one of the barriers you had was i'll give you one if you give me one
yeah
you've actually got into number counting
erm there are other aspects about that you could afford break that down i know there was sheep cows for instance
i know the outlook
well we thought that
er you know what could you do with it
erm maybe since the UNK are a problem on the island maybe you could get the horses over here to work part of the year and then foal er then you'll an agreement to have some of the UNK back
i don't know you know erm think about options think about
one of the problems is when they're starting to UNK with tunnel vision
take those
blue out there sideways
erm but still getting but we maybe getting a broader front on either focus too narrow a beam sometimes it's too difficult to get that narrow boat to be on exactly the right spot
so keep creative can work
yeah it's issues quite often as well
i remember when i was out on the road i had a particular connection with we had a motor bike policy and it was an appalling risk and it came up for renewal and er nobody had take it round the market and i mean that was an UNK threat because nobody in their right mind would want this particular motor and we said well not if they want to jack up the premium on it they wanted to jack it up by about thirty or forty per cent and the UNK was not very happy about this
but i said alright well we'll consider it so long as you let us quote for the rest of the business
erm and if we actually get the rest of the business we keep the motor pre premium down at ten per cent increase if we don't we're UNK it up by forty per cent
so in fact it's tying the two things together and getting both bits of business
the motor is completely rubbish won't be rubbish but the profit bit is actually quite good
so it's actually sometimes thinking about can i tie in something else to this which may bring the whole picture bring it all together but be creative
thinking things out
but perhaps one other thing i mean it's all useful
i don't know how many times i have to say that we've been there and we know all about this
but didn't work out
erm my story of this was i failed to recognise the role status
i at roles and at one stage i almost did
er the secretary gets out of her chair and she while i have a look and you can hear annual negotiation and er and the golden rule for negotiating was er looking at your list up there and he was a boss he was also working as a colleague he was even a friend
he of friends and i thought well when we're going into this you know he's obviously coming in as a colleague because actually he was a member of the same damn union
and it was a ridiculous situation so i went along and said er look jack er we're going to go into the annual UNK i mean you know very high inflation
i said you're gonna come in at two per cent and i'm gonna come in at twenty two and we both know that actually we're gonna up finish between eight and a half and nine don't we
which we did
i said so shall we actually save each other time and we'll both come in with reasonable till we open our pay you know erm stand points and he said yeah all right
so we went away putting our package together and we went in we sat in the either end of the table
he said you've got er your package for this year as requested
i said yes here it is
and he said good and here's ours and we passed them along the table and we wrote down two point six i said excuse me could i just have that back there's a slight typing error excuse me sorry twenty two per cent
and of course we settled at eight point six two or something ridiculous
i mean we were exactly where we said we were gonna be but suddenly i didn't realise that he was boss
he had to show other people that he had gone because that was what UNK did
mm
and he had to do that every year in order to satisfy his stance his hat that he was wearing that he was actually being the boss and knocking the workers down look i'm holding down what twenty two point on six er and he believed that my need was that i could go back to my manager and say look i got him up to two point one
erm we both had something to gain but equally we had something to lose and maybe that's the sort of things we think about to change the cost
the cost of doing that it was too high for him
UNK reputation so he couldn't do it he couldn't change so i've been there
it won't always work if you think you've
shall we begin to pass out the UNK
team
who are you are what's your name touch of the old garden touch of the old garden do you
good okay
in terms of sort of where we are in the course we spent yesterday having a look at and yes this morning having a look at planning for england
and we spent
having a look at some skills
in terms of listening terms
getting down to specific information and in terms of negotiation
the fun part of the course tomorrow morning it actually involves you in doing a role play with one of your colleagues
your colleague plays your person your trying to influence you obviously play yourself trying to influence them
now we're looking for tomorrow for about a twenty minute or so role play
and if you're still going after twenty minutes or so we'll stop you
which doesn't really matter because just we're just looking at a snap shot of
actually going on
so tonight you're actually to do a little bit of discussion and tonight tomorrow morning discussion with your colleague to brief them in terms of what they need to do to fulfil that role
how they actually need to play it
erm but we aren't going to the sort of end of degree that er i say this and then you sort of enter stage left and say this and i respond like this and then erm something else happens and then somebody comes UNK in through the door
it's er obviously you'll need to give them a briefing so they can play the character but to the end of degree 'cos you'll need to respond to things that they say as indeed you'll have to back in influencing situation back in your own department back in your own ground
so think about in terms of preparation for the influencing situation but what are some of the things you might want to do
not that i want you to agree with your colleague but check perhaps particularly for a bearing yourself
what are some of the things you want to think about for tomorrow
er exercise
structure
right
need to think about a structure
okay
what in particular on that
how you'll introduce certain people
right in terms of the of the dealing with the UNK
anything else
terms of the structure
whether you're gonna do all the talking or whether you're gonna write down ideas
right okay so whose ideas whose contribution
so we've got an introduction
anything else
terms of the structure
what you're negotiating points are all about the
see the UNK stance
position if you like
yeah
anything else
structure
about introductions
might need to think about what are some of the things that i would want to have as a conclusion
lead to that certainly
but whereabouts do you hope to be at the end of twenty minutes however long we've got
what other things might you want to be thinking about in terms of preparation for this one
erm outcomes
right yeah outcomes perhaps you're looking for
yeah
which is again related back to that
i mean a whole variety of other things from erm put ten extra staff to erm it could be that actually i just open the doors so that ne next time i could actually go back in
that's measurable
some are very clearly measurable but nevertheless measurable
any other things that might be in terms of preparation
anticipate what they might say
right there's a bit of about UNK
yeah
anything else
right
anybody else wanting to be talking last day of term it might be worthwhile now
don't you think
surely is
difference in roles
right
it's about roles
where am i coming from
what kind of role
and not only that but where are they coming from and how do i signal who i am
and indeed if i'm in a different role to what i am normally
how do i make that particularly clear
they always see me as the boss and i don't want to the boss
what are some of the ways that i can actually make that clear
anything else
perhaps just a couple of others you may want to think about things like questions
let's have a few questions up our UNK
maybe some avenues that we want to explore
you might want to think about things like that
what i also want to think about the model the positive outcomes remember that
if maybe i've got a negative outcome to the relationship to this one are there any things i
or positive
so maybe i'll start off maybe memories after you are only plans start off with some positive plans
and you'll start working round something there
so that you can think about er positive outlook is one of them
so perhaps a host of things to think about in terms of preparation maybe not all of those are gonna be suitable a relevant few preparation this evening but perhaps if focusing in at least some of those might help to give you the opportunity to persuade to influence your colleague
i think the only thing i'll say you know it's been a real odd situation really horse for your bit you reckon how well do i know this person
the bit on the video something to do with that bit where she says to him what did what are you going to say
and what's he going to say to that
and what are you going to there
if she suddenly erm you gonna have to sort of do this i think it's ridiculous but you know
you find a very small group and erm perhaps you can do this yourself
sounds ridiculous but you say oh erm you're not gonna like this and he's gonna say bloody right i don't like you
so that's not good news erm if i can show the way of UNK that problem how would you be interested and you say that UNK always been difficult for me you know what can i say then can't say you ready to train yourself to think you know physically you a little bit of actually putting yourself in their world
remember you've got to influence them in their world you can't just live in your own
you'll be very good if left carrying on in their own world for the rest of their time
just think about it i mean in a real life situation think about ought you think about imagine what how much do you know about do you need to use your network to find out what
i do that but curtain across the window in case you get what is it
so how do you get neighbours
as a senior employee there you sell tickets to them
okay so a whole of things to think about certainly for the role plays tomorrow but indeed for a situation back in the real world
okay well maybe we could have called it a day now
however what we're gonna do is usually at nine o'clock in the morning er ready to start UNK
i think has everybody got their pair who they're working with
the person you've been working with over the last couple of days
that's alright we can we can swap them round i think if we have them play first in one group and
i think we could work
we'll work something out about what what's gonna happen
work with your pair erm for now and overnight what we'd like you do is obviously decide for yourself your strategy but also if you can brief your other half as to how they need to play that role to get you the best opportunity of practising the skills
now i'm not looking to people to be totally bloody minded erm but i'm gonna for people to sort of totally UNK in erm with these newly acquired influencing skills because as we've said all along they will work on some occasions but they're not gonna work all the time
so you need to make your colleague work for what they get without being totally sort of bloody minded
but actually just UNK in
looking for about twenty minutes or so
erm to get some feedback at the end of those
okay
anything else now just before we all er disappear can i just quickly check what we want to do about the departure
i guess there's only six of us who probably finish about mid day tomorrow erm of which time there are various options
erm you can have a twelve o'clock bus if you wanted to sort of UNK your premises with a packed lunch or without a packed lunch if you er if you don't want to do that
if you want to have a lunch and then to just shoot off afterwards we would probably get you in the staff lunch i should think but i'll need to check that if not you'll have to wait till half past twelve to have a to have a lunch
or erm no that's it that's the various options
mm
i think i'm gonna have lunch at one so
right okay we'll put you down for twelve
what number are you dividing by if you
if i'm UNK by ten
the number
ah right
now that sign which we call in maths a divide sign or a share sign doesn't mean UNK it right it only means UNK if you are dividing by what number
no not quite
well if i if i have ten pounds for example and i want to UNK it what would the answer be
half of ten
mhm five what number what number have i divided by
ten
no not ten cos you see ten divided by ten would be one wouldn't it
so if i do this ten and i UNK it and i get five what number have i divided by
one
no ten divided by one i'll tell you is ten
because you are saying how many ones go into ten
let me write this down for you ten divide by one is ten because you are saying how many ones are in ten and the answer is ten okay
now when i said if you UNK ten pounds and you get five what number must go there
any ideas
five
then you'd are saying how many fives in ten the answer is two
we know the answer is five
ten divide by two equals five
good
two
that's right
yes
two in there okay
now that's called UNK by dividing by two that's UNK
but when you see that divide sign it's not always UNK is it
were you UNK here when we were dividing by what number
so that sign means divide by or a lot of school people talk about sharing by sharing by dividing by
right so over here then do you think that's your final answer
right okay
erm i wonder if you've remembered the short cut of this
has anyone ever told you about moving the decimal point
see we've done it all without decimal point on the calculator and we never done
right so we need to really think about all this from scratch don't you mm pity the others aren't here actually
erm right okay i'll tell you what copy down onto there
put can you put a heading along there decimals if we can get you understanding this you can help a few other people
erm
who are you UNK in as
my name
right
move down on to the second page then
oh it's s f o nine yes
so we select it now do page down danny
now it's going to the main menu
that'll be all right now
okay
right what we'll do is we'll get you thoroughly understanding this and you might be able to help the others
all right
you want to space this out so space it out
suppose we've got this decimal here now can you tell me what have we got two of what have we got two of
we've got things like tens millions UNK tenths tens what is it that we've got two of
sorry
forty nine
forty nine
why do you say forty nine
cos there's another one there
right we've got forty nine there haven't we but here there's a two okay
now what is it that we've got two of
well let me give you a clue
erm this here is forty that's four tens four tens are forty
they're tens four tens are forty
what is it that we've got nine of here
think what is it that we've got er nine of
nine
er well i think i'll have to show you
these are ones here you see that's saying we've got four tens forty and then we've got nine ones so that's how we get forty nine
now if we go to the right of the decimal point are these bigger things or smaller
they're smaller
they're smaller things good
now what is it that have got two of
tens ones smaller than ones
nought
not nought i can understand why you said nought
half
UNK they're fractions aren't they
they're fractions
danny it's just occurred to me because we're tape recording we'd better just stop print just at the moment we'll just leave that off line we can do it later
erm
halves
right now you're thinking it's fractions tiny smaller things
erm but we we've got to tens and tenths hundreds and UNK thousands and UNK so it's not halves but it's
quarters
no not quarters
fractions
it's a decimal system it's what we call a decimal system decimals
it's all UNK around tens and tenths hundreds and UNK right so what's the first fraction that you put here then
just use ones and zeros you can't use anything else
ones and zeros
ones and zeros
can't have a quarter cos there's a four there can't have a half cos there's a two there
one
one but we want a fraction one over what's the bottom number going to be
nought
not nought
ten
ten
these are tenths yes
tenths okay and then what are these
getting smaller but you can only use ones and UNK
nine
you can't have a nine only ones and UNK
erm
right you've never i don't think you been shown this have you really
thousand
right good only can have ones and UNK
now if we go on what would the next one be
how many zeros
erm
one two three
five
one two three why did you suddenly leap up to five
one two three four
four
yes that's right next one
right
how do we say these things
hundreds
UNK
UNK
yes
this is UNK yes
how do we say this one
ten UNK
well done
now can you just say it again
ten
ten UNK
yes you've got to put a th on the end
ten UNK
right
one ten UNK
and then this one
a hundred UNK
well done yes a hundred UNK
yes that's right
and then i haven't got space now but here you'd have a UNK six UNK that'd been a million
right now that's what a decimal is a decimal is that's what a decimal is and there are some people think we should write them like this or you couldn't you couldn't do this
it's nice just to see it once that er really that nine should be written smaller and then that two should be even smaller still and that three should almost be UNK because those things are smaller and smaller aren't they as you go along there these are getting UNK and UNK
right now
nice and quiet
yes erm
you don't have a lighter by any chance do you
i'm afraid i don't smoke
no
sorry
it's all right i just wanted to see whether this little boy is UNK or not
oh
he's had a terrific bang on the back of his head and
yes
i don't know that's the old time honoured way of doing it isn't it
oh right
oh
has an ambulance been called then
no he doesn't want to go home
is he feeling all right
yes but it hurts when he turns his head
he's got ever such you know a lump on the back of the head
i think he needs looking at
i've told him to go and sit quietly
right how's he up here then
why is he up here
well cos i'm florence UNK
UNK cos i bet yeah where is he
danny come here a minute love
he doesn't want to go home
yeah i did
right
thank you right now a really clever thing then that you should know about is if i want to times that number by ten right
everything in it will get ten times bigger won't it right and this is why the short cut works because a really clever way of UNK that by ten is to make that number come here that number come there this number come here right this number come here and this number come here
we move every number promote each number make it go higher right then we've multiplied that number by ten haven't you
yeah
yeah
now look what's happened to the point
goes after the nine there but it's now after the
two
two
so some people like to think that the point has moved one place to the right
what's really happened is that all the numbers have moved one place to the left
right but it's easier to see the point moving than the numbers really
so the quick way then of doing these decimals is just to move the move the point
yeah
now if you're doing a divide you want to UNK all the numbers don't you
you want to put them one down
yes
so if you're doing a divide you want instead of four tens you just want that to be four ones don't you
so if you're doing a divide the four will go there the nine will go there the two will go there the three will go there and the four will go there
so look what's happened to the point
it was after the nine but now it's after the four
four
so that divided forty nine point two three four by ten and it's as if i've moved the point one place back
you understand
have you met this before
not this way
no
it's interesting isn't it
cos you're year nine now and i would have thought somewhere along the line that you'd met this
right
well i'll tell you what then erm how about you UNK your own UNK on this
would you like to
it's all right
on the computer and then you can actually do this
all right okay
erm so do you want to log in perhaps over there log in over there erm and i'll show you what to do and then what the sheet you do you right we'll produce for other people couldn't we
right so rather than me just do some boring stuff there
all right
just okay right so if you log in now i think we will go into word right we'll do this in word all right word for windows so connect to network log in as you
oh before we go any further yes sorry no you're right UNK can you make sure that UNK on please that one
otherwise oh it's just the monitor that's off is it
it's just that otherwise when we choose the printer we erm can i just see your screen UNK
that's it press when it comes up connect to network press return we must get beyond connect to network
all right
now hold on we'll just choose the printer before we go any further can you just put the printer off line UNK
how do you do that
just press the top button right we'll select s f o nine select printer
right
mhm
page down
yeah takes you to the end of this menu and we can return to the main menu and er we won't er have to select printer again will we
that's what i did
sir
did you
that's why space
i've saved it on
you did
oh good
right word full stop word erm right press return a few times then choose UNK button and table insert table and now we're going to have a table whe where i thought we could have a number and it can either be times or divide by something and then the answer so we want how many columns
three
three so number of columns three and i'm not quite sure how many rows we want how many questions we get on a page but perhaps try for thirty something like that okay now table isn't showing go to view oh go to tables sorry table and you see grid lines is not UNK so click on grid lines and if the table doesn't show that's usually why
erm right word in there decimals in UNK decimal
UNK you spell decimal
d e c i m a l and then well you're still in that put your mouse on there
erm how strange oh i know what's happened you've still got the UNK going so it's UNK these
erm multiply or divide by multiply or divide by m u l t i p l y space or
or
yes do it small or do it small letters space then divide
mr there's a telephone call for you
do you know who it's from
yeah
okay
what you doing young man
oh right
what you doing danny
oh i see
is this on now
right
and what are you doing
how do you spell divide miss
divide
what's it start with
d
right
i
mm
i
d right now what d'you put on the end that makes an i sound i the magic
e
right
okay
divide that's right no
multiply or divide with an e on the end
what goes in the end column
what goes in the end column after you've got decimal multiply or divide
on here
have you done this one danny
what's that miss
what goes in this end column here
erm i think it's the equals i dunno but
have you done this one
don't think so
have you done this one david
erm
what about UNK over there
have you done this one
what goes in this end column here
decimal multiply divide
i dunno
might be answer miss
did mr tell you and you've forgotten
no
right well you'd better wait ah here he comes
mr 's on the UNK
mr oh lovely right that's UNK dad
right okay
i couldn't tell what to put in that end column
ah right okay
sir it is alright if i do that art quiz while i'm waiting to print off my work
yes okay
right erm multiply and divide by put the word by okay and then erm answer a n yes UNK a n s w e r good now we've printed this come out with grid lines we got to format it so what we do is
table select table yes select table select
tables er
undo table yes it's a very useful facility
if you make a mistake with word right then you can always undo it right if you ever make a mistake don't panic cos you can always undo it but you only get the one chance if you go on working then you can't undo it
so what we do is erm your cursor must be in the table somewhere so you then go up to table select table then you've got to format border and grid so we want the grid lines to show then in fact you can chose what we want for the outside border one of these right okay now what i want you to do is set the questions right
now what we'll do is this erm get into your table and put a decimal there now you can choose i don't mind what you have right so you're going to do some like that right
here you're going to tell people what to multiply and divide by
now don't make it too difficult the big problem with kids UNK setting sheets they that they make it far harder than the teacher ever would so do don't be over ambitious let's have a few easy ones to start with right
you leave that blank because that's where they are going to put the answer
right
can i put any number like four three point whatever
yeah you can choose any decimal it doesn't have to even start with numbers cos it could start with zero it doesn't have doesn't have it doesn't have to be bigger than one it can be smaller than one
okay
now just so that they see whether to times or divide we've got to tell them it's no good just putting a ten there is it i've got to say it's a times or divide okay
so what i would suggest is erm times is easy because you can just use an x for times small x i think
leave some space there i think you need to make a space that looks good
the silly thing is there is no divide on here and the only thing i can suggest really there is a divide symbol in the computer that we can drag out but to drag it out every time it's too boring really so i'll think we use this i don't like using this but you see this symbol here that's what they really use for divide so if you do that and a couple spaces people will learn that means divide it's all we can do really
or we could if we could be bothered we could write the word divide
in this box here
all right
sir could i a million
yes you can have millions if you want it
yes
erm this first two we'd tell people the answers to so what answer would this one be that times by ten and all that happens
all that happens when we times by ten is that the point moves one place to the right so what will be the answer can you tell me the answer to that one
will it be twenty three nine point eight seven
how do you say that number
twenty erm two hundred and UNK nine point eight seven
good well done
this one is a bit tricky for a second question i think i might revise this actually
erm made this a bit too hard to start with
one like that you see we'd have to move the point two places to the left so we'll have to introduce another zero
yeah i i've done that
you've done that
now let's get sheet
right now what erm what would the answer be here
that would be thirty four er point seven one eight
right now you've only moved the point once
oh
so what will the answer be
it'll be three point
good
well done
this is simple
sir i can't get into windows
right i'll come and help you
erm would you like to carry on with that
put all the answers in
no we'll leave those for the people to put in
you just set the questions
right david what's the problem
it won't go into windows
erm
what's that a gun
no
hugh
that's a rocket calling out to the crew of the lifeboat but it's a lovely day
there's no wind and a boat can not be in danger
i know but that they are
there are
there are ships
sharp
sharp rocks just under the water and a
s
sailing boat might have been cor
car
carried on by the UNK
ti
tide
that's it
my dad my dad's on the lifeboat
let's go down and watch it go out
well done
the two boys UNK down the harbour when
where
where the crew were
gathering
gathering
there's my dad
hello boys a fishing boat has br
broken
broken down and we're going out to tow
well done
them in
when
wan
want to come for the run
there
there's
there's room and it won't be dangerous
well done
are you with me
yes please
come on
su
super
super
once they were cl
sorry
clear
clear of the harbour UNK took them to see the
UNK
engines
well done
twin
yes
dis
UNK twin UNK
UNK
they are
sealed
sealed so that they can work even if UNK
UNK
flooded
if flooded that's it
with water
there even
there there's enough
enough power to keep the boat going as UNK
at
as full
at
at full speed even in the s
UNK
strongest gale
well done
they
the
then they say saw the
search
search lights
search lights
at the loud
loud
loud UNK
UNK
UNK and the v h f radio with which the crew can keep in touch with UNK
aircraft
aircraft and helicopter
well done
half an hour later ron pop
po point
pointed to a boat dead a
that's it dead ahead
dead ahead
it was the o
oak leaf
oak leaf it was the oak leaf
a UNK
local
local fishing boat which the lifeboat had came out to helped him
don't forget the full stop
ten minutes later there were close even
enough
enough to use the rocket pi
pi UNK
UNK
that's it
it's that
threw
threw a line across to see the fishing
across to the fishing
fishing boat and the UNK was there
were then
were then at
able
able to put a
pull
a UNK
heavy
heavy turn
tow
tow rope on boat
board
board
they were able to pull a heavy tow rope on board
only it
once
once it had been UNK
tied
tied strong
well it could be but it's UNK
UNK
once it had been tied UNK
the captain of the fishing boat UNK his hand and the
powerful
powerful engine of the lifeboat
r UNK
UNK into life
it was just in time too as both boats were drifting slowly to
towards
towards some sharp rocks
funny how you go through a line like that beautifully isn't it
you know really well
wish
while
while this was going on ron and her
hugh
hugh were call
care UNK
careful to stay out of the way
on the run back to the harbour UNK dad asked did you enjoy that boys
well read
yes can we join the crew of the lifeboat when we grow up
well done so you haven't done that card before
no
i drew up the list you've got it written in there
so we'll do the questions now
go through them
question one
question one
the noise hugh heard was a
rocket gun UNK rocket
so the answer to a is one a
rocket
rocket
you keep that writing up like you done that it'll look lovely on that page
r o c k e t
k e t right that's good
to get to the harbour the boys a
UNK sa
sailed
a they UNK
yes they UNK because you can remember that from what it says here
good
number 3
the UNK engines are sealed
to get more power
to give more power
so they work if flooded
so they used less fu
fuel
fuel
i UNK it's so they worked if flooded
you're dead right
b it's good you see that you're remembering what you've read
it's all very well to read through something but the main part about it is to remember what you've read
if flooded f l o d e d
flooded that's right
question four
four
in bad weather the lifeboat
has to stop can only go slowly can go as
at
at full speed
i think it's c
you're dead right
can go at full speed
s p e d
that's right
number five
a line was thrown by
a UNK a UNK a rocket per
pi
UNK
i UNK it's c rocket UNK
so do i
i don't think they had a UNK out there
a rocket
UNK
that's right now you've only got one
let's see if you can get the hundred per cent
at the end of the trip the boys
wanted to go home felt sick wanted to join the crew c wanted to join the crew
that's it
hundred per cent
wanted
to
to join the crew
and that is very neatly done
now we'll see if we can find out these words and then we'll write them in write the answers in
so it'll start off with one but you remember we do it across the page
that's it
so you just start off with number one
and we are trying to find a word which means men we're finding the word in the story which means men who sail in boats
it's number three
yes
thank you
men who sail in boats in number three
no UNK
hugh
hugh
that's a rocket calling out the crew
that's the word
crew
c r e w that's one now number two is another word for pushed
pushed in number five in chapter and that's in paragraph five
i know but there are sharp rocks just under the water and a sa
sailing
sailing boat
might
might have been
carried
carried is that it
it is
you're right it's another word for pushed you see in this story
it could because you could put and a sailing boat might have been pushed on by the tide
but it was it's more correct to say carried on but that's another meaning okay
number three ran quickly
well we know what that is
don't we
because i think we've already said we've already put it in two a
UNK
yes they UNK
two boys UNK
so you got the same answer for two questions
four
coming together
they're coming together
that's also in six oh well then so the two boys UNK down the harbour
with the
where the
where the crew were UNK
gathering
gathering
that's it
so they're coming together
the word is gathering
can you get it in there
g
g a t h e r i n g
yep
just
that's it
gathering
that's good
filled with water another word to cover the words filled with water
and you've got to come down to eleven for that
only
we'll read it from here
they are certain
sealed
sealed so that they can work even if flooded
well done
as soon as you get to the word you know it
f l o d e d
and you know how to spell it
cos it's there
oh that's all right
doesn't matter doesn't matter
six very powerful UNK okay if you'd been in the war you know what the answer to that was
very powerful UNK in eleven
erm start there
they then
then
they saw the sec
what's that
oh UNK
search
search lights
that's a very powerful UNK isn't it
s
that's a long word c h l i g h t s that's it well done
erm that's powerful UNK seven showed with a finger
i think i know what that is and that's in twelve
showed with a finger erm showed with a finger oh UNK oh yes look it's in the first line
half an hour later ron UNK
UNK
pointed
with a finger
pointed
p o i n t e d pointed
number eight tightly
another word for tightly and that's also in twelve
erm i think you can start reading here
writing erm
once
once it had been tied
that's fine we'll do we'll do paul listen don't be UNK
we'll do the functions of building afterwards okay
at the moment we're doing what buildings are made of
right
stone brick mud what else could they use
i've got a classic one why did london burn down in UNK because all the houses were made of
look you're
no i'm not i'm helping you understand
i'm on about
listen to me
you can't talk about present day right
i'm not on about that i'm not on about that
until you understand
i'm not on about houses i'm on about main buildings like st paul's UNK all that
yeah but the old churches were made of wood and stone it's important to think about that
oh yeah
you know what i mean
yeah
a lot of the buildings in london are hundreds and hundreds of years old
yeah
we'll do types of in a minute so wood mud brick stone anything else marble erm wood mud brick stone
copper
no they didn't build metal houses did they
yeah but that's roofs that's not a structure is it
i know structures will you write bridges too
bridges
iron bridges i reckon that's a good start
okay now this is materials modern materials okay right tell me some of the things they make buildings out of now really big
glass
yeah good one paul glass what else what else they make them out of
metal
metals
erm reinforced concrete big one for the sixties
reinforced concrete
what about UNK what are they made of
UNK
UNK
board
erm what else did they make them out metals glass reinforced concrete
i mean like office blocks like that over there all that crap
they still use brick don't they
yeah they still use bricks
cos that whole building is like looks like metal and er glass though doesn't it
yeah
i think glass metal reinforced concrete UNK glass brick are about it can't think what else they make a building out of these days
so we've done our materials let's do our what sort of buildings did they make
what were the buildings
what are we talking about
we are talking about houses
buildings
okay we're talking about institutions and what comes under institutions
UNK
institutions schools anything paid for by the government buildings like you said like town halls libraries theatres
yeah
what is a really important part of london architecture
what is there on every corner
no building on every corner which you can go in and have a jar
public houses
pubs are a really important
i did a seminar on pub architecture
excellent do you know what my research was
no
i had to go to lots of pubs
oh great
pubs really good one for london
erm what else
schools government buildings libraries theatres pubs houses what else did they build
oh i know churches what else
what other old important buildings can you think of in london
i can think of a really good one UNK
mm
monarchy buildings
what about so yeah royal buildings or UNK
UNK what's another big palace one of the oldest buildings in london just off tower bridge it's called the
tower of london
that's right the tower of london is a palace the king used to live there
UNK
what else
right let's do some modern buildings
what do they build these days
let's put uses and give me some different ones
when they build these days they build one really obvious one which UNK is
office
office block
they build office blocks
what else do they build paul prisons
i've thought of a really good one factories
those old weird factories with metal windows and not much light
UNK for storing grain on the river UNK
what are UNK these days turned into
UNK
luxury flats
so that's a good one
put UNK here
put UNK and put erm what was the other one i said
factories
and then you can put over here office blocks flats they didn't have flats pre sixties not till thought of it
that's really important write down
what
this guy this guy right this french guy okay in the twenties and the thirties yeah okay this guy and he invented the idea okay
of towers
he invented the idea of UNK living like flats okay and everyone was supposed to be the same
it was like communism everyone was supposed to be the same everyone would have the same house with the same shed everyone would have the same stuff in their house all their doors would be colour co UNK and that's what flats were the original idea of flats were like co UNK living okay
this is great this is tremendous
but it doesn't work like that does it cos what happens in flats
people change all their things
exactly people stick on big oak doors don't they
people cook fish
people cook fish and UNK each other because they live too
close and it is unnatural for people to live too close
ah ha but in the old days they used to have
UNK
in the old days they used to have little houses close together called begins with t
UNK
UNK
UNK
which are like your back to back
my grandmother right had a back to back no listen this is funny she lived in a UNK in er which isn't there UNK actually just up by the river up by the angel and there was nine people living there in two rooms and they had a UNK and the UNK so they did have
my UNK used to live in UNK charles UNK house
did he
yeah not there UNK
he had fourteen his grandmother there was seventeen of them
my god well i've got to at like quarter to
right we've got half an hour so right what else do they build which they never used to build
we build office blocks we build flats we build
they re thingy re UNK
they UNK
UNK
that's good refurbishment UNK good lad UNK
of old
yes this is a very key point
okay so they base we're talking about style now
oh yeah wait a minute let's put this
well put these ideas over
let's do this
i'll remember that idea for you
office blocks flats they UNK places what else do they do what do we build
what's this school is it new
they build colleges and universities educational buildings and many more
what do we have that we didn't used to have
supermarkets no
yes no that's important
supermarkets like shopping UNK
oh yeah
UNK what are they called
shopping centres
shopping centres we're doing it together that's good
office blocks shopping centres universities new flats UNK flats office blocks office blocks they don't really build churches much UNK cos they don't need them erm what else do they build
UNK for the young
yeah UNK as opposed to hotels
oh yeah
hotels
youth UNK
you see the thing is paul what you i could help you do is there are several modern buildings round here which we could investigate
there is the youth UNK and i know who built that cos he's a friend of mine
oh so he just like built did he
no built that and i know the guy so i could get to the plans
they were but it's the recession and no one's building at the moment
erm right what you were talking about just leave that
we've got a basis for our knowledge haven't we
we realize that right now how is style okay what a building looks like related to
they're based on UNK aren't they
how is style related to use cos the thing is it is really UNK i think to say modern UNK crap
i should go to the design museum
ancient UNK beautiful you should
design museum doesn't have a lot on architecture though
so style what you were talking about when they base ideas just concentrate on what you are doing cos you're doing some good work you know when they base ideas on the past that is looking back yeah like see this word UNK going back right
so retrospective when you are a UNK what are you doing
looking
right so UNK is looking UNK is back so retrospective so there's some styles some modern art is retrospective
okay it looks back
that's one new word for you
think of a piece of modern architecture that i think personally is all retrospective i think everything built on the achievement of the past yeah i don't know what is the actual question
what is the actual question she gave you
it ain't a question it's my own study
your own study and how are making this media studies how is architecture media studies
argument
it's just UNK to be an argument but this will lead to up like an argument of like them kind of buildings are not like buildings like tradition to keep with the tradition
so you wanna look at prince UNK book don't you
prince UNK book you wanna think about this guy le UNK
i'll have to go to the library for that
think about this guy i might have stuff on him about flats and what they are for
what are they for
erm shh hang on
think about this idea this word building okay
cos you've got a building and then you've got the idea of building on past knowledge and experience
there's a good there's good language games you can play with that because modern architecture builds in a way on the architecture of the past cos that UNK is actually what's on top of it
a UNK
and when were the UNK built
i dunno last week weren't it
in egypt do you see what i mean so that you can have and put that down as an example so you can have
you've got a UNK on top of UNK so that is classical reference
yeah i know i know what you mean
so if you can think about it like UNK but we gonna have to work out an argument
what we wanna do is think of some buildings and describe them to ourselves and then work out what style cos the thing is since the UNK styles like we want like a progression of styles till the UNK and see what's changed and what's stayed
last lesson
oh
where what have you got last lesson
technology
tomorrow
what have you got tomorrow
what have you got first lesson
mrs miss english what about next lesson second lesson
yeah it's all don't worry about it
no what have you got
no but what have you got
nothing important
no but i just want you to tell me
science
with whom
i don't know
when are you supposed to come up here again
tuesday next
only once a week
do you want me to sort out some stuff
er
i mean material that we can use
right this guy's really important and that'll be helpful prince charles book
right we wanna think about style how it's changed since the sixties
when you think of sixties architecture what do you think of
ugly blocks of concrete
ugly blocks of concrete okay
e g okay and whenever you describe this style you wanna think about right take ugly blocks of concrete okay ugly blocks of concrete right what is it and why do you think it looks like that
and what's it made of
right so what is it it's flat
old fashioned it's not modern
ah but it is in your context you defined modern
so why it's quick to build space saving what else is it what is concrete that marble isn't
attractive
no concrete what is concrete
oh it's erm stone
i mean erm money
in comparison how much does a block of concrete cost to a block of marble
buy much concrete to a block of marble
exactly so what is it paul it is
cost
cost
cost UNK
economically
economical
so UNK i'm looking for a really simple word
it's ch
cost consuming
cost effective economical cheap do it the simple way so it's cheap and we've got what it's made of concrete
so it's cheap space saving
quick
quick
and that's it basically so you've explained why ugly blocks of flats in the sixties and you even know cos why post war UNK of london
so the important thing about this is that you cannot you cannot just say modern equals bad and UNK is good because you must in order to argue paul examine the
situation
yes situation or more complicated word for situation the
modern arch context
you must examine the context because the situation relies on the
this is more art it's like art
no you must
they like they treat it as like pieces of art
but you ca but people do
the thing is the trouble with that is when you try and understand or argue about something like that you can't treat it as a work of art cos it isn't it's a UNK building
i'll have to change i'll have to change my thingy
you've got to think about why is it there what is it made of
what does it look like can you explain where does it come in history and post war pre war think about the context it's really vital
does this help you in some way
yeah of course it does
right what about if we
wrote this instead of i don't think you work well from diagrams they keep confusing
write it in a list
things what i have to set out and like er put bits in
only do a yeah only do one little bit at a time
you put big heading paul what did we do first what did we talk about first
how weird
what did we talk about first paul
listen what did we talk about first
erm
what was the first thing we did
what was the first thing we did
we wrote traditional and then we wrote modern and then what did we do what did we decide for those two categories
i can't remember serious
what did we decide we gave them a what was the important thing we gave them a
erm
was the important thing we them a
erm i don't know
look if i write that does that help
oh yeah
so we gave them a
when why what situation
so what did we do first
the
the time line
the time we're looking at so we decided traditional was from civilization to world war two and we decided that world war two to ninety four was modern okay
now you can define modern in lots of ways but that will do for our purpose
right then we decided that we look at materials and what
so under the heading of what first thing we looked at was materials
okay now i want you to make a list there for traditional of all the materials we put around there so make that list there okay and make it easier to look at
make a list of these words that are around materials
right oh then i do
and then you can do uses or types of building and you can make a list of all those things as well so types
in your old college
now concentrate what
fire i saw loads of people running down
where
when
the other day
you're losing your concentration it's very interesting but materials list there types of building list there and i'm going to the loo and i'll come back
is that why you work so quick
no cos it's quick if i have to keep your attention
no you're doing that first you're doing it now do that and go and see her afterwards
see what they do is they start you off and then they give you now what action do get from these words
look at the words they're actually putting in passion loving UNK you see what i mean
why should they put in those sub headings you what's the point of putting passion what's the point of your sub heading loving and UNK
it is really isn't it
to grab your attention to keep your interest you've got another
and you gonna keep on reading
so what you need to do is rather than have a big block of writing okay which is going to look not really in the format of this kind of newspaper is it what you tend to get in the tabloids is loads of these little ones
see
having said that of course quite a lot of the stories in the tabloids are actually quite small
what you need to think about and you're gonna keep your UNK interest engaged keep on want to keep reading your pictures are gonna do that to a certain extent but that's what your sub headings goes over so think about pick out read through your main story pick out your main ideas and see if you can slot in one of those UNK words that's passion that's UNK people's emotions
the new college which cost eighteen million to build was destroyed there was a death toll what about a final death toll was it's a bit more than there was a it's a bit boring see what i'm saying
yeah
final you've gotta be a bit more dramatic you've gotta think of the words that are dramatic words final death toll UNK to twenty dead forty three injured
UNK at bacon's
i'm still trying to get the headline
you gotta you gotta try and think what your headline will be
right
no ideas not yet
not yet
well keep working on that what about erm the length of this piece
i'm looking for on a three aren't i
tends to be a little bit on the first page then it goes onto pages like two three all different pages with small sections
yeah
yeah right will go from that to that
so all that writing is actually surrounding your picture isn't it you've come up with your UNK picture and then you UNK your UNK picture with your writing i was saying to him with these little sub headings like trapped right cost holiday okay which actually keep your reader UNK and make them want to read on
so again you've got to come up with your main heading what kinds of words do you think you've got to have in your main heading
basic words to do with the subject
yeah more than that what have they got to be these words they gotta be words which really what which really make you feel what
as thought you want to hear them
and
appeal to a
we're dealing with a horrendous fire here we gotta have shocking don't you think some quite shocking words some quite UNK words if you want to grab people's attention
yeah
so think about that what the tabloids do okay think about your sub headings and think about your main headings
yeah
okay and the vocabulary you're gonna use but to start off with terrified that's really good
right sam what are you up to is that not yours
alright you not got far on this
no
shall we go onto kelly let's see what's she's been up to
is there two there show us the other one
i don't know it's the same one
what's the one at the back
it's the just these other okay
that's good don't you think i'm impressed
i am impressed i am impressed
right kelly tell me what you've been up to
that's just they're the people i'm going to interview okay then you've got example yesterday at approximately nine twenty bacon's technical college at went up in a UNK of smoke taking one life which is believed to be that of the UNK who was having a last minute check before leaving the building in the evening
it was thought the cause of the fire was a student leaving a UNK on at the end of day
it is while the UNK was in the science and UNK wing he turned on the light which caused the college to UNK
mr the UNK leaves behind a wife and three children two of which were twins blah
bacon's college which cost around a quarter around eighteen million to build has now been open has only been open since september UNK and they're just more details which i've gotta add while i'm writing it that's just the beginning write on the front page
i don't know my feeling my UNK feeling is that's not UNK enough you know it's not erm UNK enough it's not it doesn't grab me enough to be a front page of a tabloid
i mean i haven't seen there what you've got what do you see as your main heading
that's not gonna be the heading right
you're not gonna use UNK at bacon's you haven't actually thought of the words
it's really important i think that you turn that into something more UNK and shocking
at the moment i mean that is quite a boring sort of report
it's more of a story than a
it is it's more of a little story and it's not a front page UNK which i think is what we said we'd set out to write a front page UNK okay so i think you've got to think about the kind of words you use
now what kind of words do you think should go on a front page if you're dealing
i dunno but the sentences have gotta be shorter
yes you're right they have
it's gotta be er more like more UNK more to grab ya ain't it really
and what's gonna grab you
i dunno yet
think about it
how are you gonna grab me what kind of words are you gonna use to grab me
er
bodies victims flames what do those words do to me as i'm reading
