di we in UNK there
a final question do think society could do without drugs
do you think do you think we could ever do without drugs
button one for yes and button two for no
and i think you're probably quite right you eighty three
seventeen people have said yes we could do where are you UNK
what are all the asthma UNK and arthritis UNK and various people going to do
yes
i don't think we could be completely drug free i mean obviously medical conditions dictate that you have to take UNK
mm
but when it comes to taking other drugs for a UNK yes you could do without them and one of the ways you can do that is by taking time out for yourself whether you're a single parent or if you're a you know if you're a family the important thing is finding time for yourself and not for your family or your dependants
i think that deserves a whole programme
how do women find time for themselves
we'll talk about it another day
thank you all very much indeed
thank you for watching
see you next time
goodbye
is this on yet
yeah
oh
okay well good morning
erm i have a er an important administrative message which came from the biology department office before we begin
erm concerns the following
david and james would you erm please report to the head of department's office straight away following this lecture
okay well erm i hope that you'll remember from last week er what we er our discussion centred around the general way in which carriers and channels worked
and i'd like to extend that discussion this week concerning channels to look at the biological properties of channels that is viewing th their activities in a UNK in a physiological role
and what i hope that i can do before the end of the lecture is convince you that channels pay play an important role not just in conventional UNK such as nerve and muscle but also in a wide variety of cells and UNK
for those of you who erm get a little er UNK at the at UNK concepts let me just erm begin the lecture by erm reminding you that when we talk about the current through a channel all we're talking about is a UNK
that is we can express the UNK simply by dividing by the UNK constant
that's all the current is and the reason that we talk in terms of currents is because those are the because the major methods that are used to analyze channel activity are UNK ones
but in principle there's no reason why we cannot discuss the UNK through a channel that is its activity in terms of UNK per second
and we saw that in the calculation that i gave you at the end of last week's lecture
so let me begin this discussion then of channels by er pointing out the methods that have been used for studying channels and for some of you who've done the er UNK course this will er be revision but nevertheless it will be pertinent to today's discussion
okay so let's look at the methods for studying channels
until around nineteen eighty the methods generally involved UNK of cells with glass micro UNK
so er a micro UNK was er UNK and then put inside a cell and connected up with an UNK
and then the measurement of currents electrical currents flowing across the membrane could be analyzed using voltage clamp techniques
this is known for reasons that i'll point out in a second as a UNK technique and the currents were usually identified through replacement of ions UNK and of course this can generally be done only in the external medium because you don't have control over the internal medium
secondly by the response of the UNK potential of th of the current to a change in ion concentration
the UNK potential of that current should shift as the ion concentration shifts if the current is carrying is being carried by tha by that ion
so that simply that statement simply comes from the UNK equation
and in conjunction with that generally it's conventional to er s UNK apply UNK to block the currents not being studied
that is if you know one particular current is UNK by a particular toxin for example and you're not interested in that current then you block it
okay what are the disadvantages of this technique
well first of all as i've just mentioned you can't control the internal medium unless you're dealing with er some very special er large types of cells and therefore you can't address all the interesting questions which er concern UNK regulation of channel currents
secondly it's obviously impossible to look at UNK channels using this technique
you're you you're restricted to looking at UNK membrane channels and their properties
and thirdly if you find that a current for a particular ion is UNK it's becomes difficult to describe what's happening at the level of transport at the level of channel activity
and let me show you what i mean by that
if we're measuring the m membrane current which here i've called a UNK current because we're integrating over a whole area of membrane this with respect with any given channel will UNK can be expressed in terms of the number of channels which are present the probability that each one of those channels is open the open state probability and in terms of the unitary current of each channel that is the single channel current
thanks
okay so this UNK current can be expressed in terms of the simply in terms of these three parameters which relate to the single channel properties
it therefore becomes UNK that if we see an UNK of the UNK current that we are able to express that UNK in terms of a change in one or the other of those so called UNK parameters
and it therefore becomes important to study the properties of single channels
and UNK in other words measure the currents through and study their open state UNK
there are two important UNK techniques which enable such studies to be undertaken
and the first one i referred to UNK er last week and it's known as patch clamp which most of you have come across before
and let me just remind you of the principles of this technique
the idea here is that you take a rather UNK er fire polished glass UNK and press it against a membrane
these black UNK are supposed to be UNK and i've tried to er illustrate the orientation of the protein by showing these er these supposedly er UNK er UNK on the outside of the cell
the UNK constituents of the protein
okay so th here's the UNK pressed against a cell a high resistance seal is formed UNK very UNK between the membrane and the glass UNK and you can then if you're lucky if you've got a s a single channel molecule under that er bit of UNK record the currents flowing through that single protein molecule
the technique is very versatile because you can er then er go further and if you pull the UNK away from the from the cell you can if y again if you're lucky be left with the membrane the patch of membrane firmly sealed to the glass UNK and you can now record in so called inside out mode in which the a er physiological inside of the membrane is exposed to the bathing medium the in which the UNK is UNK
alternatively you can record in so called wholesale mode that is by either UNK away this patch of membrane or by applying a whole er a large voltage pulse which essentially UNK it so it burns it away and you then gain electrical access to the interior of the cell
and having done that you can then pull the UNK away as shown here and you're left with a UNK of membrane in which you're now recording in the so called outside out mode which is the exact UNK of the inside out mode
okay
so this then all o a th these techniques when applied erm er as an UNK then all allow you to look at the single channel currents the currents flowing through any given channel and as well as the effects of external and internal regulators
however of course it's not readily applicable to most UNK because most UNK are er not large enough most UNK are lo not large enough to UNK the application of this UNK
now in fact before patch clamp came along in a in around nineteen eighty there were there was another technique which was available for looking at single channel currents
it wasn't er very widely used but it nevertheless er had some important applications and this UNK this technique is known as the UNK technique
and the idea of this technique is you take er a erm a chamber which is split into two UNK by a UNK shown here you fill the two UNK with an UNK solution okay and you can then paint across a small hole in this UNK a solution of UNK in a UNK for example UNK and when these UNK are painted across the er UNK the er the small hole in the UNK the UNK here i've UNK it UNK around er the edges of the hole and leaves you with a what turns out to be a simple UNK a UNK
so the membrane UNK down the UNK rounds the around the outside and er you're left with a pure UNK of UNK
you can then take UNK which you would have prepared erm UNK either through first UNK your protein or more UNK a er a s a partially UNK membrane fraction and fuse those with the artificial UNK
and UNK will fuse under the influence of an UNK gradient
so you apply an UNK you in introduce the UNK into one chamber apply an UNK gradient and those UNK then fuse with the artificial UNK and again if you're lucky you see a single channel erm appear in the UNK and you can then stop the UNK process to stop more er channels appearing
okay
and once you've got er the channel in there you can then record its activity simply by putting micro UNK into these two er UNK a and b here
so then this technique enables you to look at single channel currents and UNK if you've got a partially er UNK preparation of UNK it enable to look at channels in UNK too
however a disadvantage of this technique in comparison with patch clamp is that you can't always guarantee the orientation of your channels so that if you see some kind of UNK characteristic in the UNK er you have no way a prior of knowing whether that UNK er characteristic is associated with an UNK or an UNK from the UNK
so that's a partial er disadvantage that you can't establish the orientation
but it nevertheless enables you to look at er potentially at single channel currents from UNK
okay so having established then that you can look at the er you can look at single channel currents let's look at what those erm er currents can tell us
erm on the overhead before last i gave you a little equation which demonstrated the importance of measuring single channel currents and it ga and it had implicit in it an open state probability which reflects UNK
so let's just look at UNK for a second
and you'll remember that the definition of UNK is simply that channels switch between open and closed states they gate open or closed
okay
what the results from these single channel techniques demonstrate that is the patch clamp or the UNK techniques what these results demonstrate is that the factors UNK channel currents invariably act at the level of UNK
that is either voltage or UNK in the cases respectively of voltage activated channels or UNK activated channels both of those factors will act at the level of UNK
in other words they increase the open state probability they don't increase the number of channels or very rarely do they increase the number of channels or the unitary current through each channel once it is open
they don't increase the single channel current once it's open
and just to remind you the open the open state probability can be defined as the time that the channel spends in its in the open state divided by the total time of the recording
so for example here's a case of a calcium activated potassium channel from a UNK muscle cell
and it's a patch clamp recording which has been done in an inside out patch that is with the physiological inside of the membrane facing the bathing medium so we have experimental control over what the er physiological inside of the membrane is seeing here
and here is a recording then of the channel activity in the presence of ten to the minus eight UNK calcium that is ten UNK calcium
and you'll see er for this er little section of recording the channel opens very UNK in fact it only opens once to a level of three UNK
when the calcium is raised to five times ten to the minus seven UNK fifty UNK then what we see here sorry five hundred UNK
what we see here then is that the channel is UNK to open its open state probability increases but once it is open the level the current level which it passes the amount of the number ions flowing through per unit time is not significantly different from that er case in which the calcium was lower
so that demonstrates that's an example then demonstrating the effect of an UNK on a on the open state probability rather than on the single channel current
yeah
where what's the same as the other one
okay the single channel current is the same in both cases
right it's three UNK in each case
so you've activated the channel but you've activated it by increasing the frequency with which it UNK in its open state compared a to its closed state
okay before we go on then and look at the roles of channels in biology let's look at how channels are classified briefly
they're normally UNK er classified according to their UNK properties rather th initially rather than according to their UNK
and this general approach has been supported by recent UNK studies so the channels have been er the c d n a for the channels has been UNK and that indicates that the UNK relationships between channels have been based er have arisen er UNK primarily on the basis of their UNK properties rather than on the basis of their UNK
within any major class UNK on the basis of its UNK properties UNK can be defined according to their UNK but also according to their er UNK properties and especially as we'll see in a second according to their single channel conductance
and again just before we start this overview let's just remind you what the single channel conductance of a channel is
let's take this example which i showed you up here of the calcium activated potassium channel
we can plot the current flowing through the channel which is here shown on the UNK as a function of the holding voltage which is shown on the UNK here and when we do that we get a so called current voltage relationship
we've got current on this axis voltage on this axis we've got equal in this case equal potassium on each side of the membrane so the UNK potential here shown as the zero current intercept that is the point at which the UNK not passing any current is zero UNK because we've got equal potassium on each side and we can simply draw a line through those data points
okay so we measure ei th the single channel current up here it was er three UNK at a holding potential i guess of around plus twenty UNK we measure the slope of that line and the slope of that line is the current divided by the voltage and from ohm's law that's equal to conductance
and it's commonly written as gamma
so in this particular example we've got a single channel conductance of six UNK six times ten to the minus twelve amps divided by forty UNK four times ten to the minus three volts and just dividing one by the other we get a value of a hundred and fifty times ten to the minus twelve UNK which is the us unit of er conductance note it has an i in it
in other words a hundred and fifty UNK
so that's what the single cha channel conductance is and that's how it's measured
it's simply the slope of the er of the current voltage relationship
okay so for the rest of the lecture let's take a look at er what channels do
and let's begin our discussion with a consideration of voltage gated channels and start with a well known example that of sodium channels within this class
sodium channels are UNK found in animal cells they're not present in plants or UNK or bacteria and they're found on the UNK membrane and their role is to carry out the UNK phase of an action potential
they can be specifically blocked by several toxins for example UNK commonly written t x which comes from a japanese UNK fish
it's actually a er erm japanese UNK
you have to make sure you've removed the er UNK before you start eating and in fact each year there are deaths in japan from er UNK preparation of the UNK fish
another one is er UNK commonly written s t x and both of these UNK pounds act from the outside to block sodium channels
UNK a number of other well known toxins UNK and er local UNK which you encounter when you go to your UNK and UNK both of those block sodium channels so they UNK the action UNK coming from sodium channels
calcium channels by contrast with er sodium channels are very widespread in animal and plant cell UNK
their role is invariably calcium UNK into the cell that is the UNK when they open they will admit calcium into the UNK and this plays a crucial role during signal UNK processes where elevation of UNK free calcium UNK in stimulus response UNK
i'll sa i'll have a bit more to say about stimulus response UNK in a second
but for the moment let's just make the point that there are at least three classes of calcium channel and they can UNK in the same UNK and can be distinguished by several different criteria and this is an example of how you can use the criteria that i've discussed er previously er to UNK different classes of channel
they can be dis distinguished on the basis of their single channel conductance with respect to UNK which they pass UNK a al as well as they pass calcium
so in pi in terms of the number of UNK er single channel conductance for each of these channels er each has a distinct single channel conductance of eight twenty five and fifteen UNK respectively
they can be distinguished in terms of their the voltage at which they UNK peak UNK of their inward current
remember we're dealing with voltage activated channels here
so respectively here we have values of minus twenty plus ten and plus twenty
they can be distinguished on the basis of their sensitivity to UNK like UNK
so er one of the channel types is activated here the other one is inhibited by UNK
they can be distinguished by their UNK sensitivity specific er UNK
er only one of the channel classes is inhibited
and they can also be distinguished on the basis of their sensitivity to another toxin known as UNK er which more or less specifically UNK just one class of channel
they've been given er labels of t l and n where the t er UNK stands for tiny l stands for large in terms of the single channel UNK respective single channel UNK and er i'm not sure what the origin of n is
in the middle somewhere
okay so those three UNK ch calcium channels can UNK within a single membrane
at present their s their precise physiological roles precisely why a single membrane needs three different classes of calcium channel hasn't been erm UNK defined but at least it serves to show you that er that a wide variety of channel types can er can exist
let's finish this discussion then of voltage gated channels by looking at potassium channels
er these are found in the UNK again of animal and plant cells and their role and we'll er see a lot more of this next week when we try and integrate er this discussion into er the er principles by which UNK work their role is principally in the UNK of membrane potential
and it's involved in the UNK of membrane potential at relatively negative levels and the reason that this works is because the internal potassium concentration is invariably held higher than the external potassium concentration
so that if the potassium channels open and therefore dominate the membrane conductance the membrane potential will approach the equilibrium potential for potassium that is with all the UNK with a lot of potassium channels open
and we can s see this typically in animal cells the internal potassium is of the order of a hundred and fifty UNK the external potassium in UNK is of the order of five UNK
so if we calculate the UNK potential for potassium the equilibrium potential for potassium in other words simply by applying the UNK equation fifty nine times the log of the external over the internal potassium concentration we can calculate a value there of minus eighty seven UNK
so the equilibrium potential then in a UNK for potassium in a typical animal cell is of the order of minus eighty seven UNK which when the potassium channels are open serves to keep the membrane in a relatively UNK state
the voltage gated potassium channels form a UNK class as with the er voltage gated calcium channels
er one potassium channel which is commonly worked on is known as the delayed UNK
and the reason for the importance of this ch channel is that it opens when UNK
so when th UNK under the influence of the opening of sodium channels the opening of the UNK delayed UNK then leads to a UNK phase which occurs precisely because the equilibrium potential for potassium is held relatively negative
so that's just summarized on this diagram here which is shown er for a UNK and i've UNK here the equilibrium potential for sodium which is relatively positive here at mi at plus fifty UNK and the equilibrium potential for potassium which is held relatively negative
and at this point the UNK is UNK a UNK occurs which is associated with the opening of sodium channels which then close
and the UNK is associated here with the opening of potassium channels
so we can express then the overall form of the action potential in terms of the differential activity first of sodium channels and then of potassium ac channels
and of course the rationale for its label of delayed UNK is now apparent it shows some delay before it's open before it opens
as indeed it has to if the action potential is to occur
an example of a potassium channel UNK is UNK
there are no very highly specific organic UNK for potassium channels
evolution seems to have er devised a large number of specific UNK for sodium channels but not for potassium channels
now if you look at that er figure you'll see that er the sodium channels during the action potential of course are closing and that's allowing er partially allowing the UNK phase to occur
and that phenomenon is known as UNK and it's a property shown by most by the vast majority of voltage gated channels
what UNK is it means in the presence of a continuing UNK stimulus the channels will close they switch off
so here's an example
the UNK stimulus is given here moving the membrane potential from minus seventy five to minus fifteen UNK so there's the there's the command pulse
and we're now measuring the sodium current flowing through the membrane here given in terms of UNK
and it's an inward current so by convention it's shown as UNK and negative
so in the presence of a sustained stimulus here which is lasting around two UNK the channels are switching off with a time constant of what around half a UNK
furthermore if you give a second pulse a short period after the first pulse you fail to UNK a large sodium current
so the second pulse then is mu it UNK a much UNK current than the first pulse did
and that's also because the channels have UNK
now both of these responses distinguish UNK from UNK
we're not simply talking about opening and closing in response to a stimulus then this first stimulus has left the channels in a state in which they're relatively unable to gate open
so we have two UNK here one of which is UNK the opening and closing in a simple on a simple er in simple response to a stimulus but also we have a phenomenon of UNK in which the channel is left in a state where it's unable to respond
and of course the function of UNK is to allow the membrane potential to recover after the UNK open
you can't allow UNK to exist permanently in a UNK state
we've got it's in other words it's a sort of negative feedback
so to summarize that in terms of a of a UNK diagram we can basically write that channels exist in closed and open states
typically the closed state can comprises c com more than one type of closed state can be UNK distinguished but let's not worry about that right now
er we can we've at least distinguished that channels can exist between closed and open states and the transition between the closed and open states is known as UNK
but in addition once they're open they can also UNK to the extent that they're no longer UNK responsive to the stimulus that opens them to the voltage stimulus which opens them
so we can distinguish then a third state in w which we can call an UNK state and which will leave the channel closed but also unable to respond as it would be able to do if it UNK in a simple closed in a simple closed state which were responsive to UNK
so this UNK then the two processes of UNK here and UNK here
as i UNK to earlier on voltage gated channels have been UNK and UNK and they show first of all UNK between all three classes sodium er calcium and potassium
and you can also determine from the sequence that the common UNK origin er was er centred around potassium channels
potassium channels formed the probably formed the UNK for all of the for the calcium and sodium channels which came later on
okay that's all i wanted to say about voltage gated channels then let's erm turn our attention to so called UNK gated channels which form rather a UNK class
UNK gated channels are erm specific to er UNK their found in UNK and of they're involved in UNK communication with the communication being achieved by UNK
so the UNK then bind to UNK which are which are the same as the channels the channel is both the receptor the UNK binder and er and an ion channel and it's located at the UNK membrane or at the surface of the UNK muscle UNK if we're dealing with a UNK junction
so it's on the on the down side of the of the s of the signal
in general this is a general point the UNK of such channels is much less than for voltage gated channels
it's they show a rather a broad UNK and can generally are generally rather non selective either for UNK or for UNK
so we can't we don't usually talk about UNK gated channels being sodium channels they'll normally pass more than one type of UNK fairly non UNK they don't really mind
let's just consider a few important examples probably the most famous of which is the UNK receptor
known as the also known as the UNK receptor er cos it will respond to UNK
it's found at the junction between motor UNK and UNK muscle
it is gated open when it UNK to UNK of UNK and in accord with what i've just said about its UNK it's a non selective UNK channel
its function its physiological function is simply to UNK the membrane when it UNK
so UNK what happens is that the principal UNK through the channel is that of sodium and that's simply although the er channel is non selective it's simply because the sodium is at high activity outside low activity inside and potassium is reasonably close to equilibrium
this then this UNK then allows the opening of voltage gated calcium channels the calcium inside rises and UNK occurs
muscle UNK
so the aim when th when the UNK is to UNK the membrane UNK which UNK the rise in internal calcium and that leads to muscle UNK
the channel itself is a complicated one it comprises five UNK in the UNK alpha two beta gamma and delta
they've all been UNK
they are all UNK and membrane UNK
so you need these five different UNK to er to form the UNK receptor and channel
the channels are UNK by a compound known as UNK which is obtained from UNK
two er other channels that i'd like to consider which have rather different functions are both er chloride channels
one is known as the g a b a receptor where g a b a is standing for gamma amino UNK acid this is the g a b a receptor
it's found in brain and the equilibrium potential for chloride is around minus ninety UNK that is more negative than the normal membrane potential which is which would be of the order of minus sixty minus seventy
so when this channel opens then the membrane potential will tend to move towards the equilibrium potential for chloride in other words the membrane will tend to UNK when these channels are open
so opening of these channels will UNK the membrane and as a result of that opening what we see is an UNK of action UNK
the UNK maintained in a in a UNK state and that UNK action UNK and that enables coordination of UNK which either fire or don't fire in response to a UNK stimulus
so these channels sh show significant although not er UNK al although not extensive sequence UNK with the UNK receptor which enables you to place them in the same class of being er a UNK er binding channel
had similar UNK origins
it UNK
similarly the UNK receptor is also an UNK chloride channel also found in brain and closely related to the g a b a receptor
so both g a b a and UNK are er physiological UNK er and it has a s the UNK receptor have a has a similar function of UNK the membrane when open UNK action potential
it's er like sodium channels inhibited by UNK
okay finally a third m major er class of ion channel i which has been extensively worked on over the last few years since the UNK of patch UNK er has been second messenger gated channels so called second messenger gated channels
let's just remind you what second UNK are because they UNK play a vital role in UNK
they are second UNK are UNK compounds for example UNK a m p or ions for example calcium and what they do is they couple UNK to responses they couple a specific stimulus each one a specific stimulus to a specific UNK response
so in other words we can write the general scheme a stimulus leads to an increase in the se level of the second messenger and that increase in the level of the second messenger leads to a response
second messenger gated channels are very widely distributed they're certainly not limited to UNK
one very extensive class is er is a calcium activated potassium channel where UNK now UNK from the inside as we've already seen in that example i showed you early on
commonly written as a k brackets c a channel
they are found at the UNK membrane they have a for a for a channels a very large single channel conductance of the order of fifty to two hundred UNK
they are generally inhibited by a compound known as UNK which is the main UNK in UNK
and they have rather distinct roles depending on where they're found
one role is as a link between internal calcium UNK calcium and the membrane potential
and one very well worked on example here concerns that of er UNK beta cells which UNK in response to UNK
these are the er these are the cells which will raise the UNK in your blood in response to UNK blood UNK
and the way in which er these calcium activated k channels UNK play a role in this response is that when these beta cells see UNK they UNK and this UNK leads to the opening of voltage dependent voltage gated calcium channels
the opening of those channels leads to an elevation of UNK free calcium and that elevation of UNK free calcium is required it's the signal the stimulus for UNK
so the elevation of calcium will UNK
now if the stimulus is not sustained if the if the UNK stimulus is not sustained the calcium load can be cleared the UNK free calcium inside the cell can be cleared for example by a calcium a t p UNK since the calcium channels were shut
okay so if the stimulus isn't there the membrane doesn't UNK any more the calcium channels shut and the calcium load gets cleared from the UNK by a calcium a t p UNK
however if the UNK is maintained high in other words if the stimulus is sustained what we see is a succession of UNK and the reason we see it is because this elevation of free calcium not only leads to a UNK it also leads to the opening of calcium activated k channels which tend to UNK the membrane
okay the so as i said earlier opening k channels will UNK the membrane
so the membrane then UNK but the stimulus is still present and that's tending to lead to a UNK so we get then this circle of membrane UNK followed by UNK but it's the calcium activated k channels which are tending to restore the membrane potential to negative values
a second function which i don't want to dwell on now because i'm gonna deal with it in a lot more detail next week is o this is a second function of calcium activated k channels is to release potassium from UNK cells during fluid and UNK
er for example UNK such as UNK lead to an elevation of UNK calcium as we've just seen and that can then lead to k release potassium release through calcium activated k channels
but we'll deal with that phenomenon in a lot more detail next week in the context of UNK cells
and finally just before we leave second messenger gated channels i'd like to consider two more which have been worked on er extensively and one of which we'll er deal with er next week
the one we'll deal with next week is the case of UNK a m p activated chloride channels these are found in UNK
UNK the er stimulate chloride UNK into the UNK and the way they do this is they raise UNK a m p levels obviously and UNK the chloride channels
and we'll see how the UNK the opening of chloride channels leads to UNK next week
importantly the chloride channels are not directly activated by the elevation of UNK a m p what they are activated by a is by a protein UNK a UNK
so it's the UNK a m p then which UNK the protein UNK a and that UNK the channel to UNK it
the last class of erm second messenger activated channels that i'd like to deal with is are those calcium channels which are found in the in UNK especially in the UNK which are gated open by a compound known as UNK one four five UNK
some UNK for example UNK in UNK a specific UNK in the UNK membrane
this is a UNK c and what the UNK c does when it's activated by the UNK is it splits a membrane UNK four five UNK into two components a water soluble component UNK and a UNK component the UNK residue UNK
the water soluble component the i p three the product of this UNK to the UNK where it gates open a calcium channel
so having UNK to the UNK it can gate open the calcium channel and this leads to an elevation of internal calcium not from the external medium now but from internal stores
the channel is specifically inhibited by UNK albeit not UNK not a physiological UNK of this channel it's not found inside cells but it can be ex UNK inhibited by UNK
UNK the channel when it's UNK and UNK around fifty percent UNK with a calcium channel which is found not in the UNK but in the UNK of muscle cells
and it's this UNK calcium UNK calcium channel which UNK calcium release for muscle UNK
UNK this channel though rather than being activated by UNK one four five UNK this channel is probably primarily activated by voltage by in other words by membrane UNK
and one can show that it has a UNK compared with the UNK gated calcium channel in that this one is specifically inhibited by a plant UNK known as UNK
okay let me just summarize what we've erm covered today then
we began by considering that channels can be studied by conventional or UNK techniques or alternatively by so called UNK methods which enable us to look at single channel currents
and the two UNK methods that we discussed were patch clamp and UNK
we decided that the UNK the action potential of course are on editor a look at control we can look at single channel currents
we looked at channel UNK either by voltage or by UNK and decided that UNK is almost invariably achieved by effects on the UNK mechanism
rather than on the single channel current or the number of channels
so that lead to an increase in the open state probability
we then went on to look at several classes of er ion channels voltage gated channels which form a UNK of sodium and calcium and potassium channels
and those voltage gated channels UNK in UNK
we decided that most voltage gated channels UNK a phenomenon known as UNK
that is they switch off UNK even in the presence of the stimulus
we went on to look at UNK gated channels and in particular three different classes UNK gated UNK gated g a b a gated
and decided that these channels occur predominantly at post UNK or on the muscle surface
right erm let's start with how long have you lived in harlow
er UNK er forty six next about forty six years dear
erm

good god
and from there er mr was the er housing manager then from UNK we came under UNK didn't we
there wasn't any new town or anything and er they'd built those er council houses in the front in and he also erm he said would i like a nice new house to have plenty of hot water for the boys for bathing and everything so i moved into a four bedroom and er i was there er brought my family up there for till er unfortunately my mother came to live with me and unfortunately erm i had to go away erm because i wasn't very well on a holiday and i was called back cos she was found dead on the toilet my poor mother and er after that erm i came back and erm in the middle of the week from holiday oh bother it will it be okay
hello yeah UNK number i'm just having a recording done of me while i've been in harlow i'm having it done now yeah er so i can't stop alright bye
it's always the way innit
will that come on it
will that
no
no that's alright then and er i got into i came back sort of when mother died had to come back suddenly in the middle of the week and then erm i brought me family up as i say and my UNK he took he took us christmas shopping which is twenty one years ago this month the sixteenth my daughter in law and i and the little boy and that's the little boy over there that's now married the one with the photograph he took us shopping at bishop's stortford cos we hadn't any shops nothing here then there was nothing when i first came here it was terrible and we went to bishop's stortford and we came home in the dinner time and i got erm had our dinner and everything had our meal well we had soup and that was gonna cook at night er you know dinner at night so we had soup and that and erm he said i go down to the garage to put a tyre on my car he came struggling back and within half an hour he was dead at fifty six years old that's all he was so i was left to bring up those that wasn't married i was left to bring up er the others you know er i had the twins with me and roy one of the boys and erm er brian the youngest one and i had to bring them up and i after i they all got married and i moved before they got married i just got brian with me the two twins got married and i moved into my daughter in law's house next door which was no two seven five the other side i'm sorry two seven five and er i was in my house though three years that four bedroom and i couldn't afford to keep you know big house like that going with just three my me and my son so we moved into her house and she had the end one which is still in now we'd done a swap and then cos er in the later years i was in there oh a long while and i loved it and i didn't wanna move but then i found i was handicapped i wouldn't get up the stairs to the toilet so i was moved into this bungalow you see and i had a friend living with me and he erm he come here to live with me came to lodge with me because he didn't want to go into UNK you see and er after that erm after that we i had this bungalow and er i moved into this bungalow and er he moved in here with me and er everything happened when i got in this bungalow
the first may i fell out my garden and put my elbow out this one right out which makes it awkward for me to use now you know i put that right out and therefore erm i had to go at up to hospital and put that right and the follow the following the following may my bed caught UNK with electric blanket and that UNK all up had my had my bed all UNK my double bed the electric blanket and i'd only just had it serviced and that went that was the second may and the third may we were going on an outing me and erm arthur that was lodging with me and he we got out of the taxi at UNK and it he just collapsed and died at me feet so that's the that was the end of that and i've been living here you know since he went and erm i used to be able to get anywhere with one stick cos i had arthritis in this right hip you see i could get anywhere with one stick in the taxi or anywhere and i went to my son's er which is now coming i've been here about twelve years in this bungalow er eight years erm eight years ago in no this november gone i went down to my son's it was rather slippery and he took me down in the car and i as i got out erm the car i said to him mind it's very slippery he said i won't let you fall mother he said so i went in but as i came out with one stick he still hadn't got anything down you know if it had been a sort of erm sand or something down i wouldn't of slipped and i got half way in his car and out i fell and caught this left hip on the step on the step and i UNK my hip and it's right out of the socket like that it should be and i can't have it put back because i've had several UNK in my life time and i cannot have it put back you see
oh
but er as i say while i was round there the new town was all built and er i found we found such a difference cos i used to have to go into old harlow shopping i used to cycle before i was handicapped like this i used to cycle everywhere and er i went you used to have to queue up in old harlow for the shops we hadn't got anything here at all no stow or anything when i first i mean when i came here nothing it was just terrible lane up here it was and all these were all UNK fields and it was really terrible and i had erm i used to have to cycle into the doctors old harlow queue up queue up at the butchers queue up everywhere you had to queue and er till they built this er the new the stow then we used to go to the stow shopping you know which made such a difference but er during my say during my lifetime i've so pleased when the new town came because i wanted to move back to UNK where i came from when i first got here because it was such a terrible place there was nothing doing whatever you know and then i moved erm as i say after i got round the front there it was more better really you know with all the er traffic and that you could see people going by and that as otherwise it was UNK really in common fields you didn't see much at all there but you know it was i quite enjoyed it really now what else have i got to tell you
oh erm do you think your life's been changed by the new town
oh yes it's been changed a lot and a and er it's made such a difference and i've met er i've got a er fr a very good friend who's a red cross young man who i met at UNK and he takes me out in the car which i wouldn't never get out otherwise because my boys are all working you see they can't they're busy working and erm do shift work and security work one's got his own security business and the other one's got a factory in bishop's stortford so that they don't get much chance they work away some of them do that they cannot get to take me out see so he takes me out which he's very good you know he's yesterday he took me to erm yesterday we he took me to UNK to see his sister in the bungalow and then he took me for a meal at erm the UNK at er at UNK yes UNK the UNK it was quite nice i had rather a good time erm cos usually i can't get out unless i go out in the wheelchair you see i'm confined to a wheelchair though i struggle out into the kitchen with me two sticks and i've got a stool in there that i do all my own cooking and i make cakes and that and i'm doing a cake gonna make a cake for christmas for me brother and make a cake er another one for myself like but and then i go to my erm daughter in law's to spend christmas day and then i i'm going to my son's and spend boxing day which is my birthday i'll be seventy four on boxing day i'm UNK to say yeah but erm this young man that takes me lives in UNK he's er a UNK but he's very good he helps all us old people you know he's ever so good he is to me he comes up and brings my shopping today does my shopping for me as well so well he's yes he's most kind for nearly two years i've know him that's a photo over there it was taken at a wedding look of my that's it over there taken at a wedding dear very good

mm er what was the school like before it the schools in harlow before
well all we had was UNK school and that's where my boys had to go to UNK they went into UNK school and erm they all got on alright you know they got on well there and then from there they went to when the new school was built they went to UNK school you see but two of my sons are UNK and unfortunately the eldest one of the UNK i couldn't put him to apprentice because i couldn't afford it cos i had a hard to struggle to bring them up you know in those days we didn't get erm any family allowance or anything those days and erm so therefore he couldn't go but he sort of got on and got his own factory but my other son who's an electrician one of the twins he's erm he's got his city and guilds he passed he went he was able to go to the school when the new schools were built you see when UNK school was built he was able to go to night school and er learn all you see then there was the one at burnt mill wasn't there down the bottom
i mean
mm
he was able to go and he cos he passed his city and guilds he works for the water board so he gets the maintenance
oh
for the water board so he's got quite a good job you know but erm i'm we couldn't afford to put the other through the apprentice because i mean you hadn't got the money had you then

you couldn't do it but he had every opportunity the other the twin did to get through you know and he passed his city and guilds but peter's got on alright the other son who's got the factory he's busy got an electrical panels and all that he does you know he's quite good and my other son he works he used to work at burnt mill and he now has moved to erm er stansted he works at stansted he works in the big food depot that used to be years ago and he works there he's been there ever since he left school since except two years he had in the army you know for the UNK but he's been there erm ever since he was fourteen and he's now about oh forty something now he is i'm not quite sure of their ages i get UNK up i've got eight sons altogether so i've got quite a family dear
what was your old house in UNK like
it was a two bedroom old cottage it was very nice with a big garden and all i had was erm one room downstairs and like er a kitchen well er where the sink and that was it was more like a big room where the kitchen was and the two bedrooms upstairs but only a door on one bedroom you went up the stairs into a big open room you know where the UNK all round you know what i mean no door on it and just another door a bedroom door that's all but i loved it you know it was a nice erm not bad but of course it was condemned it got so old and then they pulled it down and they built another house on it right next to where erm that shooting took UNK you know they was having that shooting night just down that lane where i used to be
oh
i used to live just down that lane back lane and er that's where they er had that last week that UNK with the police wasn't it UNK police yeah yes that's where i and er it was a quite nice old house really i didn't like leaving it
how long did you live there for
oh i li well i i've had a lot of moves dear in my time i tell you i first of all when i first got married i lived at bishop's stortford then from bishop's stortford i went to erm stansted in rooms cos i you know we couldn't get a place and from there i had one of my sons oh hello time eleven o'clock just struck what's the day

just strike eleven so it's not far wrong
erm when the new town was first proposed and erm and they you know said they were gonna build up houses and that what did you think
well i was pleased i was pleased of it
mm
really great it was you know i didn't really think it would turn out as big as it has done you know but it's turned out beautiful hasn't it really yeah we was i was UNK especially when they built the new houses round the front we used to go and keep looking at them little did i think i would get one and the housing officer came one day and he said would you like one of the new ones i said i would and it was four bedroom but we got you see we've got the other bedroom over my daughter in law's so me and UNK used to have the en right down a long passage and the bedroom was over like the sit you've got a bedroom over the sitting room like see and she erm we used to have so the children didn't make a noise to disturb her so my UNK and i had that room yeah it was quite nice it was nice house i erm you know enjoyed being there bringing up the family you want plenty of room you've got a big family don't you really
so it then i had erm i brought up my husband's sister's daughter from when she was fourteen i brought her oh yes fourteen i brought her up for nine years and br brought her up as my own daughter like because she got to be put away in a home and i didn't want her to have to go into a home so i brought her up you know we brought her up and sort of as i lost my little girl she was with me like see and she still comes to me like she still calls but she calls me mum mother like now ha you know all those years i had her she's married and her family's grown up now and er she's got one daughter left at home who's just got engaged that's mrs from er she lives yes so that was my UNK er sister's daughter she only had the one daughter and two brothers but she the brothers she don't hear nothing of them they just you know they were gonna put her in a home but we took her so she didn't have to go in a home i didn't want her to have to go in a home
mm
so we brought her up brought her up she lived with me until she got married you see dear
yeah did a lot of people have to go in homes in those days or is it just like today
well it's more like more or less just like today you know if you if you've got nowhere to go and they just put you there but i mean now you can't get in very good can you really not now but erm pat since she's been on duty she's had a terrible trial terrible she had to get one help in this morning get one of the floor next door then we've had trouble one down further but she's been put into erm UNK now for five weeks so she's out the way for a little while we've had an awful worrying time here though it's absolutely been a pantomime cos this has just keeps er throwing herself on the floor all the time she's doing it
mm
and the warden was there in her dressing UNK trying to get her up and she couldn't get her up this morning so she had to get help one of the UNK came along and helped from the top terrible to say though it is yeah never mind they get over it

mm
at the end of september
mm
what do you think about it
i like it
right is that actually running jane
oh well no it doesn't seem to be
it is running but it's not showing us anything
which is interesting
thing's plugged in
is that channel nine on the telly
channel nine on the telly mhm there's the right one that's all in the right places don't know we're not going to see it after all
it doesn't look like it
strange isn't it
there must be nothing on it
try spinning it forward a bit might be
it's a very short thing really isn't it
mm
ah
no that's not it
no it's not it's definitely channel nine that's the video channel
ah
that's not it either
it isn't anything
mm
it's not UNK at anything oh
oh well we'll tell you about it instead
sorry about that
miracles of technology
erm it's
i'll give you a selection of songs from it
erm is it a new film
no it must be a year old or something
right
yes it's
it's comparatively new
right because i knew nothing about it yeah so
it seems to have been quite a reasonable picture you know it's quite well
as a film
mhm
as you probably know it's presently showing at the cinema and is a story of an irish tenor joseph locke
you must've got an extra sheet than me because one of the things i was UNK about this morning erm maybe you've got a different
do you want a copy of this
maybe you've got a different letter than the one i've got
maybe you have a
that is the letter
because
and that is what is audio description on video audio description and hear my song
oh it's that song yes right i remember that one coming on
other uses of audio description
yeah
television cinema theatre
yes i've got the information sheets
you've got that
i got a different letter from this
right
i've got a letter from
cos that's the one
UNK rather than from than this
and you've got all these
yeah
things yeah
yeah
UNK and things
yeah
so i'm not quite sure what the long term connection with er talk
is
right
and i'm not entirely sure UNK did phone me and say at one point when he was making up the mailing list he's had three hundred copies of that made of the extract and he was kind of you know UNK around for who to send them to
right
erm so you that's when he said he would send one to me but he's obviously sent them to and UNK had one
has cath had one
maybe she'd pass it on to me
erm
i would like to think
so there's one at there is one at and there is also one erm
yes because it would of come to from
that's where mine came from
but i'm not sure i doug has got one doug is my chairman of the arts committee erm
mhm
i'm not quite sure why he's got one apart from unless UNK just decided to send one to him but he's sent it to home so i'm not quite sure what UNK is mailing
it's voluntary organization so your
yeah
mhm it could be that
but it would've normally come to us here you see at
yes
anyway duncan
anyway
duncan phoned me on friday about something else and said oh have we had this tape so i said yes and he said have you seen it and i said no not yet and he said erm but he thought it was quite good erm
it's cathy aye just bring
alright hello cath
hi there
sorry i've been to disability scotland
oh right
there's a nice UNK chair there
oh it's smashing
feel particularly UNK
no important
important
that was lovely i haven't seen
have you not
do you want to take your coat off
now can i introduce you to i don't think you two have met
we've met before at
yes
you have met
yeah
you have
do you want to take your coat off then
yes i'm fine i'll just leave it here that's right
you sure it's alright there do you want some coffee
oh that would be wonderful if it's not gonna cause oh yes that's
and i should
do you get a copy of
yeah
and i should explain the microphone in the middle of the table and the man over here with the tape recorder is tape recording this meeting
oh no
so everybody in the world knows you were late
so i wasn't really late it was in the wrong place
so the purpose of the of the tape recorder is
yes
is to do with the
milk and sugar cath
development of UNK and the use the use of english so we have been assured in that anything we say will be divorced from
apparently all proper names and phone numbers will be UNK out
that's okay no problem at all
so we're to ignore it
what we were just saying cath was we was just trying to look at the tape that's just come from UNK the erm the film and
have you seen it
it won't
we haven't we were just gonna look at it but jane has a technical knock not speaking to each other
it won't show no
it's awful
is it
and now well i said
what i was just gonna say was that doug had phoned me on friday and said had i seen it and i said no and he said it's quite good he said
it's four minutes without the description then four minutes with it and i thought that doesn't concur with what cath said to me on thursday afternoon
the technology
that's not fair the technology is good and very obviously gets over what it's supposed to get over that's terrific but wait till you see this subject matter
but the actual
but the actual extract as cath said to me the other day you know she felt sure and i said to her you know in a full length film they could've actually chosen a better moment
aha
because
and we were talking mainly an elderly a female elderly client group let's be honest you know in terms of blind you know and just wait till you see it it's lovely
erm and i think it's to a couple of colleagues
no it's not working i think it's you know
this morning when where we all watched it for the first time together and as richard said you know i'm UNK about going to the dentist so and it cos er it's basically there's a scene in the bar where they're pulling this guy's tooth out
which is not sort of you know
richard you know
could of been a UNK operation should of been
could of been yes
grateful for it
so you know that as you know richard said you know good idea could make quite a few people so i think UNK if UNK chose that moment he really
chose the wrong moment
could of chose a better one erm having said that the second part there's two parts there's this scene in the pub and then there's this er scene on the cliff top and the second scene one's a bit better
right
oh right
the thing two things that struck me about it one of which is that we were not talking about a separate UNK the actual existing UNK of the film is UNK with the audio description
right
is what we've talked about in films and t v is erm having erm i suppose the integrity if that's the right word of the existing film or programme standing alone and then on separate UNK like in the theatre
mm
you know there's a description which you can choose to listen to or not
mhm
with this film it will be you know compulsory you won't be able to make that choice erm and the other one the other thing that struck me just from one of the particular UNK of people standing on top of this cliff erm is the way that the importance of in something like a film where it's you know it's done for good you know the importance of having an actual creative writer
yes
doing the writing to get over in the description cos they talk about the UNK sea
mhm
there's one or two moments like that which is possibly a different you know if you cou you know putting it on to tape
mhm
for life you know
mhm
it's that kind of thing rather than i suppose to the theatre way you know you react much more UNK so i thought that was an interesting thing that thing
i just thought
jumped off
the page do
i thought it was interesting as well that the stuff i got from the i and r v with it was a lot about audio description and the tape and how much it cost and how wonderful this was and it was the first time it had ever been done but there was nothing as is always the case there was nothing actually about what the film was about it was full of sort of this is the first time it's done but nothing about sort of this is the film about this is what the UNK about you know
it's it is very UNK to that one sort of you know well here's the audio description you better like it
i mean i suppose it is the first time it's the only film of its type you know what i'm getting at it's exactly the same thing we tried very hard to avoid in the access guide actually being able to say what instead of just saying you know
mhm
the lyceum theatre is fully wheelchair accessible we actually describe what the theatre what kind of plays it shows
yes
erm you know why it's different from the travellers which is round the corner
mhm
you know erm what the difference in the work that they do
i don't i'm not quite sure of erm that's i think that's a different thing
sometimes say people say to me can you give us
of the play what's it about cos we don't know what it's you know about before we come which is fair enough erm that's very often sighted people don't know
mm
mm
mm quite
so if blind people are trying to be on the same level terms with sighted people then you know why should they get an
mhm
i'm not quite sure i mean i'd give an
if there's one available
mhm
for instance there's a nice one for
mhm
so i gave that and there was nothing this year the citizens have nothing at their
we put people off going so i'm not saying anything about it not erm i don't i mean i don't i could say what the story of major barbara is but then it's not in any of the printed UNK for sighted people therefore should i what should i do cathy i don't know
no i don't i really don't i think it in it with
yes
it's the quality of access
exactly
it's not some sort of different erm sort of it shouldn't be a different scenario for
well that's what i feel yes
and er very often if you knew somewhat you know obviously modern it would it would spoil it because you're there
you would that's right
to see what it's like really and to feel what it's like and to no i don't think we should do
some things are very difficult to actually work out what the
as well
you can
i mean
you're right
take UNK last year we didn't know what was gonna happen until it happened
and then it happened different every night as well
i suppose if there's something in the programme then they should
i think that's what i'm talking about really actually is that i mean if you're if you're selling a film like you know if
it's a marketing line
it is a marketing line
yes it is a marketing line right
as saying you know this is a story about this and that and you look at that
but then i would read it so if i was in the theatre i would read that so i would know that
yeah
before the play started
mhm
so blind people should be in the same position there shouldn't they
should yeah
yes
so i mean if there is if there are two lines saying this is the story of
that's right yes
yes
that's
but then we do that at the start
anyway
yes you do that
but it's beforehand eh for instance they have little flowers that tells the story of what's what the plays about and i think it's fair enough to read that because a sighted person would go in and pick it up
would be reading it
and say what is this
that's an interesting actually side chart i mean this is completely off the agenda and things but erm i just had some information up from er from UNK and er
that's the dates for everything i see sorry
one of the things the group in wolverhampton i think at the theatre royal there is doing both audio descriptions by sign language i think and one of the things they've they do is meet in the bar
mm
like half an hour before the show
mm
and someone i don't know whether it's the director or someone actually says this play is the half hour quarter of an hour chat say this is what the UNK about
mhm
you know and the UNK you know and i thought that was interesting that they did that because it's not something we'd thought of really doing ever
no
erm programme notes yes but not the actual sort of
this is the story of two people and this happens and that happens and that also comes in
yes
mm
so i was i was interested to see that i mean that
no i didn't i think that was right
i wouldn't of thought that were right and all
mm the director always i mean
after show talks yes maybe to be able to say well what do you think of that and
oh yes that's terrific in fact it would be fun aha
but er no
but no i don't think
that's assuming that blind people wouldn't understand what they're hearing on the stage
i think well you see this is the other thing yes
that's right
that's right yes you have to tell them what to look out for kind of thing
there's enough examples of that and you read the most peculiar thing i think i was telling i don't know if i was telling iris i have a notion i had it in my mind to tell you and you turned up with this blind girl to do this m c
with the video team
mhm
the team you know are very important people
they announce in the room we are from video such and such you know and just looked at me this black man explained everything to everybody else and then the guy went over and sat down and explained it all again just blind
and m i thought he was gonna start saying something different
yeah
but i realize the same thing i said erm
she can hear
she actually has heard all this before
yeah
and he said oh yes of course you know this
you don't you think we've all moved on in things that all
yeah
were all so much
so it's bad enough if they gather them in the gathering them in the barrel like the barrel bit but not the sort of
yeah
gathering you get to explain what's going to happen first of all you done
and does she take sugar
yes
oh would you like some more
all i was gonna say that if that was you
oh well if there is
if that was it on the agenda that i miss because of being so early bit in the wrong place
what i wanted to do is say is what about the publicity can we try and make the very best of this
mhm
erm you know because i want to do something more clear that's gonna fit in with everybody else
yeah
it's an ideal opportunity
yes i mean erm
i can't do anything about it erm yet because we've only just got it i mean what you thinking of
there's a bar on it until the eighteenth of september isn't there
oh is there
is there
yes
that's when they're that's when they're launching the full
because i mentioned it in playback because i thought er trouble is within a
and it's just a take on so i watched what i said but erm we mentioned it we didn't see very much about it we just said it's coming up we'll have we'll let you in for a full details next month so
mm
the other thing we might do is erm is a at the film council and see if he can help us with i mean it is a film after all whether he's got er particular contacts
mm
anything council with media or anything
mhm
erm
yes that would be
to say you know this is you know this is arrived as it were and the tape with full things coming in the middle of the month and what kind of thing did you have anything in mind
no i really just to see what everyone else was doing i mean i was thinking of is a little
of which she sort of goes into every door every door in strathclyde what a horrible thought but in fact you know i thought maybe try and do something there although i don't always get on greatly well with the press and publicity people and the women in press and publicity are sort of start UNK
once the
if she says it to me one more time i
no but i will
but i mean you know if
you put that piece of dried heather and you light it
light it yes it does
yes it does
see that it does yeah
i think you know if it's not child abuse or something you know
aha
you know straight to the heart erm you know fifteen million children abandoned in glasgow green there you know she's really terribly taken with mind
not interested
i think the answer to that is i don't think you're in the right job
really is erm quite annoying
er yes
fire fighting
but worth trying that would certainly help but i just wondered even if you know sort of local press i mean presumably they are in their league for doing this
well what i suppose we should do is find out what r n i b is doing first that's what we should find
yes that would be good aha
and then we can maybe then think about it okay well i'll
you come back to us then and
well yeah i mean one by one maybe if we can hit the herald and erm the times and
the times is always good for UNK things
and the news and the UNK
aha
and erm and erm our friend at erm radio
the daily record
radio UNK as well
mhm
i'm sure the local press will be interested too if you can involve them that would be a great help
i would be very grateful
as there will need to be more campaigning before we see the UNK description in the theatre and that could be
presumably r and r b would of contacted the big papers but obviously not the small local ones
to help spread the news i UNK the material
mm ah i mean if it was the question i mean i've got that material we've got it i mean if it was question of sending out i mean i could do that
well i'll check with r and r b's press office first just to check before we sort of do things but i mean it'll be worth would it be worth approaching erm reporting scotland and scotland to
i think so
and good morning scotland yeah all these kind of
mhm
i would definitely think so
and the free papers i mean that's the one that goes through all the doors
yes that's the one that's right mhm
you know everybody gets it then
erm right what's the name of that nice man that good morning scotland who neil
neil
is he still there
i think so yes
oh cos he did a couple of nice bits for us in the past
mhm
for i was always keeping up my UNK for sort of things we might do as opposed to r and m u have done
mhm
yeah
this is that's a sort of reference to sort of
yes
get into sort of the voluntary organization
enter the cut throat staff you know
a wrap through r and r b's not a hit
no
erm right okay well i'll look into that but i think that serves a good point right moving back to the agenda erm note of meeting fifth of august erm anything for those of you who were there that cath had to run away that was one of your UNK you were having
oh god
that's right because you came back again
right at the end
it was still
it was still erm quite good that was worth it that day
was it oh good
because that location still on the go
is it
oh good
that in yes
mm
lovely location
erm we're using the same agenda which is why UNK confusion about venue on the front cos i said to my secretary
she said what agenda do you want so i said just the same and so she put the same venue we tend to alter at the meeting she said
yeah
yes i think it says it's edinburgh in the front and glasgow on the back or the other way round
mm
that's why i'm late
yes
she was still in glasgow yeah
scotland i didn't know you were having it here
well we felt like a change
yes we felt like a change why not come to my lovely office
it's lovely isn't it you can't have it falls apart when it's moved
so it's the same agenda so if everybody's okay with that note i mean most things i think come up
mhm
i should say that i came away from the last meeting with an enormous list of things to do and i haven't managed to do them all but they'll emerge as we go through erm developments UNK if inter interrupt me
UNK haven't
UNK happened it has it's pilot on august the twelfth which iris UNK
mhm
mm you seemed to of i mean you were a bit disappointed there were less not so many visually UNK people were there but they were sort of casting the net with council
no i wasn't so much disappointed as that i was disappointed that there was only five would be UNK and that it was we had to give out
oh right
about sixty UNK and i thought well who are these people we're getting i think a lot of them were social workers so that's fair enough
mm
but erm
i mean certainly the UNK people seem well pleased and
mm
somewhere i think i managed to remember to bring erm their erm their minutes from the meeting i didn't go to last week but you did
erm no i haven't got them erm and they've agreed to go ahead in conjunction with
i mean everything is kind of UNK up
it is going that is
erm
the monies
well they're they are still waiting for confirmation on money but they've got quite a lot in the kitty already
mm
because the society up in UNK the UNK belong to a society and had this UNK legacy and they'd agreed to spend it
a UNK amount of it on audio description so from that point of view there they was sort of fairly well down the line with the money anyway they had
still giving money into it
erm they were approaching the district council weren't they
yes
the common good fund and they had you know all i mean you know they had all UNK out for all the things so there are a couple of dates which came up in the last meeting erm for further pilots and then the intention is to just go ahead from
well they said at that meeting they'd hoped to have their system for the next one which is the seventeenth october
oh right
mm
because i didn't know whether i was going to have to bring ours up or not because i
that's right yeah because obviously the radio system was
yes
used on the twelfth of august erm
so they're going to have their er infra red
so they hoped to have the infra red in by then yeah
they hope to have it by then
yeah i mean what was nice in a way was that er i couldn't go to the last meeting i wasn't well i had a cold er what was nice in a way was that david who's the general manager and the general manager from UNK had come in i mean in a way it was a classic case
it was good
of having sort of help set something off and then UNK away which has been one of my functions that it can happen
yes
yes
it sounds good
and i felt quite happy especially with a bow tie on you know it had been it had gone you know and in a way we sort of could almost sort of
can let go of it
let go of it
mhm
now so it's i was well pleased with that
in saying that go over erm obviously i'm all for that but in terms of sort of holding on to what they're doing i just had written down to mention that you know we didn't have some sort of mechanism to share you know
yes
either up to information on what's happening all this you know and i'll i know we'll come on to
yes absolutely
that point later
mhm
but we must sort of all pull in together as a situation in scotland now that which really concerns me and i'd
away because it's wonderful to have another theatre but erm it's just a bit maybe trying to draw up some method to do that
is there sort of a team leader of volunteers emerged up there
or is that is that still theatre that's doing that
not yet i think at the moment they're organizing it yes
yeah or is it the society for the blind or is it sort of between the two
no it's the theatre
it's the theatre is it
i think UNK organizing it all
right
good that's good it's a theatre
very good it's a theatre
she can keep doing it
mm
erm
no
it all depends whether they want to do it or not
yes
sometimes it's easier if you find to pass it on to someone else
oh yes i mean i just wouldn't of got anywhere with it
oh aye no
but i'm hoping to pass glasgow onto someone else
it's quite interesting that it's the theatre that's doing it i was on a course last week in sussex a management course and there was bradford theatre companies were there erm from all the different theatres and they organize it and they organize the volunteers
oh really
that is the that is the
they do the training now
how do they do that through a friends group or
yes friends of the theatre
right
it's quite interesting that they do it
yes
well it's a perfect opportunity for friends to
that's difficult in the setting up stages
mm
you know it's whoever takes it on really
i think that's we all we all UNK it
ours is always
i mean the closer it is to the theatre the better
yeah
the contacts are and everything and i think that's much better if it can be got down to that eventually
and you're getting people who are interested in the theatre
mhm
yeah
oh right from the beginning when we talk to citizens about using their friends of the theatre i nearly fell about you know
and yet i have three i have three good friends of the theatre involved
do you ah mm now
one of them's the chairman
yes
we have friends of the lyceum involved
there is historically i mean it maybe the same at the
as it is at the lyceum that there is kind of historically a certain amount of not exactly friction but i mean something that has
that is
sort of got kind of an odd relationship between the friends
yes
and the management literally
mm
i suppose they see themselves as
i suspect it's the same in the
yeah
the sort of suffering chart
yeah
aye
but i think it's an ideal thing cos people who remember the friends are always interested in the theatre
yes
and that's such a good start
and be able to pass on the enthusiasm
yes mhm yeah
and we also i mean it was also felt that you know the friends mechanism of the UNK and get together
mhm
yes
you know
mhm
is a way of getting
erm
mhm spread the word
i don't know maybe it may just be come down to sort of the individual theatres i suppose
mhm
that's the thing
it was quite interesting that all of the theatres and all the theatre staff who were there knew all about audio description
yeah
really
because i spoke to them all about it
yes mhm
and it was happening in all of their theatres
mm
it's just good
it's interesting isn't it
that's good mhm
yeah
mhm
so mm so anyway it's apparently it's kind a way in
one of the things that dough who was there er with iris on the twelfth er spotted was that one of his ex students who now works in educational technology or something equally grand in the northern college in dundee is one of the volunteers who have come forward
oh
mm
and with her kind of background in writing up training package packages and things
mm
that's good
he has he's not asked her he's UNK her to actually get involved in helping with the UNK of the training package
training package mm
once she's sort of you know
i mean obviously once she's been through the learning process herself so doug came away feeling quite pleased that he'd made that contact and he also sort of made one or two he had one or two wise observations i think about the evening he made one or two new contacts himself and the suggestion and things he spoke very well about it at our committee on our last meeting last week
oh good
so eliminate er it UNK about how successful
good
the system is
so that was
the sort of a contact for training now
good manage to get the equipment back that the sighted people ran off with
no erm well it's not just they didn't have it wasn't too much there's one ear piece which has come off but i discovered at my last i sent myself last week at the assembly hall to how that could happen
ah
because it happened to me you know the little soft bit
yes
oh right
i was wearing i had the UNK behind my neck and i took it off for something i was holding it up to try and get a better
and i discovered that one was missing
was missing
and i thought ooh where is it
oh all
i started to look around and i put my hand up and it was lying at the back of my collar
mhm
so it must come off very easily
must come off very easily somehow
so it so i'm tempted not to hand you know to take them all off before handing them out
yes
if i'm giving a single ear piece cos they won't be quiet otherwise they will get lost that way
mhm
very simple
are they terribly expensive
shouldn't think so i don't know i haven't managed to contact
to find out
i was just wondering whether it's something you know you buy a
yes
mhm
probably aren't that expensive
what happens about hygiene with those as well
well in you could clean them with stuff is
you can clean them
there's the thing is they're terribly expensive if you if you don't exactly have any money
yeah
which is what the position at the moment
aha i see
mm
aha and we will have to think about some sort of contingency fund around to for UNK whatever
that's part of the bigger discussion
mm
well anyway yes sorry that was
well
well not for me no
oh no
repairs and UNK are typical are a lot
mm
what's the latest from glasgow then
the latest from glasgow is the system is starting up again we're doing the first one on the twenty fourth of september erm the theatre royal had we're doing three
are these dates erm sixth november fourteenth november
yes sixth november fourteenth november what's that
and the fifth of december that's the theatre royal for UNK
it's sixteenth i didn't think afterwards i didn't bring it wait a minute sixth yes sixth is the UNK cos that's a UNK and ten thirty in the morning
ten a m
well done
schools which we hope erm they all come
well done
that's the
that's right
yes mm
then the fifth of december is on
that's all that's
oh yes the fourteen of november
that's again a saturday night er four p m
i should think we'd probably have good people going
mhm
right i haven't done anything about the
at all
they're trying encouraging to cathy to show some interest
oh yes i have
which is more than i have
and i laid back so that the fashion might
i was coming to do all again sort of thing you know i mean they suddenly announced who
i really i was seeing her because i wasn't happy about the publicity the way it had described audio description i didn't think it was good and alex was unhappy about the way they were describing some language things which cos they're not doing erm and we just went in and he just said right just erm well i've kept you some seats for a performance on the sixteenth of september this was about the
oh aye twenty fourth of august or something
aha you know since a week goes on and erm and that's it aha not ring me up and say hi there we're thinking of
so if you hadn't happened to of gone you know
aha so if i hadn't haven't goodness knows aha so i mean we i had a chat with iris obviously but it just wasn't on with other commitments and different things it was in the afternoon
apart from anything else we don't just go to the theatre we have we really tend to wait to be invited
mhm
erm now and erm anyway i refused to say anything about the
until i could see physically they have UNK it i mean i won't even say yes we'll do it if you do it i'm going to say you do it and we'll give you a
description because there's no way i'm going to go into that position again no
yeah just to fill brian in with that
they had a great deal of trouble
mm
we hadn't done anything since they UNK the st paul's theatre
mm
and they assured us there would be a bit incorporated for audio description so what it was half of us entrance into the UNK sound box cut off it was a sort of UNK but erm to see out the window
this is good yeah
i standing on my UNK i couldn't see out the window to look out to the stage erm and there was a huge step up it was about that which was great for people's bad backs and if you got up on that erm then you sat on top of a very high UNK chair in fact one of our people had to UNK on top of the high UNK chair to look to see down over the window down to the stage and they didn't give us a sound feed which would sound familiar
yes it does
because there's no sound feed and altogether oh yes for the second we did two plays and for the second one they didn't produce a script
no
so i described them how to do it UNK on our knees looking down no sound without a script it was just absolutely ludicrous
yeah it's exactly that kind of experience that i think has got me thinking about what i was saying before you came well before we were just doing the coffee about the idea of actually starting to draw well i was calling contracts but probably it's more better called agreements about you know the theatre will do this we will do that and
mhm
you know maybe even have cut off dates so that if there isn't you know a script by such and such a date then we will need to figure out what these dates were but this is why got more on board
over the
to give the theatre side more of
the sort of he's doing more than me
yes
the sort of contracts you would you know i mean you have with producers anyway UNK
mm
and artists and things that you know we could maybe i don't want to make it you know a twenty five page
mhm
you know a legal document but i mean maybe we can reach some sort of middle ground that would be a kind of guidelines and
mhm
i mean once
the only thing i can see there is the different UNK will obviously will have different differences to cope with that
of course of course yeah
well that's something we would obviously have to sort of i mean maybe it's something where you know i mean with the
there's a UNK about it now
mhm
mm yes
which i suppose it might be difficult to see what had to be arranged for that with you there's a UNK but you know the UNK is obviously a
one UNK basis i mean we are talking a certain one of
there are certain basics there are certain basics
yeah
that if they're not there we can't do
you can't do it
that's right
yeah
and the theatre must know when you're actually going to see the show
yeah
because you've got to arrange seats
mm yes
that's right
so if the a script there at least when you're there
mhm
erm
you see the message had obviously got through because that
at the latest
day he just handed me script
yeah
handed me it but even then
that's all you need when you turn up and forget the
i said
script that's enough
well i don't i said i said i'll take it but i said that i really don't i mean i said it's really i said i've explained very carefully it's iris who had all that yes ah but here's a script so you see that had at least got through
that got through
but i think what we need to do is go down well iris and i will go down there make arrangements will go down go down the office
and talk it through
and will have a look
yes
have iris can have another look but erm but it's incredible because i mean that's that really was
it really was it was
worse than what i thought
sorry what i was gonna suggest on that in a way this is kind of UNK something else you know the bit on the agenda for it i always put them in its back together when i write erm
yes maybe you and i can sit down
mhm
and kind of erm some time one afternoon or something and kind of go through these things
mhm
erm or maybe i'll consider you two down you know as the describing side
yes
the theatre side and just say
yes that might in fact be practical in
yes
and then sort of come up
mhm
with a draft if you like and then we can talk it round you know
yes
just so that we can try and work it out so that you know if we are going to go to new theatres like you know i think the new travellers is going to be interested
yes
but obviously it's pretty busy now but you know we can go to them and say this is what we found you know
mhm
as you say
it's all
every theatre is going to be different but i think there is a basics
mhm
there are basics
we've already been along there
have you
oh
have they
right well you're already ahead of me in that case
the friday night as to look at different things
i mean i knew they wouldn't be
the only thing is i would hope it would be it would be very simple and basic and nice
well that's what worries me is
because i don't want to put them off either i mean if we've got to the
oh no
and said this is what you do they would of UNK us straight out the door
yes i think that's something we would have to kind of balance up is that kind of making
can i no not telling them what to do
no this is this is what we need and this is what
you need
you need and
yes this is what we're giving even though
yeah coming up round to
yeah and i suppose it's always going to be up for sort of negotiation i mean i
oh
have this sort of vision
yes
you know of maybe you know a three or four page thing with maybe different you know different sheets and you know sort of say well now we need to do this can you do that or shall we bring ours you know
oh yes that's right
yes
and sort of when can we have a script you know and you write it down and take thirty per cent of it or whatever you know erm i mean the other thing that alex has drawn er
has drawn up for sign language is this sort of flow chart er with dates and things working backwards from the event saying you know we need this by two weeks beforehand we need it back
you've got to book in
yes you have
and i was wondering if that might kind of
mhm
mhm
the thing i mean again it's different but
i don't think so i think
if it's any UNK they totally ignore that
yeah
i don't really i don't really think it's that that's UNK people down and i think this theatre will be slightly different
yeah
mhm
because when some plays run for two weeks
but until there's erm that's right i
and some for three weeks
yeah
and you wouldn't have the opportunity to go along
no
and i think i think the difficulty with that is until you know it as one person said to alex in front of me ah well we did exactly what you required and you never brought any audience there was no audience do you remember that
that was really embarrassing
did he really
now i mean that can happen to us you know that can happen to us
oh yes
yes
ag again that's why i don't want you to be heavy cos i don't want say to say oh you know you've brought us you know fifteen pages and we worked our way through it and then you know at the end of the day we do all of it yeah
where's your audiences
yes yeah
i think we'll really have to be cautious and that one
that happened on saturday
mhm
i agree that there are certain things like the sound coming into the
might be able to actually see that real smart
yes
but i mean other than that i i'd like to be dead cautious about that i still think it's early days i know we've made a great success but it's early days
and we can't guarantee an audience we can never guarantee an audience
no and there's still some theatre UNK no we can't and there's still some theatre people don't want us
of people
that's right can you tell me see there this list are any of these please go UNK to other theatres
that's helpful for us to know because maybe even would want to take one of them for instance that's already been described
mhm
yes that's us moving onto edinburgh now mate
now oh sorry aye
we did get on together
i thought we might
UNK
yes
yes it might you know
i've got a potential describing UNK i met her on the train the other day a friend of my he says
aye
asks that
and aberdeen still very gracious
yes he would be very good in there
aberdeen still there
oh
that's january right
there's UNK
well february i suppose by the time it goes to long
well the theory was it was even UNK his majesty's
aberdeen and er theatre royal but i don't have any of them UNK
mhm
and we also booked tour of the price arthur UNK
right
mhm
so there might be some UNK in the new year
and they're UNK after they've
after the new year yeah
been here
after the shows yeah
that'll be that'll be
that's good
we're gonna start to send something
because we're gonna have to know that in advance because the UNK have to be asked if they will be will they be able to travel
prepared to travel
them to do it
yes and that in a way leads me on to the next party if we're gonna have an agreement between this group or you know the other group
mhm
bit of this group and the theatre the next bit is an agreement with the UNK about who's doing what
yes
and you know okay you're gonna do this show or act three of this show on the twenty third of january and it's going to that particularly what not yeah erm
still find a UNK who are prepared
or if it was
to travel
if we were going through to glasgow UNK to
said to do it in reverse
get
you could perhaps get in edinburgh if they were all busy
what's it here or er whatever or even pick up notes from edinburgh people
yes
yeah i mean it's that kind of co ordination yeah to get that to get that right
today a co ordination job that is
can i tag a wee bit onto that
how about putting smaller theatre companies like UNK targeting certain
yes
on the tour
well we're sort of trying an experiment
iris is trying an experiment
UNK erm
seven eighty four one
seven eighty four one
yes i mean we've sort of talked about it but not done very much about it UNK of course is based on the lyceum which is something which is worth knowing erm
because at the moment i mean they're going into some UNK out like the UNK who were thinking of doing it anyway but
yeah yes i mean the situation is yes we have kind of thought about it we haven't actually done it
right
that's what it comes down to
yes
i mean the experiment that's coming up is the one week only
mhm
emergence of the oxford stage company at the moment
i personally think with these smaller of the UNK of the theatre companies who spend their life UNK more or less
mm
it would be handy for them to get
yes
their own audio UNK
yes remember
who would travel with them
with a portable with a radio systems plug in
yeah
that would make sense
that really would because i mean they
for the preparation
it's much easier if they have somebody attached to them
yeah
of course they would
they know the play they know the er act they know the whole thing
i mean this
get mentioned somewhere along the line of you know maybe you know i mean god knows how you would fund a
i know
but you know whether it would be something like you know
yes
the a one of the a s UNK would of additional responsibility it wouldn't be absolutely every performance
you can give the back up team though you can get people to hand out leaflets and that sort of thing
you can get
it may well be a volunteer who's willing to be
within the group
within the group you know or volunteer not attached to the
who's not a part yeah
the company who's willing to come
mhm yes just to go along
i mean you'd need to look at the UNK schedules and things
yes
maybe what we should do actually is before too long because of the planning involved is actually approach UNK
pull
yeah
to just say you know what are you doing sort of
mhm
yeah
doing next year for a tour what UNK plans have you got
mhm
and see if there's any anything in that cos you wouldn't be looking at doing every single village hall
no
no
but you could sort of
mm
try them
you see there's a difference as well
mm if they had someone with them it wouldn't be a problem
yeah
i'm sure it's like joining the circus i wouldn't of thought you'd have a problem getting involved in it
that's right i wouldn't
you'd be delighted to go for
mm well it depends on the UNK pattern as well because i mean something like UNK can sort of kind of do a week here or a fortnight somewhere
mhm
another group shown can literally doing one night stands
yes
around the country then you know did sort of think about that i suppose UNK can
as well
is there is there a pulling o off people's schedules just now people sort of central sort of information point
there isn't
no
that's something that we're needing
that's the problem
that's one of the things we're trying to identify of
that's what we do need yes
a way of doing that
right
but i mean certainly i think it'll be worth erm
yeah
looking at the UNK the UNK idea
erm i did the same thing the tag
as i said earlier erm i suggested to them that perhaps as they went out so much perhaps one the company would do it they sounded quite enthusiastic
right
yes
and one of the girls who i was speaking to oh i'd like to do that she couldn't for the one that we're doing
no
but erm i mean i they obviously didn't say oh no that'll be a rotten idea so
oh no
mm
i think they might look kindly on it
yeah oh we should explore that as you know erm i mean how far have do people like UNK and
erm yes so if we went to them sort of fairly soon we'd
yes
have a good idea of what they were doing next summer or whatever yeah right otherwise edinburgh erm everything is in place for the festival descriptions well everything's in place like curtain up for the lyceum description last weekend
yes
iris and i standing in the
where were you
and i thought he's not he
so what's the position in the future is it are we going to have to go through that every time or
no
or that
is that in though
now that we know
i must admit i was
now that we know what the problem is we get we're on top of it
i was UNK at your sign person because i thought we have no way of doing this for about at least two months
mm
why the night before did was i told oh you'll need an UNK and she's going to bring in one from her home her own one in tomorrow morning i thought i didn't spring it in last week anything and then that day when i discovered it still wasn't working i just couldn't believe it
oh it's
i mean i said to UNK on a friday night we'd better decide this otherwise there's no point in us coming through tomorrow mate we might as well stay at home and go to the football or something
mhm
so
that's it now is it
that's it
yeah put it on top of that one there
good great
erm
have a bit of trust
i have that was my job
you're alright on the night i'm sure you've heard that expression
quite
oh yes as they were UNK at the lyceum last week they were it were a good programme i can tell you
anyway that the last thing the only thing is of course we've missed the publication date for your
for the season
for the season
yeah
which is a pity
yeah
well that's of a one of those things
the erm we did invite UNK to come to this meeting just to report about the festival things but er she when i saw her down at the lyceum she was sort of doubtful erm just because you know
yeah
it's still the first one she's got a billion things to do we'll obviously speak to her in the autumn erm
mm that's good yeah
there wasn't anybody at the assembly hall for the national theatre well
i really was disappointed in that yeah
no blind consumers as it were so that was a disappointment
that was too bad
i mean and i mean i turned up about half an hour before the end and iris really was looking a i can confirm a picture of UNK
yeah
that's very sad
i thought it was a great pity because i mean it's er a major thing UNK
mm
one reason i was disappointed is because what it says in these minutes UNK people reported they'd been speaking to the r and abbey leisure service in london that had been considerable interest in the edinburgh festival programme and in everything
mm yes
ranging from when i went to leeds to that seminar and there were people excited about the festival and you know two weeks before the festival speaking to jane in london said oh we've had a lot of you know and i said well i'll get back to you in september and tell you
yes
and she said well i'll be able to tell you how many enquiries we've had and so you know you were expecting something you know
nobody's there mm
well at the lyceum there was one lady from the south
mhm
about
yes i remember you saying about
that they just the others are all local so at least there was one festival visitor proper
that's good yes
erm and i know they sold about five or six tickets at least next week
next week
for this the church hill but i don't know where they're from i don't know if they're local people or from the festival
aha i wonder how
one thing that we did spend i mean i don't know the festival seems to come in an awful rush this time i suppose cos
oh it does
my holiday was later as usual and longer so you know and there was a couple of other things not related to this which i'd thought of doing and it's sort of they UNK but erm we did spend time talking to UNK earlier in the year you know about publicity and i gave her lists of well such as things obvious things like playback and UNK
yes
and UNK dinner piece and i expect you did as well erm but you know she was she was talking about contacts and things like good morning scotland and all of the rest of it and i don't think any of that kind of happened
mm
mm
er i mean i'm not sort of trying to point the finger at her but
no because it may well be that they said oh we've covered audio description before nothing new
yeah
yeah that's right
we were covering some
this morning or something
yes
yes exactly and events UNK things and whatnot
i tell you what i was quite disappointed as that there was no didn't seem to be a couple of UNK up in the box office either the lyceum i could see or there's not that there's
on the day
assembly hall has a has a thing but
yeah
erm no i mean it's good to see them on they were they the programme on the fourth of november will be audio described
yeah
yes
mhm
for the visually UNK you know that kind of thing somebody booking their seat will say oh UNK mary might be interested
aha
that was the other thing i think about the festival programme which i think was a bit embarrassed about is the fact that all that information is in such UNK tiny writing
that's right
yes
which is difficult for me with my
yes
difficult for anybody
okay sight to read you know my recently tested sight and erm
mhm
oh er let alone anybody
most
yes he went and got glasses yeah
as a result of your training er
yeah
really
session
but that's that is the bigger thing
so you know the UNK something else i don't i don't know what i'm wondering is what you know what you know
can do it
what UNK is gonna come back you know
yes er
in a month's time and whenever she comes
yes
mhm
to a meeting for the group for next year you know she's gonna say well you know we tried it and nobody came
that's right
we're not doing it again i don't think she will but i mean i think we need to be sort of positive about how we are going to sort of
well i erm
build it on
put a put a very strong piece in playback this month about audio description and seeing that it you know how disappointed it is for how i've explained how much work we've put into er
yeah mm
description and that if people er don't take it up
yes
then it's likely to fall apart because the volunteers are going to give up
mm
that's right
they'll see us a play four times and then go along and no one comes to hear the description
that's right
mm
so erm i hope that might make few people visit but then as i said also in it you can't force people to go to the theatre if they don't want to
oh you can't you that's what we we're saying this morning
that's right
mm
you can take you know horses to water but
horses to water mm
you can't get them to drink it
is that
yeah but i think some works
one is transport and i said this before to you
oh yes very much yes
and this is the difficulty i'll take this away and see what i can do with it i mean there's that east end thing you know that arts erm you know
yes one
and the shop UNK well you know
mhm
and i'm just wondering if maybe we will just have to do a wee bit of work and try and get something on the go to see if somebody will
yes
UNK i don't know that i can offer transport because it's not a very easy thing you know and we need to try and do but
well we now have started this concert and theatre UNK group in glasgow and the
yes well this is what i was going to
yes that's the other side of the
that's right
they've actually started now they've got a committee of course i don't know how long it will take them to get going for them but
yes oh god
you see they likely can get a grant from the society now that they're
exactly
a proper group and er i don't know how they can arrange transport but i think that's what they're planning to do
well it's do you still have that
it'll be worth
mm
transport subsidy schemes is that still work
mhm
oh
this is some well
that's right yes
mhm
how does it work
does it still
erm you've got to go over a certain size to get a portion of the fee of paid
mm
mm
mm
this is from the arts council
i see that it's very complicated for blind people
it's complicated for anybody
anybody
absolutely
ludicrous impossible to try and organize
ah
but then
we've got groups of volunteers who take people to theatre as well as art
ah ha
i think the other side of the festival as well you mustn't lose track of is that the festival
yes it's i could of brought people through i should of been able to
the festival also chooses its own plays i mean the festival choose those three plays and whether they were the best three plays to choose
mm yes aha
you know but you would of thought the national theatre but i mean it's you know
i know
the spanish play in england
yeah
but you know
mhm
i don't know it's difficult to know
well i don't know i feel quite guilty because i think maybe i could of done a bit more but i'll certainly take it away now and i'll have a chat with some of the
mhm
maybe meet alan together rather than separately
yes
cos he doesn't you know original council but i think we should of could look inside and i
i think then
could of brought a group of people
yes i think the other side of UNK point about the theatre and concert UNK club is quite an interesting idea
yes
to run alongside audio description groups you could be
mhm
and this is something i could change my hands slightly about and come back and speak to you
mhm
for example about because you know one of the things that i've thought about for quite a long time is the idea of encouraging voluntary organizations concerned with the disability to get more interested in the arts and that's obviously what UNK is
mhm
i thought of hugh being up in UNK
mhm
yeah
er with the UNK is
mhm
taking people to arts events and getting things that way
mhm
so it's not a way of reaching people with a disability and you know that might be that kind of
mhm
you're talking about might be one way of getting
i feel sure if you offer to pick people up and take them home again you'll be you'll be UNK you won't know what to do with them
absolutely it makes such a lot of difference that's right yes
it really does and can you blame people
no
i mean i've just come through there and i had a car today and a girl was telling me her father erm opened his door last week er UNK and the wife the granny blind too and there the man from the water board was just going to switch off your water just okay if i check your UNK three hundred pounds out the house
mhm
mm
now you know they've been watching them they know they're a blind couple i mean blind people feel that vulnerable that you're asking them to go
mm
yes
out so you just so maybe just maybe i've taken a slight hard line to say no people have got to make a wee bit effort too but maybe in fact
maybe they do need the encouragement
to go back because to do this to get to this stage and find we're not getting our audiences then if that's the answer we'll just have to find the solution
mm
is there not two separate problems that we have to find them first and then the then worrying about getting people to the theatre
well i think we can find them through playback in cases like that
yes
i mean if places like that i mean if you set i mean she knows this
if you were to press this thing
if you say in playback there is an added night performance
there will be a bus
you might get a phone call if you say there's an
performance
mm
you know if you're in this area or that area we'll pick you up and take you home and the phone just doesn't stop ringing
yeah there's a bus going
you got yeah
yes
so i think there's a way of getting the blind people
yeah
yes i think there is
but it's just this all for a transport
yes
right
and what you've got to be very careful cos you can't offer them and not come up with the goods
mhm
so it's a bit trying to set up a system
it's got to be consistent as well
yes
yeah
mm but i'm sure i'm sure we can do more there you know
oh yes
i did briefly manage from
i think so of
mention this
of transport you'll get people
to
from art link erm
to do the UNK service and they do it i mean
oh yes
what he he's moving he's moving actually a bit more towards the east end model in glasgow
is he
aha
er towards actually you know for example he is targeting west
and so on but he's moving away from being a completely response lead
mhm
so that you know they sit in the office
right
and people phone up to ask being a bit more kind of pro active about it
yes
oh i see right
and his response when you're doing the audio description as well you know if the society for the blind wants to organize i mean
i mean you can organize every kind of thing why does it have to involve us
but i mean i'm sure there's a sort of there could be a meeting of the sort of ways there somewhere
mhm
erm
if we or organize the transport will you supply the volunteers
yeah i mean there could be a way of sort of coming together
mm
so maybe that's another area and that's a meeting we could set up quite easily with well with clare who runs it and erm
mhm
with er
in glasgow and that's
mhm
whose name i can't remember
neither can i
er can't remember UNK
i can't remember the guy's name either
it doesn't matter
and brought these the bloke so
so
right okay
UNK is happening is it
mhm
jane the last one
we're talking of UNK
the lyceum
yeah
is it what is it definite i mean as a regular or just the one off or what
as a regular monthly thing
mhm good that's going to happen
when oh sorry
i was going to one of the many things that i went to away last meeting with was the idea of that i've missed it this time for playback is a list a UNK kind of mechanism so obviously this is the first one
yeah
erm i was also going to use erm the erm r i b kind of format that they use for their UNK you know for their leisure lists
mhm
just because it's the style
yeah
just go and UNK that
mm
mhm
erm so it'll be useful to have the UNK dates
dates
erm
i haven't got them
and this is something i would need to
the thing is that i've been concerned for some time when it's finally helped f found for next month because
because we've got three things happening on one night
the twenty fourth yes of september
yes
three separate i mean if people from
sometimes come through to edinburgh
yeah
people
sometimes come to glasgow and either of them could go up to UNK
yeah
that's right
three in the one night i think is just
yeah i feel guilty i feel guilty about the UNK one but when i arranged
it's very silly
the UNK date with the woman from the oxford stage companies in time
with robert it was the beginning of the summer in june or something like that
yes
and i suppose i should of gone off the thursday night
it's difficult cos yeah the thursday night was a bad night any other night might of been better
but erm
i'm worried about that because we had a very bad experience in UNK before so
yeah
we really don't need it
i tried to see liz about that last week but that's anyway but
yes
to get back to the UNK i mean that's something we obviously need to think about
mhm
i've got UNK theatre dates i'll copy that you can have that if you want
oh great
erm
what is it a thursday as well
no saturday UNK
oh that's terrific
that is good
mhm so that's definitely on yes
that's ideal yes
so i think that's something
just a quick
to think about
you see i think that's what is like the
they don't tie up with you
no there okay no not at all
they don't tie up with you so you're alright
yes so we need to sort of keep on top of that one and i'm not really sure until we do get our
co UNK how we cope
well we see that's why and i did seem to go about i don't
UNK job but i really wanted to raise that this time we really have to have someone very quickly to protest call it what you like
yeah
but we're gonna have to have somebody
just to programme it
because already it's going on you can see that
well
do we want somebody who will just do cos i've got i mean i can get somebody just to do that if that's all you want done that could be done easily
mm
in UNK or print or UNK and print or anything you like put all the lists together
mm
can i say i think that's like the door closing and the horse gone you know
mm
before that
it's the bit before that
yeah i thought
unfortunately and i know and that's how much complicated bit
yes it is
and that's can i phoning round everybody keeping UNK what are you planning over the next three months aha
that's right
would it be worth having i mean
i could certainly get all those lists
you know what i mean i mean that would and that and that still necessary that's as well as that
would it be worth actually having a having a sort of a planning meeting say you know for the first half hour of one of these meetings the next one say that we have you know a wall planner you know a chart and
yeah
you know sort of say this is
but is not i mean it's too late at the moment because both the citizen and
it's too late
and the lyceum have organized it
yeah
their dates erm so happens as far as i can see only the twenty fourth of september
is appropriate
is the one
i don't know about the after the new year but that's very lucky that one
cos the other problem is christmas is one that which is coming off
christmas yeah aha
yeah
well i don't think it matters so much in with the
people
on same date because people are like more likely to go to their own local pantomime aren't they
they all go
don't they yeah
mm
oh children
so there is a problem about
you need to watch about children this year because erm because of the children at the royal blind school
oh yes
and maybe you know from glasgow whatever
the
absolutely nothing they've got it none of the audience paid things
i remember when i first went to see mrs
came over
i don't think is mrs still there
yes aha
she wasn't very keen
no she's not very keen
this was like three years ago
yeah
ah it's not terribly blind is it
she is not
this is
the children will be out of school they might even be sighted people
romeo and juliet i mean it couldn't of been a better thing for school children
wonderful that
yeah that was planned that we
yes exactly
exactly and we went to the school we told them all about it we phoned the school we kept saying
not even the older children
it's going to be on nobody not one person
oh no but i'm sure the children didn't even get
because at least all schools have wonderful
to hear about it
mm
that's a shame you know because that's the ideal isn't it remember those wee UNK things at four
that's right
all my staff were crying which didn't help
had to keep dragging them off to the toilet they'd never seen blind children you see they'd all seen adults
it's fine to be blind to be an adult but these wee UNK things and there's a little boy saying you know i was really looking forward to this is really exciting totally blind ooh
but i mean it was so good because remember the letter we got from the wee boy with the drawing
that's right
is this great big painting a mass of colours you know but a wonderful time cos it's the children you need
mm
the children are UNK audience
that's right yes
that's right yes
i'm very disappointed with that
if you get the children yes not one thing
can you not bypass mrs
no you're joking
no
surely you can bypass if you think
seems to be our fault if it's anything to do with the society she doesn't want to know
of course try jim who'd do it
he's fine he thinks it's a good idea
oh yes
he'll certainly put the information
he'll maybe do a job by putting
wouldn't bypass
by woman who went to work
he wouldn't bypass her
he wouldn't
no
i wonder if i approached her
may be a way round is the parent protected teachers
very UNK
parent yeah
yes i might approach her
maybe that's a way round
direct from
i'll have a go yes
yeah
cos she's all
mhm
yeah oh yes UNK rubbish but UNK wonderful but i think that could be true
i think i might approach her direct and see how UNK we are to get younger people interested in
that's a shame because children are really the key to this
it's a shame
they are they are the key
if you can get them going while they're at school
you know i mean this is an organization we are quite keen to get these people as well i mean their publicity
of course
yeah
yeah
machine isn't reaching them because we don't have any contacts to send
that's right
so perhaps i should
ring lucy
try and get a list of contacts or something to i mean UNK quite happy to do it and
the information we can print
yeah the whole lot
for schools you know
we can get your lists into the UNK press and the workshops i mean
mhm
that would help wouldn't it send that
maybe i could do it from the theatre would help
mhm
a different a different
a different approach
yeah
yes because it's not
it could be
a society it's not
yeah
we are we are offering this for our fund
and these were the dates
that's right yeah
yeah
that'll be super
and get the letter all UNK and everything so it goes down to the
absolutely
that's right
can UNK that for you no problem
yeah
and er she would sort of say oh and here's a theatre make a wee bit effort yes that might be the answer
that's right that might be the answer for the UNK press for the school and
yes
for the workshop
and it's directly from the theatre
what about what erm
and that's your UNK customer
mm
would it be any help for
cos i mean that's what their publicity machine is there for
that's right
that's right that's
that can be
what about
UNK easily
what about the pantomime i mean i don't like to say this but there's a society in glasgow buying tickets for the children for pantomime
yes
is there a society here like to do that
to be absolutely strictly theological in fact william UNK made a little mistake in the song because god will never ever send another pentecost
it was a once off thing
and in our english language we actually make this mistake when we talk about UNK french in some ways are for more sensible with language and you only ever have one birthday the rest of them are UNK of your birthday
and god has only ever and only ever will send one pentecost and that took place on the day of pentecost the birthday the birth of the church
there are as we've been reminded we celebrate that again today an anniversary
i've gotta confess i don't like th the expression UNK so much i prefer er the expression what it really is it is pentecost
and literally it means just fifty
that what it means and it was fifty days se seven weeks after the death and resurrection of jesus and the disciples had been told to wait in an upper room until the holy spirit would UNK upon them and you've had that record read to you from acts chapter two of just what took place on that day that birth day of the church of jesus christ
course it didn't end there
UNK are UNK not UNK
and the early church grew from there
and that experience that took place on that initial day that is the birthday of the church was not just a one off thing but as others came into the church they experienced not another pentecost but if you like their own pentecost
and we're gonna look at a passage in just a few moments in it's in the eighth chapter of acts where a group of people there they were UNK how they came in to experience their pentecost
but you know for every one of us as christians jesus christ lives in us by the holy spirit by his spirit
jesus christ when he er went back to heaven he went back as a fe as a UNK but as a physical being
that is why the physical resurrection of jesus is so important
there is a man in the glory
there is a man seated on the right hand of god the father there UNK for you and for me
it's not his spirit that's doing it is the same person that the disciples spoke to when they walked the streets of UNK it is the same person that went around healing the sick it is the same person that was born in the in the UNK at bethlehem he is now after having died been raised again by the power of the trying god had he is now UNK back into heaven in UNK form and he is there UNK representing you and me before his father there in heaven
he is there in that local situation
and just the same as when jesus was here on earth he was in one place he confined himself to a body
and he is there now in the glory but yet we say we invite jesus into our heart and he walks and we sing the song from the he walks and he talks how is it that this happens if jesus is there in heaven
well it happens and it's made possible because he does it by his spirit
now there aren't two spirits there's not the spirit of christ and the holy spirit
there's not a multitude of spirits
god is a spirit
and he is the mystery of the UNK
god the father who is also spirit
god the son who is also spirit
and god the holy spirit
and so jesus christ UNK your life as a christian and he UNK my life as a christian by his spirit by the holy spirit
we are born again by the spirit of god
we become christians through the work of the holy spirit
but the new testament teaches us that apart from that new birth by the spirit and that UNK of jesus christ in our lives by the spirit there is a subsequent experience that is called receiving or being baptized as a holy spirit
we're gonna look at this little passage in acts eight which shows to us that these UNK they were saved
they had accepted jesus christ as their as their saviour they had been born again
they were christians
they had been baptized
and yet there was something missing in their experience
let me read a few verses reading first of all from verse twelve it says that when they believed philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized men and women UNK
and even simon himself believed
and after being baptized he continued on with philip as he observed signs and great miracles taking place and he was constantly amazed
this fellow simon you read about him in a few verses earlier he was a he was a UNK a so er a UNK he was the wi the UNK doctor if you like if he was in i in an african situation there he was he was the medicine man of the town of the area and he too believed and was converted he was baptized and he was amazed at the miracles that he'd seen being performed by philip through the power of god
he was a man who was used to the UNK but he was amazed at the things that he saw
and it says now when the apostles who were in jerusalem heard that UNK had received the word of god they sent them peter and john who came down and UNK for them that they might receive the holy spirit
for he had not yet fallen on upon any of them
they had simply been baptized in the name of the lord jesus
they began laying their hands on them and they were receiving the holy spirit
now when simon saw that the spirit was UNK through the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them much money saying give this authority to me as well so that everyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit
but peter said to him may your silver UNK with you because you thought you could obtain the gift of god without mo with money
you have no part or portion in this matter for your heart is not right before god
therefore UNK of this UNK of yours and pray the lord that if possible the intention of your heart may be forgiven you
for i see that you are in the UNK of UNK and in the UNK of UNK
simon answered and said pray to the lord for me yourselves to that nothing of what you have said may come upon me
philip who was an UNK he had gone down to UNK in fact the holy spirit had taken him there
if you read a few er verses a chapter or so earlier on he had been speaking to one man to a er a high official from UNK and he had been sharing with him from isaiah chapter fifty three the message of jesus christ
this UNK he had come to jerusalem he was a he was a go a UNK man he was seeking after the things of god and he had come to jerusalem on a UNK to worship god and he was returning home and he had got hold of the UNK that had isaiah fifty three in it and he was reading it and philip goes up to the man in the UNK he said do you understand what you're reading
the man says how can i except somebody explain to me
and philip it says there he says and er he UNK unto him jesus showing him that isaiah fifty three referred to jesus christ
and the man was er accepted christ as his saviour and they went down and philip baptized in there in the river
and as they come out of the water the fa the bible says the spirit takes philip away and he goes down now to so to UNK and he starts preaching there in UNK a and there's this tremendous result
he sees miracles taking place
many folk coming to know jesus christ the saviour
it says there was great joy in all the city
and yet there was still something missing
and word gets back to apostles in jerusalem
they had heard about the blessing there they had heard about the healing the deliverance the joy yet nobody had received the holy spirit
they'd been baptized in water as we've already read and yet nobody had received the holy spirit
now as we've said earlier on the holy spirit works in the new birth and it is through the work of the holy spirit that we come to know god
that we are born again
that we become christians
jesus shortly before he left his disciples he tells them it's in mark chapter sixteen er yes mark chapter sixteen in verse seventeen it says these signs will UNK those who have believed in my name
they will cast out demons they will speak with new tongues
we are born again of god's holy spirit
this is something that god does in the verses earlier jesus says go into all the world and UNK the gospel to all creation he who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved
it's the work of god's spirit
the result of the preaching of the gospel men and women respond and are born again
they become followers of jesus
so the holy spirit works in our lives to bring us to christ to bring us to new birth
to bring us to become christians
then there is this subsequent experience which follows receiving or being filled with the holy spirit
peter tells in his first UNK in chapter one in verse twenty three for you have been born again not of seed which is UNK but UNK that is through the living and UNK word of god
so the holy spirit is at work
and god's word is used in bringing us to new birth in bringing us er to faith in jesus christ
and this is what happened here in UNK
in verse fourteen it says when the apostles in jerusalem that UNK had received the word of god and we cannot become christians without god's word
it is his word that makes us aware of our condition
that we are sinners
it is his word that makes us aware that jesus christ came and died for us that god loves us
how shall they hear the bible says without a preacher
how will they how will folk hear
how will they come to faith without the word of god
faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god
so when they hear this the apostles back in jerusalem they send peter and john down to UNK for this special purpose that they might pray for them that they might receive the holy spirit
now why couldn't philip have UNK for the people
he had brought them to faith in jesus christ
he had UNK the gospel
god had through him performed miracles
amazing miracles and signs and wonders
why couldn't philip pray for them
well of course there's a sense in which he could easily have UNK for them but at that moment in that particular place that was not god's purpose
and this is sometimes where we get a little bit you know hung up a and when we tend to make a little bit we make mistakes a lot
we have got to allow god to do his work in his way and in his time
and in god's plan at this particular moment i this was not UNK function it wasn't his job
he had fulfilled he had discharged his mission he had UNK the gospel he had seen men and women coming to jesus christ he had seen the mi miracles happening he had baptized those who have put faith in jesus and now you see it's not a one man show there was there was a UNK there was a team involved here
the apostles come down
not because philip was unable to do it not because he was incapable of doing it but here is god's purpose of ma of people working together in bringing about his will and his purposes
we've all we've gotta remember this that every one of us we have a place in god's will and plan and whilst we are in that place everything is good well there's still problems of course there are still difficulties there are still UNK but things are working right
the machinery is working correctly
but once we try to operate outside of that place and we try to do somebody else's job we try to fulfil somebody else's function then we are in trouble
then the thing is out of gear
then the UNK start UNK
there's not that smooth UNK er way of going on which god purposes and in and UNK
you see god is th i is a god of order he's not a god of disorder it's not a case of anybody doing what they like he works according to his pattern
and who are you and i to tell god what his purpose is and his UNK gonna be
he is sovereign and he will work according to his will
and he's used philip and now he i in his purpose he brings down peter a and john to have their part i in his will and his purpose at this time
we do not all have the same UNK
we do not all have the same function within the body of christ
and later on the apostle paul he UNK on this and he uses the picture of an ordinary body and he says every UNK not the same
we're not a our physical body's not made up of a multitude of hands or a multitude of feet there are feet and the feet has one function the hand has another
we don't hear with our hands
we hear with our ears
and every part of that body has a function
and the body is working well and fine when every part is doing their function
now at a pinch i might be able to walk a step or two on my hands with my feet in the air believe me it's not a pretty sight
and i won't get very far
and even if i how far i get it won't be quick because god didn't give me hands to walk on he gave me feet to walk on
and so the body works better when each part is doing it's particular function
and this isn't just true of course of our physical body it's true of his body the church
and oh when we do something else and my hands say to my feet ha hang on you can walk as well as they can let's try it
they can't
and there's UNK there's chaos
there's trouble
and so it is within the body
when i say i can do it as well as he can do it i can do that
god says no hang on you're supposed to be doing this
and it's only as we fulfil our function with the body
that's why it's so important to kno for everyone of us to know what our UNK are
that we might be not frustrated you know frustration is because i'm not able to do what i should be doing
and oh the frustration that can build up in our lives as christians because we are not where we should be or doing what god purposes for us
we do not then all have the same UNK
and so peter and john they come down to UNK
and when simon they laid their hands on the folk and god in his UNK out his spirit and they receive the holy spirit
now when simon saw was UNK through the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money saying give this authority to me as well so that everyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit
simon was not trying to buy the holy spirit but rather the ability to UNK the holy spirit
there's a sense in which it might sound rather strange i think simon was there was something in this guy that is attractive i think
he he's already opened hi up his heart to the lord there's a lot that he's gotta learn there's a lot he's gotta let go of there's a lot of his old life still there but isn't that true of every one us
it doesn't all disappear over night
we grow in grace we grow as we learn what god teaches us
and we're all at different stages in our UNK
and so simon he wants what the apostles have got
if only i could he looks back on his life and he knows the power that he has experienced
he knows the authority that he's had in that community he has seen UNK things happening in his life and through him albeit they were not of god but has been involved in UNK things
and he sees something now that to him is mind blowing
he's never seen anything like this before
he has already been constantly amazed at what has taken place through philip
and now with peter and john this is just the end as far as he's concerned
he said oh if only i had that power
if only if i had that ability
can i acquire it
can i have it
and he offers them money
he doesn't realize that you can't buy it
he doesn't realize that it's not up for sale
but oh if i might have this ability to UNK the holy spirit
but he's made this carbon thing you see it wasn't for the apostles couldn't it
peter and john couldn't do it
in the new testament there are four different words that are used to refer to a gift and the one used here means an endowment and an endowment comes not because of me but it becomes because of the grace of the UNK
i don't merit it
i don't i haven't worked for it
i've done nothing worthy of receiving it
it is the grace of the UNK
and the holy spirit god's gracious gift to us
just like salvation is not because we merit it
we don't merit it
we haven't worked for it
we can't acquire it by any other means other than receiving the gift as god the gracious UNK makes it available
wanna say a bit more about that a little later on
now these er UNK they received the holy spirit now how do we know that the UNK actually spoke in tongues
because it doesn't tell you that here
it doesn't say so
but it certainly as you read through the new testament the acts of the apostles it certainly is the norm for those who received the holy spirit that they spoke in other tongues
and we've already read that verse from UNK gospel where it says quite jesus himself says quite clearly that those these signs will UNK those who believe in my they will speak with new with new tongues
and wherever you read of this experience happening again and again you read of the folk there receiving the holy spirit and speaking in other tongues
in speaking a language they have not learned
it wasn't just on the day of pentecost
and it seems that this is the norm and there comes a time when you don't always mention the norm you don't underline it every time you don't refer to it every time because it is the UNK thing
it is the normal practice
and everybody was aware that this was the norm and so you accept it and take it for granted
it is however mentioned in most UNK in the new testament
but if they didn't speak with tongues how did simon know that they had received the holy spirit
it wasn't because their faces suddenly lit up
it wasn't because there was some weird expression that had come over them
how on earth did he know
and the only record that we have in scripture of any evidence of folk having received the holy spirit was that they spoke with other tongues
there certainly was some evidence
when simon saw that the spirit was UNK to the laying on of the apostles hands it wasn't just something he UNK up in his imagination
there was some evidence for it
there was something that with one of his sense that he could recognize
there was a physical sign
and yet in the new testament there is no other sign given
there is no other physical UNK given of the holy of the o baptism of the holy spirit other than that of speaking in other tongues
you see it wasn't their joy it wasn't just because they were UNK they had already i di expressed this joy back in verse eight at the preaching of the gospel there was much UNK in the city
there was great joy in the city
so it wasn't just the joy he was used to that this was something over and above that
and certainly as you read through the new testament and the in both the acts of the apostles and the UNK the UNK of paul in particular speaking in tongues goes hand in hand with receiving the holy spirit
now speaking in tongues is not the holy spirit and the holy spirit is not speaking with other tongues but they go together
it's an evidence
you know it's a little bit like a car log book or a registration doc document as they're called now
the log book the registration document is not the car but it is evidence of the ownership of the car
i've got the registration document because the car belongs to me
i can't drive the document around
and sometimes we make that mistake as though speaking in tongues was the holy spirit
it is but an evidence of the holy spirit
it is one of his gifts
one of his UNK one of his many UNK but it is one of his UNK
and if we've been filled with the holy spirit then we should have the evidence to go with it
there should be the UNK station if you like there should be the documentation and it certainly seems in the new testament that is speaking with other tongues it's not the only thing of course
you see it's not just speaking in other tongues there is gonna become the evidence of it as well as we grow in him
notice also that there is no evidence or suggestion that they had to wait for th for this baptism for this UNK of the holy spirit
it is god's free gift to all
that is why i mentioned those mar those remarks right at the beginning god will never ever send another pentecost the only people that god told to wait were those early disciples to wait in jerusalem until the holy spirit came and they had to wait for ten days from the UNK of jesus until the holy spirit came
there is no suggestion anywhere else in the new testament of waiting for the holy spirit
he has already been given
god is not gonna give the holy spirit again
he has given him and he has never withdrawn him
and so it's not a case of our waiting it's rather a case of our receiving
you see if i was to say to you right well i am gonna go out and purchase something i'm gonna get something and give it to you as a gift
then you have got to wait until i do that
i might go out and buy it straight away i might wait weeks months before i acquire the particular thing to give to you as a gift you've gotta wait on me giving it to you
but once i have the thing and make it available and say here is the gift that i promised it's yours it's available then all you have to do is come and take it
and any waiting any time UNK is not my fault it's not cos i've been slow in getting it i've already got it there it's all wrapped up it's gift wrapped with your name on it
any time UNK any period of waiting is because you haven't come and received it
and so it is with god's gift of the holy spirit
he does not suggest there is no suggestion in the new testament that we have got to UNK and wait and long and so on for it it's there available to receive
the apostles came down to UNK they laid hands on them and they were receiving the holy spirit
and this is god's purpose he is given the holy spirit and he has not withdrawn him
it is god's free gift to his people
harold UNK some of you will know of him and have heard of him who was er a preacher within one of the early UNK within the UNK movement in this country and one of their teachers said that to teach people to wait for the holy spirit is nothing in the world but a combination of works and UNK
you see if i were to start waiting it means i've gotta start doing something
what am i waiting for
am i waiting on god who is reluctant to give
god is the most generous UNK in the universe
he's not reluctant to give he's not slow in giving
jesus used the illustration he says you parents you fathers if your children are hungry you don't mock them by giving them a stone you give them egg you give them bread you give them meat you don't give them a UNK something to harm them you don't mock them by giving them some something they can't eat
how much more your UNK father will he give the holy spirit to those who ask of him
to those who come and receive it
notice also that peter and john did not pray that god would give them the holy spirit they UNK that they might receive the holy spirit
you haven't gotta twist god's arm to receive his gifts
he is a generous UNK
when sa they began laying hands on them and they were receiving the holy spirit
in verse fifteen when they came down they UNK for them that they might receive the holy spirit
sometimes in our praying re concerning the holy spirit we say we ask god to give but god says hang on i've already given
you're asking me to do what i've done
pray rather that they might receive
and perhaps we should exercise this idea this thought when we pray for the salvation of people
not to pray that god will save but rather that people will receive the gift of eternal life because god's made it available
he's made his forgiveness freely available the gift is there
god's gift of eternal life
and the praying is not that god will save people he's er done all that he can to save but rather that people will respond to his UNK and receive his gift
and so we see there in verse seventeen that they began laying their hands on them and they were receiving the holy spirit
the onus was not on god doing something but on them receiving
and you know if we wait for god to UNK us in the holy spirit can i suggest you'll wait until you die and still not know that experience
because god has done this he's made him available
the thing is for us to receive
to seek and receive that gift
the promise and the fulfilment let me just give you a couple of verses there in john fourteen john make er jesus he makes this statement to his disciples in john fourteen in verses sixteen and seventeen and i will ask the father and he will give you another UNK another word for the holy spirit that he may be with you forever
this is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it does not know him does not behold him or know him but you know him because he UNK with you and will be in you
and there i peter when he's preaching on the day pentecost he says this is was has happened god has done just that just as jesus promised
in acts chapter two and verse thirty two this jesus god raised up again to which we are all witnesses therefore having been UNK to the right hand of god and having receiving from the father the promise of the holy spirit he has poured forth this which you both see and hear
and so le let's just conclude our thinking and some of the things we've been looking at
a and remind ourselves that this gift of god in th the holy spirit the baptism of the spirit it is not an optional extra it's not something for super saint it's not something for special people or for certain types of people it is a not an optional extra it is god's purpose for every one of his children
amen
just as he UNK to save you so his perfect will and desire is that you receive that you are baptized in the holy spirit
i again using that sermon of peter in acts chapter two peter said to them in verse thirty eight UNK and let each of you baptized in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit for the promise is for you and your children and for all who will as many as the lord our god shall call to himself
so it is not an optional extra it's god's purpose it's god's desire for you and for me and for every one of his children
then the gift has already been given and god has not withdrawn it
there will come the time when he will withdraw the holy spirit when he will be taken out of the world but as long as the church of jesus christ is here that will not take place
so the gift has been given and has not been withdrawn
there is only one requirement of re to receiving god's gift of the holy spirit and that is the requirement of being his child
the requirement of salvation
any one who is saved any one who is a christian who is a UNK of jesus christ who has committed their life to christ who has received his forgiveness and who belongs to him any one is ready and able to receive the holy spirit
there are no other qualifications
it is a gift after all
UNK living of UNK life living a pure life they're not the criteria they're not they're not god requires that of us but they are not requirements for receiving the holy spirit
we don't have to get to a certain stage of UNK
we don't have to get to a certain stage of UNK before god will give to us the holy spirit
if that is the case then every one of us will wait till we die and we still won't know anything about this experience
the only qualification is that jesus christ has saved me and i'm following him and i belong to him
see if it depended on what i did if it depended on how good i was on how UNK righteous i am well i am righteous in christ
so all th even if you wanted to make that qualification it's there in him i am righteous
he is my righteousness and that's how god sees me through the righteousness of his son jesus
and so we are able to receive the holy spirit
we can expect to speak in other tongues as i've already mentioned from mark sixteen jesus said it would happen
and as we read through the er accounts of this experience in the acts of the apostles we find it happening again and again and again and becoming obviously the norm
now what does it do
when we receive the holy UNK what happens
what did it do to us
what does it do your life to my life
let me say straight away it does not make us UNK
ha
oh no
it doesn't make us so that UNK has no power over us so that we never sin again
it doesn't make us UNK
not at all
it doesn't give some special UNK to our testimony
it doesn't turn us into to super soul winners
great servants of the lord
it doesn't do that at all
the disciples were told before ten days before they received the holy spirit that they were to be witnesses unto him
and as we mentioned last sunday night this word witness it means a UNK it means giving one's life
being totally sold out for god
a living UNK for him
so what is it that god's give to the holy spirit to us for
it is to UNK us it's to en it's to enable us it's to er to give us that which we haven't got UNK
but what is the basic primary purpose of it
well what is god's greatest purpose for you
what is his greatest purpose in your life
it's not to make you the greatest soul winner
the greatest witness
the greatest preacher
it's not that
because by obvious reasons that can only happen to one person
greatest is the end of the line there can't be two UNK
so that isn't his purpose for you and for me
what is his purpose for our lives then
it's not to make us into some spiritual UNK like some great leader of the past or present
his great purpose in your life and in my life is to UNK in our lives the life of jesus christ
amen
now in some folk that will take special emphasis
it will make them great soul winners
in some it will make them great prayers
in some folk it will make them this or that perhaps not in every body but for some folk it will do that but his greatest purpose in your life and in my life is to UNK jesus christ to make us like him
and ultimately that will be the end of the line for every one us
we shall see him says john and we shall be like him
but we will see him as he is
and that is god's greatest purpose in your life and my life
to UNK in us the life of jesus christ
in our day to day living
in our service in our thinking in our motives to be like him
there are some folk who will talk about the baptism of the spirit and the gifts of the spirit and say oh well they're all very well and good but i would rather have the fruit of the spirit
that's a ridiculous statement
you see it's not a case of either or god's purpose is both of them
his purpose is that we might have the gifts of the spirit and develop the fruit of the spirit
and he doesn't offer them it's not an either or package it is i want both of them in your life
i want to see evidence of both of them that is my purpose that you may be like me
and he's given us certain gifts to enable us for this to happen in our lives
and one of those gifts is the gift of the holy spirit that's why it's not an optional extra
it is something that each one of needs
in our day to day living in our living in our service for him in our worship in our relationships with one another in our thinking our motives our everything about us that we may be like him
now lets just close with those words of peter on the day of pentecost it's not for other just he says it's for you it's for your children and it's to as many as there are far off right down through the centuries as many as the lord our god shall call
and who is he referring to then what does he mean shall call
not call to be special people to be baptized but shall call to be his children his followers
and so it's for you it's for me for the person sitting beside you and behind it is for every one of us
if we are followers of jesus christ then he says i want you to receive my gift
the gift of the holy spirit
and o on this day when the church UNK the coming of the holy spirit
it's not an historical thing it's not something we look back to but it's something that every one of us should be looking to as a present daily experience in our life
the bi the new testament uses the expression be being filled
and you and i perhaps we can look back to a day in our life when it was our birthday as far as that is concerned and god filled us with his holy spirit we received the gift of the holy spirit we were baptized in the holy spirit
that's great
the danger is that we look back to that and think of that
but there's a sense in which every day has gotta be an anniversary of that a celebration of that
be being filled with the holy spirit
it wasn't yesterday's experience it wasn't UNK it wasn't something just that happened twenty thirty fifty years ago it's something paul says that should be happening today
UNK
that same UNK
the tap has not been turned off
god is still wanting to continue filling his people with his spirit
well let's sing again shall we
from the redemption UNK er number two hundred and thirty
number two hundred and thirty
and this song does say that there is just one requirement from our part and that is that we want to receive
that we are UNK
ho everyone that is UNK in spirit
ho everyone that is UNK and sad come to the fountain there's UNK in jesus all that you're UNK for
come and be glad and it goes on in UNK to use yet another picture of the holy spirit we've talked of one being of fire another picture is that of water i will pour water on him that is UNK
i will pour floods upon the dry ground
open your heart for the gift i am bringing
while you are seeking me i will be found
two thirty and let's stand to sing
a word gets around the UNK is over and after the tragic experience of UNK her family her three men in her life her husband and her sons nobody starts to consider the situation again she's alone now in a foreign a strange land surely the only sensible thing for her to do would be to return to her own people in bethlehem they say news comes through that they've been a succession of good harvest well of course there was gonna be good harvest god hadn't UNK his people although they had UNK although they had done what was wrong he hadn't UNK them gods not in the business for UNK people he's long suffering he is faithful he keeps his UNK from one generation to another that he hadn't forgotten the people in bethlehem and he had sent them through and he had provided good UNK those who had remained in bethlehem during the UNK they'd only suffered for a short time perhaps enough time to bring them to their senses to bring them back to god now the suffering was forgotten as they UNK in a UNK supplying in UNK naomi on the other hand she knows want now she's suffering UNK she's suffering poverty she's suffering UNK there's nothing for her in UNK there's no rest no joy no provision nothing that could meet her needs what a pity she had wasted there those ten wasted those ten years ten long wasted years in her life now she comes to a decision whatever the cost and there is a cost she's gonna have to eat humble pie how are they gonna receive her when she goes back but she comes to that decision that no matter what it costs her she will go back to the place that was chosen for her by god her inheritance of him it always to our cost when we under value our inheritance do you remember the story of UNK and UNK and how UNK his birth right the inheritance that was his and UNK and naomi had done the same and you and i can do it so easily leaving forgetting not entering in to the inheritance that is ours in christ we do it to our own costs and so she goes through that i'm gonna go back i'm gonna take up my inheritance i'm going back home
you know sometimes the way forward is backward there are no short cuts with god if he's leading along a certain path and were UNK there's no way we can opt out of it and join the trail further along he doesn't allow it its back to where we left it that's were we've gotta get back to we can't skip an experience we can't miss any thing out we've got to go back to where we start where we were when we left the trail and naomi has to do just that to go back to bethlehem that's the way forward for her and you see because we all we always find this if we are really children of god then we can never ever be satisfied away from the will of god there's nothing else that meets our need its god will or nothing you know when we know frustration in our lives when we know sort of the these UNK and er sense of frustration there its not because god is leaving us that way its invariably cos we have actually gone out of gods will because he's will is not frustrated its satisfying can i just it will only really be headings this morning just leave us with three brief headings in this little incident that we'll read or we won't read the whole passage but its er in the remainder of the or more or less the whole of the remainder of the first chapter tha that the cost was involved and then the choices that were made and then the commitment the cost that was involved naomi had to pay something you see before she could return to naomi she had to con before naomi sorry could return er to bethlehem she had to acknowledge she'd done wrong she had failed she had UNK she had to acknowledge she had made a mistake now in fairness to naomi she did it and she UNK her responsibility she didn't try and shift the blame on to
she didn't say well er my husband brought me here because it was a decision that she had UNK it was a choice she had made as well and so she UNK her responsibility she UNK her blame and she goes to return so there was there was this sense of confession and confession can be costly when we've got to admit that i was wrong i did wrong i was UNK i went the wrong way that could be a costly mistake and er costly experience for us to go through but surely the true sign of UNK is that we do acknowledge our sin we acknowledge our failure that we acknowledge what it means to god we can't shift that blame onto somebody else then also consider not just the cost that naomi had to pay in going back but also there was a cost for UNK and for ruth as well as UNK there would be little joy for them in israel they were UNK they were strangers there wouldn't be much hope for happiness for them there would be very little UNK for them ever getting married in or UNK er in israel they wouldn't be able to worship there own god they'd be taken from one culture to another there'd be taken from one language to another what was it gonna be like for them alright perhaps whilst they were living with naomi perhaps she could pull a few UNK for them but what happens when she goes and they are left by themselves and yet it would appear that with naomi making her decision to return that they too these two daughters in law they decided to go to bethlehem with her and it tells us that they set out together but perhaps they hadn't thought it really through because their not totally committed to us and as they come towards the UNK and their gonna pass into in back into UNK with their few miserable possessions that they've gathered together naomi again considers the consequences facing these two young women UNK and ruth they continued with her as she UNK with them to go back home UNK is no place for a UNK is no place for somebody to come unless they are part of gods people and i'm reminded of again of what it tells me in the book of acts that in the early church that people were actually frightened to join with the disciples they were frightened to join the church there was no room for UNK there was no room for UNK on there was no room for those who went just because they thought it was gonna be the next the in thing to do but folk were actually frightened of joining because they knew they had to put their lives right they knew they had to live holy lives they knew that god had to be lord and master in their lives and unless they were willing to do that and be committed to him they were actually frightened of joining and one of the great weaknesses of the church today is that it becomes and it can becoming our thinking and nothing more than just something we join something we belong to something we go along to er as like a club like an association but that's not the picture we see it in the new testament it is a very exclusive body it is a very exclusive grouping a grouping of those who have committed themselves to jesus christ and that's why not every body is a member of the local church not every body who goes to church on a sunday is a member of a church to jesus christ now they know if they are but other people may not know they know and the lord knows i know if i belong to him and he knows if i belong to him other people may not i can put on the act i can look as though i'm playing the part i can go through the routine i can i can i can fool every body but he knows and i know and he knows and you know and so jesus said not every body who says lord on that day will i acknowledge and recognize and so for ruth and UNK er yes ruth and UNK it was gonna be different of course for them as UNK in UNK especially when naomi goes and she UNK with them go back home UNK is not place for UNK she knew what it had been like to be a UNK she knew what it had been like to be an UNK land in an UNK culture in a different religion with a different language she had known the UNK of it all she UNK with them go back home she prayers for them the lord bless you the lord you know be gracious to you and so on but they refused and again naomi puts it to them to please go back and UNK and she takes the counsel and advice of her mother in law but no so ruth and naomi turns and says look your sister in law's gone back she's gone home you go as well you can't do it its a too greater price for you to pay its a choice you mustn't make a decision you mustn't make your gonna have poverty your gonna have loneliness your gonna have hardship
i'm sure that ruth UNK her heart she may of made her decision lightly way back to go with ruth er to go with naomi but not now its a heart searching decision she makes the choice before her do i go back or do i go do i go on do i go back to UNK with its UNK with all the things i am aware of or do i go on into the unknown with my mother in law and with her god UNK makes a choice and she goes back and ruth had ruth says no and she makes the commitment and she says there in verse sixteen do not urge me to leave you or turn back from following you for where you go i will go and where you lodge i will lodge your people should be my people and your god my god and its those last few words that makes all the difference your god will be my god i will not be a stranger there i will not be an UNK there i will be part of your people and the only way she could be part of UNK people was for UNK god to be her god that was the thing that kept that was that was the common UNK should all of UNK people because they all belonged to
and ruth says i commit myself to him he will now be my god and therefore your people will be my people your home will be my home your UNK will be my UNK the way is clear she makes that greatest decision of her life a decision that will affect the whole of her life but its not as say a life decision is a commitment now we are always confronted day after day we are confronted to make decisions some of you make decisions and were not too committed about them and if things alter they will change our minds not just a ladies UNK to change her mind men do it as well and things happen and we think oh no well i won't go through with that i'll change my mind before its too late but here ruth she is not just making a decision she is making a total commitment a commitment that is worth time of the whole of her life to promised to be loyal to de to naomi and her UNK husband she promises loyalty to UNK race and the people of god but above all she UNK god and her willingness to follow him to the end you know this how she finishes of this commitment where you die i will die its to the end its to the end of my life i will not walk out of it and even after you've gone mother in law even after you are dead i am still committed to that decision this decision i am making today where you die i will die there i will be buried and here she sorts of puts this solemn UNK to this commitment thus may the lord to do me and worse if any thing but death parts you and me
UNK naomi realizes there's no point talking about it now the UNK has been cast the decision has been made the commitment has been entered into whatever the cost she was going gods way there was nothing more to be said about it we find that a de a decision made before god and we all make those decisions means nothing at all unless were determined to carry it through whatever the cost may be three women here make their decisions before god they make their choices naomi she chooses to return to UNK once again and enjoy the inheritance god has given her UNK she chooses to return to her own country and her own god as far as were concerned that's the end of the story but ruth she chooses she UNK her faith in the one true god she turns her back on the old ways and decides to follow gods way no matter what the cost she would of said with UNK but as for me and my husband were gonna serve god whatever the cost i dunno what'll be and she didn't know what she was letting herself in for and the i counted it although i don't know what it is i counted that cost i'm willing to pay it and jesus said that is the acid test of disciples said to count the cost and weigh it up and ruth had done that then to make their decision and because if we make a decision without counting the cost without weighing it all up like UNK you'll go back it won't last there is that choice for every one of us day by day who will we serve not to be like UNK its for us never for any body else i will serve the lord because and this is the reason for it not because you've done nice things for me i will be your saviour because he is god that's the reason for our serving god not because he UNK us because he UNK people who don't serve him blessing is not exclusive to gods people blessing god UNK across the board god is generous he's gracious he causes the rain and the sun to UNK on the just and on the UNK blessing is not the ground for serving god but because he is god that's sufficient reason for our committing ourselves to him
let's just sing shall we as we close whilst were singing were gonna take up our morning offering its number one ninety seven one hundred and ninety seven an element of commitment in this song one nine seven well stand to sing
we have received apologies for absence from er from er mr
are there any other apologies which we've received
thank you
the minutes of the meeting held on the twentieth of october have been er distributed
there is one modification er which has been drawn to our attention that is mr ian was present on that day
subject to that er amendment is it your wish that i should sign those minutes as a true record of that meeting
agreed
thank you er public petitions none have been received er other business none has been notified
questions none has been received
we therefore move to item one on the agenda which is the local management of primary and secondary schools and i call upon mr christopher to introduce the report
thank you chairman
the home manual school panel meeting erm on erm for sometime now and i think for those people who don't get to see the government
it is an illustration of how it can and should be done
because once the UNK discussion rarely does anyone sit and UNK us of having had clearly party political discussions we had a job of work to do and as a result of that job of work is in front of you now in items one and two
item one deals with further UNK and aspects of further UNK er to primary and secondary schools
the officers on part of the panel have consulted schools very carefully about the last UNK of possible delegation which might arise and the recommendations are as presented to us in red set out in section three
section three point one gives aspects of further delegation which the panel considers after consultation with schools should not be proceeded with in nineteen ninety four ninety five and justification for that is in the papers which is attached to agenda item one
it should be realised of course that this does not close the door on further delegation each year should indeed there be indication from the schools that they would so wish
section three point two deals with funding for non pupils with special educational needs
we suggest that this present system which i think many of us have doubts about should continue for practical reasons for nineteen ninety four ninety five only and for ninety five ninety six we will have the benefit of the audit
three point three has been rather involved er aspects of examining average teachers' salary costs basically will fall down given that we've had a sixty five percent return from schools and we will be able to use this year coming year the actual mandatory points in determining how delegation of salaries should be proceeded with
three point four is a small matter of deputy head whilst it would be inappropriate of course to er schools UNK should there be reduction in numbers certainly we do need a mechanism by which small reductions in numbers don't lead to a tragic and drastic loss of staff
section three point five is banking needs that er there was quite a lot of current by arrangements but opt outs use erm that's an unfortunate word in terms of education and will be allowed for those who are wishing to have alternative arrangements
the panel is still considering the divisional schools library service erm the they're very clear is at to whether these costs to the library is a fixed cost or a variable cost or perhaps even more to the point that it will need to reach the cost of libraries are fixed and variable and the UNK views both within the panel and schools about that and the panel is continuing UNK research
on that basis i have pleasure in moving the in section six of this report as shown on page five
thank you
is there a seconder on that motion
well further
i further question the policy erm which erm just mentioned the average salary issue is that we want erm that's gonna cost us a million pounds next year but we are doing it so there's a million pounds in growth in everybody's er budget and basically everybody's budget when we come to later
erm on school libraries we're thinking of maintaining school library service and be as be as fair as possible for schools that are different sizes that i have erm that i have erm doing that
agreed
agreed
agreed
agreed
thank you
we move then to item two the management of the schools nursery and special schools erm
this is er mostly by
thank you
erm the speed with which we dealt with item one is encouraging or rather it's somebody might be but item two again maybe if proposals which perhaps er a little controversy
there are two separate issues involved here first of all there is the issue of nursery education we have no statutory obligation er to devise scheme for the delegation of nursery schools
nevertheless
failure to do so would cause them problems
first of all nursery schools would be dealing with the county council on a different basis from the vast of the schools population and that will give rise to UNK and UNK which would be UNK and secondly there might be problems particularly if they are considering expanding nursery provision between nursery schools and nursery classes in primary schools
both of these can be avoided by UNK nursery schools on a similar basis to the delegation which was made for ordinary schools and again you consulted about that and the proposal laid in this report
and as for all special schools there is an obligation to provide a scheme for local management of special schools with effect from april this year er we consulted there was a little bit of chasing which had to take place in which you can see in section four of the report but following that chasing we now ascertain meeting schools on favourable proposals for or against and once a week that a view of and also undertaking as you know
on that basis i will propose happily to suggest that those in section six of this report
and i second agenda and erm we ask for your attention to para three point four er which is the financial part of this budget really and it says that some UNK in nursery schools should be increased erm that it is actually allowed for in the later budget erm the tax payer budget will be
er mr
yes chairman erm i'm i should like to draw attention to the paragraph three two and wonder what happened to three because er we see it goes from my copy goes from three two to three four so er i don't know whether there is anything in three that i have forgotten but i assume now that i which they're are two other
erm may in fact find in reading the application of formula rather difficult to cope with because they're very special circumstances and of course the small nursery schools
erm if there's if there's a query then indeed i three might be one of them
the effective speech
is there an added speech in what you are referring
sorry yes i i'm a very i'm two appendix b
appendix b
b er c
er but there isn't three
erm other than UNK the erm all solutions were made available to members of the panel as an appendix to the reports to the policy panel er but that they won't to all members efficiency but were made available
that's not the point
there appears to be a in as much as there is a section there is appendix b as the three two o three
UNK error next business
i am assured that it is just a UNK error
they would say that wouldn't they
we are after all teaching these children to count
which children
money that motion has been added to
agreed
thank you very much
it seems that you all want to hurry on to item three a erm as far as the timetable is concerned
erm is going to make certain UNK which we'll start with and is going to introduce the report and then to give some explanations
after that we shall move to the three motions and there will be one debate on all three motions
chairman er i have a petition that i have been asked to present er at what point do you wish me to do that
i suggest that is er brought maybe before the motions immediately before the motions are put erm after the motions after the debate as one debate i am proposing not later than twelve forty five to call for the winding up erm speeches by the three UNK of the motions and to take the votes erm prior to lunch
if necessary lunch will UNK an UNK
thank you er may i then ask if would er give UNK on certain items
thank you mr chairman i just want to cover three areas
the first one has already been mentioned and relates to the actual average salary
the second one is in relation to the sheet in front of you headed school meals and third area erm is the UNK errors on some resolutions to take you through
as far as the actual average salary is concerned if you look at page nineteen paragraph k a white page on your report page nineteen paragraph k and there you will see that you're promised an audit report on the position relating to teachers' salaries i can confirm that the position is consistent with the remarks that were made earlier on cos you have within the budget here sufficient money to provide for our current estimate of next year's actual earning salary in these schools
we have returns so far from sixty five per cent of the schools and we expect to have the remaining schools before the end of the month i wouldn't expect it to change from where we are at the moment but if there was a significant variation then i will be in a position to report back to the policy committee at the end of the month but i'm not expecting that need be the case
the second area relates to erm school meals and you have in front of you an UNK sheet the sheet UNK two areas of er change relative to erm in the main report
firstly i am reporting to you that there has been in the current year additional efficiency savings over and above those that previously anticipated er at the level of two hundred thousand pounds and so we are assuming in the budget erm that those can continue into ninety four five and thereafter and then we'll see the resolutions have been amended to take that into account and the text of the UNK sheet explains how that's been done
appendix ten which is attached to the UNK sheet it's the seventh page you'll see there that you've got in front of you all the figures that were really erm concerned with in favour of the and amend er the report on lines fifty four a and fifty four b showing two hundred thousand pounds savings on school meals and you will see that reflected in the columns headed conservatives labour and liberal democrats and those are consistent with the resolution papers that are in front of you
another aspect of this change is the erm the change in line fifty eight where the business and saving in the current year carried forward has been increased to seven nine one from five nine one you can see in the report and you will see that
operated in the new appendix ten
the second aspect of the school meals changes are with that alternative meal saving and would best be introduced erm if members were to decide that this is the way we wanted to go from april ninety five rather than in UNK september ninety four as suggested and attached to the report and that delays the savings but UNK the same saving but not until nineteen ninety six seven and you will see that the figures have been amended and to take that into account and that's on line fifty four b appendix ten
the third area i need to take you through is some erm UNK amendments to the resolutions that you have in front of you so if you just bear with me i proposed to go through those and perhaps if you want to mark them on the sheets as i go through and if i'm going too fast erm just wave
the first erm resolution sheet that you have in front of you is a pink one erm so the labour group there are no UNK errors on the pink sheet
i have to say these are documents in terms of the addition
erm the next erm feature is the yellow one for the liberal democrats there's one liberal democrat UNK error and that's on the second page four of the resolutions and you'll see that in the second column there's a total three five that should be amended to sorry three five that should be amended to three one five and then where it says nine the resource budget immediately below that nine four five ninety four five o it's three hundred and sixty thousand three hundred and sixty million six hundred thousand that stays the same
the figure that is three six one nine two o should be changed to three six one seven four o
yes
is everybody with me on that one
again the appendix ten figures reflect the actual position all we're doing is UNK the resolutions and turn to the blue sheets
there are dozens
and the first UNK error on the blue sheets is erm item six f
the first figure for section eleven should be three eight rather than three four and the two totals at the bottom of paragraph six should read three one o eight and two nine three zero
they're academic anyway
turn over the page to page six paragraph eight item d eight d strategy the UNK is a hundred and six and it should be one five six
god
and the total should be one three six in that column
crap
and that's it thank you very much
thank you er paul erm i'm now ask er to introduce
county chairman i'm pleased to present to the committee the report of the head of finance and myself on each resource budget in nineteen ninety four
i think i should start by UNK the process through which we have gone in order to prepare this report has been somewhat different this year from that which we followed in the past and
on past experience
there has been more expensive consultation with head teachers and the governors than has been possible er before and i hope the result of that it is reflected in the pages that you have in front of you
i am grateful both to the education UNK who put a great deal of time in order to carry out erm their UNK towards this report and to and to take part in the consultation exercises and to my own colleagues
erm the fruits of that work will be revealed in the decisions that are made er later on today
i am not intending to go through the report in detail erm but i hope that i we will now need to draw attention to one or two issues erm which are of particular concern and which emerged through the consultation process
first of all the issue of increasing pupil numbers
i am sure that we are all delighted that numbers in schools are now rising because it can be a very difficult situation in which to work when er a head teacher and governing body find themselves trying to manage a continuous decline
at the same time that does create pressures upon the school and in particular it creates pressures upon you in terms of finding the money in order to ensure that those pupils are UNK adequately
you have therefore erm a proposal for a figure of over five million pounds to meet the demands of increased pupil numbers er next year and of course that will be a continuing pressure for the future
secondly i know that this committee has over a time been concerned about the resource needs
of primary schools
we've all been aware of the extent to which the local management formula er has made clear erm the rather er significant difference between the UNK of pupils in their families primary education and their early years of secondary education
i hope you it will give particular attention to that issue er in your UNK deliberations later this morning
nursery education is an issue
which is being drawn to your attention i know over again a number of er months and years
UNK position on nursery education is a good one by comparison with very many other local authorities including many counties
it is an area to which the county council has given priority in the past
that does not change the fact that as far as parents are concerned if there is no nursery school or nursery class available to them then for them there is no provision at all and i know that you will want to address the question of whether you can find additional resources for nursery education er in the course of the debate
i would also i think put in a word for the work of the joint po policy panel erm which is shared between this committee and the social services committee because it seems to me that it is not for us to be thinking that there is a group of children for who nursery education is necessary er or desirable and a different group of children for whom something else erm is necessary and desirable largely because of their parents' position
we do have to look at all our pre school children as a group who have similar means as they grow and they learn and they develop and i hope that we can continue to push for a co UNK approach to the whole range of services that we are o offering to that group of children and to their families
thirdly special educational needs has been an issue for this committee in the past and will no doubt continue to be an issue in the future
we are continuing to experience a significant er pressure from schools in terms of requests for form assessment and UNK of children with special educational needs
in the current term we are receiving requests at the rate of something like twenty five per week and of course that has the implications both in terms
of handling them through the through the assessment and UNK process and it has implications in terms of finding the resources to support those children once the statements of provision are drawn up
you will not therefore be surprised to see a number of items in er the budget report which relates to special needs issues
it is an attempt to ask you to consider to maintain the sort of progress that we have been making erm in past years but it's a problem is not going to go away
at the present time it is being UNK of course by the er effects of nineteen ninety three education act with all that act implies or UNK up er many of the processes and procedures that we follow in dealing with special educational needs we have a host of new draft documents for consultation from the department for education
many of them received just over christmas and parents and schools are looking to us to give them help er in providing for what is a very rapidly moving situation
section eleven grant you have discussed with this committee on a number of occasions
i know that the concern is shared right across the committee about the implications of the reductions which the government is proposing in section eleven grant
i think i told you some months ago that i would be asking you to consider that
in the course of your budget debate and er true to form i've brought it in front of you this morning
the need to prepare schools and help to help schools prepare themselves for the erm review of the national curriculum the changes that they will have to deal with and in particular i think erm to help secondary schools to come to terms with changes in key stage four and the likely erm opportunities there will be for a more UNK curriculum including eventually er the opportunities for more UNK programmes in schools and to assist schools
to build on their own interest and commitment to erm deliver improved pupil UNK at sixteen and at eighteen nineteen in response the national education and training targets is an area which should not be forgotten
a number of these things that i have already raised this morning are perhaps are er primary phase issues rather than secondary but we must remember that the pressures on secondary schools continue as in the primary phase and finally another concern which you are all very well aware of and which particularly if you're governors you will have drawn to your attention constantly is erm the continuing concern about our educational building stock both in terms of its UNK as regards the size and the capacity of the accommodation at where some schools are concerned its need for repair and maintenance work and its need for UNK to meet the new demands of the curriculum
er you have er a substantial er appendix within your er agenda papers which set out proposals from the UNK policy panel which would help you to deal with some of those issues
i shall be very brief and simply mention that
a number of the savings erm and the increased income that is available to avoid savings are the result of your own policies developed over a number of years and i hope implemented with a degree of further manage managerial action which has actually given you some money to spend erm which will avoid you having to make er painful cuts in order to fund a new growth and in particular i would highlight the significant movement that has now taken place children from special educational needs provision outside the county back into the county
erm th the reduction in the cost of UNK awards which is partly the result of the policies that are partly also changing the in the national situation and increased recruitment funding and in an area into which officers put in a great deal of time to try to make sure that we do the equivalent they should be getting
it is a relief i suppose today that i am able to speak to you on the basis erm of financial output which is a good deal more favourable than we expected even six months ago
indeed i think we frightened some schools six months ago erm not by any means er wi UNK if er because we all thought that the financial situation might be very much worse than it is
even so the range of
pressures that this committee faces and the need to try to balance out the UNK of needs across a wide range of interest groups and a wide range of er pupils and schools means that your decisions are never easy
you need also a course to be provident for the future in terms of ensuring that you will be able to continue to discharge your responsibilities in years to come
it won't be easy erm but the decisions are now for you to make
thank you chairman
thank you er
erm the john is now are going to explain certain aspects of the er
thank you chairman
i just want to draw attention to three major components within the committee report
erm the first is the base resource budget which is set out on page four table one
the base resource budget started
with the ninety three four budget of three hundred and forty two and a half million and er through the addition of certain growth items most UNK that requires the UNK for the additional pupil numbers we establish a base resource budget there of three hundred and fifty nine and a half million
a seven million growth over the current ninety three four budget
the second area of the report which i would want to draw your attention to is that area concerned with growth and savings and a number have put forward in sections seven eight nine and ten of the report that on pages six seven and eight and it's got within those growth and savings that we can work to the target set by the policy committee
the high target of three hundred and sixty two point two million and the low target of three sixty point six million
then thirdly i would like to draw your attention to the report of the capital programme er policy programme
where they're putting forward a recommendation for a number of minor and major building projects within the capital guidelines and those are set out in appendix er appendices five and six
finally attached to your report er there's appendix ten which is the a three sheets
the first sheet has not been changed and the first sheet shows the base resource budget which you are being asked to recommend on line twenty one and then it shows a number of savings which can be achieved through efficiency and volume changes
if those are then accepted you have a second sheet to appendix ten which has been er modified and which has been circulated just prior to the meeting
that sets out the growth of the savings and which it contains in the report with paragraph and appendix reference numbers on them and it sets out for each of the groups their proposed budgets
it is from that sheet that the figures were UNK on to the erm on to the pink and the erm blue and the yellow sheets which have been circulated and which have been amended so that the figures now UNK on both sheets
thank you
next i was going to ask before erm are there any questions of fact i don't want anybody anticipating the debate but are the any questions on fact
mr martin
erm er chairman may i ask a question on paragraph four and appendix three that's on page four and appendix three on the increased percentage on school milk charge
i see that percentage is quite high way above the in the in the inflation figure er at seven point five per er percent
and i wonder if i could have an explanation for the reason for that very high increase
the er percentage is identified at the top of appendix three UNK one of appendix three
er let me come back on that issue the er
right well the e c have cut their grants of all school milk i think you'll find certainly on that being discovered i would imagine that it's similar to the county council
thank you
may i ask er mr that it would whether she would now er pass forward the petition
erm i gather you wish to just present the petition
yes
at this stage but you wish to speak during the debate
tha that is right chairman i have a petition from the UNK indian association containing seventy five signatures
