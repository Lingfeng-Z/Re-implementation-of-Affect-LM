er it is about the future provision of section eleven which appears in the main report you will no doubt appear as part of the budget debate
i think you can see if you look at the er around the chamber at the amount of interest that this er has UNK and the header referred to the number of other petitions and er letters that have been received
therefore this time i will just hand it to you chairman and er reserve my rights to
thank you very much
thank you
i acknowledge this er receipt of this petition and i'm glad to see the er support of the present will change
er i understand that er
mr is now ready to respond to the questions
yes well erm it isn't the effect of the changing er e c grant that's elsewhere in the budget and legislative changes item with the increasing cost there er if you can change the grant or for instance where we're getting less grant from the e c
what it is reflecting the intervention crisis of milk
oh
the cost of milk undoubtedly
going up
it is increasing the price in line the increase in cost of milk
so just that further clarification if i may we are passing the increase er cost of milk on in the charge that we're making
yes
thank you
right now to read er we first call upon labour er bob to move the motion standing at the erm
give them some UNK but i don't think i'll do that erm
sorry erm this budget has a very long UNK period er i'm on version twelve i think at the last count and i hope there isn't gonna be a version thirteen
erm i ought to thank everybody erm officers members head groups service groups unionists petitions and all who've written to us
we've taken all this into account erm i'm not sure all groups have tried to do that erm but we have tried to please everyone we do have some particular priorities and we do want to make significant improvements in service where we can and not necessarily looking for cheap publicity by increasing in lots of places as some people are supposed to of done so where one concludes sometime a significant amount of money in but will have a UNK difference to their essential service
i am going to go through the pink sheet i think that's easiest if i do that erm on the top of your pile
first the base budget an this and return to give increase the expenditure is the five million pounds or so needed for the increased number of pupils
now we're meeting that in full and i'm glad to see that all three UNK groups er proposing to meet that in full
of course last year that didn't happen and last year hidden away in the first part of the er the budget papers was this cut in the amount of money going to each pupil erm in education in secondary school so this year we are not doing that we're going to meet the full cost of so in that sense the formula will be unchanged and of course there's growth er later in the budget and both primary and secondary schools in terms delegated budgets
we've have already mentioned the million pounds extra for salaries
there's another cost of a million pounds which results from a change in government policy of the cost of government policy now this is including the er unfair funding of g m schools and including the loss of that was just mentioned
now another of those things will be increased service that's stand still that's the best way to stand still
there are other elements later which UNK improve the UNK pension for each pupil
erm well that base budget is rather higher than we are expecting and the time when the policy committee set its targets for each of the service committees
it's about eighty million pounds higher than we were expecting it
so whereas the policy committee were allowing us three point five million grant maximum on top of the er base budget now course that's reduced because with cash limited to the total on to the base plus so getting a lot less than with the group so they might say increase to about two and a half million rather than the figure we had earlier
so in net terms we can have maximum we won't go to this in the current till next year erm two and a half million pounds of growth
that's roughly about the same hours as the government's just decided to spend on sending the parent's charter to every household in britain i think that's gonna cost over two million as well
erm the government's there are telling parents what they ought to do
this UNK er which is government policy these days erm is costing them same amount of money they're actually spending intending increasing erm education division
i use the phrase UNK because i know jim is sitting there with a tape recorder and taking note of all the words we are using today our dictionary so i think the phrase UNK i said three times in relation to
in relation to the conservative party's current policy back to basics and all that i think is the appropriate expression to bear in mind
erm okay let me go on now to er the next section of the er resolution which follows the report in terms of savings erm in para seven of that seven and para eight
now all groups have savings
erm another piece of that service on the great wall of justice around this morning erm i the officers to take certain elsewhere
moving on to the row on paragraph eight again all three groups are agreed er on this except with one i think exception of a certain group
er no one exception it is to not allow appropriate expenditure on section eleven
erm both the labour and the liberal parties erm think it's extremely important that we maintain this provision for the curriculum pupils who might wish to have petition early and we will maintain in full so the current level of provision under section eleven will be may next year which puts a large sum on the money into that this is growth in expenditure the making up of government cuts increasing the money we're spending it's not increasing service it's simply continuing the current policies but it will continue as it is now
er against the cost of government changes so this last part of this budget is actually the cost of making up for government cuts and section of and we're disappointed that conservatives decided to cut the section they were funding for next year
i don't know how much they're cutting it but the figures change again today no doubt
er so let me move on then to erm the growth areas
well the growth area section in ten part of that is again maintaining this level of service er so if i move on to er the savings under paragraph nine bottom of the pink sheet
i'm going to say a word about the efficiency savings on school meals and the proposal from the conservatives bringing this alternative meal system
now we couldn't do it anyway next year we'll have to do it the following year as we've heard earlier
erm now i'm interested in this proposal so i tried that on my daughter last
this is erm the menu this is the menu of which erm is being used in some UNK as an experiment in some schools you have fish fingers one day monday beef UNK then hot dogs wednesday UNK fish thursday and turkey jackets on friday
erm with very little choice now i gave this to
my daughter who's sixteen and also her school mates and she said well where's the beef UNK
where's the beef so i'm dubious about this in terms of quality of UNK in terms of choice being offered and i think we need to look a lot more closely at this before we jump into agreement change or in the system
it couldn't happen anyway in the next financial year it'd have to be the following financial year
now i think that the whole school meals issue not just this but also the way in which cost savings are being achieved at the moment in schools
erm needs looking at by members
we need members need to get a grip on what is happening and my wife suggests this that the panel erm rather than setting up a new panel look at the whole issue of school meals this and other issues
i'll get a load of erm in some ways
as long as the UNK is kept as long as choice is available as long as they're popular with kids then erm it might not be the
okay so i was on savings at the bottom of erm the sheets
er we are grateful to the education department for finding this two hundred thousand and er the
certain departments save as well one of the payments i'm sure and again it's not a direct cut in the short places
so growth savings in terms of erm provision in educational service direct
so i can now move on to the next page which is the growth we're proposing given the saving given the splendid things that are allowed by the erm by the
now there are four significant areas
first
there's total here of a million pounds in the er next financial year when er part inland revenue and part of
which will find well in excess of a thousand extra nursery places
now all is quite clear in the consultations certainly the one we have with the heads whilst that they didn't want to continue the previous policy of expanding their tradition by increasing class sizes
we are absolutely clear on that it came over quite clearly from heads the previous policy of increasing class sizes and therefore not spending any more money but claiming we're doing a lot for nursery education the previous policy erm was not one which they wanted to support
if we're going to increase nursery provision we've got to do it by putting money where our mouths are huh putting our money where perhaps some conservative government UNK mouths are as well and they're all very keen to will the ends but they're not so keen to will the means anyway this is the means there's a million pounds here erm next year we effect and other members can speak about that and the work that they first have erm i do notice that the latest report from the erm commission on education and the book we all had to read does give us this first priority er provision in nursery education particularly in areas er deprived areas
if you read that er book er from the commission you will find their very first goal is in relation to nursery education in deprived areas and the panel's looking at that looking at indicators of deprivation as well as erm the
moving on let's have a talk about the primary school budgets we're proposing a million pounds here for primary school delegated budgets er we assume that the schools have used that largely by non contact time for the teachers
er we can't tell them how to use the money we presume they will do that erm this is a significant increase on the amount that the conservatives seem to be suggesting which is just i think deputy heads so there are a hundred and forty thousand er deputy heads to go
er moving on UNK
er the next big area again there's another million pounds in total for special educational needs erm and provision for pupils so if you add up
section c that's the to schools of budgets and the included that comes to another million pounds sum of budget
now we notice that whilst the other groups are agreeing the officers that we actually buy sports
they're not putting money into delegated budgets now i was a teacher a head teacher and i was told that the erm the essential the educational departments finding more money for devices and to give advice to school now they're all unnecessary as it is i would say we are the ones that carry out the job we're on the ground we've got to do it
huh it's not good helping us to do it we need money to do it within schools so we are proposing an increase in the delegated budgets of both primary and secondary schools special educational needs
that's about five per cent on the current six million pound allocation which alone is based on free school meals should make a future upon the special needs audit
moving down i am not going to comment on the conservative resolution erm there's all sorts of cuts in there and lack of growth i am going to ignore it actually the tories are so far out of touch huh on erm both nationally and locally totally out of touch with what people think and that the government will obviously UNK we all know that but i'm surprised and disappointed the conservative opposite are also out of touch and the figure is way out from both the liberal and the labour way out and with all the consultations it's had
the they're cutting everywhere and they're growing erm
i am not going to bother with a certain group
like attack
i don't necessary
erm so if i move on then now to eight d which is forty the fund we have written into the resolution huh let's be clear about that
erm how we want that fund to be distributed
we discussed this at the panel and they
proposed that we should in effect give the money to erm a non county body involved in this to allocate to work out both the basis of the allocation and the allocation funds in this order we think that's inappropriate if we're putting up money then we should also have the responsibility for allocating them among a until the done and the done so i'm at all or whether our council or something to be set up in the future should have equal control of that money
erm i've given a zero for all the effects because they of money erm if it i if this idea works well then we consider that growth next year as well but to be prudent wh why didn't you justify the service environment rule to be prudent erm i have assumed that will be a proper effect and therefore i'm not assume the potential of next year's base budget
i would like to think mr that you are coming towards the end
oh yes
here
can see i'm
erm the next item is similar to that education which i shall speak to you later and then erm at the moment
on a couple of programme we put some money into this er together er more er we notice that the conservatives haven't i think that's all i want to say on that
erm now in general terms this budget keeps within policy guidelines and i am grateful to environment committee for sticking to their lower level and help us out as mentioned yesterday
the labour group will keep within the government capping limits obviously we will and therefore the council tax increase is getting no more than about four percent so you can't claim all this growth is gonna well it certainly can't count all this growth is going to er with this ma massive increase in council tax
the average council tax payer the council tax can't be more than around four percent erm which reminds me of the last miracle budget we had ninety eighty nine i think it was again a labour budget which i think was three point nine per cent increase then and the lowest rate of increase for twenty years erm and the highest level of growth erm
erm again if any of the increases under
the tories cut it as soon as they got back in power
we're putting it back again and this time we're gonna make it stick
yeah
just to conclude this is the best budget UNK had for many years it's good news for schools it's good news for council tax payers and mostly importantly it's good news for pupils and i hope you'll accept that
thank you is er anyone prepared to second that
thank you
and now we call upon er paul to present the er liberal democrat er
yes thank you chairman i hope to be slightly er more brief erm in proposal of the liberal democrat budget of er three six o point six million which i would remind with your permission is the er the minimum target er suggested by
er i think we must remind ourselves that er this year's as i say is by no means er generous and for that reason we're not aiming higher not because we wouldn't like to but because we recognize the restrictions placed from elsewhere
i think this is one of the chairman because there was so many horrendous forecasts in the summer and autumn about the s a that when it was announced you know we thought it was goods news and of course it wasn't erm so this is why they're trying to be prudent and we have kept in our proposals to the erm has already mentioned that er thank god the er democratic growth has been covered this year and so on erm plenty of other things that we would like to see erm to comply with the government's own legislation erm but they where with all
i would like to extend my thanks also to the officers who have worked er very hard er both sides of the christmas
er i think i am on version ten i don't know whether that's one or two more than but er the officers have worked very hard and i'm very grateful to them erm i'm also very grateful to the primary heads secondary heads their own staff associations and the representatives of the governors for whom hilary bob and i have met and er we've listened very carefully to what they have to say and we've done our modest best to er to er use their priorities as well as our own perhaps political one we've looked at the educational value er i suspect more than the other two groups erm than the political sum
erm i have thought that the same is listed in paragraph seven er and the growth of paragraph eight were non controversial and er would have received all party support but i
er but of course i must say something about section eleven funding this whole section under funding er is er UNK in this section and er i'm not too sure what the tories are playing at er unlike bob i am not going to condemn them out of hand now being a democrat i want you to hear what they have to say and then we'll UNK them this afternoon
erm and while we're talking about er
conservatives this government has UNK some UNK things
in recent years but among the worst must be the reduction by the home office of taxable funding
here
not because they granted its continued necessity your UNK will continue providing someone else pays
they say they can't afford it we say that we must afford it
not from the space of pity of certain members of our community or even of UNK but purely from investment and common sense
if we fail to help these children now they will not be able to contribute to the social economic UNK of the nation and may cost us in time more social and financial in the future so it's good investment we're friendly with them we do UNK them but it's only common sense and good investment that we fully UNK that the to the level it shouldn't be er by the home office that is to replace fifteen percent o of seventy five i think seventy of
assuming there is a majority if not unanimous approval for savings in both in paragraph seven and nine analysis in paragraphs eight and ten
i'll try to make it brief because bob has er mentioned this and has pretty well er all party support to the savings er the reduction of two percent in the erm it's not quite UNK but following the er drastic restructuring of the of the department in the last two or three years is quite significant erm er i and i think that er we must thank the director of and er UNK if you like because in 's report erm th these erm the savings
erm there's enough i think enough has been said on school meals it's those they're only in the both were identified with efficiency savings of er joanne erm in school meals without i hope because in the content or the UNK value of the basic meal
here again i've got to reserve comment er on what the tories are proposing for next year erm you know once you condemn it out of hand we like bob says he's got an open mind and i'm glad to hear it er we also have an open mind on this but we we'd like to hear more er of what's in the debate before we before we comment
er so with these three measures plus the seven hundred and one thousand estimate er UNK th this year to carry forward we have er about a million and a half to use against er further grant and of the options listed in section ten er ours are not UNK from the er from and i best pick the
erm we have we the liberal democrats have made no secrets in of the fact locally and nationally that er within the nursery places are our top educational priority
er mr major UNK it's his but mr UNK if i understand mr UNK rightly says the country can't afford it so here again if they can't afford it i certainly can't county must afford er at least the six hundred and thirty five thousand which is in our proposals er that will be nine sixty five in a full year to find nine hundred and twenty extra places
we've been precise on this because this is if you look at your agenda papers er quite detailed suggestion one of the UNK one of the options er in fact that we the same about officer's erm nine twenty er the basis er is erm a very near to the that's thirty five including capital er we had to go fur further obviously and but we picked the labour figure er and i wonder a little because the advice we have is that once we go over nine twenty places become much more erm unfortunately costly
our next priority like er labour says like a the different degrees is er the primary schools er many of which as we all know that we've been struggling and to cope with inadequate budgets
we propose therefore to increase delegated funding fund the schools by one point one million er approximately four and a half thousand per head average per school
er coming next to our priorities on special educational needs erm i attended a and conference as recently as last saturday and i didn't know it all already i did er i am now determined that
we will do all we can for well especially at the centre and while whilst UNK the need for it to resource at the schools at this conference the voluntary agencies parents and even teachers admitted the greater need for specialists at the centre that is we want more education UNK advisors of all sorts and er therefore supporting options er at ten one c small roman one and small roman three on the agenda but er that is UNK not er not small roman two
this means that erm four hundred and ninety thousand extra in addition to nine hundred thousand in paragraph eight
erm i know the UNK have also has gone for one three and not for two
er i assure you there's been no conclusion on this and i am sure will agree with me
here
erm the rest of arbitrary proposals maybe considered small comparison in financial terms at least but er differ a little if any in educational value that's two hundred thousand to boost the fourteen and nineteen strategy er i think there must in the present climate in which we have to regard the UNK content of education as well as the academic
two hundred thousand to improve the provision for extra pupils here again er lot's come out of er the but er ministers wax UNK about what we should er do about this mounting problem of erm of er UNK exclusion discipline in general erm they tell us what to do they tell us er we must have er referral units and what have you but then UNK give us any funds to do the job but i'm glad to say that all three party agreement that er that two hundred thousand or so it to improve the er the service for extra pupils
erm we must recognize
that the to cope with the expression on that there that erm we must fund this referral unit erm coming last to capital erm many of school buildings are in an UNK and UNK position through neglect over many years before er we've given perhaps erm but our UNK a hundred and ninety thousand er i've i admit won't go very far
er there and er it's therefore er the best use we can make of it not specifically for any particular school in any particular circumstances as i read in the that the that the tories proposals have been in on the issue
erm i don't think i need to say any more but i promise to come back later when i've heard what other have to say
has already said that the tories don't seem to have any provision for capital and i'm dying to know why they have as much to say about the additional buildings as anyone else er i'd be interested to know what they say
so finally mr chairman i command this modest liberal democrat budget to your committee in the hope not too optimistic er receiving all party support but i feel it would be considered too modest by one and too UNK by the other which suggests to me that the moderate UNK er will got this about right i move
thank you
may i ask for a seconder for that motion
yes i'll second it er and i reserve my rights
thank you
i have now of course gone er mrs birmingham er to present the conservative motion
thank you chairman erm i'm delighted to be the last person to present a set of budget proposals as it gives me the opportunity to draw attention to some facts that seems to have been UNK by the representatives of the other two groups
indeed i believe there's a distinct possibility that the force of persuasion in my arguments will bring the other two groups over to the conservative point of view
optimistic
mr may not attack conservatives
but of course that doesn't leave me much to talk about UNK however he managed to go on for about ten minutes
that all
because the labour and liberal democrat budgets as far as i am concerned are UNK dum and UNK very little to choose between them
labour make proposals and the liberal democrats in effect say
now clearly we are not going to join the need to exercise because chairman no one has mentioned or drawn attention to the fact that the UNK to the budget paper contains a very distinct warning that in addition to the estimated resource gap in nineteen ninety four
whether it's nineteen ninety five which is relatively small it UNK to a potential sixteen point five million fourteen point five million minimum in ninety five ninety six and to twenty seven point two million in ninety six ninety seven
even if those figures are reduced by the two million each year that leaves a very large financial mountain to climb in the years ahead and i apologise for beginning with that UNK but it does get better thanks to our proposals
the chief education officer sorry director also contain these UNK in her introduction she reminded us that we would have to discharge our responsibilities in the years to come she reminded us that decisions are never easy and she reminded us that we need to show that we are capable of firm managerial action
now i see no evidence in the er proposals of the other two groups of those qualities there i do not see coherent form of covering for the UNK that we could face and i see a real UNK to indicate how they would tackle priorities
that has always been the case we have always been UNK for doing it but i find it UNK this year
our budget reflects our commitment to our schools it aims to improve the level of service to our schools particularly in the area that's been identified the schools themselves by the schools themselves as one of their UNK their highest priorities that was special needs
we also aim to prepare more four year olds for full time education and we aim to provide incentives to schools that wish to UNK the fourteen to nineteen curriculum
we are also able to fund this year this very substantial increase in pupil numbers
this isn't always possible as we saw last year and as we have been reminded that was not an easy decision and in fact it's one of the reasons that we haven't put extra money into the primary schools this year
first of all we couldn't find it and secondly the secondary schools had a UNK decrease last year
given our commitments to the programmes that we've set forward and given our commitment to the council tax payer remember that person again not mentioned today
the question may well be asked how are we going to fund it
first UNK we do not feel we can enter into an open ended commitment to fund the shortfall in section eleven
we believe that we do we believe that a
shame
review of the service should be undertaken immediately with a view to perhaps reducing the number of bases
and perhaps UNK a certain tier keeping the teachers and assistants who are actually in the schools as our top priority and maintaining a careful balance between schools with very high needs and schools with isolated children who are actually even more in need of support and know how
we are committed as was as we've decided last june to retain the programme until september nineteen ninety four
thereafter we would wish to phase in the reduction in staff to match the home office funding half in ninety four ninety five and the rest in ninety five ninety fi ninety five ninety six
it is reasonable to expect with a re an extensive programme like section eleven that there has been a build up of expertise hat there has been a build up of educational resources and why should one area of the service be exempt from examination or assessment
we've done a review of the service we did a review of field centres we really do not accept that one area no matter how worthwhile and i've talked to you
on many occasions to the excellent work done by and the section eleven team but we do not believe that any area is entitled to automatic exemption
here practice
we don't think to have the sixty to ninety transport debate yet again this route remains committed to a policy of reducing the amount we spend on transport because that ultimately benefits our schools and with this in mind we will UNK
our grace in favour charge of sixth UNK and college students
the existence of the hardship fund make absolutely sure that economic considerations need not UNK pupils from attending college or sixth form
rubbish
but to introduce a blanket free charge when some are willing and able to make a contribution to us is a nonsense
members of the committee will see that savings continue to come through on the school meals service and this is to a very considerable extent the result that the UNK of the previous UNK administration which ran a tight ship and positively encourage UNK
a number of the savings in this report come into that category
i believe that we must look very closely into the alternative meal
it uses modern technology to provide an extremely cost effective meal and it's UNK with fresh items every day
i spoke not to an individual child but to the head of school in hatfield where the scheme was UNK and i have to say he was he neither UNK nor condemned
he had an open mind and said there were pluses and UNK and for it i think if it was pointed out in future years that an extra UNK one point four million pounds could be available for school budgets he would look at it perhaps a little differently
maintenance allowances for college students well we UNK fairly clearly last june that we feel that maintenance allowances for college students should be the concern of the f a f c
there has been no positive response to our representations so perhaps it's time to be more firm
to the extent of phasing out funding and putting the f a f c on the spot
my colleague chairman of the youth and community panel and policy panel will speak on our proposals in that regard
so chairman just to in conclusion we continue we are proposing to continue this daily expansion of nursery places our half a million pounds this year would be divided up roughly three hundred and fifty one thousand pounds on revenue and a hundred and fifty thousand pounds on capital and would gain us over four hundred new places that's in line with the type of expansion that we achieved
last year and we believe that type of steady growth is very is desirable
special needs again we've highlighted we have put in a token on the er in the primary sector erm it's a UNK amount clearly we can't tell the schools how to spend their money but it seemed to us that the increasing in managerial role of primary deputy heads they would welcome er a small increase in non con in non contact time
that's an area of course that we would wish to increase eventually but looking at the protected figures a large increase in the primary schools delegated budgets this year could result in a de UNK cut to the secondary schools next year
some of the decisions clearly are easier at than others because we get a certain UNK on the easy ones while we've gone to some of the more difficult ones to UNK behind the changes that need to come about that it will not have a direct impact on schools and their school budgets and the children but will promote the services we've always done
this is a budget chairman that builds on the achievements of the last four years the care for our schools and it takes into account that the future will not be as UNK as we would like and allows for UNK
in harsh numerical terms we didn't accept the policy committee guidelines we felt that they in some ways were over generous and we aimed for we UNK deliberately set ourselves lower targets with point we're two point six million below the liberal democrats for nineteen ninety four ninety five
three point five million below labour but if you look savings in the pipeline of four point three million against the liberal democrats and four point eight million pounds against labour
let me remind the committee it's not too late to cross the political divide
and it's not too late to vote for common sense and careful management
thank you er do you have a seconder
UNK seconded but i reserve my right to speak
thanks very much
i would like to at this point to review the timing that we set earlier on
who said that
who said that
we could pass straight to that and er sort of go to lunch erm
what people wish to do perhaps
if we stick to the original proposed target we'd only be now some twenty five minutes for general debate and i would be this is probably therefore a serious issue
yes
one of our serious of the year we should er extend that debate er we could extend as late perhaps half past one for lunch or we could bring it to half way between half past one so the feeling in respect of that
would you
stick to twenty five minutes of debate and then close
yes
yeah
absolutely
i would like then to draw your attention to standing order c page paragraph four all speeches shall be concise and relevant to the matter in hand
pity you didn't do that do that a bit earlier chairman
relative to the matter in hand i take it to mean that it is to do with the budget er to prepare for this county and do not er to be the UNK of UNK in other places
i would hope that they will people will not will be speaking primarily on the variations of the previous speeches that have been made
we should not be having the same speech from the same group on the same issue at any point and also i would hope that where there is agreement between the groups that there is not time spent in
debating the agreement
finally i propose to call no person more than once to accept that the UNK will have the opportunity of winding up at the end and i would please ask you to wait until you have been called
i have an indication from mr that he wishes to speak
thank you chairman for this
after the behaviour yesterday someone claiming to be spokesman for the tory group on the environment backed up UNK by these UNK i said to my group today no more mr nice guy
but i needn't have bothered
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to be nice to the conservatives particularly when you produce something like this
look at some of the points here
oh shut up
look at some the points i've heard i've been UNK yesterday don't UNK me this week the section of level funding
what sort of UNK speech was that were they dance about it or trim here what they're saying very simply and this is relevant to the people who are listening to us today is that they are not prepared to restore the cuts made by the government which they have got elected
they are taking responsibility either they agree with their government or they do not agree with their government but to pretend that somehow we can not at all some of the cuts that are made that the f the other does not convince us i'm sure it does not convince the people on our right and even less more convincing than the people who are listening to us today
over the page it gets rather worse child under sixteen to nineteen
a saving is one way of looking at it or UNK from education is another way apparently what the conservatives would wish to do they wish to make people pay for education and there is no other way of looking at it
reducing staffing in the need of community services it's only seventy five thousand pounds but why what possible justification with rising grants rising private sector etc you know the problems out there
what possible justification can there be for that given the fact the actions are reasonable as they stay this year
increasing nursery provision you know it's very amusing actually the press release that had early this year er from er earlier mid last year in fact
from the conservatives saying that they believed in nursery education
it's rather late for the press releases on some months later the press release coming from my group and coming from the labour group it was a late conversion but not much of a conversion let's face it the word UNK springs to mind that's what i've written next to the conservative line there totally and i don't believe in nursery education but they know there are votes in it
we actually put it down in our own manifesto because we thought it was a good idea
oh there increasing primary schools delegated budget a hundred and forty thousand pounds
frankly one of your a hundred and forty pounds because at a hundred and forty thousand pounds that is an insult
that is three pence per child per week
it's hardly worth drawing the cheques in certain cases and the capital programme couldn't see it actually when i looked for it first time had to go back to the pink sheet and found the UNK now we're not as generous as we'd like to be but at least we try
no capital expansion
now i wonder where and this maybe unduly cynical but it is difficult to be unduly cynical with that lot over there
this is something to do with grant maintained schools don't repair schools government comes along and lovely mr UNK if he's still there
well who's next today john UNK tomorrow
chair
said here's some money here's some money and
a point of order
you just go
has the debate moved on
i thought we were debating a
the we are debating a b and we're debating altogether
yes
that's the same
yes but not d
charles
because d is our
d is our resolution on capital
right
UNK rather like it in er section eight of
indeed
if there voting on then it's traditional point of order during the speech thank you very much and what took me so long
i thought the conservative budget is a UNK budget the people in the people voting or an increase in nursery provision increase in educational provision this is what we are trying to give the conservative party are trying to UNK back to cutting our budget by two point six million pounds that is not what people voted for and is not what people want
no further discussion necessary on their budget let's get on with the serious business of funding real education in hertfordshire which we asked and in this particular case the labour party
good i you have stepped out of the debate
by a ludicrous budget
the conservative
and briefly the labour party we have certain doubts over certain lines there are similarities good
perhaps two sets of people do actually agree on education
these may need to be debated as they were before UNK may need to be rich but i'm afraid it looks as though it's gonna be a compromise only between two parties but this isn't a
thank you
thank you er mrs
thank you chairman er tell very quickly as er my voice is going so i'm going to be very brief on it for er two for about two points
the first one is the question on special educational needs
yes of course we will increase this
er better support and better advice for schools but i agree entirely with what says it's no good having the best advice in the world if we can't deliver the er the recommendations and one of the things that er has been borne in on me when i was sitting on the panel looking at special educational needs that the early identification of the early intervention when there are difficulties which start to arise in schools can save you a lot of money later on and unless the schools have the resources to er to meet with the er recommendations which are being made on particular children then we are asking for trouble there so that i'm very concerned about the fact that er the like the early one which was er increase that er provision
on section eleven yes we are along with the liberals we are trying to maintain the budget against the government cuts but don't anybody get away with the impression that is going to maintain the service as it is at the moment because we are really to pick up extra pupils
section eleven was confined to er people of commonwealth origin
the categories have been increased but the funding has not so that er although this is in as a growth item and although it is being presented as a UNK item in fact it may not have been a reduction in the service
section er i was very surprised indeed that er hilary asking for a review of the service because in fact all one's experience and i am sure as well tells us that this is a success story it is something that petition after petition that we've asking to keep it that way shows that it is one of the services that the county provides which is very much appreciated by the UNK and we can't say that in all county UNK services but you can say it about er the section seventeen and i think you ought to acknowledge that chairman
thank you mrs pauline
thank you chairman i appreciate that erm UNK isn't flavour of the month in the current majority at this county council and that indeed has been proved by several speeches from the opposition parties that were made this morning
you must however
in the other parties
the other parties
we must take UNK though chairman of the warning in the report and that was mentioned by mrs hilary that it's the responsibility of this council to plan the future needs on the basis of the estimated shortfall in resources that have been forecast
the problem is it seems that the both the liberal and the labour budgets do precisely the opposite they've obviously decided to adopt an approach of spend now and hang the consequences for the future
now i'm a governor of two schools and from this perspective in particular i'm very pleased to see that as a result of the legacy of previous conservative administration and the generous s a proposals for this year that the conservative group have been able to put forward a budget which enables schools budgets to be increased fully for UNK and inflation and certainly i know that was a great worry this year in many of our schools that might not be possible so it's good to see that it is possible
the conservatives were also putting forward of course prudent growth in important areas and one of the areas that i would particularly like to mention is that of nursery education
following on from the last administration the conservative proposals and that it would enable something like four hundred and fifty extra nursery places to be provided
that follows on a steady increase in nursery provision over the last few years
but obviously it must be necessary to UNK the statutory sectors versus the non statutory so it isn't er possible this year perhaps to put in as we might do if were to be as UNK as the opposition parties
what bob said of course was totally UNK with respect to what the conservatives did in the past
it is true we did increase the pupil to teacher ratio to one to thirteen in line with the f e er guidelines and that of course did provide some extra nursery places but last year we did put in real resources and actually increased the number of nursery places by about four hundred which involved the development of several new nursery classes so it is completely UNK to say that the conservatives attempted to increase nursery education on the cheap
we put in real money into this area
i would also like to nail the lie that the conservatives don't care about nursery education as put forward by chris as mrs already said this morning hertfordshire county council has one of the best records of nursery education in the whole of the country something like seventy five per cent of the client group currently have part time nursery places
these figures are in the report we are an authority that has an extremely good record on nursery education and i hope that no one will believe the attempt to try and black the good record that the conservative and that have the conservatives had have in this area
the budgets of course proposed by the liberal and labour groups have some aspects which would be desirable
the problem is as they know in their heart of hearts much of what they propose this year is not sustainable in future years
undoubtedly therefore much of the growth that they've put in is this year's budget will have to result in UNK budgets being cut in the future
now i think we all appreciate that the liberal and labour groups are working to another agenda
they'll of course attempt to claim that any future cuts in UNK budgets are down to lack of government funding
this will not be true if the liberals and labour groups con something
think do it in a situation which UNK this informal UNK erm
mm i mean i did one thing last er a few weeks ago is that i er cos i m it's a i do this market research it's really boring
yeah
people are just looking for a diversion so erm
yeah
i started up le let's a compile a famous lesbian list
yeah
and erm it started off with i suggested a few you know well know UNK
mhm
and er then people were coming along and saying the woman in the sandwich shop
she's not famous yeah but she's a lesbian
how do you know
mm
how do you know
cos she's miserable
and laughing
oh right
and she says oh he said oh yeah i feel really miserable today i feel like a right lesbian
and he's
right
really laughing at them
mm
and then someone said er they were saying people like er peter UNK
mhm
which i've never heard no but we don't like them
oh i see so it's still you know i UNK you know it's something to say about people you don't like
and the whole we sort of
yeah mhm
and then someone said UNK and then someone said she can't be cos she's nice
mm
and then i said
yeah
i said what do you mean sh oh i didn't mean it like that i meant she can't be because i like her
i went ha
oh right
that makes it alright does it
UNK
yeah
people are sort of
well it's it it's very much like you know a lot of things i've come across in everyday language where people i don't know er friends and relatives have found out that somebody's been gay oh well i never thought it of him he seemed like such a nice person as well
mm
you know it's almost as if it's like er you know a sort of negative thing to find out about somebody erm so erm yeah i mean i think i so i think you'll i think you'll of necessity have to try and do something which UNK this sort of informal talk because as soon as people commit themselves to writing they're gonna be erm they're gonna be
on the defensive
well not exactly g gonna be on the defensive because it's i don't it's no less it's no less genuine you know it's part it's a view that they can express in different circumstances
yeah
it's like sort of a guy comes into lectures and he can be particularly when talking about things like racism and disability be quite liberal as it were you know and that kind of when you get him down the pub all on his own er a quite different UNK comes out so er
UNK
yes it's very UNK erm i think as i think human beings are so erm so i think you you're gonna have to
so i've got to
crack go for the erm yeah
go in the pub
yeah
sort of erm if you erm tt i don't know in some way succeed in noting or recording or something erm you know whatever it is that people are doing
erm mm so how did we get on to that
just remind me
erm
that was just i wa i wanted to get like some
yeah mm
kind of pilot of how pe
mm
erm because a lot of this questionnaire
mm
is based on that people have got an i you know they sort of identify a gay person i mean you everybody
yeah
said i wouldn't like to be in a room with UNK
yeah
er a lot of the time i was talking to someone at er
well in a sense how do you know you're not as it were you know in many cases
mm
yeah well i was talking i was talking to a friend and they said that you know there's some UNK attacks and some of them just happen to occur because people are walking in a gay area
yeah
you know sort of ooh he's gotta be a UNK so they er UNK him up just cos he happens
mm yeah
to be walking past a pub
yeah
erm and i was just thinking about erm how people actually label people
yeah
so i mean maybe there's context maybe there's the sort of situation oh this is an area where you know kind of this is an area that's full of UNK so he must be erm
mm
sometimes it may be to do with dress UNK you know kind of again you know people go for oh i don't know i mean there's a conversation er i remember UNK erm with some friends in leicester and they go to motorbike UNK a lot and erm er they were describing an incident where they pitched their tent at a rally and some blokes came up and pitched their tent next to them and they were erm two blokes had arrived together on the same enormous UNK motorbike and they'd got sort of matching leather UNK erm
you know this is the sort of thing and really you know sort of UNK hair and enormous UNK like yard UNK or this is the story that was told to me and then there was this all this all this UNK about why their UNK were so UNK oh yes er so UNK er rather i beg your pardon and erm
yeah
you know kind of there's all this UNK about sort of UNK making your hair grow and all that kind of thing erm you know so erm it's one of these things that erm sort of erm kind of people s slip into on the basis of you know th er as far as i could tell there was no sort of firm evidence that these blokes were gay or heterosexual apart from judgments made on their UNK and personal appearance erm you know but er you know it gave rise to a whole range of you know kind of supposedly UNK talk erm in that context erm so there's a whole range of things erm tt you know sort of talk and UNK and er you know kind of also gossip and UNK about them oh is he married if not does he have a girlfriend if not ooh i wonder if he's gay you know kind of things that we understand about people's relationships feed into it so
mm
oh there's loads and loads of stuff erm tt which i think people can use UNK in different circumstances you know depending on what information they have about somebody so
mm
i mean i've got a rough idea of what the things are
mm
mm
i just wanted to actually you know
yeah
get it from you know what people do
yeah certainly erm i think that's er that's good well if you can if you can access it er in some way informally or you know it's probably un unlikely that you'd get too much stuff in writing as you say but you know er it could be very er productive and interesting erm tt erm can that sort of thing particularly if you can get it in terms of quotes from people you can sort of you know make a project look quite nice because it looks like if you do all this you know sort of stuff with the attitude scales it it's er it gives you lots of nice numerical data but er
mm
particularly if you can supplement this and show how it erm fits into the way people discuss these issues you know here's some real talk here's some real quotes you know er stuff like that it can look quite yeah great
yeah
i mean i want to actually put in some you know some real kind of you know rather
yeah mm
than just
yeah
qualitative stuff as well
yeah right so er yeah so it's anyway it's difficult to know how you're gonna get it but er i wish you i wish you luck in doing so
erm tt
well i'm gonna use some of the er i mean i've got some of the er i made notes of some of the quotes i got from UNK
yeah
the famous lesbian list
yeah
and i can use some of those
mm
about UNK
yeah
but i probably can't use her will i be able to use names which
of course you can yes if it's if it's
yeah
UNK erm if it's you know individuals at work erm you know er perhaps it's appropriate to use UNK but erm you know with UNK i mean people do projects about you know kind of soap stars and things like that and say
oh well yeah
say what people have said about them so you know it seems to be much the same sort of thing
erm yeah let's see if there's anything else i remember thinking when i when i had a look through this erm so er yeah erm oh great so
yeah mm
i mean there are some really ex extreme ones and
mm
i'll just have to UNK there
yeah i think i think that's probably just as well because erm let's say you know it's being answered by somebody who's gay themselves or lesbian themselves or you know kind of is heterosexual but has sort of anti UNK
mm
i mean you don't want to kind of put them off too much erm
mm maybe you put people on their guard like
mm
the christian erm the born again christian council i mean some of the quotes i got from people
yeah
things like erm
mm
UNK will er will lead to an increase in UNK and UNK er
mm
sex crimes
yeah
mm
i mean i
yeah
i couldn't use that
yeah
i mean that's a thing that er i remember seeing a UNK and there was this bloke i dunno if he was from the UNK trust i don't think so but erm er anyway he was going on about this very thing that there's often the UNK imagination er has this sort of UNK between you know UNK adult activity and if you're gay if you're UNK then this probably means that you're also interested in UNK children you're also interested in UNK activity er you're also interested in you know a whole variety of other you know things which
but it's
you know the sort of er the sort of disgusting to the straight UNK erm
it's exactly the same
mm
mm
thing if you think about is as it's used for drugs
yeah
you know if people wanna smoke a bit of pot then this is
yeah
obviously gonna lead to sort of drug UNK
absolutely yes
yes there's this sort of UNK model
yeah
which is very powerful in mm
you start off drinking then you smoke and you yeah
yeah mm
yes though it's interesting with things like er alcohol and tobacco because they're well at least partly legal erm you know often there's quite a UNK division drawn between them and anything that's illegal erm you know so that you know kind of once you start smoking UNK you're on the slippery slope to er you know kind of UNK and crack and all the rest of it
crime
yes and crime of course yes absolutely erm er so erm yeah er yeah and go in thinking about the er thinking about the questions erm
i mean you didn't spot any that just look you know UNK
i didn't spot any that er that were UNK do bear in mind that i read this quite late last night after i got in from that meeting i went to
oh
so erm er i can't guarantee that i was totally UNK when i read it but er i'm
well i mean i'm just
i'm just thinking you know mm
i'm reasonably happy with them but i mean i know
mm yeah
you've sort of had a lot of experience of UNK things like this so you know probably i mean if i'm gonna make an error i think it'd be a UNK one
yeah mm yeah so erm i think mm yeah i think i think with something like this with questionnaires really the acid test is actually trying to administer them and then you see the problems very often
yeah
erm it's very difficult to spot what's going to go wrong in advance and some of the things you suspect are dodgy nobody has any trouble with some of the things that you just didn't occur to you that would go wrong do go wrong it's like mm yeah mm
doing that that's why i thought i'd get you know a response out of people
yeah
yeah but erm well a absolutely erm but er
the thing is i've omitted i've omitted things like sin
yeah
UNK is a sin cos i mean i think that's UNK into religion as much as to
yeah quite erm
erm
so er yeah
i don't know what i mean some people may you know may not even perceive you know the concept of sin so i got rid of that
mm
i also got rid of anything to that mentioned morality
yeah
yeah
cos i mean that's
fair enough
to sex behaviour anyway
mm
yeah so let's see if there's anything i remember
erm mm yeah erm
i'm gonna also sort of UNK it with erm instructions to sort of say okay look
yeah
when the term UNK is used it can be male female specified
right yeah mhm yeah fair enough mhm
so to stop too much confusion
yeah great and you can have a little UNK in there about sort of confidentiality and your views are important whatever they are and a little bit of UNK about filling in the scale and you know the usual sort of standard stuff
mm
erm so er tt i think the other thing that'll be nice if erm er given if the first years are filling it in er in about a week and a UNK time if we could if you could try and bash some of the data in fairly rapidly so that you know kind of before the end of term we can you know kind of give them a brief digest of how what the results were
yeah
so that they they're getting something back as well as
yeah i mean yeah
as er as doing something erm but erm yeah it's certainly possible to er to do the first years
erm yeah er mm yeah no i'm quite UNK myself about this idea that erm somehow it's UNK who UNK who are UNK and that you know once you have a sexuality that's different from UNK then you can't be trusted with children and you know you can't be trusted to er you know i don't know run boys' clubs you can't be trusted in a you know it's sort of it's almost like erm er it almost flies in the face of evidence that the vast majority of sexual abuse that goes on of one sort or another is heterosexual it's
mm
very often men abusing women and yet you know when you're looking at erm attitudes to gay and lesbian people it's often the case that they're you know somehow thought of as suspect
mm
i think a lot of the time i mean UNK has been perceived historically as like a you know if not an illness a weakness
mm
and er
yeah
people are told to go and have a cold shower and not give in to the weakness
not give in to the weakness
yeah
so i think they recognize that everyone has UNK
mm
thoughts
yeah
it's just the people who sort of gave in to them were sort of UNK than other people
yeah
so if they gave in to that one temptation
mm
they'll sort of give in to other UNK
oh right yeah
but it's like
and you know they'll be tempted to put their fingers in the till and UNK from work and
you know all sorts of other things as well because they're morally suspect don't have the UNK
mm
tt yeah erm yeah i mean it's interesting when you come to attitudes to UNK erm i think that's quite an important issue because it does tap into a whole range of things about erm you know kind of er UNK that somehow if gay or lesbian people raise children then the UNK either be you know sort of UNK or converted themselves
mm
erm you know never mind that most children who are beaten or abused or die at their the hands of their parents er you know do so at the hands of their heterosexual parents
mm
erm you know it's still er you know considered UNK
mm
mm
version of most gay people come from heterosexual homes anyway so
absolutely yeah and er you know kind of er it's absolutely impossible to determine exactly what it is that's you know UNK people's sexuality isn't it
i mean
you know it's still
i mean i yeah i included those because i thought a lot of pe even the sort of most
mm
right on people
yeah
are gonna have problems where children are concerned UNK
yes i think there's some yeah i think there's that's one of the areas where er as it were attitudes are most small c conservative that er sort of liberal UNK whom i know er you know are often quite suspicious of that
erm
and i usually say well once gay and lesbian people start beating their kids like UNK i'll agree with you but erm tt so er mm
i mean i know that there were
mm
i mean i did read somewhere there were some studies done
mm
er on the american sort of er gay
mm
couples that have adopted
yeah
and the children were sort of actually more you know
mm
UNK well balanced you know
yeah mm
as they define it
yeah
than the sort of the a controlled
well i think i think growing up with gay or lesbian parents i think i think could be a very mind UNK experience for people it will certainly teach you about social life in a in a lot of different ways that er
mm
people in heterosexual families wouldn't find out about erm and it teaches you ways of dealing with prejudice and discrimination on the assumption that you do learn to deal with them and er
mm
all sorts of stuff like that
yeah erm oh well looks like we're nearly drifting towards the end again as i as i say i'm fairly pretty happy with the questions erm you know er going back to what i was saying earlier i was just thinking that some of them might be more f easily UNK as non UNK statements and you have the you know kind of have the words in the scales yeah right good so yeah
yeah i mean i'm definitely gonna put some words i think that
erm as regards UNK things together and UNK them into the same factor analysis model and stuff like that er even if the questions are a bit different i think you can still do that legitimately because it's still sort of expressing the strength of opinion on some sort of scale erm so i don't see that that'll er interfere with the ambitions you've got as regards the data erm so er
mm
anyway i'm afraid i haven't sort of UNK anything on that but you know kind of that's er
no that's quite good enough that's good
you know just thoughts i had as i was reading through it as best i can remember them so er mm
but i mean this one i'm i've got i would feel comfortable knowing that i was attracted to
yeah
so i put if i was attracted to my
er how or something like how would how would you feel if you felt attracted to a member of your own sex or something yeah
oh you'd ask it in the form of a question
and you can bung you can bung some UNK underneath it of one sort or another er
so i mean questions as opposed to statements
er yeah erm
okay that's great
i know when invented scales back in the early thirties er typically they were UNK statements which people had to agree or disagree with erm but er i think perhaps more recently people have gone more for things that are a bit like how would you feel what do you think type statements erm so er
mm
erm
yeah i think that'd break it up and i think
the erm mm
it'd be a bit boring with just the agree or disagree
yeah fair enough so
right that's great
okay right so best of luck to you anyway if you
okay
sort of get that er sort of er get a neat copy run off we might be able to get it down for UNK to UNK in time for er tuesday week with a bit of luck
that should be no problem at all
yeah good
okay cheers thanks a lot for your help
okay
cheers
oh hello
ah hello erm do come in
yeah right oh well now then now i'm afraid erm i'm doing a project for the british national corpus which involves er trying to record everyday conversations so i've got a microphone on i hope you don't mind
er
oh well never mind erm but you know informal consent and all that kind of thing so er right anyway erm so er how's it going
well i've been told well i was gonna come and see you anyway
yeah
i'm a bit behind in my coursework and whatever
yeah
well i'm a bit behind full stop
yeah
so er
just to
mm
so what s what well let let's get on to something a bit more s as it were specific i mean what sort of things are you are you behind with and having difficulty with then
erm well i'm still on stuff from last term
right
yeah
which
er well it's just i'm ha it's not that i'm having more difficulty with one thing than another it's just that i haven't i didn't get round to doing them
yeah
yeah erm is that gonna be a problem that's gonna UNK in the future do you think
or do you
erm
do you think you'll be able to get sorted
well to be honest
yeah
i find it quite difficult like
yeah
everything
ah right
yeah
erm are there any specific areas of difficulty like you know sort of things like statistics things like you know erm i dunno other bits and pieces that er you know give you particular problems
er subject itself
yeah erm
i'd just don't know how to go with it i dunno what to do
yeah erm
i'm alright on UNK
yeah
it's what were you doing before you came here
was it was it like a levels or er
erm well i i'm a mature student
oh right
but i've had a few years out
yeah
but er
yeah
you know
i think that's not UNK actually if you when you get people who've been away from the education system for a f a few years and i think it's almost like mature students do have more anxiety than people who come straight from school generally speaking i think erm
mm
you know more likely to worry about work more likely to feel that they're not quite coping more likely to feel erm you know that somehow everybody else is getting on with it and they can't i mean that's just you know going from what people have told me so
so it's more it's more oh right
yeah
but sometimes actually it's a more you know kind of it's not really because they've got problems but it's just because they they're sort of more UNK and more you know more motivated but erm yeah getting on to
what more motivated
well in some cases in some cases it is i'm not saying every time but
you know i mean sometimes it is erm so i mean is there anything that you think you know we could change or you could change to like improve the situation
so you know is there anything is it about the way you work is it about the way the course is taught is it about you know sort of reassurance and UNK type stuff is it about you know what
all of them i think but seriously
all of them
er mm
it's that erm originally i couldn't get like the motivation
yeah
and i had trouble like er cos i come from like i've got like science
mhm
and physics and all that sort of stuff i mean i
yeah
haven't written an essay for like a
yeah
i mean you're talking like i mean years i mean really it's
mm
i can't remember the last essay i wrote
yeah
and i really have problems
yeah
with that sort of thing
mm
and er i just haven't it's like erm i just haven't put the time in
mm
i just haven't been able to UNK myself to put the time in
yeah
i've ch that's changing a bit now cos erm
mm
yeah i'm ge as i'm getting into the course like i've gotta realize that i've gotta do it but
yeah
er it's just not knowing where to go with it
mm
and er the stuff that i write is just rubbish basically
yeah
you know what i mean
erm well i mean that's the you know one of one of the things that er a lot of people UNK with
i mean some people adopt the approach of trying to d do it all in about two hours just before the deadline so they don't have time to feel self critical erm i think perhaps if you can you know rather than rather than trying to do it all at once i mean the business of going through UNK of things and gradually getting them better and better i mean the first UNK of things that i write are usually just UNK on the back of a piece of paper that's with something else on the front
yeah
they're usually just notes they're usually ill formed and not very well backed up and ill thought out and then gradually you know you sort of go through it again and you can fit more detail in
yeah
and gradually you can go through it again and sort of fit the references in and you know so gradually and then you find it's too big and then you sort of go through it again and try and knock some stuff out so
yeah
i mean often actually producing pieces of writing is quite a you know sort of long drawn out sort of er UNK process i suppose in mathematical terms erm you know you kind of go through it again and again erm i mean that's one thing you ca but obviously that's quite time consuming er
yeah
so er erm and don't forget in the first year all you've got to do is pass
yeah
erm it's just a qualifying year yeah well everybody says that but you know it's worth
bearing in mind that you've
yeah
just gotta put something in that in the coursework and the exams that sort of gets you over the forty percent barrier and in psychology it's not that difficult to sort of UNK your way up to forty percent erm without wishing ma to make it sound too easy erm
it's not like my brother did in his physics degree where he sort of ended up getting twelve percent overall in his second year and then took the year again and got six percent erm that's very difficult to do in psychology erm
so er mm but you know so er given that it's a sort of fairly UNK thing it's you know it's probably in some ways it's probably less difficult than you think
erm yes
yeah but i mean i think the stuff the stuff that i've written is like rubbish it's like i dunno
yeah
it sounds like something you get on
mm
you know like television UNK you know the really sort of
oh right yeah
UNK type stuff
mm
i just ca i just i've never done psychology before you see and so it's like erm
yeah
there's no there's no er sources to it and i mean it's just like
yeah mm
yeah i know it's well again you know kind of once you can see once you can see what's wrong with it rather than just sort of you know UNK it up and throwing it away you know kind of if you can use that as a basis for you know kind of putting more of the stuff in that makes it look a bit more academic
yeah
erm you know kind of er call that a first draft and then sort you know sort of try and sort of go through the books again and stick a few references in to back up the points you've made so you can see it relates to other people's evidence erm trying to go through it again and knock out the well you know what i mean kind of statements and you know you can gradually sort of make the er UNK you know sort of but again it's one of these processes that i find you know you need to go through again and again and again to sort of get it er get it together erm so erm
what shall i do about the stuff that i haven't done
erm well i'll if you could if you could do me a list of what you've what you've missed so far so we know where we are as it were erm what er mm
i need two on
mm
i need two by the end of the term
yeah whi which
and
which two
i did the erm tt er what's it called
erm
well there's that tutorial essay thing possibly
yeah i did that one
yeah
and i did the erm the one about the information crisis
whose tutor group where you in
erm mr
oh right
have you had that back yet or er
no
no
oh right well i'll erm er see er i'll see if i can catch ian and see what see what's happened to it
it's UNK
oh right oh well not to worry but mm yeah but you know
i mean cos it was it was bad actually i mean i actually
kind of if you do if you do manage to get some feedback on some of the stuff you've done so far it may turn out that it wasn't as bad as all that you know
yeah
it may turn out that it hasn't failed UNK but you know there may be various ways in which you could improve it which you might you know if you're lucky he might have sort of written on round the sides and round the edges and erm that's you know kind of one of the things that you can build on erm you know a lot of
you know kind of build on build on the criticism as it were and build on the things that people say could improve it erm
yeah
and er you know i think coming to a university is a thing that you know like it's a very sort of novel experience for a lot of people and you know certainly when i started the human UNK course here you know about twelve thirteen years ago erm you know i didn't know what on earth was UNK required and i UNK over work for quite a long time and er
mm
you know it's not too UNK but you know it's just a matter of
i don't know what it is though it's
kind of ge getting something in that er you know sort of UNK the requirements of the course and most people gradually the hang of it you know
i think i will
what are you supposed to what are you supposed to do with things like erm you get UNK you get lectures
mhm
okay and then erm it's like some UNK give you like a set of notes
mm
mhm
and some UNK give you a set of references
yeah
so and you just end up with a list of names or something like that
mhm
and er are you supposed to go back and like research it yourself or
well erm in some ways i mean what we're doing in social say most of that you can pick up out of the UNK where it's discussed in rather slightly more detail and i stick in you know different kinds of examples and things like that to try and
UNK it along and make it a little bit different to the book erm with some of the other things i mean for example if you erm get stuff off i don't know for example people like ian erm
yeah
erm with him i mean he doesn't tend to give handouts but you know kind of if you write ever if you succeed in taking fairly good notes erm
they're very often good enough to like survive on erm
yeah
er if it's people give you things like reference lists and reading lists i mean sometimes that's the most confusing thing to be given because you don't know i used to think you were supposed to read everything on them er and i actually tried doing that once or twice and i couldn't find stuff in aston library so i ran up the er town library and went to birmingham university library and then i got back the next week and i realized that i was about the only person who'd actually done that and other people hadn't
yeah
and erm you know it was erm er
too busy
yeah absolutely erm i think partly those things are to in when people pump out loads and loads of references partly it's to indicate which studies the ideas information evidence have come from
yeah
so they're not just making it up out of their heads it actually you know somebody really did a study on this somebody really put this argument forward erm er partly it's to i mean some of the things on those things you can't easily get in aston library anyway some of the things erm er particularly if they're references to general you know sort of you know general bits of the you know whatever UNK they seem to be using mostly erm
yeah
you know that's the sort of thing you might want to read as kind of background supplementary material and particularly
i find it boring to
oh right erm but er well you can you can get away without buying stuff erm i mean as i as i say some people do end up sharing erm some people do end up not that there's very much library stock very often but you know some people do
i've noticed that
i couldn't get any of the erm
mm
course books like i think i can't afford to buy them then
yeah
er you have to use other books
yeah
erm again you know with the subject matter provided you can find stuff that does tend to cover the same sort of s topics erm it doesn't really
the course is so like geared to like one UNK you know
mm
most of the time
yeah
and i can't get hold of that UNK and then and not knowing psychology before
mm
you end up with like all these books and they've got a different sort of er perspective on it and they've got
mm
yeah
and they go into it in like different depths or
mhm
and you just end up with tt you don't you can't follow it
yeah
and i they do a bit and then another one you have to go into another UNK
yeah
and er it's just like i just lose it totally
yeah
mm
yeah i suppose it is a tt it is a bit of a problem erm particularly for some of the stuff which you know it tends not to be dealt with very deeply in sort of general UNK like some you know erm i think things like er some of the you know some of the stuff that erm ah for example er people like rob do erm
yeah
it's difficult to access that in general UNK
because it's often quite specialized
yeah
erm some of the stuff that we end up doing in the second and final year you don't easily access through general UNK because it's quite specialist
yeah
erm some of the stuff that you might be doing in things like perception and stuff like that erm
UNK yeah perception
yeah it might be i don't know i think usually roy does that but i think UNK doing it this year or something erm er that tends to be that tended to be something that i had difficulty with as a student because again you couldn't just sort of find one book that covered the lecture course
yeah
erm
you have to go to like ten different
yeah
and most of the good ones are gone and it's like the nineteen thirty
yeah
ones left in the library
right yeah erm so that can be that can be a bit awkward but still some of the older stuff can give you a bit of a UNK in what it's about if you can find anything relevant and sometimes you've just got to sort of wander round the library and pick things up off the shelves like at random and see if you can find something in the index or find something in the contents pages that sort of vaguely UNK with what the you know what's been talked about in the class that week erm sometimes if you keep looking you might actually be dead lucky and find one of the recommended books has actually come back in erm you may find that you've got to be a bit flexible about that because you know if a UNK dealt with in november you may not get a chance to see the book until you know kind of i don't know february or something you know i mean so it sometimes does mean you've got to do the reading like a bit UNK from the from the classes
right
erm i know it i know it i know it's yeah mm
i know it's a i know it's a problem with big with big classes and few resources erm so er
i've got few resources i just can't afford to buy the books that's the
yeah
that's the thing
so erm
i'm just so behind i can't believe it it's like
yeah
all of the first term went ah just like that
yeah
cos i was working as well that term
mm
are you are you self funding or er
yeah
oh right
so it's like i'm working like
yeah that makes it difficult as well
god knows how many although i'm not working any more i've lost the job but
yeah
i'm looking for another one but
yeah
so only like i've had the last week off
mm
and i've er done an essay
mhm
but i can't afford to go on like that you see
yeah
and i don't know how i'm gonna survive
mm
i've got all the
yeah
other studying as well as the work to do
yeah erm well that can that can be difficult erm i know er when er when dave did his psychology degree here erm he started out as an electrical engineer and he got interested
yeah
in psychology and chucked in electrical engineering and started a psychology course and he had to work at the same time as he studied for some of that time
yeah
and i don't know how he managed to fit it in er but some people manage it erm it means that sometimes you know you're very time limited on writing things and you don't put in something that you feel does justice to yourself you know you put in what you think of as crap and you know mm
i'm just not i'm not UNK with coursework
mm
cos i mean there's loads of
mm
like everyone like you talk to someone and they're like throwing up all the technical information
mm
sort of jargon and you think well it's like cos er they're
yeah
all starting to get into the
mm
sort of knowing what it's about now
yeah
even the people that didn't know before
did the a level and that cos like a lot of a level
mm
but the people that like are new are starting to sort of oh you know
yeah
oh that's the work of er
oh yeah they can say the say the say the names and the dates and the yeah mm
yeah and i'm thinking well
yeah
i'm gonna have to do some work on this and then erm
yeah
when it just comes down to it and i just don't know where to start
mm
it's like last term i didn't get anything and it was like
mm
i got very little notes and it's
mm
i just need like
yeah
you know is there somewhere that i can get the subjects that i need in each
yeah
lecture just like
well erm
and all that
not very easily because there's different things apply to different courses like some things have got quite a lot of sort of documentation and handout materials some things
yeah
haven't erm er and erm you know some things you know there's the sort of one particular UNK that covers most of what we talk about in the classes some things there isn't
yeah
erm so i mean for example with something like statistics that covers different techniques and activities from you know different books erm something like erm something like social most of it comes out of that which is a thing we did because people were experiencing difficulty with it so we thought well right we'll sort of anchor the syllabus mostly to you know one particular book erm so different staff use different techniques some people ha have drawn on a whole variety of things and some people have just drawn on one erm i think the main priority is to try and do some coursework though in your case erm
you reckon
yeah if there's still stuff outstanding just so you erm
well there's only one
mm
i've done one
mm
but it's like er it's the one for guy about memories and
oh right yeah
it's a bit erm it's awful but erm
mm
i dunno whether should i go and see him or hand it in or what
well i'll tell you what if you want to yeah if you if you want well do have a word with him if you possible can erm
yeah
er i think i know he's not around very much at the moment because he's supposed to be on UNK but you know erm do
oh yeah
do let him know er because if we if we sort of know you know if a if an essay just comes in off somebody we've never met or something like that
yeah
and it comes in late we're we it doesn't it ins it doesn't make us very sympathetic but you know if people know who you are and you know you know they know you've ha they've had a conversation with you then it makes it easier
mm
erm you know even if it does come in late so we can say oh yes i remember this person sort of thing you know
stuff like that
how about how about coursework which isn't actually due in yet like stuff for the end of this term or the beginning of next i mean do you reckon you'll be able to have a have a stab at that some time
i haven't started i haven't started
yeah
yeah i'll give that try but i've got this other
yeah
this practical for dave in from last term
right
that's like
yeah well
that is
as i say if you could erm if you could some time soon drop a note off in my tray about you know kind of what exactly you've got outstanding so i can go round and see the erm see the people concerned and say that you've been to
just the one thing
well mm well you can but it'll be nice to it will be nice to have something you know kind of some sort of list we can we can refer to and say oh yes oh great he's handed that one in now and sort of knock it off because i know they do keep records in the office but you know just something so we know where you are erm and it also kind of er will perhaps help concentrate the mind on what you need to get done erm so er
i know there's a
and there's also
practical is
mm
i'm just
yeah now that's probably worth mentioning to dave because i think one of the things he was talking about doing was instead of one of the tests or something making people hand in either some sort of lab book or some sort of record of the practical so far this term erm
yeah i hate UNK
yeah
so erm that's if you're if you're getting behind on that it's worth trying to do something about it UNK before you get too far behind to manage to catch up
yeah
erm because that's like a continuous thing erm with some other stuff if it's just like essays or projects due in at the end of this term or beginning of next you know get the light stuff out of the way first erm and try you may find it easier if you if you what i used to do was sort of try and you know pace it out a little bit and not try and write an essay all at once because i found that very difficult to do but if you just sort of write a paragraph and do something else for a bit and you know kind of write another paragraph a bit later on in the day and you know kind of erm you know work you know don't try and write an essay all in one evening but try and sort of you know if you've managed to spread it out over the course of a few days so that you don't have to do too much at once i mean it's difficult to concentrate on one thing
just so behind on the coursework
mm
yeah
and take the notes and that
mm
cos erm i just need to do some work on that i've still got last UNK work and everything i just
yeah
you know what i mean
well it is possible it is possible because erm you know we're not necessarily dealing with anything that's UNK difficult this year erm
yeah
i think usually most people find the second year more intensive there's more work to do
yeah
and the final year i think there's sort of less on the timetable but people tend to do more work for it and do a project as well but in the in the first year erm you know it's not that difficult to pass it erm er and there are always the referred papers in september so if you're if you're keen to
well you know if i mean if you're keen to keep on the course but just having a few difficulties
yeah
then you know it's probably it's probably possible
possible yeah
but erm you know i mean some people do actually get total totally UNK off with the university and the course and everything and decide to chuck it in you know er in which case
i've done that before though
mm
oh right
where did you where did you where were you before
erm i was at manchester doing physics
oh right mm
and i couldn't stand physics i just sort of
yeah i think that's what happened to my brother actually
yeah can happen
yeah
so
mm
so i can't really er but i like this course as well
mm yeah oh well if you find you know there's anything you like about it or anything interesting in it that does help because it you know it certainly makes it a lot easier to learn things take information in revise things erm whatever
i do think it's interesting but i just er
mm
it's like say i say i UNK say i go from here now and i
mm
mm
i think and i think well i've got this one practical to do and i've got erm
yeah
yeah
which i can get done and then i've got
mm
all this coursework that i all this er lecture stuff that i'm behind on lots of it
yeah
and i don't really know where to start
yeah
to be honest i don't
yeah erm tt well if i was you i'd probably try and keep up to date with the stuff that's happening now
yeah
and then gradually try and re don't spend too much time trying to UNK the past because that you know you just get further and further behind with the present stuff so you know kind of try and at least make sure that you know maybe if you get a job you won't be able to go to all the classes but at least make sure you are in contact with somebody who has that you can get notes off every time you know that erm oh hello
hi can i come to
hello can you
to see you later
erm how much later
are you very busy
well
erm let's see er
whenever you're free
er let's see it will be this afternoon some time erm
yeah that's fine
if you could try me about sort of some time between three and four
okay
i should think because i'm doing something with some students shortly and then erm there's somebody coming to see me at two so er
right i'll come up then
thanks
okay right
so yeah erm so erm tt er yeah so oh that reminds me i think i may have left something in the lecture theatre i was in this morning oh my god it was a letter from somebody yes i have oh shit
oh dear
erm do you mind if i leave you for a second
i'll just nip back and see if i can get the thing
erm oh excuse me
people right thank you hello
hello
UNK just had to burst into somebody else's class and get my er thing back
right yeah so erm you know i mean that's probably the best thing to do if you try and try and at least keep up to date with the rest of this term and er you know not er make sure even if you haven't been to a class at least you know what went on there from somebody
yeah
erm so er
right
yeah i think that's probably the best thing and gradually the past you've missed might start fitting into place as it were you know if you if you keep up with the present i think that's probably the best thing so er and you know er i know it's no comfort but these things take time you know it takes time to get UNK into something and it takes time to get used to a way of working
yeah well i mean most people do i mean
yeah i think i mean i will but
yeah so er so
i've gotta go and see someone else who else should i see about this
well er if i was you if you're if you're missing out on stuff from guy try and see guy if you're missing out on stuff from dave try and see dave
yeah
erm if erm have you seen ian since those tutorials at all
no
well you might want to go and ask him er about it because he'll be presumably your personal tutor as well so erm you may be able to get some more er you know some something off him you know kind of what he thought of your essay or something like that
yeah
because i haven't seen any of your written work so i can't really sort of erm er UNK any advice yet er
okay
so erm er or indeed it may be if you ask him or if you ask in the general office it may of erm tt it may have it may have been marked by now and so er
could be
you know er
right
but er anyway as i say see the people who whose work you're late with so er
so where can i find guy then
guy lives on the sixth floor in let me see it's on the it's if you're going along the corridor it's just past the final year notice boards it does have a number i've forgotten which one it is but it's on the right hand side
dave is further down the sixth floor corridor it's almost directly under this room
aha
and it's er the end on the left hand side if you go in there's like a little sort of little sort of lobby and UNK is the little room sort of straight ahead of you it's about down there somewhere
yeah
as the as the UNK i suppose
erm so erm yeah so you know kind of get in touch with the people whose work you've missed and er you know er so at least they when it you know when it does arrive they'll know what the circumstances are so er
do you actually fail the year if you don't hand in a piece of work
erm let's see usually what happens is there's an exam board in june after people have hopefully done all their coursework and done their exams and then we decide what to do with the people er you know who've failed something or there's stuff missing
mm
erm usually if it's just one or two things people are offered the opportunity to submit a piece of work over the summer
aha
if it's just like one exam or two exams that they've failed or they've been ill for or they've missed or something they're offered the opportunity to sit those in september then we have another exam board in september
yeah
and see what the situation is then
usually most of the people who've had coursework and exams to do over UNK
yeah
erm then er then what do we do
erm then we wonder whether to offer people the chance of you know offer them a UNK year or whether we want to ask them to withdraw asking people to withdraw is very rare actually i haven't seen that done very often
oh god
so er usually people do people do leave but it's usually because they they're sick of it or you know they want
oh right
to do something else elsewhere or they want to transfer to transport management or something like that as people do sometimes
that's an idea
yeah
er yeah and i think people in the first term are quite attracted to it because it doesn't seem to have much on the timetable erm
what transport management
transport management yeah erm anyway erm so well if you if you can well if you can give me a list of what's outstanding if you can see dave and you can see guy
yeah
er for the time being and if you ask dave about this thing you've missed and also about what this business about erm cos he has explained it to me but i'm not quite sure about it this business of keeping a sort of l record of all the UNK for this term
yeah
cos if you've missed the first couple of weeks' worth or so erm
you only have to do eight out of ten
oh eight out of ten so there's still there's still time to er
still time to redeem yourself good
yeah that's no problem
okay
oh well you already know about that in that case erm
i know what i've gotta do but it's just doing it
yeah so er
erm when do you want where do you want me to put this list then
er well if you look in the general office erm just in
on the sixth floor yeah erm it's there's a load of plastic UNK erm
right
for leaving messages for staff and stuff like that mine's the
will you know who i am
er mine's the top one it says erm well i'll UNK i'll rem i'll yeah well it just says on it and it's the it's the top one on the left hand side as you're facing them
okay
it's the one nearest the door
so what you just want my name and
your name and what you're missing yeah
alright no problem
so er so we can er we can see where we are as it were
alright then
right okay well mm yeah UNK quite good about that sort of thing she seems to be er be quite on the ball about who's handed in what erm
yeah she does
yeah but er yeah there there's a UNK there's a great er it's a great shame actually erm we may not have jenny for very much longer they may not renew her contract which will be a big shame
have to get a petition up or something
yeah erm i dunno if it would do much good actually but er yeah but er no she she's quite good about you know sort of erm you know kind of keeping an eye on students and stuff like that anyway er so if you could right
see you see you again
er right see you soon then
bye
hello tape recorder you seemed to go off there for a while i'm just checking that you're still working again thanks very much
so that's why i'm going around with a little machine and a microphone on
and they're trying to get some record of what
it's best to explain it you know
yeah sort of UNK er how english is spoken sort of around er in different you know circumstances in private places and universities and television and
all sorts of things like that
a lot of things and don't knows
yeah
with me so
mm
right
yeah
okay
what it was it's from this book really
mhm
which was this study
mm
here which i've read about it's got erm articles about the blind dreams of the blind
oh yeah
now what it actually was er some a systematic set of questions about the natural experience of people UNK to UNK and visual images number of people in
yeah
now i've looked it up that's supposed to actually be in our library
yeah
but it's not now i've
mhm
left a note for a while now them
is mm
to try and locate it but
er what er
it's the
is it a book or a journal
no it's a journal it's the
erm
erm disease mental disease or something
well is it er there's a thing about general nervous and mental dis
general nervous and mental disease that's the one yeah
yeah oh right
it's one of seventy which is supposedly the first one they've got
mm
there but
oh right erm well often the coverage even when they think they've got it is not terribly good
mm
erm for some reason certain issues don't seem to have appeared in the first place
no
or if they have people have nicked them and
right
all sorts of other things
yeah
it's er it's not that UNK er have you checked birmingham university library or anything like that
it might be worth a bit of bus riding around
i haven't yet no cos yeah i was
and you might be able to get it erm
me and UNK wanna go over there and you know i'll
oh yes
and he wants to get it for his disability project to see if he can get
oh right so mhm
you know i think we're gonna take a trip over anyway so
yeah excellent good so you might be able to find some more stuff
right erm questionnaire i've got in contact with the institute again
yeah
erm with these people
mhm
erm she said she thought everything would be okay apart from partial blind due to accident after teenage years cos it's basically it's actually a college
mhm
which she said they do have people who don't progress much staying on
yeah
but on the whole it's like
yeah
you know sixteen to mostly
yeah
sixteen to twenty one year olds
mhm
so erm
so er
see talk i'm talking about twenty five
okay so it yeah it looks like quite a reasonable number of people possibly
yeah
yeah
good
yeah
oh and she's just said you know get 'em a questionnaire done that was really what was
yeah fine
you know wanted to get with you really
yes erm
erm right yeah this was just asking myself really and for you
mhm
erm right in the book and other ones i've read cos i've also got well i've got quite a few UNK with
yeah good
with the various ones so erm some of them done like open ended see what i was wondering was where i wrote this organized here
yeah
yeah it was analyzing it erm whether i wanted to do general questions on general dreams that a
mm
tell me how their dreams are formed
yeah
or which is one which they've done in there is take a specific dream which they've had which is vivid to them
mhm
and describe with all feelings and everything
yeah
and trying to
mm
as opposed to as UNK questions to ask
yeah
about analysis or me giving them the dream and i have to sort of like get out for myself what
yeah
how they do it
well i mean you could do a bit of both i don't see why you can't sort of start out with some general stuff about whether
that's what that's what i was thinking that's what i was thinking of doing yeah
they actually experience dreams at all
yeah
you know because some people claim not to blind and sighted er you know and then maybe you can sort of say well you know what sort of things do you see what sort of things do you feel and then get on to something specific
mm
you know can you think of one you might've had last night or one that you particularly remember or something like that
yeah
they've had some
and try and
incredible dreams
oh right so you actually er mm
it's really funny yeah i went over there erm it was really to meet the woman but i ended up erm she said do you wanna spend the afternoon with them
yeah
so they had like an hour break so i spent in a room
see the trouble the trouble which i found was it was difficult trying you know it's not about dream con you know it's not about
mm
dream meaning and
yeah
they were sort of like you know interested in what i you know you see what i mean
it was difficult
oh yeah so yeah absolutely yes there's that er whenever UNK to do with UNK
yeah
there's that suspicion that you're trying to
yeah
er access what their UNK all about you know they mm
there's one bloke had a erm speaking a dog which spoke to them which gave them the
oh yeah
for the next day
mm
races oh i mean you know
yeah
they're quite
yeah
erm
were the UNK tips any good or er did it turn out
he said he could never remember them
oh right
he says he can never remember the names it's the times that er
mm
yeah er
he's not a UNK yet
no so perhaps not mm
oh perhaps he perhaps he has the knowledge but has difficulty in er UNK his way to the betting shop to do anything about it
anyway erm
right i've results see this is
mm
this is really what i'm
yeah
comparison of subjects within groups and between groups i thought that's
yeah mm
like a typical analysis variance
well yeah it cer it certainly
but
it certainly can be
erm it depends on erm it depends on what you ask them though er if you get erm excuse me
if you get er i'm just trying not to UNK the fabric just yet
erm sorry that's going on the tape recorder isn't it
never mind
erm
if you it depends on what you do i mean if you're generating quantitative material you know if you get some sort of scale UNK of things like sort of estimates of how frequently they dream
that's exactly why i wanted that because they've done
estimates of erm yeah so they've actually got a standard questionnaire in this paper that you can't find yet
mm
mm
right good
erm you know all feelings of how vivid they are on average or feelings about how you know any UNK anything you can write a question about that you can put on a scale of some sort
yeah
that you can try and get them to say well is that sort of UNK vivid or very vivid or very vivid or absolutely UNK just like real life or erm i don't know what you'd be able to do erm it's obviously gotta be something that you can present UNK
yeah
er but erm that kind of thing where you can sort of scale the responses in some way or say how many times a week or say how many times in the last year or how many times since christmas or something erm fine yeah you can do you can do UNK on that you can hopefully find p less than point o five etcetera between the different groups
mm
you can also erm maybe try and UNK things like oh i don't know how frequently they came claim to dream with how much they rate their enjoyment of dreams on average or you know all these kinds of things are possible
mm
erm equally if you can't get any significant differences between the five different groups of five people you can try and split the stuff up once you've got the data you can try and split it up in other ways divide them into two groups and see
yeah
if you know there are any other kinds of differences
mm
with wi is
yeah sorry yeah
obviously with the questionnaire i'm going i wanna get like you said a lot of results where i can split them up you know
yeah
it's really getting the questionnaire in a good format that's what
yeah mm
i'm worried about cos basically it leads on i know
yeah
you know talking to five you know people who've done their projects they've said some of the trouble going out
yeah
you know was that they'd got results which they couldn't sort of like apply
mm
so i'm trying to do it
yeah
you know look at the results and to effectively try and to sort of like estimate them
yeah
mm yeah
the poor old printer seems to have broken it won't it won't
it won't make the paper lie down flat when er when it's finished
yeah that's just an updated list of project people because some people have changed their titles and some people have
there's some interesting titles isn't there
yeah
i'm really i was really impressed
mm
so erm yeah so i don't know in some ways what the questionnaire actually ends up looking like is up to you i mean you've already spoken to some of these people and spoken to some of the organizations involved
yeah
and stuff like that so i mean in a sense you're by now a fairly good judge of the way to go about this sort of thing you're a fairly good judge of what sort of things are important perhaps the way in which people describe stuff and you know words concepts UNK erm all that kind of thing which obviously it helps if your questionnaire fits in with
yeah
erm so erm i don't know it's just down to generating some questions
mm
i mean you may want to er for example you know in some ways some of the responses may fit in quite nicely as a point on a scale or something like that you may have some you know be able to in fact i advise you to come up with a fair number of quantitative type questions
right
where you get a scale response to them and we can do UNK on but equally if you get people to describe their most recent dream or describe their most erm you know UNK dream or you know a good one that they've had in the last year or something like that you may want to try and get that on tape or something like that erm if possible yeah
yeah i was wondering about using tape actually
i'm afraid i i've only got one spare tape recorder and i've lent it to somebody already erm
yeah
so mm
i've got one
erm so er it's sometimes possible to borrow from the university but they usually they usually make it very difficult for one so er oh thanks erm so erm anyway because with a thing like people's accounts of dreams you may want to sort of go back and look at them you know sort of how people have expressed them in their own words they may have er you know produced some nice interesting quotes or something like that
mm
you know to er
yeah
er you know express the dream in or express their feelings about it
well it's very it's really interesting actually i had
yeah mm
a brilliant afternoon it was
yeah good
it was really exciting
yeah
erm
so er
other things to right
mm
i've got in the introduction
mm
er do you think it should be in the form of like a erm you know abstract introduction method er yeah
yeah i think that's usually the UNK thing to go for with these things
right
however you've done the UNK investigation it looks like you've already spotted some literature of various kinds
mhm
articles books and stuff like that which talk about this thing erm it helps obviously if you can link in what you're asking people to some of these previous ideas theories bits of evidence
and stuff like that
mm
so it looks like when you write it up it looks like some it's got some sort of continuous argument to it
mm
yeah
which often looks quite nice so that even if what you've found doesn't quite match up with what they've found you can say well look you know these theories ideas are need UNK they're a bit inadequate as they stand because what happens when somebody tells you this what happens when somebody says this erm you know we can we can revise them in the following way
mm
which is question section erm you know you can tell that kind of s equally
yeah
you may find that certain pe
mm
got so much dreams
mm
erm but you know when you
yeah
go through it's quite you know
yeah
applicable a lot of
cos i mean those mental rotation tasks are you know fairly standard er cognitive tests that
mm
are sometimes used as part of i q tests and things like that sometimes
right
so er that's old is it shepherd and UNK no it's not in this case but i think they invented the task yes they did good old shepherd and UNK
erm er so erm yeah er you know sort of UNK ability type
mm
things
erm tt yeah but er so anyway whatever UNK you can draw out of these things
mm
you know in terms of not necessarily the precise content but you can get erm some general idea about how people have studied the mental life of blind persons and how you know maybe it's interesting that er presumably most of the people who've studied it are themselves sighted rather than blind themselves you know
that's right yeah
i mean it's like the able UNK studying the disabled men studying women
mm
UNK studying UNK you know all those other kinds of UNK in psychology in the social sciences erm which might be interesting erm cos like guy sometimes says about erm when he was er talking to some er deaf people well perhaps not UNK the right word but communicating with some deaf people about their about their problems i mean this bloke said you UNK are all the same you just think that deaf people need UNK implement
yeah said that
i UNK and yeah that kind of thing and er whereas you know in this guy's view it would erm involve the UNK of the whole culture of sign language
mm
you know that you know he saw something valuable and wanted to preserve presumably so
yeah i think cos he said about that in the lecture about the
mm yeah mm
sort of like friction it caused
mm yeah
yeah erm so er you know you may find some UNK of a more you know kind of er i don't know UNK understanding on the part of blind people as to you know what it means to you know kind of have their life investigated
well one of the well one of them was saying
mm
like a lot of people ask
mm
about the dreams of UNK you know ask us and er
yeah
yeah
said you know they ask us about colour and
mhm
you know said you know it's so UNK of them to ask us that you know if you're
yeah
completely blind you know the concept of colour they said
mm
mm
they said colour was one of the hardest
mm
things to like a colour green you'd have to
yeah
describe it as fresh you know and
but that we only have that that's only by association for sighted people yeah
that's right exactly so
so
you know they said mm that's right
mm
mm
now
yeah
another thing was in the introduction i wondered how much explanation of like general structured dreams
mm are there people coming in
oh no it's a they've UNK off oh never mind
mm
it's just some students that UNK well mature student who graduated last year so anyway carry on
mm yeah
erm it was sort of really from this book it's nineteen ninety one erm which is
yeah
right good
mm
you know all looking into how dreams of erm able sighted people and how
mm
much do you want on that if you see what i mean to describe about dreams that
yeah erm
to for comparison
well it's one of these things where if you sort of have a
cos it's quite detailed
have a read of things and then on the basis of what your UNK tell you then you can sort of focus it a bit more on erm tt you know the stuff that er erm you know the stuff that comes out in the literature that's particularly
well suited or well fitted with the with the stuff that you know you've got erm i mean that's probably the best way to do it and i also find actually trying to write things sh myself shows up the holes in arguments shows up the bits that you need yet to fill in sort of thing
mm
erm so i mean what i did with my final year project was actually try to write something which was very sort of wide ranging and broad which sort of was like a first dr draft of an introduction and then once i got more data
mm
sorted you know i could i could try and zero it in a bit more on what the data was about erm
what did you do it on
it was about er the press and unemployment and it was about the way the effects of unemployment were written about in well UNK and popular newspapers it also involved a bit of a study where i gave people some articles to show which had been typed up in a fairly anonymous format and got them to rate them in various ways and that was in let me see nineteen eighty three long time ago
oh yeah UNK are UNK past like sundays
it's terrible er yeah it does it goes faster
erm yeah so i mean that's generally the way to go so i th i think you know it's probably worth working away towards a more specific set of questions that you might want to ask and think of ways of UNK them so you get some sort of you know numerical information in the end
equally you know things that might prompt people to talk to describe dreams to tell stories and that
mm
erm so er
erm the other thing
that kind of thing
cos they were quite interested cos they hadn't had like anyone actually properly doing research or anything erm
mm
she said you know could she have a copy and i said
mm
you know i'll do a copy in UNK
yeah fine
as well which they said
oh wow
would be absolutely brilliant and
excellent
she said she would erm cos it's erm well it would work out about forty pound to have it done thirty five
what have it done in UNK
mm
er but she said she
oh that's not as bad as i thought because i'd always heard that it was like really expensive to produce er material in UNK
apparently as long as i get it on a p c disk five inch
mhm
well she said actually she said she's gonna try and erm
mm
tt put it through the books there as well so
yeah
you know she's gonna take off about
mm
fifteen pound there and i've chat
mm
i UNK to the bloke as well who did the
mm
who was partially blind as well actually who did the erm
yeah
mm
processing and he said you know that'd be fine to do so
yeah
well i suppose you know once you've got a machine that effectively like a big dot r dot matrix i would've you could er you could do it with something like a desk top printer er
mm
and you know maybe it's getting easier these days mm
yeah
i was i was surprised i thought it'd be a lot more cos i just you know
mm
UNK just to see if i could do it but er
yeah
because in the early days when it was invented i mean people were actually UNK the dots on by hand individually erm so er anyway yeah so yeah that would be excellent yeah mm
but i just thought you know it'd be nice to give it because they have been i mean they've been really helpful and
excellent yeah
so
good cos that's always the
yeah
thing with dealing with outside organizations you know that sometimes they're
yeah
either a bit off putting or a bit slow or a bit you know all sorts
mm
of other things so er so that's er seems like so far so good almost
erm you know fingers crossed erm
yeah exactly yeah
anyway at least you've made contact and it seems like it's going okay
yeah exactly there wasn't sort of
and that's the main erm
any friction at all between us so
mhm yeah good erm
i think that's about the lot really
think what i'll do is try and try and get hold of the other report and then
yeah
mm
erm if i can bring a sample questionnaire when i've done it to you i mean i'll see
yeah certainly yes
mm
you know when i get there so obviously
mm
yeah
then i'll make an appointment and just
yeah great stuff
if you so if you come in come in next week some time and
yeah
yeah
also it goes without saying i mean the people at the other end would probably like to see a copy before you start just for to see if they can suggest
mm
anything just for approval you know cos people like to think
yeah i mean that's what that's what they would er
they've been asked and stuff like that
yeah
i phoned up this week just to say i'm getting on with it and they sort of like she said she'd
mm
mm
yeah
try and get there's sorted out
yeah
yeah
good so er
UNK ho
right oh well glad to see er things are happening and you know
things are progressing
so much
mm
it's ridiculous this term
yeah
yeah mm right good
we've got four hundred four hundred words a day we calculated we've gotta do
oh right er
dunno if that's a good way of looking at it
yeah well i dunno i'm UNK the easter holidays cos i've got like erm we're probably gonna have about two hundred pieces of coursework to mark over easter then there's and they're sort of you know UNK things and things like that erm and then there's first week next term there's like all these second year social which is well over a hundred of them plus about forty final year projects will come in plus about i'm hoping it'll only be twenty things from UNK but it might be as many as fifty if the other person gives me all their marking er as they have they've given some indication that they will
oh it's alright i'll give you a couple of hundred quid for it but you know it's all it's all
mm
so erm yeah just hope i don't get ill between now and round about july i think it'll all be over
that'd be the wouldn't it
so yeah i mean if you have flu for a week or something you know everything
yeah exactly
everything er
once you get a week out of hand you know it just goes
mm yeah when it's all sort of tightly packed together
mm
when it's all like an interference fit and there's not much room
oh i looked up about the last the last essay i did cos it was about erm
mm
smoking and trying to change erm strategies towards it i don't know if you remember
erm it was
it was about
i remember doing someone smoking i can't remember yours specifically erm unfortunately so
oh it was just erm cos it said about cos i couldn't work it out cos he said about a reference which was
mm
eighty one reference and the magazine wasn't out till
well hang ab you'd er you'd put er you'd put the date some time in ninety four
yeah
somewhere er which or if it was the one
it was eighty three it was
if it oh right so it was er
but i looked and it was actually
oh if it if it was if it w if it was that one i think i think there was some dis if it's the thing i'm thinking of there was some discrepancy i think it was alright in the s on one occasion there was some stuff which i couldn't find at the end
yeah
but there was some stuff with like dates that hadn't happened yet in ninety four or something er
it was it was two magazines but what it actually was which i
yeah
mm
if i think if that's the one i was thinking was mm
it's actually an am it was it was an american book which cos it was just seventeen
yeah
and good housekeeping magazine which didn't
oh
oh right erm oh we're talking about the actual titles of the things that didn't start till oh the sort of u k version
yeah that's right that was the problem
didn't start till later
i didn't know that's it's UNK it was the american one that's what i
oh it was the american version
ah i beg oh i beg your pardon in that case erm
no that yeah that's i couldn't work it out because
because i UNK i remember when the if it was the seventeen er i remember when that was launched in the in the u k and it was
mm
some time after
i didn't have any idea
the original
cos i saw that and thought
mm
you know it applied to the british
yeah
cos i didn't just
erm
but it was the american they're american magazines
mm
oh right yeah
so
oh i beg your pardon then
no
no it's no it's alright it just it just puzzled me because i couldn't see where it had might have come from
well i thought
yeah
UNK ho then
mm
i'll get on
yeah good
okay
so was it also you that had got some dates in the references that hadn't happened yet like the erm pe there was somebody it might have been you had actually referred to things that you know sort of twenty first of the fourth ninety four and things like that and it was sort of
don't think so
oh it was probably not you that was probably somebody else then but i remember seeing that you know
yeah i don't remember no i think that was
no that was er that was another example of peculiar dates in references and er stuff like
they can obviously see in the future
yes i was thinking that you know perhaps they could er
quite UNK really a waste of
you know sort of erm read the racing columns or the er or the or the or the or the
i think that's
or the stock market reports or something like that
yeah mm
right cheers then
okay right
i'll just see if that er that character who was looking in the UNK still around
mm
oh right
yeah so er ah
cheers
okay cheers
oh hello i just wanna say hello to pete
right
and well and to you as well UNK but er i haven't seen UNK i haven't seen pete for a while
i'll get some of this later
yeah
mm
mm
i went to as we came down suddenly realized you'd got somebody there you were obviously deep in conference so er
yeah
but i i'll give you a knock when i've finished if i can
yeah fine yes please do i might there might be somebody else in there with me by then er
well i won't disturb you
it's quite rare i have a spare moment these days but er yeah please do er give us a knock when you've finished here
right cheers
bye
oh what er
but it's in the mail
yeah
arrive this afternoon i've sent it back
oh excellent because i
to the er
mm
to the writer to the author of the chap
yeah
of the erm
yeah
okay well it will be interesting to see what er what other people have said about it because i was sort of fishing around a bit in the dark and looking at the UNK manual
one review was absolutely crap
mhm
just about three lines
oh
the other review is really good just as good as yours and he and you are saying very much the same things
well i never
oh right
so the s p s manual didn't let me down then
i did take out one thing about the bible since it was going to somebody in the states in the bible belt and i didn't
ah you never know
i didn't like to take any risks
you never know yes okay well that's er
i did wipe out your comment about the bible
oh well that's fine
but apart from that it went in
mm
exactly as you'd put it
right okay so they can they can i ca they can er UNK me and send me death threats now if they so desire
well they don't know it's anonymous
oh right yeah
i took your signature off the bottom
okay well i don't mind them knowing who i am i er i mean it's a you know if they do want to mm
anonymous
yeah
anyway i must get on
see you later
so okay right
cheers
right
i don't want to encourage erm mention this morning or is that gonna be embarrassing
no
or sh right okay UNK plugged in microphone on and off we go
okay
no problem
oh dear ha parcels i love parcels
i tell you what would you like to open the parcels
yeah
right that'll give you something to do
erm not exactly no
right
erm UNK
ah
well what can we do for you
did you
yes i did
yes erm let's just er find it again no that's not it i must have it here somewhere
no it hasn't been there for a little while british national corpus i've been carrying it around with me
and i wonder what i've done with it
UNK and no erm as i recollect er ah
here it is
i was gonna say as i recollect i didn't see much wrong with it that i would disagree with erm i think it's nice to see you know sort of progress seems to be going on and erm er what i would say is sort of it might be a good idea to sort of line the numbers up a bit more but erm
yeah
yeah
er
i did actually
aside fr
i looked at it UNK i changed a bit
mm
myself i could feel that the order
yeah
of the questions weren't
mhm
cos like
so is this like er s er yet another version from this or is that like an older one er
oh well it's the same questions i've just changed the
mm
order of the questions
yeah
aha
cos i thought maybe asking about their own experience but okay
mhm
before like putting all these categories cos it
yeah
yeah
might put ideas
yeah
in their head or something
yeah erm that might be true but then sometimes it can be an UNK to put ideas in people's heads so they actually write something
oh right
erm because i have had the trouble of
asking open ended questions and like nobody says anything so er
oh
erm however i always find with questionnaires it's very difficult to predict what's going to go wrong in advance so
mm
erm you might as well do a bit of a erm you know kind of give it a go and see what happens
mm
erm now erm i think er i think yeah that was okay
it might be if there's a little bit of room it might be worth sort of s moving the numbers slightly towards the erm items so that because if you sort of
yeah
look across it's you know can be a bit
that was what i
yeah
thought about that
i thought about putting
mm
but then i thought it might take up too much space
well i wouldn't worry too much about UNK it all together tightly because it's erm one of the few things we've still got a budget for is photocopying student questionnaires so you m you know you might as well take advantage of that it doesn't erm it doesn't cost you anything and the actual difference it makes to the university and to erm world resources is very slight indeed i think
okay
so er you know
okay
er so you might want to you know kind of space it out slightly erm
yeah
er right erm tt yep that seems to be okay i didn't erm no i was reading this on this morning just after the clinical lecture and i didn't see anything that i thought would be UNK erm you know given you know sort of what i've seen in your coursework so far you seem to have got a fairly good idea of what you can ask and what you can get away with and what sorts of things you think are useful and stuff like that so erm you know i'm entirely happy with your judgment as to the content erm you know because it's part of an ongoing pr project and it's not just something that you've knocked off in half an hour or anything so erm
you know i think i think usually what i say about questionnaires is towards the business of you know kind of writing them in people's own words that sort of fit in with ordinary language okay putting them in a sensible order advising people to do scale type things with five or seven points or something which you've got a lot of already so a lot of the comments that i normally make on people's questionnaires er you can take as read as it were erm so i think erm you know just really one or two minor things about layout like you know you know sort of space and moving things around a wee bit it might make them easier to read but again as i say that's a you know relatively minor erm problem
so in the other version that you've got what sort of changes to the order have you made
erm
well i put i put all these questions about erm have you witnessed violence or not i put
yeah
i put them first and then i
mhm
put erm all this about what you think force is
you put all the UNK things
after
there
yeah
erm yeah erm well i wonder erm again it's difficult to tell what's going to work best
in some ways as regards the layout and the appearance of the thing i tend to prefer this version because on this one erm if we have a look at that there's just like l oh my god loads of numbers oh no
yeah
i can't be bothered to answer that throw it away erm
you know erm not that they will but er you know it it's one of these things that sort of looks like there's a bit of variety on it when you've got mm
mm
you know UNK things you know
yeah
with some things to write a few words in some things to tick some things to make a mark on one of the numbers and so forth so erm er you know it's erm but as i say it's difficult to er
well maybe if i got a couple of people to fill in
mm
the different versions and see
yeah fine see which they er which they do a bit of market research as it were yes
mm
erm that can sometimes help certainly yeah but er as i say er i think there should be it should yield a fair amount of data for you and you know with a bit of are you a UNK view or s p s person or any strong
oh
preferences or
i think you have to use s p s cos i didn't
right fair enough
well i did do UNK view in the first year but not very much
yeah
no i
how to use it
find UNK view very difficult to use myself but er when the time comes once you've got a few that are filled in we can erm well i'll show you how to do an s p s data file and erm so you can bash your data in and if you bring it back we can turn it into a system file and analyze it
erm so er that shouldn't be too bad
so i don't know do you do you fancy now kind of giving the different versions to a few people by way of er
yeah
another pilot and see if erm
well i'll just do it in my flat i suppose
yeah
yeah fair enough if that's erm you know how you fancy starting
and then if you
finish it off
any sort of yeah any sort of changes or anything erm er i don't know if you're around sort of early next week we can
yeah
get the
yeah
things UNK and
yeah
and er
it usually takes about three working days and er
okay
and away you go
how subjects are you
erm with a thing like this i mean what i usually say to people it depends on erm if you've got a lot of numerical data oh you might as well have this back for the time being so
UNK hands UNK into it or anything
erm er then it does help if you're looking for p less than point o five and aren't we all these days erm
you know er it helps if erm it helps if the groups that you're comparing between there's about sort of at least twenty people in each sort of thing erm and the same goes for things like things that you might want to do squares on or something like that erm so i mean if you were interested in comparing people who attended very regularly with people who only attended once in a while erm you know it would help if there were about sort of more than forty people altogether so that there was sort of you know
mm
you could UNK split them at whatever the medium was and then you've got two groups to compare erm because it usually looks quite nice if you've got something comparative as well as looking at the average sort of you know pattern of responses on the questionnaire
equally if you've got erm i don't know what other kinds of differences you might want to erm er look for but again if you're looking for differences it helps if there's about sort of twenty people in each of the groups sort of thing
or if you're comparing people with themselves as it were that is looking for differences between how they answer one question and how they answer another question then sort of you know kind of twenty or more people and you've got a reasonable chance of showing up some p less than point o fives
erm i don't know that's this is not in any official UNK books but it's just my experience with UNK projects that if you get more than there's a sort of critical mass of about forty UNK and then you're much more likely to start showing some interesting UNK significant findings for some reason erm i don't quite know why but er it's one of life's little UNK but er so that's usually if there's a lot of numerical data what i'd try and advise people to er to get
oh that's
so you know i mean more than that by all means you know er so much the better you know y the more the UNK but erm certainly you know kind of it's a good idea to at least try and get that many erm
yeah
so er
i've got i've got in touch with a football supporters society
mm
and erm they've got eighty members so
oh right
mhm
so they're like sending me a list well they sent me back a half list
mm
i said to them can i have a list they said oh yeah sure she went we'll put it in your
mm
mm
pigeon hole you know it's just like bit of scrap of paper with like a few names on it
mm
and they said oh we'll get the list to you the full list to you as soon as possible i mean
yeah
that was about two weeks ago
yeah
well i mean it's often things that people do in their spare time the record keeping isn't perfect and
yeah that's the thing they haven't got time yeah
they don't have a you know kind of computer based mailing list that they can print out or something you know
no yeah i know that so
mm
so i should
yeah
if i if i get in touch with them then i'll
mm
yeah i mean that might certainly give you some you know kind of you know regular UNK to er to
yeah
to look at erm so er yeah
great
are you into football very much yourself or er
yeah
oh right mm so it's it this UNK out of a personal interest thing
yeah
oh right
mm
yeah i support bristol city
oh right
are you from that part of the world at all or
er forest of dean
oh right so er mm
yeah it's the nearest place really
yeah within the nearest place with a UNK
with a yeah
football team possibly yeah
anyway
right
right so er
i think that's everything
yeah
so if i get it laid out again then you know
yeah fine erm but as i say it's just sort of you know kind of minor layout changes that's all i was suggesting
yeah
so you know at a pinch you could probably run it like that and i don't suppose anybody would notice the difference but you know just in terms of you know making things look attractive
right
erm so you know but you may find if you give print off a few and give them to a few people over the weekend
mm
you may find that some additional changes occur to you
mm
which you might want to incorporate anyway so you may not want to print off another version anyway
yeah
so er
erm oh yeah the other thing was it's two sided at the moment is that
mm
best or do you think
erm generally speaking the consensus is it helps if it's sort of on one side
oh right
but how you do your original is up to you i mean it's just what we ask for from UNK and you know they do single sided
okay yeah
double sided UNK
different coloured paper and all you know all this sort of thing
yeah
so er erm er so that's no is there anything else we need to worry about with regard to that
er no i don't think so
so as i say i think it'll i think it'll run okay and behave itself on the assumption you can get some people to fill it in so er
yeah
yeah right
right good
okay
well do have er a pleasant weekend
okay
mm
i shall try to
yeah
and yourself
oh yes i could do with one
are you working
yeah well i'm gonna try and get the final year lecture for tuesday sorted actually on saturday and erm it's usually it's usually guy but i think i'm doing it this week yeah because i've got quite a few to do on things like racist in the media and guy's mate dennis has just written a book and he's given me a UNK of it and it's about how racist psychology is which is
really
yeah and he's spotted racism in the UNK et al UNK and all sorts of all over the place so erm mm there should be something interesting to talk about in that for a start
yeah
so er anyway
okay
more of this on tuesday
see you
mm
bye then
mm
oh hello
so what have we got have they sent me some new UNK
oh lovely
but one's for you and one's for guy
oh i see oh UNK
ah
have you finished in there now
erm yes i've finished with the students
oh right oh i didn't realize there were just two parcels on the erm
yeah look
on the thing and i picked them both up
you see
i thought they were both for me
oh dear
ah
oh well erm
yeah i didn't fancy
let's see
going up to the UNK
no i don't i don't blame you
erm
i sort of started to feel a bit ill before so
yeah
well do er do come in er well did you have a pleasant trip down
erm yeah it was okay it wasn't too bad
mm
alright cos i think we've been sent these on approval to see if we want to adopt them for course material
yeah
you see so erm
they seem quite nice
yeah
erm well i don't know quite what erm they'll be teaching you out of in your er UNK course but erm er i do find the sort of current generation of american UNK quite erm
mm
quite a nice quite exciting erm i tell you what UNK that UNK chair round and sit on that
okay
do you have a drink please or
yes of course
now erm what sort of UNK appeal
now we've got ordinary tea we've got UNK tea we've got coffee out of a coffee machine we've got UNK we've got ordinary tea i've mentioned that already haven't i
erm
we've got soap powder and UNK
oh i'll have some sort of tea that'll do
yeah
well we've got what about some UNK
it's sort of UNK that's quite
yeah
quite UNK i've had a lot of coffee already today
i'll just go and fill the kettle
okay
are you going to eat this cheese roll
well would you like some
i'll have a bit
yeah
erm it's not too
what's in the middle
elderly it's cheese and UNK
oh good i can't
oh well yeah got you there
erm yeah if er you have no objection what it's for is the there's this outfit called the british national corpus and they're trying to make a record of english language as it's used in the late twentieth century erm so it's a sort of resource for further scholarship so it can assist in writing UNK and studying grammar and all sorts of things like that and erm they're attempting to tape conversations from all over the place erm er i've got a bit of UNK about it it's quite interesting erm and in some cases it's sort of out of erm er it's out of people's homes it's out of UNK it's out of meetings it's out of all sorts of things erm at work and at home erm
have you just turned it on now
yeah it's just on at the moment er they didn't hear any the other stuff
oh
erm so
oh yes it's UNK er oxford university press chambers UNK british library UNK university oxford university erm so er it's erm quite interesting so
do you mind if i have a cigarette
no go ahead
are you sure
go ahead i don't no i don't mind people smoking in here it's fine by me
so er oh dear oh i'm a bit UNK
UNK
yeah i mean it er i was up till about two a m so er
what marking
well i've just about finished marking for the moment er what it is erm i went out last night ill advised
so if we could come up
i'll sit at the back probably in the back corner there
basically if you could come up er one group at a time explain er the of your programme and the reasons behind your programme the assumptions that you've made
even the difficulties you've had if you want to go about it where the central problems are if you think there are any particular ones
er if people have any questions on individual presentations then i think we ought to take those questions while the group is up here
so if you could er however you present it just wait behind in case there are any questions where people need clarification
and when we've finished er i'll come and hopefully pull everything together and take this onto the next stage which is the evaluation of the plan
you've got as long as it takes but it won't take i should think more than a few minutes for each group er to do their presentation
so group one if i could ask you to come to your
do you want us to go through everybody knows about
well i don't think they do because we've got here some people who have done the er some people have done an hotel and i think it would be best to explain the whole thing to them
we haven't got an
oh they've all got
but we have got
okay then erm six tanks erm reinforced concrete er two metres square by about two metres high with er on the top
er basically we call this area and the area here we've got er and for the actual set up
er the problem with the job is it's very tight inside there so we've had to use cranes and basically poured concrete er ours is being done by a separate sub contractor
er few problems with the job before we started or during the job er come back to us for a six so far so we have to what we will do is drop them down and er another problem with the job is we're about three week's behind er arranged for them to come in on monday
we had to pull forward it's not due so we've got er so we've given them three days to you see when we worked out the numbers for the we were given all the allowances the rates et UNK et UNK we worked the forecast through and seen huge amounts of time given for which the assumption is that it's all done by hand the job these cranes so the resources how much money had been spent
here the concrete yeah that but we haven't got the resources to do it yet we've just got a couple of assumptions at together at the beginning the tractor and trailer is generally helping moving between cranes loading back and forth so many areas so unless you want us to go through this literally point by point it's question time
anybody got any questions
one problem very small area that's why working at the same time
er another problem we had as well is we had all going at the same time in a very close area as well
er when it comes to the wall UNK seven metres high er top and bottom
that's right
that's right
erm do you identify
erm basically what's in the programme but
erm in your plan you seem to have like two objectives one was
yeah
and the other was which i don't think you said
did you find that a particular problem
yes we had to get them all into the tanks otherwise
okay
right thanks very much indeed
sir when i do present to each training do you think that's
i think it would give erm i what you would probably do would be to put those three things
yeah
oh but that's all right with you
here's your work get on with it but i do understand what has happened here
okay thank you very much i like that
two please
erm good morning ladies and gentlemen
my name is alan and this is terry and we're group two
we're going to talk to you about er farm project and its basic problems which we had to put a programme together and er make the job
erm you've seen this before so
our construction but the only to get there we had to squeeze through a gap this way and come round
now we just have a couple of minor problems to start with
here we go and that is that up to now erm we've only made six UNK we've got to reach for these tanks we want to make sixty and the problem is we're on stop now UNK the whole thing and going on the present rate of production we're going to go up to about week twenty eight
twelve weeks over the time that is UNK in the programme and to do that we're gonna have to produce the twice the rate that we're doing now
so that's just a little summary and terry will fill you in more
er what we can do if the figures are worth eleven and a half days erm seventeen days
that's for the we actually calculated them by using the unit quantity
now ow
we decided one of our first things we had to do was decide on a sequence of construction for these tanks
we tried to keep it as logical as possible and er there you have it
unless you have a base to work off of started to do once we started doing the er the walls take the UNK down out of the way and to release some area off our stock pile we decided to back build so that by the time that we'd done six tanks we'd got half our area taken up by all that material UNK and just flip back to the drawing here what's going to happen is that UNK here
while we're down this area and we've got the cranes UNK in here to do these tanks this way and the pipes coming in this way and the tanks construction going on we need to release this sort of area to be able to get everything so there's more work to do
now what we've decided to do on the UNK for the tanks is to construct er a square frame into UNK er into one hold everything in place while we pour the concrete onto the programme oh there it is
erm just er presentation of the programme of the way and the way we tried to get into everything
you know at the beginning of er week six
i mean sorry week er thirteen that er base six had been poured and therefore so the first thing we did was to get base six as soon as possible
erm we also know that base five UNK is up so we started on base five as soon as we can put as many resources into it as we can we mentioned earlier that er having five hundred people in there made life quite UNK but we decided the more people that helped in there the better and er our objective was to get the er wall UNK up
it was gonna take quite a while so erm we got the base five as quickly as possible so that we had as many hands on the job at once and er we had some UNK getting spare so we decided to make them useful and it's a case of we'd got six tanks to do and if we had a UNK we can't afford to stop the programme so as a er a standby just in case we may never use these we might three or four uses out of but if we do have a UNK we want to be able to replace that straight away so have a spare set and you've got nothing more to do and er get the walls get the er the back build operation right at the very end ongoing till you've got the UNK in er get the UNK up to the five meter level and er get the back build in as quickly as possible
we tried to keep the UNK er occupied doing their UNK bit accurate but safe everybody's gonna be climbing down on that
we've allowed a day for safety checks somewhat excessive but er there's always something that you find on UNK that's not quite right
you're not allowed to work on it and er that's about it really our programme we've decided to er start the pipe at the first position away from the tank construction and we've set out we employed a concrete layer and to lay out the pipes while we're doing nothing and continue on with the so that while this gang is actually laying there's only er six people in total
two actually doing the pipe laying quite heavy pipes er that's it really
thank you very much indeed
any questions from anybody
well what we've decided to do is er know what to do and er this is the gang this is maybe exaggerated if you don't have three people on the bottom if you get any thing else
erm the frame that we've that we will have on site
you'll have one frame
we'll have one frame on site to start with the er steel er around about what we've er planned to do is site the crane and then we can do all the UNK and shut the in these a bit nearer
erm delivery for the steel will come in and we need a crane to UNK and a crane when we're UNK onto the tractor trailer
erm well it is a mobile crane so er one crane will be pretty much fully employed and er if it's busy down here we can always bring the mobile crane
still mobile though
yes
yes it'll probably take quite a while actually
erm here we go
it takes er one and a half days to do the base and er eight days and eight UNK to er to do the walls but two hundred and four days in total can't stop the concrete
very good
thank you very much
yes okay
don't UNK at once
do you want the main programme
chris do you want the main
yes i do
programme
that one
yeah
okay
do you want anything else for that er
just a layout that's all
a layout
this one
yeah
okay
they've gone off
right morning everyone
we're group five
we're working on an hotel project i think and we're up to week thirteen on the programme and i think you might be able to see on week thirteen and given the information we've got at the moment as well it means we're gonna be working on three floors at once so it was the first thing to identify
working on three floors at once we decided to we needed to continue work on the seventh floor before moving up to the eighth and so on to the ninth by the information given us in the er we calculated that the men that were to get onto the programme by the end of the week calculated the production rate for various gangs to see how fast so that's how it was looking
starting work on the seventh floor and allocating gangs accordingly
but you can see you can see already that the production rate is no where near good enough to meet the programme and if it's only on the first part of the seventh floor bearing in mind we've got to be working on three floors at the same time we're only on the first part of the seventh floor and already we've got UNK on day granted it's a major problem
if you carry on i'll show you the situation UNK as we've attempted carrying on the seventh floor all the all the other gangs are still employed working in the previous area
we haven't got enough nice to get some work started on the eighth floor because of the different activities but then again with the activities that are carrying on the seventh floor we can't by the time we get round to the ninth pretty desperate
we've only really got work for the labourers in the form even labourers aren't employed up to the ninth floor cos that work's already been completed
meant to be moving onto the tenth and eleventh floor it only takes them a short time to save time on that or cut down on your labour as usual
there's no need for them to be but there again it's a desperate situation that's it
okay
thanks very much
yeah
what sort of gap
yeah we put the
got it UNK got these sorry
have you got it all UNK up there
wall tiles there now
is it
how do we know whether you
we've assumed we haven't got any information given to us to tell us where so i've made an assumption we've made an assumption that
and we're and then and then i'll start in room one on the seventh floor
where are they going
where are they going after that
yeah
are they just
so on the seventh floor the floor tiles are next and the next job they're doing is on the eighth which is more floor UNK
what they're doing before or what they're doing afterwards
both
wouldn't be able to read it
the wouldn't be able to read it
well i'm not going to
i'm not going to
but i can show you i can show you the eighth floor and show you where the gang where is the eighth floor
three four seven
yeah
and go on to four eight three
yeah
yeah
ah but they can't start we can't start
but we don't know we haven't that information
we've got to make we've got make some assumption
yeah we don't know which numbers
yeah
i don't know
no it's erm on monday on monday morning they could've been working
another room
yes
yep
but it couldn't be working in the room if we had control of the numbers though
couldn't be working in the room if we had control of the numbers
it would've been best with a bigger piece bigger programme because then we could've it was easy to see where we were UNK
if we had started on week one where if we'd had complete programme information up to week thirteen when that'd be more complete wouldn't it
well that's it yeah
yeah
no they're they are complete up to programme by wednesday dinner time
they don't do anything more than the than UNK to
well they can do
they can do if they want or they can progress onto other rooms to get time back that way but anyway can't you we have er a target to meet on the programme of x percentage time and they will meet that far wednesday afternoon so we haven't continued and shown
i take your point
in reality they would be they'd be moving onto another area
but then we don't know which other areas are ready do we
right
i like i like that any other questions
no
thank you very much indeed
good
group four next
this was ian by the way
yeah morning everyone
we're group four looking at the er the hotel complex which has been explained before hand
erm we approached the first project we were looking at the information we had available er looking at the strength of the work a lot of information as you can see the er and looking at the er a definite lack of
comments
yeah sure
no we've had the main update
they should know what
fine
fine okay laid anybody else off
no we've managed to keep everybody else in er in work
yeah
my eyesight is not what it used to be
er where do they go
they go up to floor eight
why can't they good
any anything else
everything else
yeah we got we got all four hours a night
sorry
where did you get from
er from the information we was given
erm the
it depends how UNK it down a bit
so you just
yeah
yeah
from other jobs we've done
yep that's good
pardon
thank you very much indeed
group three
hello everybody
well what we did was we what we did was we erm found the alarm system to try and calculate some reasonable output rates erm but what we found was the output rates seemed incredibly low using based on the completion that they have got so what we was we erm took the nine week's work that they'd done and erm plus they'd obviously based our output rates on that erm just for a little example using the allowances we haven't got whereas actually we'd been calculating it on what they hadn't worked so that was basically what we so moving on to the actual short term programme
okay
rather than looking at the proposal we decided that it was so that's what we did really and that's why if you have a look down there right so all we're doing then we're working through the resources and allocating them room numbers erm and then when that's done so that's what we did for each of the little rooms
yeah but basically from that programme all the er you can see all the resources were really being used all week and but i had a problem when we came to do the bedrooms that er you can there we ran out of work for the UNK to do er removing this thing once you've removed and then i managed to squeeze in but where the second UNK erm up to room twenty three but rather than erm have just one gang than and not using as many as the resources as we possibly could i let them gave the second gang a few rooms that they could actually squeeze in without UNK i've let them do up to room twenty three and then and then basically the UNK and they have to come in after everybody else has done what they monday morning basically we just decided that we really needed more resources the earlier sequence of events to get so we were getting to so whether we've been given
i did the erm it's a bit tricky to describe where with the active areas because you haven't got room
UNK
yeah we hadn't got time
and we didn't do this
too tricky
is that it
yeah
thanks very much
i thought about that
on the basis of our calculation
erm could i could i on the er diagram concerned
well you can have a look
right we've got erm
UNK
sorry tuesday afternoon
from three to er twenty eight
have you got your purse
well the erm oh
saved by the bell
i think i think in fact you're not having the problems that we're having where it's very difficult so you've got er a really nice representation but haven't quite gone far enough
cos we did actually we went to before we went putting the things together making sure that we weren't starting the next activity until the rooms would be finished
however when we decided this morning to change the whole way of presentation yeah i was just getting along to that
erm is it probably that the numbers
all right i accept that but basically
yeah well if we had if we had of had more time we could've like written each individual room but really i just put the numbers down quickly just to demonstrate
there was one
is it the same sort of thing
i wanted to
okay
the resources were broken down also into groups er a gang per room
whereas really then if you have bathroom they might as well be working in that same bedroom at the same time whereas we had two separate gangs
where do you think
i mean bearing in mind that all the resources were broken down presumably the were separate gangs we couldn't really make
erm
they were definitely coming weren't they for the UNK
UNK
yeah
good
thank you very much indeed
thank you everybody very well done
erm do you want to get a coffee before we start again
yes
we've switched the recorder on so we're gonna start
thank you for those presentations i thought they were very good
i thought that the thought of er the thoughts gone into your erm plans and your presentation was much greater than we've had on previous courses
i think you've been a lot more UNK and got a lot er potentially a lot more out of it
i'd like to spend a few minutes now trying to pull that together and then go onto how we evaluate these plans because you've all produced these and wouldn't you like to know how good they are and how bad they are
can you tell how good they are and how bad they are
er quite often on real projects people produce these plans and they get out and work to that and never had to pause to think this is a good one this is a bad one
can we improve it
does it need improving
electronics was never my strong point
they hadn't invented electronics when i was still had one
wireless
wireless
yeah still had wireless
could i take er a minute and just try and look at the steps that you've gone through and i tried to write down as you were doing it giving your presentation the steps which i think everybody eventually went through either formally or informally and i think if we look at these steps you'll agree yes i needed that and i did that or we didn't do it formally
er step one i think is assess the current state
where were we
and some of you had difficulty doing this erm i think one of the hotel er groups said to me i didn't know which rooms had been done
well we needed to know which rooms had been done
another group just said they were rooms one through ten and er one of the tank farm group said we didn't know exactly where we were but this was i think the assumptions that group two told me were er were about that
is that right
i can't remember
so we have to assess the current state and if we didn't know then in our particular example cos if we hadn't made the room numbers had been done
er and thi this lead us to a list of things to do
is that right
no you may have said ah i've got room this to do i've got this base to do this base UNK base erm thi this wall er UNK to do
so in both projects i think we had to do that first step
er we had to get the number of resources
if only i could spell resources number of resources
now everybody had to do that
er there you said i'd got three UNK gangs or four UNK gangs six a gang er and here you said i'd got so many so we had to do that
they weren't any good by themselves er these things because i the other thing which you had to get from somewhere was output rates
how good were people at UNK er wall UNK or fixing base steel
how long did it take er a UNK gang to do first fix UNK
the questions are identical i think
they were just slightly different types of work which were being done
in this one it might've been slightly easier because everything was UNK out you had to do you had to do UNK you had to do electrical
in this one it wasn't quite so er straightforward in that we hadn't given you the actual activities to do
we'd given you the activities to do there so you could find the output of them
in this one we hadn't told you that you had to strip UNK that you had to er make the UNK that you had to fix the steel you had to know this from your own knowledge
yeah
so you had to know that in order to pour concrete you had to have something to pour it into and you had to put the erm you had to have er UNK as well
bu but basically the output rates were you had to do
you had to think of a method and the method was particularly difficult i think on the tank farm one where this is the sort of method that i am thinking here of how on earth am i going to build it on the hotel
it wa was very prescribed
you didn't have much choice in what you did
yeah
you had a you had a choice in sequence of doing things but you didn't have a choice in method whereas in the tank farm i think you had a choice of method
you could say i'm going to do all four walls together or i'm going to do one wall at a time
yeah
erm and it was quite interesting but i think that the two groups that presented actually did had chosen different methods
is that correct
yeah
so you had to choose that er you have to do that and the fifth thing that i wrote down here which i had to do a sequence er of work
now there are two UNK here i think erm in all these things
you have to do the detail sequence er so for the tank farm this is here i've got to do the UNK before the UNK before the concrete or the other way round i've got to the UNK before the UNK before the concrete
and that's an on going thing wherever you do it this is the detail sequence
on the hotel the sequence was i've got to do the first fix UNK before i do the second fix UNK
i've gotta do it in this order
yeah
and so for each one of them you might've started by having got all this what you could do then is write for each individual element a tank base a tank wall a bedroom or a bathroom you can produce i would suggest a little bar chart which might look like that for one unit
and this is a chart where this was activity down here and time along there
so this would be a little bar chart for one bedroom one bathroom base wall whatever it is
and that brings together all of these things here
the number of resources output rates the method the sequence
okay
so that we've got there you've got to do lots of different concrete and UNK slightly different thing here you've got to do lots and lots of these
you've gotta do thirty six on one floor thirty six on another floor and the next thing that you got is all the information together where all you've got to do is put that lots of those together and it's er it's er a UNK around procedure isn't it
yeah
and you know they can't go this one can't go earlier than that one because we've got the sequence and so if we got through these steps i think that those steps are the same steps that we go through on any project
and indeed when bill yesterday asked you what do you need to do short term planning
if you go back and look at your list i wouldn't mind betting that your list includes we need to know the sequence we need to know the number of resources we need to know the output rates we need to know the method
yeah
i wouldn't mind betting that bill's lists that you gave him actually contained all these things and only then can we actually put them down in order
it's a great shame that when we are presented with er a problem when we're out on site we actually forget all these things and i think that probably it took you an hour or so yesterday to actually recognise oh yes i need this and i need this and i need this
once you've got them yeah
the problem actually becomes much more UNK
would you agree
yeah
and i certainly think the results that you've produced show that the problem is quite UNK because i think in the end you've actually produced a very good programme for work
all of them
because you've had to make different assumptions and you've er decided different ways are different
but i think your thinking has gone along these lines which is fundamental to any planning programme
now when you're out on site some of these things you have to do each week
some of them you don't have to do each week because they're there from previous work on the site
so you would know the output rate or you think you'd know the output rates but you only know those output rates if somebody bothered to collect them
somebody might not have collected them so you might have to and as work changes it would er then the method
we would hope that has been defined er by somebody of the hierarchy but if we're moving onto new work areas it might not the sequence maybe self evident but it may not be and it would be nice to have it written down
i think especially in the in the hotel project it's useful to have a little bar chart saying this is what goes on in a bathroom
yeah
even okay even if we the reason that we need the output rate was to find the length of this bar
yeah
if you wish that to send things out to UNK first of all you've got to have it reasonable but you still need the length of that bar
that's what i'm saying
and so you're assuming the output rate in order to get the length of that bar
erm you might do chris
i i'm not arguing with you
i think that it is sensible even when you send stuff out to UNK to make sure that you've got a reasonable plan especially when you send out to UNK because they're very hard to control anyway and you've got to make sure that you've not sent unrealistic targets either too high or too low
and i think there's a lot of goes on here
er in the real world where people say you do it it's yours
whereas in reality i think people have got to take responsibility and say this is a reasonable time for you to do it in and we will control that reasonable time
yeah
but i do take your point of course
ah right
we've got to get the things to do but quite often if you are we've got to have those things to do you've got finish by a particular time
if i told you now that we needed another five gangs of floor UNK or whatever it was which you hadn't got enough of it won't be floor UNK something you haven't got enough of everything could you get them by monday
as short term you can't at medium and long term you can and that's where we've got to recognise in order to UNK the resources onto site
but really at short term i still believe that we are doing this and this is what we're aiming at this
use the available resources but maybe the wrong ones because somebody in the position of authority hasn't recognised or he hasn't got enough to finish the project by the client required date
yes to attempt to achieve it
using available resources to attempt to achieve it
but you see what we've got is a set of fairly standard steps here which you got through no matter what the project and i hope that er you've all had a bit of practice at that
what i'd like to do now is reach for another er set of notes and er talk about change direction a bit and talk about checking erm short term programmes
sorry if we get one of the main problems that i find is that i've already said is that people produce short term programmes and they get issued
nobody actually knows whether they're right whether they're wrong or if there are any problems with them
i think that whenever there's a programme it ought to be agreed above and below er a hierarchy
so what do you think of this
is that alright
is there a problem with that
is it doing what we want
what sort of things do you think should be checked in a in a programme
feasibility
feasibility
by that you mean the order of things we ought to think about so
well i mean i'm really saying can you actually
oh we've got lots of things to do
er can i can i take a few of those er an and try and separate them
yeah
you've gotta break it down
i want to break it down yes
i really want to break it down
erm one thing that you said there having all these people in there in the room
what erm what do we call that
i think
i think there're a few things erm i think you asked the question er peter about having eighteen people on one base all got to work together
i thought the not that i made there was safety
yeah
yeah
and er this clash might be give rise to a safety aspect
it may not be the first thing at the top of our minds when we're when we're checking the thing but i think it ought to be checked for that
erm okay then i think that er what we'd got er what you were talking about there was UNK
yeah
erm and if i may er use that UNK you know we've got all the people in one room or we've all the people in one base
it may not be of safety but it maybe er not the sort of thing that we want
erm so UNK
what other things are we going to check
sequence
yeah we really ought to check the sequence
have we what do you mean
er have we really drawn our programme we've got a very complex programme for the tank farm which we did have we shown ourselves putting the UNK in after we've poured the concrete
because in fact
it certainly should be
yeah
it
somebody some
i'm where are you handing it over to
well i thi well if your boss checks it what should he be checking for
UNK i'm not even checking for figures there i'm just looking through just UNK through erm i'm i haven't said how we're gonna check these
yeah
i think that it ought to be self evident erm if we've done our programme in a way which er is clear or if we've presented it in a clear fashion then i think sequence and UNK er and safety to a large extent become self evident
as they indeed they did from i think it was your er programme group er two where you'd actually drawn out quite UNK bearing tank five tank five tank five or whatever tank it was
yeah
there was you know your judgment was this was okay
but somebody else's judgment might have been that this was a UNK clash
yeah
er and they may have thought it was not acceptable from that point of view but you felt that it was okay
er the sequence i think has also got to be done
i think that the sort of sequence that erm i can't remember which group it was
you need a sequence indeed yeah erm just a minute i i've made a not somewhere
erm on yours in fact i couldn't check sequence erm on the programme that you'd given me because i didn't i had know way of telling whether we did get a clash
i think we discussed room twenty eight or something didn't we
so i couldn't actually check that but somebody's got to check it
it's got be feasible
now you said that you'd actually presented it in another way and were just and had just changed it
yeah
yes yeah well indeed you
yeah
which
indeed you had you had thought about it and so it would just have been a case of saying yes this is obvious
yeah
and so that's all that's necessary
but i think it is necessary
yeah
what other what other ones
go on tell me some other ones
continuity
yeah
once again that's another one which is just a glance at the at the programme if it's presented one way and very difficult if it's presented another way
yeah
as somebody pointed out i mean that the floor by floor was great for one from one point of view wasn't it
in that you could see what was happening on the floor but it didn't show continuity of work which easily
i'm not i not arguing with it yeah
i'm not arguing with it
yeah
i'm just saying that one way we can see things easily and another way we can't and we do want to check it we do want to be sure that there is continuity
it might be it might be
it might be
we have some interesting pictures of what's on site and er so yes i agree it might be
i'm not saying it is
yes
because there are i don't know how many sites tarmac run but there must be at least the number of sites that they've ever run divided by two standard ways of planning tarmac
that's a hell a hell of a lot of standard ways of planning
okay what else
yeah like that
erm shall i put finance
now that's a bit more difficult to check from these from these diagrams but i think it's very important don't you
you know you want to know and i would've thought that the higher the management the more they want to know the implications the financial of it of any plan which you're going into
yeah
so
i look at the short term programme and er see yeah
no we couldn't because what happened was the
but we do know that some people have done within tarmac
sorry
well i don't know where
we'll have to look in john's thing yeah
there isn't you know there isn't one thing is that we need to with the short term programmes we didn't do it work out the financial we need to go one stage further identify where the labour is
i'm gonna look a financial implication because it's something which i reckon having had practice of this you can do in if we we'll give you an example
we'll let you do it on your example
you could you've gotta talk exactly it will ta
it's one it's very simple and you can
and usually
it's usually it is it isn't there but it's terribly important so we're gonna have a look a that
okay
but before we go to that
check resources
check in what in what way tom
somebody's got somebody's gotta make sure that they're there next time yeah
so yeah resource considerations
i think so
now it may well be that is actually looking into a slightly longer term
you're now beginning to use the short term plan to UNK resources and that's very dangerous because er you've only got a very small UNK of what's going on
er but it can certainly indicate that er more things are required
yeah
yeah
yes indeed
yeah
so could i er the sort of UNK of the UNK yeah
is a is a thing which you're commenting on as well
yeah
i think
UNK of the UNK i think what you're saying is look these might be okay but this one isn't
yeah
the others you might not have argued but you know you might say my experience is that it i could do it in eighty percent of that time
but your experience on one thing i think was i can do it five times better than that
yeah
okay
yeah
the only thing you could do to this programme is
okay
yeah
well we've got the resource
i i've put i've put both
i agree
yeah
er what else
we need to check for the
yeah
so we've got to check the objectives haven't we
yeah
yeah
er yeah i think very much so
yeah very important
so somebody's got to say is this you've got a problem
yeah
which he may not be able to do anything for that week but it will ring a bell loud and clear the following weeks
yeah
okay i agree there and objectives so we might say er future work which might bring in the your point er tom
that okay
i agree yeah
all these things have gotta be checked
anything else that's gotta be checked
er yes i think we're looking at objectives there as being programme yeah
in what way
quality
quality
ah right
now quality
well indeed UNK quality is a very different i haven't written quality down
i think quality is a very difficult one
but you can guarantee if you're trying to force people to do things in er unacceptable ma methods then you're gonna have a problem meeting quality
so the UNK of the work pattern will affect the quality and so if you want a general thing there i'd rather put down
yeah i'd rather put down for UNK of work pattern
yeah
but er all these things should go towards that
yeah
there there's still something else i think that ought to be there
perhaps two things
and i know that you've considered it er in drawing up some of your programmes and
well yeah well try to expand a little more on that chris when you when you say coordination
yes
okay now i think i think you've said getting all the materials down to one end er so you've got two things there i think
you've materials and you've got access
yeah
have we considered materials at all
are the materials available
are we gonna be able to get them into the right place
are we gonna be able to get the people into the right place
yeah
and those are really the two last things that i had on mine on my list
now these tend to go fairly well together
i think access was a particular problem on the hotel
yeah
we had one lift to get everything up and down
yeah
so somehow they've got to move there haven't they
they've got to be moved and i it's a tremendous time
you only had lift three yeah
yeah
no
so you've a got a real problem and this will very much affect the work method
now you had a very similar access problem didn't you which was it group two that referred to particularly
did you did you talk about it
some of you one of you
yeah
once again you know you'd have thought in a green field construction site that you wouldn't get access problems and in er a restricted area like a city centre building or er a you would get access problems
but i actually think that you've got access problems in both of them and they have to be considered because the do really affect severely or they could severely affect er the success or failure of the programme and it's these list of things which you think now i've thought about that or i haven't thought about that
quite often in reality they don't get thought about and it's quite often these sort of things which cause programmes not to work because on site people work round them
oh i've gotta do that i've gotta do that
you're continuously working round and taking people off doing what they ought to do simply to move things around and you you've talked of that
there's a UNK oh yes yeah there is a limit so maybe what you're doing is just assessing is this going to give er problems or have we got put a gang on specifically moving things around
yeah
right
right
yeah
but at the time
yeah
you've definitely got to think about it at er long term er very much so chris
but i do think you've got to realise that it's going to affect your production rates
simply having er an access problem is quite severely going to affect your production rates whether you like it or not
you know if somebody's got to move a twenty two r b even three hundred yards they don't do that any more do they move it metres
yeah
it's gonna take quite a long time
yeah
if you're in a restricted area and you want somebody to do something you can't get to cranes in there you've actually got to say i'll do that one and then i'll do that one
so this thing of having the crane doing this and the crane doing that i was actually a bit concerned about that
in the hotel once again we've gotta get all these we've gotta things into a room which is obvious but you've gotta get things up through the lift and you've got this UNK
yeah
just like the crane in fact you've gotta transport in a bottle an access bottle
erm could i go on and look at er the finance which i've UNK here
somebody said finances i think it's very important and i'd like to look at financial implication and see if we can do something about it
and i've got er i've got a printed overhead here which is nice so i'll use my printed overhead
er and i want to talk a little bit about er finance and i i've got to recognise to start with that not all money is UNK at the site level
sorry
you will get you will get some notes on this
cos it's printed it's in my notes somewhere
it's the things that i've written down quickly
not all money is UNK at site level
would you agree with that
at different sites different things are UNK
so on some sites you might say no i well i can control the labour costs and i can control the er plant usage but i don't buy the materials myself the only way i can affect them is by altering the UNK
yeah
er but basically somebody else in head office somewhere orders these materials
on another site you say no i order all my own materials
it will vary very much from contract to contract but not all money is UNK and how much you all contribute to erm brian b m w from your projects i don't think you have any control over do you
precious little over them
precious little
well somebody UNK it don't they cos he's got a b m w
and he hasn't bought me a UNK er i think i i'd like to make the comment that in general the money which can be controlled at site level is that related to labour and plant
so if you might say no i can control materials erm but labour and plant would you agree
right but er if
do you have er a choice over what price is paid
some sites do yeah some sites do but some sites will use the central buyers
yeah that's right
the central buyers will do it yeah
and so
and so whatever the buyers have agreed they you will pay that price
so you can't con you can control when it comes but you ain't gonna ch you're not gonna control how much you pay for almost anything i'm afraid
some sites do
some sites can actually go and order everything
some sites can go and order everything up to a thousand pounds
some sites can go and order er things up to fifty pounds
yeah sometimes it depends very much on
you can do
well you can but not everybody can
yeah
erm and it's different from site to site but i can the things that you can normally control are the labour and how they're used and the plant and how it's used
you may not be able to
i haven't i haven't put sub contractors down there
well they might be they might be er labour only sub contractors
they might be erm proper sub contractor
they might be all sorts of sub contractor
yeah
i'm just saying there at the minute and if you'd like to argue no we can control the sub contractor sometimes then fine
yeah
and you can do sometimes because some of the sub contractors you'll come on they'll come on and they'll act more or less like your own labour on some sites
yeah
yeah
so i agree there but UNK really could come on
i think you've got a very narrow view here
you've got a very narrow view of life
yeah
an UNK narrow view of life
yeah
erm how about this one
the actual income and expenditure for the project will probably not be known by the person carrying out the short term UNK
yeah
because you've absolutely
it's all under UNK
really a pain innit
isn't it a pain
yeah
all too late
because it as you say you hit the nail on the head there you've spent too much they're on your back for spending too much
isn't this the best thing to do with a lock them in their office
great
let them do that
let them do that
no let them do that
let them do that is what i'm saying
i don't give a UNK what do
yeah
i couldn't i would if the company weren't so UNK i would say other things about them but i don't give a UNK
not on tape
oh yes i'd forgotten that
erm i the actual income and expenditure of a project of the project will probably not be known by the person carrying out the short term programme
what i would like to say i don't care
in order to control things properly we don't need to know
what we do need is the equivalent of what we've got in the documents which i've given to you which is some sort of allowance for every bit of control of the thing
now that allowance would be nice if it bore some relationship to what was allowed in the estimated er figures
yeah
but it's actually surprisingly enough isn't essential as long as we can agree on an allowance
let's say we're gonna be allowed so much and then let's measure off those against that allowance
somebody else can measure that allowance against the actual price that we've been paid but from our point of view let's accept an allowance
i'd like that allowance to be related very much to how much everybody thinks the work's going to be er going to cost which is initially worked out by the UNK
and you've spent some time doing this don't you adam
yeah
yeah
yeah
you know this is what this is what your life's about
you actually the UNK do think about these things believe it or not
yeah
or they have a little book where they can look it up
yeah
but you
but i do think
er right what i er what i think we've got is an allowance
so if i pass my er printed overheads for this one an allowance er is and you were talking about it really you were using this as though it were going to be er your money that you'd got to spend for doing each one of those activities or each bit of work within the project
and but what you were actually spending was the money on the resources
whether you appreciated it or not what you were actually doing when you were UNK resources and things was you were actually working out an expenditure er on resources
and these two should be comparable shouldn't they
and that's the sort of thing that we want to compare
so this one is sort of comparable to income cos we're always comparing income and expenditure
somebody said did it mean we were making a big profit
tom was it
are we making a big profit
well we don't whether we're making a profit because we don't know where how our allowance related to the actual money which we were going to earn from doing the work
because only the locked in their little room by phil
lucky you're on opposite sides of the room
but only the or the project manager would know what we were actually going to be made
yeah
it might it might've been you but you didn't care where it was from did you
you just thought it was an allowance
there's nothing wrong with that
now i assumed it was it had come from somewhere else
so erm
where did i i'm not sure whether i ought to be getting into this but i will
i think we've got a bill of quantities
yeah
which is actually broken down into several headings erm now people break these bills down into many different er forms er for example in major projects i know that for any bill be able to tell me er how many were involved in pouring er concrete er on any base
did you know this
how many er they know
they actually UNK there's er there's er a computer system which er allows you to build up the rates for doing work
holiday stamp
yeah we need some holiday we'll have a bit of that in there
we'll have a bit of this type of we'll have a bit of that tying wire
so how much tying wire is involved in the base of the tank
no trouble
it's all there
er i don't know what do
i know major projects do are able to do this
it's
the UNK package
no the UNK package i don't know what it's called
yeah
yeah it's the standard one which er lot use
chief UNK for UNK director for major projects
erm now i'm not really into that sort of breakdown
i i'm not really interested how many UNK of tying wire are used in the base of er a thing but i they do have another one which groups some of these together and er will give me labour plant materials and it's surprising how many contractors have this same breakdown er from er contractors might have materials and temporary materials er sub contract erm what else are we likely to have
overheads and profits
yeah
and risk
yeah
these sort of things five or six UNK
now and all these go together to provide a bill rate which is what we actually get paid isn't it
now the relationship between how much labour there is how much it's actually going to cost with labour and plant to do something and what the bill rate is can be anything
people might've UNK around with it by putting this overhead profit to risk they might've put a negative er element in there er they might've put a high cost element in there they might put nought in there so it's very difficult to recognise that bill rates er from the labour or the labour from the bill rate there isn't a standard relationship nowhere near
we don't what this
yeah
it's irrelevant to us
this is how much we're paying towards brian b m w
sorry brian
yeah
what we're interested in sorry
if you've heard my comments about the knows who it is
er what we are interested in is what the UNK have thought we're going to do for labour and what the UNK thought we were going to it was going to cost us for plant
so we're interested in two elements here of this multi element we're not interest in the materials we're only interested in UNK money which i've decided that at the minute will be labour and plant
i take i think it was your point alan that we could something with sub contractors as well
but let me just deal with labour and plant at the minute and we'll see we can do a similar thing
so i'm only interested in that
if i can get these that's great
if i can't then i will have to make up my own in order to control the programme to work
but er those things are available on most not all tarmac contracts unfortunately but most of them
where am i going
what i'd like to do now is how do we compare the allowance and the expenditure
there's one thing we can do is take one from UNK
yeah
because we should be able to get our planned allowance and our do so many cubic metres of concrete this was the allowance for it
the figures that you were actually calculating weren't you
yeah
some of you actually calculated those
we're doing so many er bathroom first fix er UNK this was the allowance for it
a planned expenditure i'm using these yeah
er and these resources i think are going to cost me er x pound for a day
so i ought to be able to work out the difference between them
say look i'm gonna make a profit or i'm gonna make a lost
this profit and lost is not real profit and lost it isn't real profit and lost
well i
i think they should be yes
yeah
yeah
yeah
it might well of been
well no i
well i i'm not sure whether we have
let me just continue for a minute and then ask a question later
yeah
what i what i'd like to do is we can say that we're we can make er a profit or a loss and we can give the figure so this might have come out at seven thousand two hundred whatever
let's call them pounds because we're working in england
yeah
and er my expenditure might've been erm oh i don't know something that i can do the sums on five thousand three hundred
yeah
er and so er look i'm gonna make a profit of nineteen hundred
my allowance is higher than my expenses therefore that's jolly good isn't it
yeah
if the allowance had come from somebody who'd put in a lot of thought to this our UNK here
it's nice to have an UNK represented on the course because i think that you'll admit that people do put some thought into this and the rates that you use for labour and plant you try to make realistic
yeah
cos you're actually trying to estimate the true cost of doing the work
somebody else can fiddle around with the figures when they tender for it but you're trying to get a true cost of doing the work
yeah
you may not believe this and then so it's nice to have adam here to say yes that's right
yeah
yeah
and you deal very strongly with that so if he's saying having given quite a lot of considered thought to this
well a fair amount
fair amount
seven thousand two hundred you'll come out saying five thousand three hundred
you're saying i can do it a lot better than that
mm okay because i'm doing it so much better am i sure that i've got this right
yeah
or am i being optimistic
well indeed we might be saying hang on a minute is there something with the plan
am i being too optimistic
so all of a sudden you're beginning to question it
this financial analysis has lead you to question whether your plan is optimistic or not
yeah
or whether it as you said highly unlikely
yeah
and you can do it by taking one from UNK but more useful er i would suggest is to work out a planned performance or what i've called a planned performance er this'll be in your in your notes as well er which equals planned expenditure over planned er income or allowance
yeah
and what should that be
we would expect it to head towards one wouldn't we
yeah
in this situation it isn't
in this situation it's below one
yeah
but if we er so we could actually UNK you know plot this over time because we've i hope we'd have more than one er weekly programme
so each week we can plot our value where this is one somewhere down here is nought and we would hope to er eventually get to a situation where our planned performance was somewhere near one so we would be pardon
sorry
well i i'm not sure i'm not sure whether it is and it's certainly what we're what we're targeting though isn't it because we believe that either we've UNK down our allowances er nicely and we've got sensible allowances or we've er improved our planning
i actually would hope that we would keep our allowances standard because it allows us to do other things
and so just by analyzing this financially and it's not true financing because this allowance er is not related to the er to how much the company gets paid
we should be able to see whether our plan is optimistic or pessimistic and it should then get us back to it'll ring bells
and they'll say is it our are our output rates sensible
we can other things however though because we can do the same things for actual
after the week's gone we can work out our actual allowance
so if we look at what work we've really done say what we what w what we allowed to do that
yeah
and we can work out our actual expenditure that will some of these resources won't turn up
yeah
you know they'll have had a night out on the tiles
i was not looking that way
but er we would get er an actual allowance and our actual expenditure and we'll be able to calculate an actual performance
which is actual expenditure divided by actual allowance
yeah
and so we'll say well that's what we planned to achieve this is what we actually achieved
i wonder how well we were doing against our own plan
and wouldn't you rather be judged against your own plan which everybody's agreed than against anything else
and so i think we can work out our what i've called here efficiency and er my efficiency is actual performance over planned performance
so i'm going to use three things to see how i'm doing both in planning and actual
i'm gonna used a planned performance
gonna use an actual performance
i'm going to use an efficiency
and these are all based on the allowances and it doesn't matter if those are allowances are correct as long as we use the same incorrect allowances all the way through
yeah
so if it's really going to cost me fifty pound the cubic metre to pour concrete and happen to have forty pound the cubic metre then it'll show up in the plan that mm i'm not doing to well here because there wasn't a big enough allowance
but the same thing will be taken into account in the actual okay
so i might be showing myself doing worst than i should be but look my actual come out about the same and so when i compare my actual with my planned i get er an answer which should approach one
yeah
so i should be getting one
no matter what no matter how accurate my allowances were this is why i said i don't really think it matters
wasn't it somebody saying everything was locked away
i mean as long as we've got something which is in the of where we want to be we can actually measure how well we're performing against our own plan which i think is what you'd like to be able to do
because if you measure how well you're doing against your own plan you stand some chance of improving your planning
and if you said well i can only i can only achieve seventy five percent of what was in my plan one week then you say well what was i doing wrong
the people couldn't have been working well enough or my plan was too optimistic
yeah
what options do you have
you could either go and try and control the people to get more work out of them which you would do but the other option is to say well i recognise that my plan was optimistic let's change the assumptions in the plan and you're going to improve therefore your planning
i never want your plan to be achieved completely
because if you achieve a hundred percent of what's in your plan there's always a danger that they could've achieved a hundred and ten percent of what was in your plan and haven't been working hard
yeah
so i really my advice is not to aim for a hundred percent efficiency but always to programme five percent UNK
five percent you know you're giving the people the feeling that they can get there
yeah
but never quite achieving it
but the only way to measure whether you're planning optimistic UNK is to do something like this
you can't do anything else
you've got to check all these other things
check the sequence
check the order
check the er but you've got to have some way i believe of measuring what's going on
what
no
i agree erm but you can work out these same things for the master plan
yeah
and you can compare which is quite interesting
a nice one that you've brought up jane
you can you can actually compare your actual performance on your short term with your planned performance from your long term
yeah
and so you can get all these things going together
you can compare your performance on your long term o on your short term with your long term which is something that somebody brought up yesterday
how do we compare what we're doing on our short term with what we said we would do on the long term
we're not doing it in detail on individual activities but we're getting the overall productivity correct
yeah
yeah
yeah
i believe that this has got to be reported
would you like to know how people are performing against your figures
there's a plea there
just send them into him
yeah
send them into him
it'll be quite fascinating wouldn't it
it's carried out for claims purposes
correct
correct
yeah
how much use how much how
use to controlling the project is information produced for claims
bit late
it's quite often too late for the next project
erm what contracts do i know that are still being er there's a major project erm when does that finish
when does when will its claim be finished
shouldn't ask should i
m forty
the m forty
yeah
what i'd like to do sorry
very simple
i don't know is the answer
i don't know
i don't know why this isn't set up you will receive these things
if people sent them to you i suspect you would receive them quite happily
yeah
but why do you know why
now could i could i go through cos i'd like i'd like to at some stage ask you to do an exercise on this just to see first of all how complicated it is and then at the end how simple it is
yeah
and i actually believe that for your programme because you've done most of the work believe it or not the problem is you haven't written everything down
i'm now going to say what you should've done is write a bit more down on your short term programmes
erm could we give out the handout cos i think i'd like them to refer to this on the all you've got to do is write these things down cos you've cos you've got most of this on the way through
yeah
would you do you think you've got most of this on the way through
sorry
th this is not well this
yeah
well this i think is quite important
i think people are becoming more and more and it's not true financial implications here
we've UNK that and the heading i should have a copy what
the heading on your thing which is financial considerations i don't have my copy but never mind i don't need it
the heading is not quite right financial considerations because they're not true finances they're only plays of measuring whether your programme is optimistic or pessimistic
they're not really related to true finances
however people could relate true finances and they certainly could be fed back directly if we if we were using UNK
they could be used to feed back and complete a control UNK within the company not just within the site
they can be used also to compare long medium and short term programmes which fundamentally very simple calculation
in your handout somewhere i'm afraid i haven't got the pages er cos i don't have my handout immediately to hand er i've got here a short term er programme
yeah
this is very similar to one you've drawn up
it's not actually the same project it's for er a simple project
and the sort of things which we need in order to calculate this are the quantities of things that have been done because you've got the allowances all you need is the quantities that have been done
now on your hotel project it's terribly easy for most more difficult for er the bit that sarah tackled which was the er public access area because she didn't have one room one room one room
you can just count up the number of rooms that you're planning to do can't you
it's very quick
oh yes
you've got a planned percentage
so it's only the percentage that you've got here
on here where i've got a concrete type work more like
the computer reads the message and goes up
there's not even a human being in the warehouse involved
so that it can all it's all it's all UNK by load by computer now
so what UNK saying is information technology er gives us the opportunity to give you information down er a telephone line
and our UNK hardware er the disk can either
if they've got their own computer which is i b m compatible we just give them the disk because it's UNK that the UNK not the hardware
it's the software that is the UNK
but if they've got their software hardware well it's the hardware as well
but really what it does it can either stand alone and print just be a printer put the data in and then
it's set up with your like your b m s it's got your database in
it's set up with all their UNK
somebody comes in and runs a separate form puts all their customer and all they're doing is when the orders change they just put the and it prints out notes and labels and if you've got hundreds of them it saves a job in time and money and the girl
and what it also does is as you call off the numbers if you've got
yes he's reading off er yes he's but that's printing off labels
but that is the same it's same thing though
it's a printer UNK it's a p c that's all it is and that's what the despatch
you know if you've got a p c you can use our UNK system
you can tie the
that's what the hardware is
the programme is the UNK and it will just be and if you source your
you've got a sales code haven't you
d'ya know what the sales code does on your b m s
that's right
is this yours alison
yes and if alison three seven five a thousand number you've scored one five
and every time she
pardon
it will tell you what you're what you're responsible for
what can you give the managers about alison
activity and productivity
how hard you working
if you put rubbish in you'll get rubbish out
you know
a database is only as good as how well it's managed
i mean it's not really data system that's it's the way it's being used
and it's the same
a projection you know a warehouse order erm stock and order situation if you've got a and they've got people by source number they can see how much is being used by you
so the UNK can help with your stock control help in a warehouse situation
help you reduce your labour on the just with ordinary notes and labels on volume
reduce error
it's UNK quick and it can link directly to our computer if you want
so is this just with a few major accounts or
erm
have prospect accounts that we need to deal with
fifty weeks you know fifty weeks only ten a day is it worth putting a database in for only ten labels
but low on that one
you need to be talking a hundred a day really
you need to be talking you need to be talking how long when you were writing out labels
girl that would actually write out all the notes
we haven't got one but she'd like to
can't get them to print it haven't got a printer
that's not my decision now
what i want what i'm trying to get to is the UNK is an eye and it's far in advance to but i've had
sorry sarah
they have specially network no not just you
there's a team of people who are specially keeping UNK of the technology and they are by paul who heads the erm network operations
because it's an operational function really isn't it
and they set it up
something like they actually set it up even though erm on behalf of the salesmen
what the demand and supply situation i don't know how we stand on that
but erm obviously because of the customers it does not always it will certainly come now we've got this technology but they haven't got the software package
the software package i mean sometimes it comes with the deal we don't charge extra
we feel price of it you know
and er
and how would you identify you were arranging an ex sales form right
i how you gonna find out whether it's a or have they got stock control problems or they need management
how would you
now would you would you how would you would you talk about or how would you know do that sort of job
i'd introduce and then i'd
when you say you want to speak to somebody despatch would you ask for the despatch manager or the territory manager or
no
that's right
all you're giving out is information at this point in time
they can't make a decision to change but they can give you the information that we need to bring forward
and if you do approach a company this is an enquiry i need to speak to your you know who's responsible for erm raising documents in the postal region
who's responsible for raising documents in the despatch department
or who's responsible for erm received or going out
erm you actually you know you don't have to say i'm
you just UNK to save you time and effort and hard work and going home just feel like this
feeling like you know your life
associate that with you if you feel
that means change learn loads of paperwork to sort out
that's what we think when you say
asking questions asking questions
all right UNK
yeah
you know really UNK down with something that's really UNK you
because you don't think that you really are through the motion
at least when you think about you start to sound like you that's the problem with the job
is you've gotta be like that show in the west end where it's gonna feel like the first time
erm what i'm trying to get is you've got to start backing up from the sale er the objective of that call is not to close the sale
is not to handle objections
is not to persuade them to change on that call
is to gather information
alison i understand you're the person who has to drive information on
so you're the one who really has to do er if the if the system doesn't suit you or if the UNK hard work if you have problems
i mean interesting because i've never actually done the job that you're doing
how these names
and that's the sort of question
d'ya have you know what's it in connection with
why are you hard work
and i don't know if for you
and you know what i mean
if people wanna know all you the benefit is saving half saving energy
you know you the hard work
it's no use talking about cost savings to the girl interested in how much it costs
he just wants to go home or having a job and the UNK needs to be established with the person who's actually gonna use it
and get her backing or his backing
if that's something you want us to is it something you would that be an advantage to you
speak to about this
rather than you selling it to the boss and then all the trouble
you've gotta the right person
i'm gonna stop there but what has it we could spend all day and all tomorrow talking about detailed and knowledge
but what i'll try and ask you to do is your service level is not just four nights four UNK four despatch you know it's not just that
it's the it's the detail of it
you need to know closely the detail
let's just run through a couple of the points
just tell me what you've got on your list there that erm people have said
that was another one just of UNK despatch
that's a good one
that's what
belfast is in northern ireland part of the u k right
now when you are i want to talk to you about doing a sales call
but before you do you've got to look at the material in the working file
look back internally and now we've gotta talk about communication to your question survey
how do we breach what you do and how d'ya get there
will you what method do you use to talk to our UNK
what's the
you do telephone
there's different ways of communicating isn't there
there's things like telephones
letters
letters
UNK
letters fax
visiting
and d'ya have a lot of
yeah
yes
those are the those are the main ones
can you do me a little exercise first just to er write down write down what erm of what we're trying to reveal
imagine now communication i'm talking about not only through letter and telephone i'm talking about total communication
if you were now talking to each other tonight round the table in the restaurant or at the bar in the hotel okay
you're telling you're communicating with each other
if i said to you the communication right these are the methods that this is what actually communication is
if i said some of it isn't made from the words or the message some of it is made from the tone of your voice
and some of it is made from body language
d'ya know what i mean by body language
can you give me an example of your body language
pick up the phone and smile
no well that's not body language because he can't see you can he
all with a smile is tone of voice
yes would you agree
what is body language
you're staying you're in a hotel now tonight and you're talking what is body language
i mean the way that you sit
the way that you sit
sitting like that
right
you're more likely to be
that's right
obviously you know when you've been sitting still this is probably the worse hour of the day
you've been fed and UNK just like a new baby
you've been fed
it's hard to keep concentration right
and your body language tells me
it tells me the way you look you know
now all of a sudden i change the subject and look the way you're all sitting forward
that tells me
you can from your body language what you're doing
your eye contact with me is body language
we can we understand each other we're reading each other 's messages
you're UNK occasionally when you agree with me
you know that you're telling you're giving me messages
erm that's what body language is right
you were even lip reading
you don't know you do but you do lip read erm as well
and if i said to you those three elements of communication that makes up the hundred percent of it yes
that makes total communication
now what i want you to do is ask yourself don't discuss it just write down for me and i'll go round the table
if i said to you how would you divide that hundred percent up between those three what value would you put on your message
how important is the message
to get total communication how much relevance do you put on the message
is it thirty three percent thirty three percent thirty three percent or is it all UNK one way or the other
we're talking about face to face situation aren't we
yes
a total communication situation where you've got you might you've got use of body language you've got use of language you've got use of tone of voice and you're making you're getting the message across
