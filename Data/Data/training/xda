how important is those three components and what value would you put on them
and i'll just compare what each of you say and i'm going to give you some information er UNK by
although erm we haven't we're running short of these papers but it's the same figures
sarah what was yours
well i've put erm message
yes
er tone of voice fifty percent
yes
and body language
right
now
yeah well let me check that out
erm word i've put twenty
yeah
tone
tone forty five
body language thirty
thank you
oh
melanie
twenty five
yes
tone of voice twenty five
yes
body language fifteen
right
karen
erm words of message forty
yes
tone of voice twenty
yes
and body language forty
right
and alison
words of message thirty five
yes
tone of voice forty
four o
yes
and body language twenty five
i've got words and message twenty
yes
tone of voice thirty
yes
and body language fifty
right
and UNK
words forty
tone forty and body language twenty
right
so you've got some UNK opinions there haven't you
some of you some of you heavy in bodies
and er you're heavy in tone here
some of you are look at er relatively high words
research that where they're looking at how to convey the message from UNK and sales and people getting erm interviews getting into jobs what they say what they how they stand even how they've looked and so on
they reckon that erm thirty eight percent is how you say it
fifty five percent is how you communicate through what sort of
but they reckon proportion and we when
well i'm not researcher i couldn't say how they do it but it's done it was done from their recruitment and marketing sales
and they put on every consultant through out training course they got i think we've made i think we've got sixty five
but they reckon when they did obviously it's a set that probably someone had to say the same thing doing or the same person went through so many functions and it was worked using different ways of saying
so why i said to you on the telephone as you say it's not what you say it's the way you say it
what as i said to you twenty percent of the messages a word sounds the same
there's quite a few letters and therefore words sound the same
and again UNK er t n t
t n t
no if you're not careful
i wanna tell you the way the word perhaps the one where
it would be normal well it must be what i've said
i want you to do something now which is a little on the same talking about how we
and i'm going to write other and i'm going to ask you to put a different emphasis on different words to change the meaning
okay
say that for me and go i'd say it were you were a UNK
say it as though in a UNK way for me
would anybody else like to have a go at that more UNK than
i mean really do it you know
what else where else can you say it if you wanted to talk about the UNK of
right can you demonstrate what i mean
all the best
we're all the best
you're putting
you're saying erm as if to say melanie you got the message across but by excluding you lot she said all the best people
in other words if you don't you're not the best people
the way lynne said it is where all the all the best people
she's not saying er she wanted an emphasis on the word best but you've got the same
right
say it mandy in a UNK way as though you don't believe a word of it
can you think about it for a minute
of course we'd never be UNK any of us would we
all the best people
that's right
she asked it you were saying it lynne and melanie as though it was a statement of a fact
what did m mandy UNK
she was questioning
questioning yes
more than UNK
pardon
oh right
right
erm say it as though you're not sure er you're not sure about it
you're not sure of where it is that you feel you might
erm you think you're questioning the actual role
you want to check information is correct
what
say it thought you're not sure whether it's UNK grove or it could be somewhere else UNK something else
how would you say it then
go on a bit louder
that's right
see how she UNK on a word
UNK grove
and say back to sarah confirm that she's right but just use those words
confirm that she's right by her UNK grove
say that sentence back just to confirm that she's got that right
UNK grove is the
no you didn't say the word then
try reading this time
oh right sorry
good
i know what you're UNK ahead of your mouth here
carry on again
UNK grove is where
yes
but she didn't want to know
yes that's right she said that right then
UNK grove is where
i was thinking of the word grove
if you said UNK grove is where UNK grove is where the best people live
that's right
you know if you can just actually repeat it back
and people do that to you don't they
you say something they say er oh erm i was paid i was paid today
oh you were paid today
don't they
but they mean something entirely different but they say the same words
i was paid today
you were paid today
anyway
sorry
what i'm say is it's not what you say
the meaning is not in the words it's in the way you say it isn't it
if i say to you sarah i'd like a few words with you
what can i mean
because you think what mandy
what d'ya think if someone says they want a few words with you what d'ya think's going to happen
told off
told off
now to me i might want to know that people use language to mean more than one thing
and they do it to cause ambiguity
they you know we create confusion because it allows us to have control
and we
you know the tone of the voice could completely UNK you know lay completely your fear of being told off by the by the pleasant tone in your voice
yes
it might be a meeting not a telephone
might be a constructive thing an informative thing
what er do you ever have people you know perhaps people who are close erm dear to you who use certain language that you find erm er either or do you use methods which say getting your point across to people that
well i do me and jonathan erm they don't like me er read all his books
when i talk and the news is on john will always it really UNK him
that's it you do want that's all that's all body language
doesn't even speak
no you don't have to
just looks and i just
non verbal communication
yes
non verbal that's why i know you think about body language but think of all the times things like that happen where the body language speaks it you know
a raising of i have a brother who raises his UNK
he doesn't raise his voice he just looks just or
what about the way they say have a nice day
UNK
thank you for
like kath er trust me i'm a doctor
or are you on drugs
i mean we use language don't we
we say one thing and mean something else
and we're quite good at being UNK
women are really expert at it
we've got it
because you have to be cutting with the verbal
because you can't UNK them round the head can you
you've got to be a bit more er intelligent when
if you justified me coming on you know you can you can be a bit more you're being a bit more erm what's the word UNK aren't you
you're thinking more than doing and er wit you know UNK they say is the lowest form of wit but actually UNK probably is wit
some people think you know really be testing er with language and mean something entirely different
i mean sometimes do it very UNK but what i'm saying is i want to illustrate what i meant by the words never used message
you know when we using the telephone method of communication what d'ya think why d'ya think we we're employed with the company
why d'ya decided to give some contact
yes
i would say that plus qualities there's a good network
but that's why telephone sales because telephone and the to us and to them you know
at one time we said it was you know UNK on the edge of technology when they like most things you know
your brother probably paid a week's
some people can get
at one time a we'd pay a year's salary or two year's salary
now we can get something that would be half affordable
but cost to us if you paid you know pay for girls and also the procedure to er use the service is much better now
i can write it but when i is what quick
quick
yes you think it's people expect it to be quick don't they
you don't make the public phone
very cost what i'm saying is it's quick erm people expect to do it it's something oh if they're writing instead of going round i'll pick up the phone and do it
it's er an instant method
so they expect it to be quick
anything else
yeah you
in our job
yeah why we would choose it
that's erm it's two way obviously
i mean if you're writing to someone er and it's instant that's a good point
but then if you prefer it to writing they'll postal strike you know you hope
and in fact the like a UNK one forty percent on something
whereas contacts on the phone would probably be more er effective
and i think it puts you at their as well
because most people have a lot of area it isn't like someone reception i've got a phone call for you
now when you're often they phone up and say there's someone here to see you
and
they actually have to come and meet the person fact to face
they get post land on their desk
but they haven't got the instant feedback
a you have to actually you know make arrangements
but you're actually at their desk right you know i'm here really
you know it's a good method to get to know detail
d'ya think
mm
d'ya think it's harder to talk to the person you can't get
i think it's easier to get them when you're on the phone
like you said you can't see the body language and UNK off
now i agree with you there
i think it's easier to get through but it's harder to hold
yes
people get confused then they think oh when something i've got to and i've to read all those messages a lack of UNK really isn't it
you're saying it's not it isn't impossible but it's harder to generate a warmth over the phone isn't it
we have to act more
that's right
and sometimes it's too quick yes
it's too quick for what we want to try and do
because we never okay then thank you we'll call you
that's right
no and that means erm you're UNK really aren't you
if you've lost your way on the phone
so there's a it's got
anything else
what don't you like that
the fact that people do get a lot of
right
so yes
so
that's you say that's
yeah
i think that you know a lot of people are sort of
you think too many calls
i would say that's interpreted as easier to or easier dismissed
would you say er it's important because easily dismissed
and you know i've had a lot of people say to me oh is it just a sales call
yes
is that the UNK fault d'ya think or is that fault i mean salesman coming in as well
i mean a lot of times you know i think just phone up and say is mister so and so there and then guard themselves t n t delivery
oh he says a sales you know
yeah
he because it's
yeah
d'ya think that could happen to you face to face as well though lynne
you were not coming strong
oh yeah definitely
yeah
i don't i don't think it's too much to do with the telephone
i think probably the saying aspect rather than telephone aspect
but i accept what you saying
sometimes it's because it's so many people that are using this method that the importance of what you're trying to say tends to be dismissed and therefore
sales means you're going to tell me you're going to persuade me to do something i don't want to do
i think and then we can pass them off then
yeah
mm
that's when they when they calls for selling
yes help line
the help line aspect of it yes
yeah
yeah
that's good for us then isn't it
yes
he's UNK
i think it can also be i think have you never
well i have to do
he says i don't want anybody to see me
cos he is this real
i think i think i love the radio
i love radio plays and
i like the radio plays and i like erm er stories and you know book at bedtime and i love all those because it's like reading
i was reading a book
have you ever read a book and
oh yes
the illusion going completely and erm my imagination is much better is much more erm and music is very erm UNK for your imagination
i always remember i had tommy ken russell and he'd been on
we both know the music very well and the album
i mean nothing could catch my imagination fantasy
well where you get where you get reporting from foreign you know station
and i agree with trusting you can you know the reality you what you're bound to point
you can't because people UNK and UNK and you'll never ever even though you might be perfectly and somebody else's dream but you won't be everybody's dream so you're bound to UNK
or you'll leave it to the imagination
whereas your voice er is carrying all sorts of wonderful
anything they want you to be you'll be you know
and that's really i think a distinct advantage
just like we can create an image that we want
and i'll do that and i'll
but it's a compliment it's a compliment from the company saying we've got a looking people that we're quite that people can you know
look what at the conference
human bring a human face to people
people like we're a photograph
what i tomorrow and not here because they forward it on to us
and they sent it to erm he sent it and he hadn't he hadn't done
he'd sent a photograph in and he was sitting in the garden and right and he was on a garden chair and he had his nice hair washed and shiny
sitting in the like that smiling you know
and he looked liked really just ready to get up and do his lovely fresh face you know
and he looked at the letter and he looked at that photograph and he thought i can't
and the photograph matched it sort of said i'm not the same you know what i mean what he said
and it really made it really gave the edge to that you know and someone and i thought
i mean you know and it the UNK off the picture on the page
and i think it can come out of the voice as well
and erm i think what we've gotta do is you know
if the image is something you don't really think is going to do as much for you as the voice
older women have a deep voice and it actually can sound very attractive
and some people can change their
you know you can
and er i think that helps and er they'll talk to each other you know
and i have to talk to him on the phone and i'm saying speak to him very well
met him for the first time i think and erm
i mean he's nice don't his wife doesn't you know
but he has got this marvellous voice and he
i think i thought they've got no ideas and then come on with this speaker and i was and i thought ooh
and when i wasn't looking at it
so i mean

how did that feel
was it easy or
oh a nightmare
oh what did description
yeah
what was difficult about it
let's just analyze a little bit what was difficult
what did you find easy what was difficult
by the time you remembered what they'd said erm
the first bit
the first bit yeah you're remembering the last bit when you're remembering that you've forgot the first bit
cos by the time you said what did i just say
so it's the amount of information
yeah
too intense to listen
what d'ya mean by that karen
well you sort of like say for instance erm we heard of recent burglary
you are thinking burglary while she's saying i'm
so all you can remember is
you're obviously evaluating the message
yeah
of the first thing and fixing that in your mind and then well you can't keep UNK of how much
anything else girls
what d'ya you were saying karen how d'ya have to how did you manage to do it
you may just sort of er form a picture in your mind just sit there and lip read sort of concentrate
look at the floor put a picture in your mind of what they're saying and it seems sort of
what about getting the do you do you get the UNK but not the details
yes
understand the meaning behind the sentence but you couldn't word for word
lynne was doing all the hard work
we got down to number tend and they were all one UNK
and i was thinking i can't even get these ones let alone the two UNK
trying to repeat the same one
why were they hard
erm
on the form that we looked at
erm no
i dunno i got the UNK of what lynne was saying and i was concentrating but maybe i was concentrating too hard because i was getting most of it right wasn't i but it
it's just odd words you sometimes
you switch them round
you concentrate and you get it
what about the language that they use
there's a lot of er
was it different to the way you would use it
yes
erm that erm we would normally use
terms and phrase
but i don't know
things like that sometimes you can remember but because you don't use them so often you think oh that's strange
but then
and that's in fact
yeah but in an exercise like this you're thinking when they're saying that oh i wouldn't normally say that
by which time you're not listening to the other things they're saying
now what do we do when we launch into our presentations on the telephone
try and get as much out in one breath and then just go next
and somebody says well the girl you know he says you never call you never told him about that
you said i told him about that
and you discussed but he can't remember it
i've told him about that
and you do you can't go on
you're expected to remember a whole process that you're asking to you know explain how to fill in the form or use another system
you're expecting them to remember it word for word as though it you know it's UNK on their soul almost and can't
yeah i've found myself doing that sometimes
you know if i start saying something i'm UNK myself think you know i'm taking too long to say it
but i won't sorry could you repeat that again
yes
and you have to try and think it differently
that's right
what sort of skills would you UNK er what would you do in order to take er note of the detail of that exercise
what sort of things would you do to break it up and absorb it in bite size pieces
what things how could you improve that retention
pause
pause you can pause couldn't you
what about the person who was listening
what could you have done that would aid you remembering
what's the obvious thing
emphasize the word
yes the tone of voice well done
that helped a bit did it
yes
so the pace of it you said and by UNK and er stopping and stopping going er too fast
giving them plenty of time to absorb
did you speak fairly slowly to help them
yes
it's like you were speaking to a UNK you know a french person or something
i found i was trying to announce it the i'd this and i'd that in there
it was trying to like speak very clearly
yes
yes you are teach related is the word yes
you were very clear you were an and i don't think lynne even adopted a certain authority about the information when i heard her reading it out
she sounded like a news UNK
you were saying you do emphasize when you're trying to get people to understand
you do
yes that's right
but remember those these things that you understand logic are logic aren't they
they're just logical things to do
pause speak rather slower than you would do if you were in a normal conversation
remember twenty percent of the message is lip read and you haven't got that opportunity
it's understanding the so speak slowly not UNK but just a little slower than you would do
we all chat our heads off don't we
we're all excited at this of information that we want to pass the story across to
big use UNK and UNK in the voice
clear clarity or UNK
speak clearly
use language
that's what they said on that film didn't they
that it's not the language felt uncomfortable because erm it wasn't an expression you would normally use
i know you can hardly be expected to adopt all your expressions erm but you shouldn't be too technical in you know
if you're talking about erm you know er l b os and UNK and
up trading
up trading down trading despatch you know
i've just had a phone call in i've just erm had a phone call from a conference company and she and part of her research the woman in came on one of my courses to just see what the background and what we were doing
and erm she had she works for a erm videos set up conferences you know the sort of things that you've been on
and erm if you ask for the despatch manager they say we haven't got one
we don't have one
do you despatch any goods
they say no
because they're a conference
if you use language that's UNK to that environment it doesn't mean very much
who would who would be the person in a marketing and promotion conference erm creative
UNK
what would the UNK be
well he would he would design everything and then obviously it would be important for him to get it sent out
so maybe he would arrange it
or the office manager
mm
yes usually erm someone manages the place somewhere
or even if you have to clarify the title by saying who is responsible for making sure that materials that you use arrive at the place that they're supposed to arrive at the time
who's responsible for your organization of that sort of backup
you might have to be more clear about what you're specifically asking for rather than use UNK titles
you understand
you may have to talk out functions of the job
because you don't what sort of title
he may say he may say head of creative head of create the creative department or head of erm
we had in our in the newspapers creative we had a creative department
he was head of creative
now it sounds weird now something about i'm sure that's but that's what we used to call him you know
and there were there were artists who the artist
only that you know you're not you're not familiar talking to the artist
but if they do story boards about videos they obviously illustrate and er or design stands or er or UNK to er a setting
you know they have a creative market
but we might make a mistake with the title and someone
but if you use the function who is responsible for doing then you can often find out who
so you need to be careful of the language
is there anything else that you learned thinking of the exercise now listening when you put the shoe on the other foot and you have to stick to
what other things do you think could have helped you
there's an obvious thing really that erm if someone UNK something to you and you have to repeat that word for word what would you normally do by
make notes of it
well done
that's what i was tempted to do actually
yes it's a natural you get an urge to make notes
make notes
well you make notes when you're listening to customers and make notes when you were questioning me did i and it was hard to even if it's only four or five questions it was hard to pull together
or i can't do it i have to scribble
i have to scribble
even if i'm like giving out my name to a customer sometimes i write down lynne and it's like what did you write that for
that's right
bearing in mind this is dumped after a week
after this is dumped
we keep ours
do you
what for
i don't know
gets kept though if got like piles and piles of these
just in case
it's kept what i'm saying is it's a working document
it's a working document
it's for your you can you know keep make notes and er then something to you
shorthand it's all shorthand notes
i'm sure you do with your own anyway and er if you can that will help you
is there anything else that's support what you're trying to do
what how d'ya get the that's a difficult one really
shall we have a go at this
no
you talk about if it's something you're used to you talk about something and you know what you're talking of and somebody a bit like actual
interesting to you
yeah
but area of interest yes
i was quite happy answering your questions quite happy
also
you have the hard job i have the easy job
when you know more about what you're expecting to be told it's easier to remember it
whereas these things were just like anything out of the blue and it's like all what's coming isn't it
so what you're saying really you ought to make a logical pattern of it yes
it's got to
cos most questions really you know that you're gonna say yes no even though like you said well maybe i do put it that way
but we know really you could say yes
yes
what i'm saying is if you keep a most people what that that's a bit that's a very good point lynne about it they were all UNK subjects
oh god no sense was made of it
and therefore your brain was trying to naturally put it into some context but it didn't go into any context so it was difficult
so if you if you get them talking about something and they actually get talking about it
that's right
and then you ask them something totally different and think oh weren't you interested in that anyway
yeah and the thing is you they don't forget that when you phone someone else they're doing something else
and you just
talking about
you've got to allow them to give their around to where you are with how you open the call
you've gotta say something interesting quite early on and just to bring the whole conversation to where you want it to be
you talk about asking questions you talk about the product that you've got to up to the question the problems that you
you talk about leading questions again that testing trial closed where we'd just test the water before we go for the actual commitment
really what we're doing after are they prepared to talk about it if when you by consent let me carry on talking when you don't have a leading question
what you going to say about something that's important a solution for you is that something you'd like to do
what have you got to say
you know and then you're starting to present information after you've got their full attention not just from the beginning where you're trying desperately to win the presentation forward
now what i'm a little bit concerned about is how you should grasp that attention initially
because i think you have a very tough job on the phone to do that and you need erm to start think about what is interesting okay
what i'd like you to do this evening if you will erm as an exercise is you know you were talking about erm asking questions listening to the answers speaking the same language watching erm talk the language
like first of all there's erm talk person to person asking questions listening to the answers watch er talk person to person watch for signals and er talk the same language
you remember what customer talk person to person
if you are thinking about it talking person to person remember the guy on the building site remember the woman who's pregnant and trying to sell insurance and getting him to he should have been securing his family welfare and so on
when the man in the wallpaper shop was he was tried UNK floor tiles instead of concentrating on wall UNK and so on
erm he perhaps he remembered who he was talking to and what it was all about
you know have to remember the person
now i want you to think about the person who he's going to talk to
right and i want you to plan to do that for a call tonight in order to what you would say to this sort of person all right
sarah i'm going to give you i'm going to give you a company call how we feel marketing
can i use your for UNK there alison
you certainly may
thank you
i'll tell you what i'll do sarah
ignore this can i can you are you working on these currently or can i use these
erm it is this weeks but erm i won't be calling in
no all right then i won't i won't
i've got mine here
have you
have you got
tell me if you're gonna work on there
anyone at all
has anybody else got their own you have your own
you've got some of your own
got any of your own girls
no
no
okay what i'm gonna ask you to do pick any one of these prospect leads
can you work on UNK with her
karen you've got your own
you've got your own melanie
mandy have you got any
last week
doesn't matter
don't matter
we'll use it just as an exercise again
imagination you've got the opportunity to do the call again
what i'm going to ask you to then folks lynne and UNK use one of UNK just as an form
it doesn't really matter
you'll have types probably similar on each of your own UNK
i want you to think of the company you're going to ring
right
look at what the information on the pro on the prospect call thing that you've got there and i want you to plan an opening question
right
i want you to introduce yourself and i want you to say something interesting
related to the person
the company or the person that you're going to ring okay
now when i say something interesting what i mean is i want you to pick something that you that t n t do
you know this morning you were looking for
you were looking at features like UNK how you forward how you deliberate drivers and how good and how extra mile and write out printed write out labels for companies
and how we are the targeting comp how we are the company that UNK in certain industries because you've got you do industry by phone mobile phone area and medical supplies and you know your local as well
we're that sort of company
what i want you to do you my language when you first speak to me
i don't want anyone to say do you use a carrier
do you use a carrier
where do they go to
i don't want to hear that yet
that's something
i want you to attract my attention with a full introduction to tell me
what d'ya want to know when someone picks up the phone
you pick up the phone and say hello
what d'ya want to know about the on the phone stranger
what d'ya want me to do
who it is
you'd like to know who the person is
give him your name
what does that do when someone tells you who they are by name
you can actually address the person rather than just speaking to mister customer
what else did you do
well you've got a contact man
he's someone you can go back to
yes i'm prepared to give my name i feel you know
if i if i ever take an incoming call here right
and then they want someone else's help or whatever else and er i can see that they're concerned that you know they have a concern or want something from me then and i pass on i some action to take place you know for you know i've on to somebody or someone said to him i always give my name
say look it's kath if you have any problems ring us
i will say to you this is a full time job
you've got my name don't think we go away that you can't ring me up again
you know if you if you come across something you need help with phone me
i'd be i'm interested to know
if i get it's my job your success
and if you're struggling my job is to help you overcome those UNK and i want you to consider i'm here er as a service to you
i'm not i'm not i'm here for you not you don't you're not here for me
you know what i mean
i'm working for you
and that's what i want you to feel like mandy i don't want you to feel that you've gotta do things for me
i do things for you
and i do that say that because i want you to be feel my commitment to what we're trying to do here
now that's what you want when someone rings you up isn't it
they say look my name is and erm so i want you to think about how and talking about the way we talked about doing calls
don't just do what you normally do
if it's good share it
but if you think yeah that doesn't really achieve achieving nothing convincing feel that call
think about how you could say who you are
what could how could you explain what you're doing
what you're role is in this company
how d'ya explain that you know
how would people understand the function of that thing
how would be persuaded or give them the right image
we talked about image and mandy was talking about not preparing if we wanted these pictures to go out because we wanted erm create a not an illusion but a perception of what was going on
what sort of build up d'ya want to give me d'ya want people to have of you
you know
er of how would you get that across
and then say something
ask me a question and engage me in conversation or make a statement that applies to me
the customer that you're gonna choose on that b m s listing okay
and let's just work on this independently will you
don't work on it together and come up with the same
work on it as an independent idea
don't worry about it
oh my god this is absolutely terrible
don't worry
don't worry
that's we're here to help you put the words right you know
i want if you're struggling with it just throw something down and say oh gosh i can't you know
bring it to the table and we'll work it out together
but some of you will come out with some lovely ideas and they always do all you know
there was one on the course erm monday and tuesday about how they introduce themselves
they didn't telephone or indoor sales executive indoor sales executives
yes she did she
yeah
no that's now that's what is but she didn't say that she said er
she said something else didn't she
i think she said i just had normal er i can't remember
i'm responsible for your accounts in this area
or i'm responsible for erm and she did what she did rather than saying i'm the indoor sales exec or the account UNK or the UNK person who is or
the distribution in your area
responsible for the distribution in your area
that's fine karen
yeah that sort of thing
it's how would you describe the per you know who karen is
i am responsible for er and then tell me why engage me in something about me
don't tell me anything about you
in what they do if you want to
but i want you to then engage me in something about my business
talk my language talk person to person
you're on my territory when you pick up the phone
you're in my office
okay
have a struggle with it and we'll discuss the opening question tomorrow because setting the scene is often the way the tone of the whole
they control initially and you know being feeling that you're part of it you're in charge of it can set the scene for the whole conversation
and can you've got this fear if you miss some of those
and then like you did about the subject here er me asking questions on the subject you want to do
think of your first couple of questions about that company
right
as soon as i'm going to be interested by what you first said and then where are you going to go to next
start planning a strategy of questions to find out more
using the information on that erm b m s
do not ask me what know already and go through this routine of what d'ya do who d'ya do where d'ya go
i don't wanna hear that stuff
they're all questions
but if you have that information you may want to confirm it's right
i know that you do this but am i right in saying you do this but and then move onto the question right
don't just it's additional information
and don't forget i want you to demonstrate listening back through the open question through the questions
i want you to conclude with a leading question
summarize if there's a need there right
remember what she said on that video film when he when she wanted to do it for too holidays
she said what would happen if you were ill
what sort of question was that
i know the company can't do without you
what would happen if you were ill
you're actually saying what would i be right in saying that there wouldn't er they'd have to without you if you were ill
but you you're asking in a more open way
leading question don't you
what would happen if you were ill
now that's the sort of thing sometimes you can't form those leading questions until you've heard the answers
like you couldn't remember we were going
couldn't really pull the leading question out the hat until you heard the answers
but that's what i want tomorrow morning we'll be looking at your preparation tonight on your call and i want i want you to tell me at the end of each why you chose the route you chose right
i want you to put across what you're gonna do and ask a question and then tell us why you chose to go that route
what made you do it
colin cook national adult school organisation
monday the thirty first of january nineteen ninety four
this is then our meeting on monday afternoon the thirty first of january at UNK park adults school
the topic that we said we would investigate today comes from the hand book
er it's page sixty one and it's title is scientific research the whole truth er and if you like i will draw the points out of the study and leave you to comment where there questions and where there aren't any questions to UNK any comments that you feel appropriate
er let's remember that it is a study that is to start us talking and i'm sure we'll have no difficulty in finding some comments as we go through them
in the course of a life time so many facts and sense UNK upon our minds that our brains have become selective and we're unconscious of much of this happening around us
in fact we almost UNK different words from other people as our UNK and our interests differ so much
and we start off very soon then with a question in what ways do you find yourself selective
which sounds UNK or even events you block out from your mind and to which are you particularly sensitive
you're sensitive to the UNK of UNK on the stairs mary i know that aren't you
i shall not forget that one
yeah
i suppose the thing a lot of us block out of our minds is when you're out is traffic noise isn't it
traffic noise
you try to block this out don't you
yes
people walking above me
ah right are you are you
oh
particularly conscious of that
yes
yes
yes definitely
well that's something you'd like to block out from your mind
i would
but you can't
definitely
yes
and of course now you're with noisy music
mm
yeah music
american accents
american accents ah yes you'd like to block those out would you
oh i oh i like those they're friendly
yeah
mm
interesting that very interesting
yeah
erm i think i'd block out erm traffic noises to some extent because we live
aye you would then
and erm if i were to stop every time i heard a car go by i'd be stopping all the time erm to some extent it becomes a part of your pattern of existence
oh it does yes
and i tell you UNK another thing that i find that i blocked out from my mind sometimes that's the sound of central heating particularly fan assisted heating
it isn't here
when it switches on and off
here is quiet
but in some buildings you find that there is a constant fan noise
yes that's true yes
yeah
and we it we become so used to it that we exclude from our minds we don't think of it
and the same was true with as you said the fridge
mm
fridge is going so you they always have the UNK in the background isn't there
mm
yeah
because
it isn't until you make a conscious effort to listen you realise how much noise you are subject to in this modern world do you really it's true
when you make a point of try to listen to the world
mm
it's surprising how much noise we are er subject to
yes
you say sound of UNK traffic
and i think we have grown up to be a noisy
oh yeah
oh yes
race
perhaps noisy people generally speaking the television is on or the radio is on or the record player is on or the UNK player is on
mm
mm
almost any house you go into there is something UNK there is something on
i think we are a UNK aren't we
must be
'cos in the morning there's no radio on
we very rarely have the radio on except we have the radio on at breakfast time listen to the news and the weather forecast
yeah i do
but then the radio doesn't go again on again all day
mm
and our t UNK never on in the morning
no
do you do you
er so we'll probably an exception to the rule
UNK
the difficulty of this is to have the telly on and don't switch it off
yes
i think that is that's almost an insult isn't it
yes
yes it is
why did you come
yes indeed
erm at least if they turned the sound off
down
turned the sound down
oh right
well i think sometimes i at home erm if i'm particularly if i'm typing i like music and if the phone goes people must wonder what on earth it is because there's music going on somewhere which they obviously can hear in the background but i like i like that as a background
oh yes when you're tired yeah
and i'm using that in order to select
i choose the music i want to listen to
rather than hear the sounds outside
must be UNK yes
yeah
so it's the music is my choice and i'm using that if you like as a barrier as a screen er against the outside world
yeah
let's have a look at the next question
erm what are the ways do you think in which a scientist sees things differently from a UNK or an artist and are there ways in which they think UNK how does a scientist see things differently from either a UNK or an artist
well he's way above in a world of his own isn't he really
the scientist
yeah
mm
cut off from UNK i think
yeah
realistic
yes
yeah
UNK
as a scientist works so much on his own in his own little castle
mm
where as er UNK or an artist has the publicity if that's the right word
mm
in mind
mm
yes
yes he has people round him doesn't he
whereas a scientist hasn't
mm i cer certainly think that's one way of looking at it but wh wha what about if you were take a beautiful scene the sky on saturday evening was beautiful
yes it was
i looked at that and i'm not a scientist and my thought was beauty colour contrast erm i thought i wish i could paint
if i were a scientist perhaps i'd be looking at it and say what does that mean in terms of weather what does it mean in terms of pressure is it UNK cloud or says what other cloud
the difference is perhaps that the scientist will analyse
yeah whereas we don't
we don't
we don't just UNK
yes UNK yes perhaps that's the yes particular as opposed to general
saturday night i thought was the old saying red sky at night UNK old saying you know
oh yes indeed
there's an excellent example in the
erm but if it's i don't know anything about the weather so i couldn't look at that and analyse it in any way
i just had to say that is beautiful and i wish i had more words to describe it but i haven't yet
er a scientist then is often UNK as an absent minded professor
so occupied with UNK ideas that he is incapable of coping with every day activities
perhaps your thoughts go to the crazy UNK surrounded by UNK pieces of machinery and electric UNK or to UNK sitting in an UNK or to an efficient white UNK scientist
how much true do you think there is in the picture of a scientist as highly intelligent completely UNK and withdrawn from the world
it's like well it's a UNK anyway isn't it
erm
i think there's supposedly a lot of truth in it really is there
i suppose there are odd ones
yeah i can th they
what UNK me is that er erm much of these bright new people all seem to dress in such a UNK fashion don't they all sort of be dressed and UNK and er and er whether they they're so busy with
yes that could be a possibility
i wonder how many things er break in life would be saved you know never look
it's a question of priorities isn't it the perhaps people feel the way that i dress is not important the work that i do and the UNK that i make those are the important things
some of our UNK come on sunday you know they come dressed fashion in a week i don't know
mm
they just you know any old
yeah
i would agree that the scientist being is probably is constant withdrawal from his because he can't cope with what's going on around him whilst he is in his scientific research
a model of what he's trying to say and i think sound UNK they are
yes
and
mm
yes
well that's is that is the picture that you have the UNK as they say the absent minded professor erm
there's something in it
oh i think there is something in it yes
when they formed the army education UNK during the war they er they wore uniform most of them were warrant officers and soldiers but in uniform you could come out i mean they been ordinary soldiers but they'd been put on a charge every time the saw them you know
but er they were they were they were soldiers and they wore uniform and UNK of rank such a scream and yet some of them were really nice blokes you know
in particular sergeant he was he was an UNK and choir master at UNK cathedral in peacetime and he was music mad
wonderful man but completely uniform he was a proper character he looked ridiculous every time he walked down the street you know
yes see it's interesting you should say that erm the study on UNK williams in the last year at UNK
erm points out that UNK williams was the same er that when he was in uniform he was UNK
mm
he couldn't conform
he was in the army and he was you know he was pleased do anything he undertook some very difficult jobs
er he was in the ambulance UNK i think in the first world war but he was a UNK
yeah that's what i said to these chaps
yeah
but i mean i think again it's a matter of the way in which your mind takes over and says it is not important how i dress and even if i'm in an army uniform it doesn't matter
UNK
UNK irrelevant yes
research then which is really the erm the type of the whole topic today
the researcher
scientific research is often divided into UNK
pure research is an attempt to produce a coherent framework of the facts and events occurring in the world around us
it's sometimes thought that this type of research takes place mainly in universities and UNK of higher education
that it advances knowledge but has no UNK practical use
yeah
applied research on the other hand is thought to produce results which have an immediate application to industry to technology or to medicine
these results could produce great profits and are therefore carried out under the UNK of large firms which hope to benefit from them
it's doubtful whether these UNK were ever clear and certainly nowadays it's realised that pure and applied research goes side by side within all research organisations
they are both funded by the same bodies
the science research council industry and UNK
however scientific research is expensive and it's natural that to some extent those who fund it should expect to see returns and be able to influence its direction
this produces a pressure for results which may result in reports for UNK which haven't been fully tested
one recent example of this was when a scientist reported what was known as cold UNK
that is the UNK of hydrogen atoms in a cold solution
the process normally occurs only at temperatures and pressures comparable with those found at the centre of the sun
if true this would have been an amazing source of energy
but the experiment proved UNK
and therefore you begin to question whether it ever really happened in the first place don't you
erm it re it must again be a matter where er a scientist can become very enthusiastic and almost read into the results what he expects to find there
anyway the question erm is can you think of any ways in which scientists could be relieved of the pressure to get quick results
should research be concentrated on topics from which an immediate use is seen or is it possible for those who provide the funds to take a longer view
well you can't rush a scientist can you 'cos he's UNK new things isn't he
and sometimes it takes a long time doesn't it
long time takes years
yes
yes
this is always talk talked about
mm
mm
if er scientists and his team works on a or think they are on to a discovery or something that needs UNK can get the necessary funding office or firms that they benefit say this in the previous paragraph that's fine but to concentrate on topics which are i don't think that happens
these things are usually in my opinion anyway er the results are often accidents
yes i think that
you suddenly come across something and whether it is er medicine mostly or technique think first of them one stage after another was invented more or less by accident
yes accident plays a large part in it i'm sure
that erm very often the discovery of one thing is perhaps and even unexpected spin off from pursuing research into another
as a result of such
the UNK that you have at home er came UNK from scientific research into space travel
mm
oh that's right yeah
the use of UNK came from that
certainly
er i mean one of the immediate things that er we would like scientists to research for example is the common cold
mm
it would do us all a lot of good
if they could find a cure for the common cold
greatest benefit to UNK
yes it yeah
now that is something immediate
but it's no good
that's right yeah
putting a couple of scientists into a room and say find it
well after the war they had these UNK where people went
mm
and volunteers went and got UNK and sat in cold UNK to try and catch cold they couldn't catch cold could they
yes
no th that's
trying
that has only re recently closed down
forty years
yes only a few years ago
yes indeed
with adverts in the
yes
i was er i was prepared remember when i had my bone UNK i went all prepared UNK from head to foot wrapped up like a UNK from my neck to my feet
mm
ready for the op on the saturday and friday i st started to UNK they took me temperature i'd got a cold between it took us a fortnight and for the operation to come through it common cold
yeah yes yeah
and yet they were gonna take a bone out and put it put it in my and all sorts of things
so they you see that is in an instant where it would have been enormously beneficial to have something to prevent the cold
that would UNK it
or UNK the cold
or prevent the cold yeah
yes
but a doctor one of the doctors in the same hospital saying that the during the first world war when they were so desperate you know so many casualties they had to cut short treatment and they had to bandage men up and leave them UNK up a long length of they found it was often better to leave a wound UNK up in it's own
mm
rather than keep UNK off
yes
and th they it was an old indian treatment they found it quite sheer force of circumstances er that they discovered it was better sometimes to bind a wound up and leave it alone
mm
it UNK better that way than being constantly dressed and
yes yeah
it was
yes but then again it was it was an incident
UNK discovery
UNK discovery
yes UNK completely by accident
yes
i say most of these things are found by accident
yes i'm sure they are
a lot of it is anyway
and if it if it were possible to forecast absolutely what the result is going to be er scientific research would be much easier
mm
yeah
people would be able to say with some er degree of certainty how long the research is going to take but i think one of the problems at the moment is you can't always say
just don't know
just how long it's gonna take
it might take months it might take years it might never even be possible
'cos i think another thing where a lot of pressure comes on scientists is where it says a lot of cases where profit is in the UNK this is a thing
mm
we wanted to get people chemical wanted to get a thing through so they could make a profit from it
i think that's where a lot of the pressure comes in now i should think on scientists
oh yes i'm sure it is
and this is particularly true you mentioned UNK and drugs
i think this is particularly true medicine
that's what i was thinking of actually in the medical
erm i heard something over the weekend that erm mentioned er an american drug company that has come up with whatever drug and it's moved from being a million pound concern into a multi million pound concern because of these UNK
mm
er now it's a very good company it's not a british company
it's a great pity it's not a british company because it's would be a great source of revenue in this country
er but that there must have been enormous pressure on the scientist working in those great UNK
mm
yeah
to come up with er a solution for whatever it was they were they were going into
yes er must be enormous pressure UNK there
i don't think i'd like to work under that pressure
'cos i wonder whether it's that sort of pressure that caused some of these drugs to come out which caused UNK which drops to mind UNK whether that was pressure through you know to the damage that did you see
yes mm yes
whether that was in under pressure
it has to be it has to be rushed
through
you can hardly try them on humans that the of these i mean
must be a risk they must know there is a risk mustn't they
oh yes
oh yes they obviously go through a stage of trying to make sure that erm theoretically it is correct
and then they do er conduct some experiments on animals and you know that again is a question erm
ethical the choice is wrong i mean some drugs suit some people and not others
yeah yes but there there's gotta come a time when they have to test it on human beings
human beings
human beings
yes
i mean the one that's i suppose talked about a lot nowadays is a i d s and there are some drugs that have will not cure a i d s but will slow down not the progression but the regression that takes place with a i d s
yeah that's right
and erm they must try them on human beings and i'm sure there are some people who are quite prepared to these tried
to try them
'cos there must be a great deal of pressure on the scientific erm er problem was there and try and find
certainly yes yeah
that again if you if you were able to say that's gonna happen that will that will that must be given priority but there's no guarantee they can find it
no
no
however many you get and however long they work there's no guarantee they'll come up with a solution at the end
no
telephone well it's not for us no
scientific research is usually carried out by a team of scientists often from several disciplines who work together each of whom contributing something to the whole
this method is often faster and it enables very expensive apparatus to be put to better use
it may also overcome the problem that from time to time scientific UNK were claimed which had resulted in the UNK of results their UNK or too selective use
can you remember any occasions where wrong or even dangerous results have been produced in this way
oh yes
mm
mhm
yes yeah
so th there we have the example don't we
erm
well it's the UNK that you
yes
that you were talking about
very much last case
very serious
erm
i suppose there is always the danger that the scientist will see things will be able to interpret things in the way that he or she wishes
UNK thinking
yes UNK thinking
UNK thinking yes
yes
erm the only example that i thought of reading through this was erm that of intelligence testing erm because intelligence testing er was held in high esteem about forty or fifty years ago
maybe it will coming back into fashion now i don't know but there is no question as to whether some of the early er research that was done into the measurement of intelligence was in fact fair and fairly represented
i know some of the weird things they brought in that towards the latter end of the war
in the army there was hundreds of people were put through selection tests and
yes yeah
sticking your urine in a bottle lot of blocks sticking them in different coloured shaped holes and things like that you know
yes yeah
but er it was all the rage in about forty five forty six
oh certainly yes and it carried on for a long time afterwards and i think is still used in some selection processes
is it
yes
oh
but there are i think there is question as to as to whether you can accurately erm explain what a level of intelligence is but comparison with other people because some of the data that was used in some of the earlier testing erm was faulty so i have heard
yes
er but there again i think it was because the person doing this was so keen to see the right result that he read into
into
information coming back erm ideas and trends you know UNK that weren't really there
obtaining the evidence by observation
evidence is all around us and the first step in any research is for the scientist to decide which of the many facts are of concern to him
his mind must act as a filter
collection of data may be a slow process throughout his life observe the time of appearance of the planets against the background of the stars
these UNK tables enabled to work out and test his UNK for UNK motion
others such as UNK or UNK may be able to collect that information much more rapidly but again it may be years before it can be used to produce a theory of evolution
mm
do you that a child's mind works in this way as he or she looks at the world and finds meaning of in it and are others who are influenced by their own experiences and by their conclusions of others
in other words is the is the child more able simply to observe and draw conclusions based on that
whereas the adult is influenced by what he or she already knows or by what other people have been saying
and a child's mind is free of UNK isn't it
yes indeed a child's mind is
if we can get past the UNK we found that out when in our generation we tried to switch over to UNK
mm
get rid of all the UNK but that's what we found it most difficult to
still not
to UNK
yes it's still not there
no
i took a retirement i took early retirement coming in the
you would
no
i couldn't do the old one now
no
sometimes i
the metres and things
all the measurements i can't
yes yeah so
a metre and then
don't let let's just think of that for a moment as an experience erm as far as money is concerned
mm
do you find it easier to deal with
oh yes
pence and pounds than it was to deal with the old pounds shillings and pence
oh yes
there's
i always refer back
you refer back
you shouldn't
i have i know it is
you shouldn't
and i often think to myself when i'm paying for something think to myself oh i would never have paid that years ago
you know
i know
when you when you work it out
yes
how much more you would have had to pay
oh it's a lot easier the only thing i want to
it's much easier
it's much easier
morning i found i had blank spot with the old twenty pence piece
it's gone now of course
ten pence piece
the ten pence piece yes sorry the ten pence piece
and the UNK
i kept mixing it up with the UNK
yes
and yet and i had some really embarrassing experience getting it off
and UNK all the change getting dirty looks and i could not get that point out of the brain
kept thinking it was twenty
i took me no end of time
yes i can see that
ten p
two shillings
and he kept thinking it was twenty
yeah
i had some really dirty looks from people in the shops bus conductors you know
yes
but i think i think that in the main
the UNK to a decimal based currency was easier
but what about other things like erm distance wh what
the metres
metres
you know
i'd come up
metres
i don't bother i still think in what i do
mm
in my
yes yeah
i do it doesn't bother me all that much no
do you do you do you think in metres
i'm perfectly used to the distance system
yeah
i've got all that perhaps prejudice of them
you actually didn't you
and we have car i still talk in miles
mm
and i still fill up with petrol by the gallons
gallons yes
yeah
erm i personally prefer litres but i UNK that the four and half litres about four and a half litres
and i reckon the miles and petrol consumption
yes
i don't know why
no i don't either no it it's strange there are certain things that are difficult
i mean erm i don't know the height of this room but erm i could not begin to guess in metres but i would think you know a door is six foot six traditionally in height add a couple of feet on it's you know
that's twelve feet
yes
ten feet
now if i were to say let us now have that conversation using erm
metres
metres
it would be very difficult for me
i couldn't i couldn't do it
no
very difficult
no
i because i do erm a lot of kilometres travelling a abroad
i have a
i have no difficulties in miles and kilometres
i've got an UNK that high but i couldn't tell you high it is in metres
could no
i would say it was three foot six
and what about the height of an individual
yeah
mm
yes
erm i still don't know what average height is i know that in general in erm imperial measure it is f five feet eight inches for a man it's supposed to be average
but i've no idea what that is in metres
no
no
so i never needed to know that
i don't think you try
no
it's very
no
but i'm sure
i couldn't tell you
you couldn't
erm may i say while you've been
yes
across your UNK
one metre seventy or something
one metre seventy but it was something like yes
something like that
it's the same with weight isn't it
yeah
same with weight
oh yeah
it's the same with weights
yes
mm
yes i suppose you see
if you if you haven't got the old UNK to get rid of it's fairly simple
yeah
well just learning one more system
but to get it's quite on top of the other thing it seems quite complicated doesn't it
it's not unlike language if you grow up speaking a language it's easy
oh ar it's easy
if you have to acquire it as a new one it's
seen children take to it like a duck takes to water don't it
yeah yes i sometimes have difficulty with my twelve year old daughter
mm
because she understands litres and UNK and she understands UNK and grams and i still think i suppose in pounds
mm
and in pints and if she's trying to cook something and she says UNK what does four hundred UNK mean
i have to stop and think and i have to work out that four hundred UNK is not quite five hundred UNK so it's about but i'm not sure how about a UNK a pint
but it's very difficult i've got to go through all that before i can answer her question
and all she wants to know is do i use this jug or do we use that jug
i think she's supposed to be
the next generation no the next generation
must be doing litres for about twenty years and i've been retired ten years
yes oh certainly
and we were working in litres
oh yes
a good ten years
oh wait a minute it must be because erm
more than that
no
oh more than that because i was i can remember being in school
job and all
yeah
yeah
working under a UNK now sadly died when the head of maths did a presentation to the whole school so this was prior to nineteen seventy four when she retired
so nineteen seventy two i should think
oh yes easy it's been i one of the thing
one of the things that was driving me mad in last part of my career was i was responsible for documentation the fuel issues on the round a thousand of gallons a day
mm
and it got to the point where our pumps were issuing the fuel in gallons but the fuel companies were bringing it in litres
in litres
and i had to do conversions on thousands of pounds and litres and gallons i was working from a con
yes
a con conversion table i hadn't got it was
yeah i can imagine yes
gallons and litres
that was the that was that was over thir fourteen years ago
yeah
so that
i think it was about nineteen seventy two that we went decimal
yes
mm
we're gradually getting used to it
ah so the child's mind is UNK it's more easily able to erm observe things take in things learn things and has a lot of advantages over us older us adults
by contrast UNK has it that in some cases a single observation may result in a great discovery and here we've got one or two examples
the lifting of a kettle lid by the steam from boiling water may have led UNK to the discovery of steam power
similarly observation of the clear patch in a dish of UNK on a UNK is said to have resulted in UNK discovery of antibiotics such as penicillin
now we go on then to the section obtaining the evidence by experiment
observations show that events are not isolated but UNK with each other often producing a complex situation
scientists use experiments especially those which can be carried in a laboratory or under controlled conditions to UNK these UNK
when wanted to investigate this UNK of the air he first identified the factors which might be involved such as volume pressure and temperature
these factors are known as the variables in an experiment
he set out to see how changes in pressure that's the variable affecting the following the dependent variable keeping the other variable that is the temperature unchanged as a fixed parameter
most experiments are concerned in the same way with a variable a dependent and fixed parameters now that's a lot to take in one go isn't it
mm
but you could you could just imagine you've got three things one each one is UNK on the other change one and the others will change
so if you change number one and number two it is possible to keep number three the same
as long as you are doing to number two something appropriate as effective by what you have decided to do
we move on then a little bit to talk about UNK because that's another area of science erm where a lot of observation was research and is done
UNK wanted to have their results accepted as UNK accurate have worked in the same way but not always successfully when dealing with people is not always to easy to think of all the things which may affect the result
so UNK then is the study of UNK the study of people and is rather different from studying materials which are perhaps not so variable
what are the factors which if ignored could affect the accuracy for example of opinion UNK and can scientific methods be successfully used in UNK in social or political fields
let's think about opinion UNK
can you think of factors which will influence the result
there's a lot perhaps difficult to take into consideration
yes
yes
the weather
the weather
yeah
mm
erm people go around trying to get data for the er subject for discussion and if it's rain they don't find any proper average of the to
mm
erm
any other
can have an effect
what else can have an effect
well i suppose if somebody's going around with an opinion pole and they ask you about a certain what you think about a certain thing that presume what their asking about may affect everybody in different way
mm
i mean some may affect me one way the next person they ask affected another way so they get two different opinions don't they
yes yeah
although they would try to work that out by saying for example erm we would have during the course of the day to interview somebody from you know so many males so many females so many in this age group so many in that age group so many who perhaps i don't know whether they go down to look at your address or whatever
but they tr they're doing their best to get across you know you sometimes wonder why they pick on you and they don't pick on me
that's right yeah
they're obviously saying well he fits into a certain category whereas i don't
so erm they try to consider it
i think the thing that occurs to me erm they don't always know erm what has just happened to you
no
erm so do ho if the question is how do you react to so and so you're answer may very well depend on whether you've just UNK your toe against the pavement as you got off the bus
or whether you've had to wait for an hour in the rain for the bus to come along whether you're in a good mood or a bad mood
your answers may very well be affected by ho how your are feeling
tha that's one thing that can't be taken into consideration
so if the same every day
mhm
UNK something and there's half a dozen people in the group to give their opinion it's not what worth the paper it's printed on
no
mm
yes
no
no
because they are picked at random
yes
yes could be could be anybody yes
i'll tell a another way in which erm er you your comment about UNK about weather may influence things
you can have a very good er opinion pole about the outcome of an election
yeah
the outcome of the election may depend upon the weather
yeah
because er is it the floating voters or is it the others who will turn out regardless of the weather
mm
they'll be some people who erm for whatever reason won't come out because it's the worst possible day for the weather and UNK have been affected by weather
yeah
you can't you can't calculate that
no
no way in which you can calculate that
but wh what about scientific UNK methods when they are studying UNK the second part of that question
can scientific methods be successfully used in let's say social or political fields
the study of UNK
i got a little bit involved in that a few years ago when i was working on it having had some UNK before hand
the idea that you look at people and you try to calculate the way in which they work and how their behaviour and how their relationships affect other people i think we display a degree of not knowing very much about that don't we
well i could see yeah
well go on say something about it
well UNK and their families
mm
it was very successful in establishing the details about execution and erm and so on
but coming to the practical side of it
mm
that's very interesting because we're always going back to the earlier comment that perhaps people like scientists like UNK are intelligent but not in touch
they're not practical people th erm and it may very well be that there are some people who are very good at the theory but erm are not very good at the practice
le let
you need to have somebody who can use the results of the research and see its practical applications
yes
and that isn't that isn't always very easy
erm we don't seem to know very much about UNK and political science
not a lot
not a lot
no but in interesting area very interesting
always something
what about think of it
yes well some of my some of my best friends are UNK so i must be careful
oh
must be careful what i say yes but that that's
i often wonder how a person can get a degree in UNK
mm
i don't quite know how erm
what are the subjects
what are the subjects
yeah
how about the lower social
well the higher social
yeah
it's ba yes i couldn't give you an answer because i
mm
didn't come from that sort of background
i UNK onto it later on
mm
erm but i will see if i can find some information it maybe that i yes you want to comment
get a degree of political science
oh that's a good idea mm
and you hear of people having a degree in political science how can a person obtain a degree in political science
i mean UNK er science political science is not an exact knowledge
well no it's i don't know whether political science could be exact er
maybe science is the wrong word but it do erm science basically means knowing means knowledge
but it would be interesting to know what sort of a background you have to have in order to have a degree in UNK
erm i ought to know this but it's not the sort of thing that i have on my UNK
you perhaps know you get
in UNK
no
depend on what your studying i suppose doesn't it
yes i mean the rea the people that i've had most contact with erm in UNK are those who are concerned with what is known as the labour market
mm
the way in which work employment er is available
ah
or not available
ah
the level of unemployment whether the unemployment erm is for example one of the old or the younger element of society er where the difficulties are er what the employer thinks how many people of what size are unemployed how many people of what age and of what sex
now that's qui that i having been involved in that to some extent
yeah
i find it very interesting
yeah
and you can see the you can see the way in which it can be applied if we know erm that there are erm too many people of a certain age and too few jobs then maybe we can do something about it
th the trouble is the government seems to go the other way and er when it should be learning my opinion UNK the age at which you receive your pension they want to extend the age into which you have to work
mm right
erm there you are that's always political and we don't we don't want to
four million people
so it's normally dealing with people isn't it
it is it's dealing with people
dealing with people
but erm funnily enough i was out erm on saturday evening and by a strange coincidence er where we were sitting having a meal erm in the restaurant erm someone came in and joined us we saw some friends of ours and he is a UNK from the university
and i'd been wondering whether like i could perhaps persuade him or his boss the professor to come along and talk to us and let some of their time is very full and to them time is money
mm
there was a time i'm sure a few years ago when you could have said can you spare us an afternoon they would have been only too pleased but now they might have to say well you know two hours of my time that's the university and you know there are the overheads and
but they're a UNK aren't they
they're UNK yes
should have done it
oh yes but there was certainly a time when er universities schools and even business companies thought that it was part of their erm their way of supporting society in general that they gave time to go out and give talks
er i think there is a UNK now for them to say oh i'm terribly sorry we can only do this against payment
yeah
mm
well that's economic pressure
economic pressures yes
my you know time is money erm if i can't account for it
mm
it's like you calling you know calling one of your accountants
mm
yes
you know he gives two hours of his time
i'm sure we can get an accountant to come and speak to us but we might have to pay him for two hours work you see
mm
and that you'll have to take out a mortgage to do that
but anyway
erm the chicken to the egg which comes first
over the years
haven't found out yet have we
no
over the years it has never been certain except in the very simplest cases what comes first in scientific research
do observations lead to a sudden idea or to a theory
or does the scientist know first what he or she is looking for in order then to select the information he or she needs
a UNK looks at the stars a doctor looks at the human body
if they are too selective they may miss the vital factor
it took many years for scientists studying UNK to realise it was the UNK that was important not the messenger from the UNK
if experimental methods are to be used then some theory must already be present
the results of the experiment may UNK a theory and it will then be abandoned with another
results can never prove a theory
for in the future under different conditions there is always the possibility of showing that it's wrong
nowadays scientists look at laws and theories from a new prospective
they realise that improved techniques may UNK today's theory and so they no longer use the terms true and false right or wrong but only value a theory for it's UNK at the time
it will be difficult to assess what counts as success in scientific research
for the researcher it may be different things it may be money prestige a claim by his UNK promotion within the team UNK the ac acquisition new knowledge
it could be the moment when after years of UNK work he UNK the result which leads to a flash of UNK a UNK to new knowledge a UNK into the future
and to close there a few questions let's take them one at a time
or to shoot them sir
or to shoot them yes if things go wrong
or if they're found out perhaps yes having based their decisions on faulty material
do you think the joy of discovery is enhanced if the new knowledge could be used for the good of UNK or do you think knowledge per se is enough
do you think that your discovery is enhanced if the new knowledge can be used for good of UNK or do you think that UNK new knowledge is just enough on it's own
could be for instance the knowledge of d n a
mm
at the UNK university which lead to the discovery of the UNK
yes
now i think that's a
mm
i think that i think that d n a is a very good example because erm it presumably it was initially a piece of jury search
only he had no idea what he was after
yes
i know i know
mm
and er it just suddenly
mm
yes yeah and now it it's almost current language
most people know about d n a they know the expression they know what it means they
yes very common knowledge
and of course it has led to the conviction of a number of erm criminals number of UNK certainly
before then nobody had ever heard of it
mm
mm
but i wonder if when it was discovered the feeling was jury named it was a discovery a new discovery
or whether it was a feeling that this is wonderful because it would be of use to UNK
well i think he said before let's see whether we can use this
mm
on this particular
yes
yeah
and it happens to have come out right
mm
what about the discovery of atomic power
yes
it was it
erm so er there must have been a situation where he was discovered that it was possible to split the UNK basically
yes well that was wha the what was the name UNK
UNK wasn't it
UNK
UNK
UNK
no what you know what UNK was now because a chap called UNK something similar
h e y s i
mhm
something like that
yes yeah
but at that st
and then new
yes
that's the one UNK
mm
yeah
erm but at that stage it was very much pure science
that's called pure science
it is a theory
it's been proved that the theory can work in practice
yeah
at that stage they weren't sure as i understand it what could be the use UNK abuse of this discovery
mm
but it was almost think wonderful that they were able to discover this
erm and then of course later someone was able to turn this into a fearful weapon that was often my view of the thing
erm who only later realised what he had opened up to the whole of UNK
erm that is a point where the discovery in itself must have given a great deal of pleasure to a er a number of people who've been involved in the in the research
well of course a very long process of discovery and UNK and eventually
mm
got the got the through that stage erm heavy water
yes
that was in norway and got away from the UNK
mm
and then reached it's destination in america
it's a very complex story
that's where the pressure comes in again isn't it
pressure
yes
the pressure to do work against 'cos they knew that germany were working on the same lines didn't they the enormous pressure to get there first
i mean the research is still going on
mm
oh yes
yeah
i think it's a thing that they wish they could dis invent don't they
well yes but then you begin to wonder what would ho how would if they if you could dis invent
you can't dis invent it
what would what would have happened to history
but that's another let let's see if we can tackle at least one more before the tea comes in
do you know of any cases where the desire for success has led a scientist to UNK or UNK either UNK or deliberately
it has been done but i couldn't give an example
no
i feel exactly the same
i'm sure that i've heard of instances where er the results have been UNK
in order to make it look it right
yeah
erm and the last question very quickly then
what's the of computer UNK research
so many results are being produced that there is neither time nor money to follow them up
can you think of any way by which vital results could be identified and used and i think it's a very difficult question that one
just of isn't it
possibly because of computer UNK research so many results are being produced that there is neither time nor money to follow them up
can you think of any way in which vital results could be identified and used
the difficulty is knowing what is going to be useful in the future
mm
well they can't look they don't but what according to and therefore they have to throw a high percentage of the results
mm
out and work for is used or can be used
what just like that
yes
but then again er for people like us difficulties given
i think yes i think i'm i think that is one it's last one that probably has erm defeated us
were not able to make very much comment
so i i'm going switch off this recording you see erm for our monday afternoon session
thank you dear
had her operation and that everything's going well and i'm sure will take our best wishes to her when er he goes home after the meeting
well this morning er you know all know colin there's er no need for me to spend a lot of time introducing him to you
he's been here several times before and er we do look forward to having another interesting morning with you and i understand that er you're going to give us a musical morning this morning and er
sing to us
not going to sing
i promise not well i might get carried away
alright well
it's all over to you then colin
thank you
welcome here
erm i'm going to er talk to you this morning and invite comments this morning about anthems of the nations
it's erm a hand book study from last year's hand book and erm the reason i picked it i think is two fold
first the first reason er is entirely UNK
i was approached in this room about erm twelve months ago by UNK and UNK erm to ask if i would make a programme out for their group
the UNK group
and i wrote down that they were on a doing anthems of the nations
when i asked them about it later they said oh no we have no intention of doing anthems of the nations perhaps you would like to do it for us
so i was landed UNK with my own UNK if you like
landed with that topic
having discovered that i was then in april of last year in france in strasbourg is UNK twin city in france and as i was wondering through near to the cathedral in strasbourg i found a book a book shop a second hand book shop
UNK through some papers that they have got in front of the shop and found one set of erm papers from nineteen thirty six concerned the french national anthem and i thought that was a second amazing coincidence er and so i had to buy myself that set of papers for about a pound
and it really was quite interesting
so what i propose to do this morning is to talk erm based on the notes from the hand book about anthems of the nation but to spend probably more time talking about the french national anthem than about any others because i know a little bit about it and i have discovered even more
no prizes then for guessing that was the british national anthem erm god save the king as it was or was it originally god save the queen it was king er when you grew up
yeah
and then the queen
erm and it was interesting that there was always a tendency to stand up wasn't there
yeah
yeah
because i think in the so called good old days you always did stand up when you heard the national anthem played
and i remember one or two who used to sit do keep seated you know just to
as a sign yes as a protest
i don't know what it was
as a protest
yes as a protest against it
oh i didn't think of it you know
mm
you know when you when you at the end of the film you all done it didn't you
yes
there was a time when you couldn't go through a week perhaps couldn't even going through a day without hearing the british national anthem somewhere
the radio television the radio used to close down the television used to close down if you were up late enough at night with that with that national anthem
and erm the radio was the same
at the end of the film or at the beginning
yeah
at the beginning
at the beginning
yes it used mm it us
but there was a time when
you always you always have it at the beginning or any er programme
well i think that started in the black out you know because we had to if the UNK went you know we had to stop in the
yeah yes
so the
in the UNK i mean it changed
it ch it changed didn't it there was the there was a great change that meant that people no longer heard it at the same time
they heard it at the beginning rather than at the end
it then gradually disappeared
the only time you hear it now is on sporting occasions i should think
yeah
yes that's right
perhaps before the queen's speech on
don't forget the command performance
yes yeah and command performances and things like that
erm i don't suppose anybody knows who wrote the UNK national anthem
er UNK his head he thinks he knows
before his time
no it isn't
it's not known with any degree of certainty erm there was some indication by someone writing at the end of the last century that it was written by someone in the time of the queen elizabeth hence perhaps it was god save the queen
a man by the name would you believe of doctor john bull
bull
now whether that's true or not i don't know
the writer of the words was possibly henry UNK henry UNK and he was an english UNK and UNK and he wrote various erm bits of erm music words
he wrote UNK he wrote UNK he wrote songs and sometimes he wrote UNK music for things going on the stage and apparently he also wrote sally in our UNK
so if the story is correct the writer of the music for the national anthem is the same as the UNK of the music for sally in our UNK
erm originally is was sung in latin in the time of the UNK and then an er after the UNK of james the second and english version appeared
i don't suppose you've ever heard it sung in latin i certainly haven't
no
i wouldn't even know where to begin to find that
erm
probably sing it in the er catholic church
yes they probably would sing it in latin in the catholic they certainly use erm latin and of course the words have changed depending whether it's a king or a queen on the s on the UNK and from it's gone from god save our lord the king to god save our gracious queen and that came in of course in the time of victoria and then had to be brought in again er at the time of erm queen elizabeth
and what about some of the others
what about anthems in general
they haven't always been national anthems it's a relatively new thing erm i've mentioned UNK times about four hundred years ago
er it probably came into fashion in the something like the eighteenth century
before the eighteenth century there wasn't perhaps a national anthem there wasn't such much of a er national feeling and so there was very little need to have a national anthem
so we're talking about the seventeen hundred eighteen hundred and it was very often known as a national song and we had a national song probably before any other country
it wasn't known as a national anthem apparently until eighteen fifty two
so before that it was a national song and then it became a national anthem eighteen fifty two before your time i should think eighteen fifty two
yes just a little bit
just a just a little bit
just a little bit
just a little bit
just a little bit
and then other countries started to get on the band wagon and erm find their own UNK
now the UNK and the words vary enormously and we shall have a chance to hear some of the UNK certainly
sometimes the words are prayers
praying for the king the queen or whatever they have
sometimes they express UNK
sometimes they refer to battles or UNK or UNK
in the case of some of the particularly recently made newly independent states there is a whole idea of a revolutionary UNK
this is perhaps particularly true of some of the anthems for the erm the african states
by contrast some of the older countries who got a history of calm and stability they have anthems which try to bring out the beauty of the country
the natural beauty of the country
and again you will hear from the UNK music the way in which er the anthems vary tremendously
the variety there is a great variety also of musical styles
god save the king or god save the queen as it is now is UNK you could march to it but i was corrected at a recent meeting to say that people don't march to it but you could if you wanted to
so are UNK songs other have er others are very UNK songs
you'd practically have to run to keep up with some of them
and some of the south american ones are rather more like opera than national anthems erm and of course sometimes you come across er UNK which are i suppose anthems
hardly national anthems because if you think of the red flag which is the communist anthem it's not national because it UNK throughout the whole of the world for those people who are erm red UNK communist UNK and if you think of europe whatever you think of europe there is a european anthem
you can't call it a national anthem because it covers the twelve or more states of the european union as it is now and do you know what that is the anthem for the european union
no
it's UNK to joy the last movement of UNK ninth UNK erm you'd know the tune you'd recognise it particularly if you had a better singer than me on as a UNK
UNK
but that's erm thank you thank you
erm that was erm that was also that is the anthem for the european union as it's now called
erm and not only do they have the red flag there is the erm the UNK for the communist movement as well and that apparently erm was written by french workers in the nineteenth century and it was used in russia until nineteen forty four
so we have national anthems and those are the ones we're gonna concentrate on
but there are sometimes erm anthems that are not just for one nation but for lots of nations
we've already mentioned that the british national anthem was played a lot at one time
this was i suppose the case particularly during the war the second world war er where it was used to promote a national feeling
and the as i say it must have been difficult to go through a day between nineteen thirty nine and nineteen forty five without hearing the national anthem somewhere somehow
er nowadays it's very rarely heard
erm i can't remember when i last heard the british national anthem apart from the little UNK i played just now
when did you last hear the
queen's speech
birthday queen's speech on christmas day and er it usually is the morning isn't it in the morning of the er UNK the duke of UNK birthday the queen's birthday
in june
yes in june
and sometimes on the queen mother's day
and on the queen on the on the queen mother's birthday yes
you wouldn't hear it if you went to australia would you because they're trying to do away with that
quite typical at the end isn't it
yeah
any idea where that on one is from
UNK
not far away belgium actually belgium
that's it of
yes it's belgium and you may have heard again during sporting events football matches or whatever it is
erm written about a hundred and fifty years ago during a struggle when belgium was trying to regain it's er it's independence from holland
er and it's sung in two languages either in french or in UNK because they speak them both over there
erm and the verse goes something this
oh noble belgium well UNK mother to you our hearts and hands we give to you our life lie UNK together UNK you shall live so again it's a very UNK feeling
erm trying to UNK that feeling in the people who listen to it
any oh got th the beginning of the next one any idea on that one
it's not the UNK one is it
no it's not but it's canada
oh
it's canada and you can almost hear o canada
yeah
if you if you happen to know where it fits it
you can almost hear that one
erm and has we haven't got anybody here who has relatives living in canada erm but once or twice i found that people recognised that because they've been to canada visit relatives and they therefore know and they they've heard
i thought i knew it but i couldn't make out where i'd heard it
couldn't make yes yeah
it's the canadian one the canadian one
this is a long way away
that in fact is the chinese national anthem
i think we have to remember that these anthems are all played by the same military band and therefore they're played in a western style
perhaps if you heard it in different circumstances su you know surrounded by chinese people then maybe you would begin to recognise it
but erm it's called the march of the UNK and it calls upon people arise you who refuse to be UNK
there you are UNK right up your streets isn't it
you who refuse to be to be UNK
this is
the next one is a rather different one in style not attempting to be so UNK
not attempting to UNK er peoples UNK feelings but really looking at the country
they will be standing up for quite a long time
that's actually in two parts as you heard and the first part is very much trying to paint a picture i think trying to show how beautiful the country is and we don't i haven't told you yet which country it is
and the second one is just that little bit more lively try to UNK people
UNK must pass sun will UNK shall UNK
so it was i suppose we have to say in the past tense it was the national anthem of UNK
now that they've split into two parts erm i don't know which one that belongs to
presumably the UNK parts since it UNK the UNK to UNK
the next one a little bit further north this time and it's the danish national anthem and it says something like king UNK stood beside the loch he UNK in UNK and smoke
so that one really is telling a story UNK something in danish history when they were fighting for their for their freedom
dates probably from the eighteenth century and apparently the UNK also used the music to our national anthem at one stage
so our national anthem has been about a bit particularly when you think that it came probably came from or was used in erm a piece of music simply by UNK
so our national anthem is not ours alone it's been borrowed stolen used by a number of other people
this is the next one and you'll probably recognise this one
any prizes for that one
UNK
that was the UNK
that's right yes
that's the french national anthem
er an and as i say that was that was one of the reasons
mm
french national anthem
why i very much decided i would er investigate the whole business of national anthems because erm that supposedly was written in strasbourg not in paris
oh
where you might think in the centre of france
erm and it wasn't written in UNK although the UNK the word UNK might suggest it was written in UNK
erm it was called the UNK erm because the volunteers from UNK came up from the south and entered paris and they were singing erm this one
anybody know the name of the person who wrote words and music according to the story according to the UNK of the UNK
it's a man called UNK joseph was his christian name UNK de lisle UNK de lisle probably never heard of him
but er but it the if you look on the music then you nearly always see his name UNK de lisle
but he that's his surname really
he was born in seventeen sixty in the middle of france really erm and he came from quite a large family
they had seven children in all did his family and the popular expression at the time was that their family didn't grow vegetables they grew children
quite a successful family
one of his brothers went into the navy and became very successful and very high up in UNK administration another went into the army and became a general
he himself went into the army and erm he was he was born in a in a little village and an article in the newspaper that i acquired in strasbourg said that he was born in this little village UNK le UNK his was born to life but in strasbourg where he wrote the national anthem he was born to UNK
so his name stays forever in french people's minds
he went through military school and he decided that at point that he would acquired an extra name
so he was born de lisle and it was at the point that he was in military school that he added the UNK you know like having a double UNK name
in our in our erm country the same was there he UNK on this name because he thought it would sound better for an army officer to have a name like UNK de lisle instead of just de lisle
i think it was his UNK name that he'd er he'd acquired at that at that time
he moved around france quite a lot and not only was he a soldier but he was writing UNK and UNK and UNK and so on and some of his work was pro produced and performed at the opera UNK in france
he was a tall red UNK man according to the descriptions he had one shoulder higher than the other but that didn't seem to prevent him being attractive to women
and we'll come back to that UNK per perhaps it doesn't matter if you've got one shoulder higher than the other
sorry about that
wh when he went into erm when he went into strasbourg with the UNK he was very well received because he was an officer he was a gentleman he was a UNK he was a UNK and he became very friendly with the mayor of strasbourg whose name was UNK a very german sounding name but don't forget that strasbourg is very near to the german border
the mayor of strasbourg this man UNK used to do a lot of entertaining and very often erm UNK de lisle would be invited to join the company
also present very often was the choir master of strasbourg cathedral whose name was UNK so you had a number of musicians and it was quite nice because the wife of UNK was also interested in music
war was declared on prussia and austria on the twentieth of april in seventeen ninety two
i bet you all knew that didn't you
twentieth of april seventeen ninety two france declared war on prussia and austria
it took four or five days for that news to reach strasbourg
sign of the times isn't it
two hundred years ago it took five days for news to get from paris to strasbourg
now it's done in less than a second
things have changed enormously but it's so it took sometime for them to get to know that they the french were at war with the UNK and the UNK and don't forget that strasbourg is only on the other side of the UNK from germany or whatever part of germany er it was at the time
er not prussia that was a bit further away but nonetheless the threat was there
erm there was a big UNK at the house of the mayor of strasbourg UNK and they discussed a number of things and one of the topics was raised was how UNK the revolutionary songs were
the revolution had taken place the UNK had been singing songs and one of the people present at this dinner this UNK said what we need is something different something new we need a new war song
and er UNK called across to UNK de lisle come on captain make us a war song
and in spite of his own UNK that he couldn't begin to do it everybody pressed him including UNK including the UNK wife and she UNK him
so
UNK returned that evening to his rather humble UNK in the town
in his mind he had obviously got UNK of things that he'd heard and seen that day there was an expression that was being called out to arm citizens because war had been declared
the standard of war is being UNK
he probably also remembered that the UNK son was a commander of a ba UNK that was called UNK de la
children of the UNK
so with these words in his mind these UNK of words he sat down
he took up his UNK
found a tune he took up his pen and he wrote some words and according to the story according to the UNK the next day at day break he rushed off to the mayor UNK and was able to say i have done it
and UNK describes this in a letter which she later wrote to her brother
her husband was a very good tenor the UNK he sang and she wrote out the parts for piano and various other instruments
now there is a famous picture somewhere in france i think kept in one of the UNK in strasbourg which shows this scene but it shows UNK de lisle actually singing it
the truth according to the letter is that it was the UNK the mayor of strasbourg who sang this for the very first time
there's been a lot of discussion about who actually wrote the erm the national anthem
there is some thought that this other UNK the choir master of strasbourg wrote it or perhaps produced the music to which erm UNK de lisle produced the words
nobody really knows it's been discussed argued about for years and years and years
perhaps we shall never know
it's rather nice to think that it happened in that way that it was done overnight
UNK de lisle had a very unfortunate end to his life because erm he was he had a good position but he lost it
erm UNK the mayor had to UNK the country
he UNK to UNK he then returned
he was captured and you know what the french do
he had his head cut off he was UNK
erm UNK as i say lost his position as a captain he was arrested he was UNK
he became friendly with UNK and he became friendly with UNK
now don't forget that i said that in spite of the fact that he'd got one shoulder higher than the other he was very attractive to women and there is running through this story the suggestion that maybe he was too friendly with UNK
she was the one who kept saying not tonight wasn't she
or they said it to her i don't know
erm and perhaps because he was becoming too friendly with UNK he was sent to spain by UNK but then he fell out with UNK and UNK fell out with him and he was put under UNK by the erm the president and erm it makes you wonder what really went wrong
UNK de lisle never married
perhaps he had fallen in love with someone who knows who it might be but he never married
he lived out in the country for a number of years lived in poverty erm he thought about and he wrote about suicide
he had a miserable life he came to paris and led a further miserable life
and this was the man who wrote their national anthem
finally in eighteen thirty there was yet another revolution in france and that brought him a ray of hope
he was finally given a pension but by that time he was old he was half paralysed and he was nearly blind and he died in eighteen thirty six only six years after he'd received this recognition and this pension
and he was he had an unfortunate death because he his body was buried in the little UNK near to the village where he had been brought up and he'd no sooner been buried than they decided to run a road through or erm something so his body had to be UNK and moved somewhere else and it wasn't until nineteen sixteen that the body erm was taken out and was taken to paris and restored in the er where so many other famous people erm do have their UNK and their UNK
so that's the story
a rather sad story in a way about a man who for a very short time achieved UNK in strasbourg because he wrote the UNK which we all recognised didn't we
let's hear the next one
know that one don't you
yeah
UNK
that's UNK
that's the that's the german national anthem it's UNK germany above all
i think you have to remember that the next line begins if so it's not just a pro it is it is a UNK song but it's not just a UNK that they will be erm
superb superior
it's if
there is a condition attached to it
erm apparently the first tune they used to those words was a tune which i've not been able to find which came from britain
er and eventually they took that tune from a UNK from a UNK string UNK
and of course it's also a hymn tune isn't it
yeah
yeah
erm
very often used it's the old hundred is it
yeah it's the erm the one glorious things of thee are spoken
it's city of my god that's it
erm like this country germany has not only a national anthem but it has various songs that are also UNK
erm we would think of others wouldn't we not only do we have our own national anthem but we have other songs that UNK from time to time
land of hope and glory is one that almost is a substitute for
yeah
the national anthem and the germans also have various other ones erm there is one which is very well known called the watch on the UNK bearing in mind that the UNK for much of its length is the border between germany and the rest of the world
erm certainly between germany and france
erm so that is the one that used to be used and to some extent is now used
there was a time when they were only allowed to sing the last verse not the first verse because of this er very UNK erm attitude that it portrayed
yes dutch yes no not as i say not far away that was UNK the first the first one we heard was UNK and that was the dutch one that's the UNK one erm written a long time ago written in the sixteenth century written as a piece of music erm the tune apparently very old indeed erm and UNK took the tune and made variations on it which is perhaps why it sounds familiar you've probably heard it somewhere else
erm it was adopted when UNK became queen in eighteen ninety eight
adopted as their national anthem and the words mean something like let him in whose veins flows the blood of the UNK remains free from a UNK strain
again very UNK and rather short isn't it
i think i'd rather stand to that one than i would of like standing to the UNK one which seemed to go on and on and on
erm another UNK
few any UNK in the company
spanish
do you notice anything about that
it's in it's in three four time it's a UNK time
mm
you could UNK to it
but it would be a funny one to march to wouldn't it although you know but it was certainly in three four time
yes
the UNK time
it's er it's polish it's polish
it's erm a traditional song as i say and erm it was erm it was written ah way back in just after the turn of the century eighteen hundred and something eighteen hundred and five or six something like that
it's a l it's a lively tune
it's a very lively tune but it is
considering poland was really UNK
yeah it is it is it's a UNK
it is a UNK
erm so if you want to get up and have a dance that's the one to play to
this is another er i think very traditional one
haven't heard of that one before it's a UNK national anthem and it's erm it's something like though ancient though free and UNK north though silent though UNK though beautiful north
so it's very much UNK the landscape of the country
not the king
not the battles
no
not the UNK but the countryside
erm first sung apparently as the end of the last century about eighteen ninety four erm and they had at least three other anthems in their time including at one stage using the two a pair god save the king god save the queen
so as i say ours has been about a bit it's been borrowed by various people
but that is the UNK one
this one i'm sure you'll recognise
russia
no
red flag ah
no
you're the wrong side of the world altogether
it's united states
states
the united states
you know i thought it was but it sounded more like
it's the star UNK banner the star UNK banner
that's it forever
yes
they also have my country it is of thee
and the picture you sometimes have well certainly the one i have recently is of president clinton standing there whe whi listening to whatever version they were playing when he was in russia
erm with his hand across on his heart because that's the way that they do it
erm it was written in eighteen fourteen and the author at the time was watching the UNK of UNK from a british ship on which he had been UNK
so there is some history erm to it
but the UNK apparently had been the song of a gentleman's music club
so the words composed to fit the tune that's already been going around in a in a gentleman's music club
erm it's a very interested one isn't it
and you again you i'm sure you'd heard it before but were difficult to say is it is it there
yeah
yeah
i wonder what you would make of this one
i don't think you'll and i suppose i make no apologies for including it because i think we are all very well aware of the terrible tragedy that is happening in yugoslavia it's not an anthem that i would have recognised erm i was fortunate to go to yugoslavia on i think two occasions in happier times and it UNK me tremendously to see on the television to hear on the radio to read in the newspapers just what has happened to what was emerging as not only a very beautiful but a very successful country
i first went i suppose in something like the nineteen seventies and i can remember in those days having some difficulty getting into the country
because it was a communist led country erm but i had i was going to visit friends er and it was possible for us to get in
oh we had to wait at the border we had in advance to get UNK and when we got there things were very simple but nonetheless we were very well received and the person that i was staying with lived in a flat a very simple flat but nonetheless a very pleasant flat
i went back not to see the same people but i went back erm on a family holiday
i should think it was about ten fifteen years later and it was so easy to get into the country
that had changed tremendously so easy it was to get into the country that i went in and out of the border about three times because having got into yugoslavia i realized i had some italian currency so i drove out again spent my italian currency and drove back again
er and nobody seemed to bother then the place had opened up it had become UNK it was UNK it was green er wherever you went you were very welcome people tried to speak english people tried to communicate
that was in something like nineteen seventy nineteen eighty something the turn of the seventies eighties
now look what had happened to the place and i play you that because maybe we shall never ever hear that again because yugoslavia cannot now exist as a state
it must eventually be split up into the UNK the UNK the UNK and that is in fact very sad
so i propose
you were not singing god save the person it was god save the nation
nation
yes
the interpretation
because the king represented the nation
yeah
yes
yeah
and al always on the same i think it is always the same school er UNK
always on UNK day on the eleventh of november the erm not only the UNK the god save the king national anthem but also the UNK was because it was a french class weren't they
yeah
we knew that and we had to sing it in french
mm
but what i meant was we was always going have those two
yes yeah
mm
i don't we're proud of our country any more are we
we've run ourselves down far too long and er i think this is true of us as individuals
yeah
as well as being true of the country
we we've gone through a stage where we've said i'm not good enough my families not good enough my UNK not and my class isn't good and my town isn't good enough erm and so you go on from that and you eventually but well you know what about england
UNK not worth very much is it
we aren't perhaps not the world power that we used to be
be we've got a lot that we ought to be proud of
yeah
certainly got a lot
yeah we have run ourselves down yeah quite you're quite true
quite right
you notice a difference even when you go to wales
where the
oh yes
there
yeah
they they're off like a shot aren't they
yeah
with their national anthem
yes yeah yes yeah and of course they're all so wonder singers aren't they the welsh
yes oh yes
erm you know
i think they say it's the hills don't they that er
i don't know i don't what it is er the whether it's the hills or the water but er there's something there's something that makes wonderful singers out of them
yeah it's lovely
they're not afraid to let themselves go
go
no they er they're not inhibited
mm
whereas er i'm afraid we english are inclined to do a bit of that
yes yeah i mean i think if i if i were to say to you shall we sing the national anthem we'd say oh no
no don't want to do that
i think it's because there's such a lot of mixed people here now
mm
er that's what it is we're not a true UNK now
we're not true UNK we got to be like er foreign people and er we just seem to go their ways
yes i think that you know i made the comment earlier that erm we have changed in the way in which news is UNK it takes seconds
we've changed in the way in which we travel
yeah
years ago if you wanted to go to n now let's say to poland
it would take you days upon days in order to get there
now you can do it in a matter of hours in an aeroplane
yes
yeah
and so it is possible for people to come and live here
that's right
er bring in their ways and their habits with them
erm and it is just as possible in theory for us to go and live somewhere else
er it is it is very easy
some people are a bit more UNK though they what they are aren't they
yes
and that makes it
er that they keep their own saying down there
yes
not like us
yeah
any old tom dick and harry can come
yeah that's very true
that's right
any other comments about ma national anthems and memories of hearing national anthems
when i was a girl
when you were a girl yes
here we go
now
that was a long time ago
because i belonged to the guides and my er lieutenant captain i don't what she was i forget
haven't yeah
came home she came home with me she came home with me and i'd just learned to play the piano and i played that it was we'd just come from guides you see and i was only young
aha
UNK
and i played that
you were eleven
oh my god
'cos i'd just learnt to play this thought it was ever so clever and she put her hands on me hands and she said no you mustn't play that not while we're in uniform
i thought well that i mean that stuck in my mind ever since then
yes
oh well we used to UNK when they played
are yes but you see we were just standing there and i was just showing off
oh
she said no we don't play that
well that's rather strange isn't it so you
well i thought so
if you hadn't your uniform on you could play it but because you had your uniform on
i don't why
couldn't play it
and i was so disappointed because it was the only thing i could play
yes oh yes
i UNK ag again i think this it shows a very different attitude it was as if
oh yes
the national anthem was something quite sacred
that's right
erm and erm i don't know that i ever did this but i never heard anybody heard anybody walking the street UNK the national anthem
no
no
because if you if you did somebody would think it was wrong
you could whistle a song but you couldn't wish whistle the national anthem
yeah that's right yeah
it was it was something quite sacred
something that you perhaps kept in a box almost and brought out on certain occasions
cinema everywhere everybody stood up and stood still
oh yeah
yes
but now
some people used to go out
they just go out walk out
yes
we never used to do that years ago
mm
mm
mm
mm
how many times have you said that get out before national anthem
before the national anthem yes
you could get round that if you went out during the singing of it
mm
mm
you either got out before or
at the beginning
because of those at the beginning
i know when we used to down to london to the london UNK gang show
they always used to play the national anthem before
before
yes
it always seems appropriate to me to open if you going to have a national anthem at all you should open with it
open with it
yeah
erm and erm and in a way get it out of the way but in a way register the fact that erm you are UNK
yeah
the importance of the nation if not the importance of the monarchy
especially when you travel to london i mean it meant it late co UNK they did it first didn't they so you got it in
mm
and then you were away yes
then you went to the gang show
to the gang show rather
yes yeah
i wondered if they still did it at the pictures 'cos it's years since i went to the pictures
i have no i don't i wouldn't think
i wouldn't think it's been played in a cinema for years
i was in a cinema on whichever evening saturday evening and they certainly didn't have that
they had lots of advertisements
oh yes
be at the end don't they
yeah no
half of hour of advertisements
yeah
i wouldn't entirely agree that the whole that all of the UNK are entirely just because of er their age
no
don't think you become entirely vulnerable just because you age i hope not anyway
so do i but er at the same we said this much to mr that you would except that many of the people who the company deal with are old and concerned with a limited income on fixed pensions you know that don't you
the majority of the people the company deal with certainly are er pensioners
yes
they come from all types of er social UNK
i'm sure but they're many of them are concerned about their budget because they live off a fixed pension
i don't know what the figures would be er many of the residence actually had a considerable amount of er capital because they had traded down into these properties
erm i understand that they might trade down but equally there are a number and i can take you to the letters written to the if you like are you saying you didn't realize that many of these people would have to budget carefully budget
i i'd just i'm not agreeing with the situation many i'm not saying there wasn't anybody clearly people were
some
some people were on fixed incomes
right
as i am
well now let's go back to it some people might rely on their savings and some might of been mislead that's correct
as i said earlier i don't believe anybody should of relied purely on the brochure they had legal UNK
oh i understand
does it say anywhere in this brochure do not rely on what is in this brochure but contact your solicitor who will have more information does it say that anywhere
it doesn't say about contacting a solicitor but er each er purchaser had a solicitor appointed and further information was provided to that solicitor
obviously we will come to that
but mr if you know that in the real world ordinary people will often rely on statements in a brochure like this don't you agree that's the object of it
i don't know i certainly wouldn't rely on just a sales brochure if i was making a major trans
no of course you wouldn't i don't suppose mr would but the whole purpose of a brochure like this is not necessary a UNK purpose it's a hook the UNK to use mr UNK word he want to make it so simple to hook the UNK and make him or her say to himself that's where we want to live and set their heart on it that's all the purpose of this brochure in it or is the
yes it is it's part
it's like the television advertisement
it's part of the sales process yes
yeah
yeah well i mean so sure saves UNK of course you didn't you'd be er i'm sure much more er careful but then you're an experience er business man in the flash of youth
mr so glad er generous compliment from my lord
do you want to ask him something
if you were aware that er when you UNK your concern mr did clearly agree with you right
subsequently in that instruction yes
in your or about the break of nineteen eighty seven
er correct
but equally we now know until the daily telegraph published its article on the ninth of january nineteen eighty eight some of these brochures with this representation or claim was still in circulation to the general public you know that
i've heard that evidence given yes
well mr says he discovered that after the telegraph article and to document of the papers that relates to it that supports that did you discover that too
i didn't personally discover that
well if it was your concern that wanted that sentence out was it your concern to see that the brochure was withdrawn
no i'd UNK my concern and i understood the instruction had been given for the brochures or for that particular part of the brochure to be withdrawn and
would it help for my lord and the jury who's business would it be to ensure that it was withdrawn who's business
mr gave the instructions
that doesn't answer my question who's business would it be to ensure that the brochures were withdrawn
ultimately the sales and marketing director
who was at the time
mr
thank you so have we got this right beyond measure in the chain the responsibility in the group of companies you bring to the attention of your board and ultimately to mr the fact of your concern about the centre piece
correct
he gives the instruction the brochure should be withdrawn
correct
and it was mr task to ensure that it's carried out
as i understand it yes
thank you now i go back to the table let's try and er get down to some specific example when would er when was priced UNK on sea when was that begun to develop er mr
er i believe it would have been nineteen eighty five
nineteen eighty five and we can see the picture of it or a drawing of it on page seventy i haven't looked to see how many UNK there is
a hundred and thirty nine
a hundred and thirty nine so oh yes i see it page seventy seven it tells us i think how many a hundred and thirty nine and this is obviously a pretty big development
certainly is yes
is it at the top end of the it starts at the top end of the slope
it would be yes
and again approximately how long would it take er from the UNK of the building to completion er approximately
er in this particular case it was released in phases so
yes
it's probably it may of been up to three years
i understand and you were responsible at all times for the figures which estimated the maintenance order and management services
correct
were there a number of brochures therefore printed sir
i believe the brochure had been updated yes
you believe well what are we looking at here page seventy eight it's been produced by er for are we looking at the first brochure or an updated version or what
i imagine this is the first version
why do you imagine
because it er because these statements still contained within it
oh you mean the statement
correct
well how often did you update the figures for home remembering when started in nineteen eighty five
i don't recall the actual month the scheme opened in nineteen eighty five
no
i believe it was towards the end of the financial year the figures probably would have been updated at er the end of nineteen eighty six
so when would the first figures be given by you for the purpose of printing approximately
probably early in nineteen eighty five
what was before the spring
probably er winter to spring nineteen eighty five
you mean the winter of eighty four five
christmas eighty four
say january eighty five
right in or about january eighty five
yes
i'm not tying you to a specific month but about january nineteen eighty five you would give the figures for the printing of the first brochure
correct
when would the last UNK er be around so to speak in broad terms to look for about
oh because there were so many units it was er a long selling period
approximately what year were talking to
it probably would have sold out in nineteen eighty eight
eighty eight so are you saying the brochure was UNK between nineteen eighty five and nineteen eighty eight by
i imagine the first UNK would have been erm
er it doesn't matter if you know
no i don't know but i imagine the er first UNK would have been september nineteen eighty six
well as the person responsible for giving this information to the public you would you would be anxious to get it as accurate as possible wouldn't you
it would have been updated in september eighty six
can i come back to the question if you see if you don't answer it i'll repeat it you as the person responsible for the figures would be anxious to make sure they were reaching the public accurately
correct
thank you
if you gave these figures in january nineteen eighty five approximately by when would they be out of date and UNK and would require updating approximately when
they would have been updated in september nineteen eighty six
oh they may of been updated then the question i asked you was a different one when was the moment when they became UNK
er i can't say that they became UNK they may well have been entirely accurate for the whole of the period from when they were first produced through to september nineteen eighty six
what for twenty one months
yes because it's only when the scheme actually starts to operate that you can er get a clear picture of what the cost are going to be they are budgets they are estimates and until you start UNK costs you can't be absolutely certain as to how the costs are gonna end up
i see when would you start knowing what the actual costs were when would you start knowing
er towards the end of the first full financial year
give a month for the year please
september eighty six
you're saying until then you won't have no idea if these figures will be accurate or UNK
that would be the most appropriate time to determine that yes
are you saying you wouldn't know whether they were accurate or UNK until twenty one months later
i would say that they were accurate when they were produced and there produced on the basis of accuracy at the time and they would be reviewed after the first financial period
are you saying er i'll put it a third time are you saying or not that you do not know whether the figures that you published are accurate until twenty one months later is that what you're saying
the figures were accurate when they were produced and the figures
how could they be accurate if they are an estimate
well they are an estimate of what we believe the running cost would be
that's a different matter when do you know whether they're accurate twenty one months later
after the first er effectively after the first financial period
twenty one months later
in this case yes
well in your experience after the first financial year did the figures require adjustment
they would require adjust because we're then looking towards the next twelve months
would they require adjustment
they would require adjustment for looking ahead yes
do you as a person responsible for the figures ensure that they were adjusted
they would have been adjusted yes
yes i'll ask you the question again did you as the person responsible for these figures ensure that they were adjusted
i would have requested the adjustments to be made yes
to whom would you make that request
to the er sales and marketing people at
of whom mr is the most senior manager at the time
at the time yes
so speaking from your knowledge you would have made the request in or about september nineteen eighty six that should be updated
correct
and provided it with a
correct
in order that the first brochure be published
yes
was that done
as far as i can recall
what is there in this brochure that tells me whether it's the first edition the second edition or the third edition
in this brochure it doesn't
it doesn't who's responsibility would it be to see that the old brochures were withdrawn and the new brochures were put on in there place
sales marketing mr ultimately
mr with hindsight yeah i think you would accept mr a clearly is a vital thing to preserve the integrity of good name of to make sure if UNK possible these brochures are accurate and updated as possible you'd agree with that
in hindsight i would
yeah and since the daily telegraph article indeed system has changed as you say hasn't it in eighty nine
many systems have changed since then
no this system
this system
about updating these figures
this system amongst others yes
maybe many others systems have changed
indeed
but in terms of what goes in the costs of the management charges in the brochure the systems changed since the telegraph article hasn't it
yes
and the changed is to have those charges automatically updated once a year
correct
so let's go back to home for a moment you say it was updated or should of been updated twenty one months later as the first update
yes
was it updated a second time or did you ask for it to be updated a second time
i can't recall precisely but i imagine yes it would have been up i would have asked for it to be updated at september eighty seven as well
well please don't rely on imagination would it of been part of your duty to ensure it was updated in september nineteen eighty seven
yes
are you in possession that you're aware of any documents where you issue a request for the brochure to be updated in september nineteen eighty six or september nineteen eighty seven is there any document either in your possession or one you would get by another from your request for updating these brochures
if it's not already been disclosed probably not
take it from me that i haven't seen one and if there is one i'd be grateful if somebody on your site would point it out but to my knowledge no such document has been disclosed
would it be done by a document
it would normally if i recall correctly at the time there would normally been a memorandum listing new charges for each development
exactly so it would be a document issued by the by you the with the intention of what mr and in effect update brochure here and in charge
it wouldn't of gone directly to mr no it would have gone to his er regional sales staff
who would you send it to
it would have gone to whichever region the sales manager responsible or the regional managing director
well who would it go to
it would have gone to either the sales manager or the regional managing director of the eastern region of at the time
names please nineteen eighty seven
i can't recall
will you promise to have a look er will
there were a number of changes of er in that position of regional managing director
no but were would the documents be in
i don't know if they haven't been disclosed i they probably have not been retained
can you lay your hands on the second and third addition of the brochures then if there were a second and third edition
i personally don't keep copies of all of the brochures
no it was just a bound to be a cos you see let me explain something to you until you gave evidence today certainly i didn't and maybe others didn't realize in this court room that what were looking at is that one edition of the brochure which may of had several UNK do you understand
yes
and you mr revealed something new i hope you don't there may of been two if not three UNK
of the costs possibly
well you said the brochure had been UNK
why i don't think the whole brochure would have been UNK
page two
i'm talking about the er
page two
the changes to the costs
well is page seventy one which you're will be UNK and it would require a what is it of er page seventy eight
yes
so there are two pages what would have required a UNK seventy one and seventy eight
yes
the first UNK should of occurred twenty one months after the brochure was first printed and the second UNK about twelve months later
i believe that to be true
and the person ultimately responsible ensuring that happened of the system would be mr is it
well ultimately i guess there is a regional managing director for each region who would er be responsible for their region
are you able to help this jury with this simple matter to your knowledge on this development on a hundred and thirty eight or so UNK did you see the second addition of this brochure and the third did you personally ever see it
i don't recall
but this whole case is about management and service charges and you're person who erm assess them for the purposes of the brochure you say you don't recall whether it's the second or third addition ever seen by you
not specifically no
let me ask you something else on a development mr i when i watched use the er help from time to time there are major items of expenditure after the properties built correct
correct yes
let me give you one example there are many of these developments had flat roofs didn't they not all of them but some had flat roofs
a minority yes
a minority they were covered with felt rather than ash felt were they not
in some cases yes
they would require replacing every seven years would they not
seven to ten years would be normal
other major items of expenditure which would require replacement would be lift ropes is that right
correct
corridor carpets
yes
car park tarmac
yes
boundary walls
yes
warden call systems
yes
and alarm systems
yes after different periods of time there not all
quite obviously they don't all there was in nineteen eighty seven before the telegraph article no contingency fund in your budget was there
no
when did the contingency fund first come into the budget
erm
approximately
we approximately the subject we had been looking at for some time so i approximately nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine
oh no it wasn't there at the time of the telegraph article was it
are you talking about this particular scheme
i'm no i'm talking about the principal of putting in a contingency fund in the charges
well as i say i recall it would have been nineteen eighty eight eighty nine i can't recall precisely
after the telegraph article
i believe that to be the case
thank you
you thought it was a good idea didn't you
yes
so it meant that for some time before contingency fund development was introduced you must of had some concerns er about the accuracy of the figures you were putting forward for the publication can i explain that a little more if after a few years a major repair needs to be carried out there was no contingency fund it might mean sticking another two or three hundred pounds a year on the service charges might it not to cover a major repair
in UNK er in practice er it is unlikely that there would be any major repairs at the cost of the residence within the first eight to ten years
well you already agree with me that a flat roof might require replacing in seven
it might in general
might
generally ten years i don't recall any replacing any flat roofs of less than ten years
we needn't argue of seven or ten but let's say eight i don't care but when that fell due it would mean wouldn't it there would be a major charge to the there residence whoever they were
unless don't agree to pick up the cost
ah
which they often did
come on mr don't generally pass on the cost
no that is not correct in many cases went well beyond what they were legally obliged to do
why because it would have been unfair to charge the residence
it depended on what the particular er problem was at the time if something failed after four or five years it was then covered by insurance by the n h b c or by guarantees
i see let take it from the other end why did you have to take the UNK of the contingency fund of the estimates
because i believe we should be planning for long term er to repair the
exactly but why wait until nineteen eighty eight to discover that how long had you been doing these estimates for how many years have you been doing
on a limited number of schemes we have been doing the estimates for four or five years
no not we you i'm asking mr you have been doing estimates for four or five years have you
yes
by nineteen eighty eight
yes
so you that was you started doing them in about nineteen eighty three
yes
and approximately how many sites would you have given estimates for between eighty three and eighty eight approximate number
er well that was changing all the time but we had erm like
but is it twenty thirty forty i just don't know
oh it would be been er probably eighty schemes
eighty obviously i'm not tying you to a figure we just want to get some idea so seventy eighty or ninety as maybe about eighty schemes over five years you've given estimates for
yes
which didn't contain a contingency fund element
no
correct
the main er the usual recurring cost was er UNK cost which we had introduced a fund for on the outset
sorry can we get to the question again want to see if i've got it right correct me if i'm wrong over the eighty schemes and the five years that you had put forward budgets for all you hadn't included a contingency fund element
that's correct
that's correct and it was your suggestion that a contingency fund should be introduced after the telegraph part
in nineteen eighty nineteen eighty nine yes
yes did that require the approval of mr or not
again that would have been a matter raised at our board and passed on
could you please answer the question would your suggestion require the approval of mr
ultimately yes
did he approve it
yes
readily or not
yes i don't recall any argument
right mr did it require his approval as the as it were officer in charge of brochures
no
it didn't require approval
no
and with hindsight although don't think i'm being over critical although you put forward eighty or so estimates for different schemes with hindsight it's clearly more prudent and UNK and accurate more accurate to have a contingency fund isn't it in the in the budgetary cost
as a management principal one should include a contingency fund
yes
as earlier as is reasonably to do so
what it didn't need eighty schemes did it to be launched before you introduced it it's something you'd been wanting to do wasn't it
something we considered that er
no something you had been wanting to do not we you had been wanting to
yes i wanted to introduce a contingency fund
yes had you met opposition to the introduction of that contingency fund
no
well why wasn't it been done earlier
because i didn't
i didn't raise it earlier
i see
you spoke to mr er the journalist concerned didn't you
correct
did you ever raise with him back in january nineteen eighty eight something that you and mr had both raised before namely that what goes into the brochure is not to be relied on you've got to look at the solicitors correspondence to interpret what is in the brochure did you did you ever raise that with mr the solicitor's correspondence
i don't recall that being a subject of my conversation er
is the answer no you didn't raise it with mr
er we were given very little opportunity to raise anything with mr
is the answer you did not raise it with mr
only because there was no opportunity
huh er just please help us you know we get on much better of course you can give an explanation all mr wants you requested is said whether you did raise it of course you could say we didn't i didn't because erm of so and so because there wasn't an opportunity or whatever but do tell us whether yes or no whether you raised it surely that's possible mr isn't it isn't it am i trying to assist you during my people are just not answering the questions put it again in UNK form mr would you please
well the questions a very simple one back in january nineteen eighty eight on any occasion you spoke to mr either before or after the first article did you ever raise this question with the solicitors letter
no
thank you
we give it if you say why
will you turn to page find one thirty four what we're looking at is the accounts for UNK on sea the year ending thirty first of august nineteen ninety two last year
correct
look please at item four on page one three four second paragraph the contingency fund is designed to provide funds in order to pay for major repairs or UNK which may arise in the future these accounts do not include the contingency fund despite strong recommendations from can you explain please mr
yes the residence association at er did not agree to the introduction of a contingency fund
i see so you weren't able to have a contingency fund at
there is one there now but we weren't able at the time no
at the time had you been strongly recommending it since eighty eight
we eighty to eighty nine as i
yeah
say can't recall we would have been recommending contingency fund
you would
yes
yes i understand mr very much
you erm stay with t one three four please just so that we er understand the point you're making and i would ask you if you'd be so kind as to keep your voice well up
these are the er accounts that mr put to you are they audited accounts
yes they are
are they provided for the residence at
each residence gets a copy
we can see at the bottom of one three four bearing in mind that these are the august nineteen ninety two accounts we see at the top of one three four that there have in fact been an adjustment there for the previous year to august nineteen ninety one so that there was in fact an amount of surplus created to the residence of a hundred and eight pounds eighty p is that right
that's correct
so that the budgeted estimate for the previous year had been too high and there is an adjustment in favour of the residence for the following year
that's correct
when you've got a budget for an UNK year assuming you and i are here together in november ninety three and we're preparing a budget up till november ninety four can you ever have precise figures which will be accurate to the last pound
no simply because it is an estimate
so that's your budget estimate when we get to november nineteen ninety four you and i together we will then find out what has happened in practice
correct
in this particular twelve month period your budget estimate would be wrong in that you needed to pay the residence back a hundred and eight pounds
that's correct
well then let's stick with contingency fund shall we you've told us that you wish to have a contingency fund among others at
that's correct
a contingency fund will be a fund available for any particular UNK in the future
UNK or knowing expenditure what is UNK is when the expenditure is going to occur
exactly but who has to pay in to the contingency fund if it's agreed by the residence
the residence have to pay
so their charges would go up if you had to have a contingency fund
correct
does that go up as part of the management charge or part of the service charge which is not related to management
it would go up as part of the service charge the management charge would not change as a result
exactly
are you leaving the accounts mr
er my lord i was going to
can i just ask him one question about it erm i'm not an accountant and you probably i'm sure you know a lot more about accounts than i do but in fact if you look at the revenue accounts for the year we're talking about ended august nineteen ninety two at page a hundred and thirty two do you see that
yes i do
you see there are two columns the second column is budget that right
yes
and the first column although it's not headed is presumably actual expenditure would that be right
er yes
good and if you UNK over the details if you look at the bottom er you'll see er account total costs a hundred thousand sixty hundred and forty four pounds budget ninety six eight seven four so that er there in fact it looks as though the actual costs were something erm nearly four thousand pound er more than the budget do you see
yes
er if you just to avoid doubt it looks as though as we presume we go back to one three four that's less than the income was the revenue from things like the guest room and er the lounge and so on you see
that's correct
so there you get on the accounts you get a er apparently income er extension of the scheme budget by nearly four thousand pounds three eight then you go back with what lord was asking you about and i just want you to explain it if you can if you can't tell me as he drew your attention to surplus per audited account at august ninety nineteen one a hundred and eight eighty so that in fact the year ending nineteen ninety two along these accounts we're dealing with in fact the expenditure of exceeded budget by nearly four thousand the previous year er in nineteen ninety one er it had gone the other way that er
that's is
is that how i understand how it worked
entirely right
so you're talking about the little note at the bottom of nine of page one three four is not dealing with accounts er that relate to nineteen ninety two which the rest of the three pages are but dealing with the previous year is that right
it's for the previous years accounts yeah
yes it is
can we just erm clarify that mr of course it's dealing with the previous years accounts but until you get to the end of the previous year are you going to know whether you've over or under UNK estimated on budget
no it's the same situation until you've complete the financial year and you audit the accounts you don't know precisely what the situation is
so if at the bottom of page one three four there is the benefit to the residence of a hundred and eight pounds when does that come into consideration in the year ending august nineteen ninety one or the year ending august nineteen ninety two
they would normally of er received that during the year ending august nineteen ninety two
thank you
we also see on page one three four and this is something you also mentioned mr that if you've got certain costs they will be covered and you gave a number of examples one of them you said er we were covered by insurance
yes
now we can see that at one three four about a third of the page down can't we
yes
now who actually insured the premises that the residence live in
we insurance the premises on behalf of the residence
you insurance them centrally as it were and each resident has to pay part of the insurance cost
through the service charge yes
thank you is that through the service charge or through the management charge
through the service charge
thank you and we see here that erm one thousand eight hundred and fifty six pounds had been claimed that one thousand eight hundred and fifty six pounds thirteen had been received so the insurance cover had paid
correct
you mentioned another protection which is the n h b c that's national house building council guarantee how long does that run for when a scheme from the UNK of a scheme
ten years
now at the end of the day whatever your own views about a contingency fund are bearing in mind that it's service not management charged if the residence don't agree can you simply dictate to them that they've got to have a contingency fund
er i'd believe in theory we could because the lease provides us or gives us the opportunity to do so but we would not go against the wishes of the residence
thank you
now on the management charge which is what i want to ask you about cos that's what you've said in the brochure on the management charge did you deliberately set the management charge too low to hook the UNK
absolutely not
shall we just look at one or two erm documents that you've already looked at please would you go to page twenty nine just the illustration that seen and this is the i'm not sure whether a point is going to be made about this or not but if you look at page thirty one there there's a golf club on the left and a man fishing on the right
this is a golf club
beg your pardon
it's a golf club
er i'm sorry we haven't had any evidence of that yet
i thought it was suggested that
yes but he said he never it was suggested but
oh i'm sorry i asked
mr has great powers but he can't give evidence on this case
not on this occasion
no
let's assume that mr is right in the suggestion he put to you about the building on the left that it's a golf course and we can see for ourselves without any evidence there's a man fishing on the lake at the bottom there were you trying to suggest that as part of the deal at a lake would be provided or a golf club
no of course not
well what's the point of the lake that's what's been worrying me i was going to ask mr what is the UNK supposed to see
what do people do when they retire among other things by way of UNK
they play golf and go fishing
thank you and if you walked around to look at the flat would you find a lake and UNK big golf course in the middle of it
no
now let's erm just go on to something perhaps that's more to the point you were asked on a number occasions er what information was given and so for and when er can you see in fact on some of these documents that the brochures are indeed dated just look at er please you can see that it's a printed brochure it's got a number of er additions and then we look at page thirty seven UNK state you have that as twenty sixth march eighty five don't you
correct
are you be able to tell us would that page at twenty six m eighty five be part of the original brochure or part of something which erm was later brought out looking at the type and the print in the brochure if you can't help us just say
i couldn't be sure on that point
look at erm page forty would you please this is at if you look at page forty one there you've got people playing bowls at the top there maybe another retirement activity and at the bottom of the page forty two it's dated nine eighty five
correct
so that indicates print date of september eighty five
yes
now unfortunately at page forty two there's a UNK originally that says forty two but just let's look at that shall we cos you were asked about what was said to people and what they might know or understand while these particulars are prepared with all due care and the word that's been stuck over is convenience while these particulars are prepared with all due care for the convenience of intended purchases the information contained UNK is intended as a preliminary guide only
correct
did you know that was in the brochure that it was a preliminary guide only
yes
and do we find that in fact on the other brochures for instance at page fifty two i don't want to go through them all i'm only giving an example or two page fifty two there you see a UNK unfortunately er UNK in part same words bottom of fifty two while these particulars are prepared with all due care for the convenience of the intend UNK the information contained UNK is intended as a preliminary guide only
correct
now if someone therefore becomes interested in one of the developments would they be any doubt buying the houses without having a solicitors assistance
that would be most unusual
and even if they did buy without a solicitors assistance what was the system about sending them the letter which we've looked at earlier which is at erm d one five two remember this is the letter that goes to mr solicitors assuming you get a very rare person who does his or her own UNK
it would
does that letter still go them
it would have gone to them and rather to their solicitor yes
one of the things at the bottom of one five two is the n h b c agreement that you mentioned with mr
yes
so let's just look again at one five three please you see you were asked about whether or not the brochure would be updated and when it might be updated in what particulars circumstances do you remember mr
yes i do
shall we just look at er item four on one five three because this is er sent out on the seventeenth of june eighty five right see that at page one five two and it says at four the service charge the estimated service charge for these flats for the year ending thirty one august eighty five is and then the flats are set out there three hundred and eighty two five seven five and seven six four that's all in respect of because we know this was an flat we can see that from page one five two but when whether or not the brochure is updated when that letter goes out to their solicitors have you seen other similar letters of this sort going out
yes it's pretty well a standard letter that goes out
and if you're for instance dealing with a purchaser who's interested in buying around about december what was the system that you had about saying what the service charges might be
i mean do you relate to the brochure necessarily or does the
no
letter relate does the letter relate to the time of purchase
well the letter would relate to the time of purchase
thank you and it said there in UNK page one five three again calculated from the date of legal completion to the end of the then current half year will be collected on completion please note that these are estimated only and will be UNK adjusted when audited accounts are available now we've seen the reflection of that in practice this morning haven't we
correct
on the accounts for
yes
you were asked whether you told mr about the solicitors letter
yes
did he ever ask you about what information was given to solicitors
no
would there of been any problem at all in your providing it
none what so ever
would you have been willing to provide it
yes
how long was your conversation with mr
approximately ten to fifteen minutes
had you had any opportunity to prepare yourself for the sort of questions he might be asking
no none
when you offered a meeting which does not seemed to be in dispute either you're travelling to london or making yourselves available in UNK were you offering a ten minute conversation or were you anticipating that you would be able to deal with any questions he might have
we were anticipating being able to explain in detail the entire procedure relating to accounting
when you say the entire procedure would that of included or not a solicitors letter which is set out
yes it would have done
did he show any interest at all in having those details provided for him
he did not agree to a meeting
did he give you a reason why not did he say why
because he had a deadline to meet
did he ever explain to you what the urgency of having to have the article in on the following saturday was did he ev did he ever tell you anything
er no not he didn't explain the urgency
you spoke about what was said in the brochure that management charges had been or would be running at about a rate of inflation we can see it on page fifty six it's better if you look at it i think rather than i UNK phrase see fifty six if you so kind now see fifty six is talking about at UNK will the management charges greatly increase the answer is no management service er sorry has appointed u k leading management specialist for several reasons firstly because of their professional caring attitude secondly because time has shown that management charges rises the rate either slightly below or at the UNK inflation when that brochure was produced in respect of that development was that statement true or was it not
it was true
you were asked a few questions about the contingency fund was setting up the contingency fund had it got any connection at all with the daily telegraph article
none what so ever
the daily telegraph article comes out in january eighty eight was the updating or the answering of the brochures UNK anything to do with the daily telegraph article
it was not
had the updating gone on at all before the daily telegraph article came out which is in nineteen eighty eight
yes
did mr ask you any of the questions about updating or the historical pattern that had been shown by management charges
no
was there any discussion about the difference between the service charges and the management charge
not at that time i recall
when you're dealing with people who may want to buy retirement homes er how do you describe them they've been described by mr as the UNK you see UNK you what do you call them
UNK or prospective UNK at the time
is that the way that treated people calling it UNK the UNK
not at all they were customers
have you ever heard the word or the phrase UNK the UNK either at or
never
if somebody comes as a resident to one of the developments that you now presently run are they there normally for years or for months
they're normally there for years
if they're normally there for years is there any purpose at all in trying to UNK them before they go and live there
there wouldn't seem to be any purpose it wouldn't be right
my lord how that under my cross examination i don't know i've never suggested that he was trying to UNK any resident
no i there's get a little confusion coming into this case i think i'm not blaming anybody as i understand your case mr as put to er as put to mr you have UNK any suggestion to this witness that there was any deliberate attempt to UNK any prospective purchaser
that is correct
what you your case is as i understand it i've only intervened cos i think the question didn't dis perhaps a lack of understanding this by lord allow me to say so what you're saying is that erm in fact although not UNK you're prepared to accept the format of the brochure in relation to the on going charges was such as could reasonably be said by your newspaper to have mislead prospective UNK
that is so
that is the point of the case
and
now the UNK of doubt when you've got to another aspect of the case quite different namely the claim for special damages you were suggesting to mr that there was a deliberate attempt to and after all whereas you might not like my er use of the to swing on to the daily telegraph
yes
er the costs which would have been paid in any event that's all the case is
your lord your lordship's got it absolutely right
i understand that my lord i
yes but you were forgive me lord you were asking him about deliberate er UNK or there wouldn't be any point in deliberately get the exact word misleading the prospective purchaser
of course because that's the way that the plaintiff's claim has and that's why
oh yes i understand it
and that's why it's a sorry that's why it's a relevant and b important
right well i'm not worried about the point as to whether it arise out of cross examination i seldom am because there is always erm can be an opportunity for further cross examination if the other party wants to so er on the grounds of the objection i don't UNK it you can ask that if you like but er i do want the jury always to keep their eye on that what really is the issue in the case er certainly from the defendants point of view i know what you say
but erm the issue from the plaintiffs point of view of course is erm just
well you say the article meant that your clients were being accused of deliberate UNK
certainly
and in the end the jury will have to say which of the two versions of the meaning they except
and thereafter decide whether or not the meaning is made out
correct good now so ask your do ask your question
my lord i've asked it and the witness has answered in fact
oh good huh i assumed the answer was no
it was
i was listening to mr yes thank you
yes thank you mr would you step down please
thank you
er one that occurs to me no speaking on it myself the jury might be interested sometime i just like to get a feel of what a brochure looks like not divided as it obviously has to be here could we see a couple sometime not now
yes
and then the jury i can pass them to the jury now then sorry
no my lord i have three applications to make in the light of the evidence given by mr yesterday and this witness today er the first is this in terms of this witnesses evidence i don't know whether your lordship appreciated it but i certainly did in terms of evidence that in cases of some brochures there were a number of UNK in other words first second and maybe third edition
well certainly i believe mr he i don't think he went into the same detail as mr i but mr certainly left me the impression that some at least of the brochures were went into more than one addition yes
er my lord there has not been disclosed by the plaintiffs anything more than one copy of the brochure for each site we've got in the my lord might i therefore formally call for UNK of each addition of the brochures that the jury have them
well erm you can't no doubt do that at this moment but i think it's as mr undoubtedly said quite apart from anything mr said er if there are a several addition er which UNK with the relation to the er important part from our point of view or an important part mainly these residence on going charges that sounds reasonable
good er i think that's right in fact erm a large number of brochures were in fact on our list of documents
yes
erm disclosed erm there are dates on some of them as i established
yes
in evidence
well could that be further looked into
oh certainly
and any
any copies of that
any suggestion because i think the jury would be interested particularly with the dates on them but even if there aren't compare the figures in different UNK
certainly and my lord my problem is i'd liked to see them before i cross examine mr the er the next witness cos he was the officer in charge of brochures er i don't know whether the defendants can get the plaintiffs can get them before but er i mention it now the second application my lord er your lordship UNK that mr evidence is at a meeting of he brought up his concerns about the accuracy of the inflation sentence in the brochure and a board meeting in no board meeting to that effect has been disclosed
no minutes you mean
no minute and i call for and ask your lordship to order the production of any board minute meeting recording that concern of mr
yeah
and more for completion the third application is this yesterday mr referred in his evidence
not yesterday
i beg your pardon the last time before
yes the day before yesterday
the day before er mr referred to in his evidence you may remember to a company called
mm
the employer and i asked him what documents they produced what report they produced we have written a letter about it but i formally call for any report or document from and the second thing he mentioned were letters from about twelve members of parliament that they received
well i think he did say those ought to be in their file
my lord
he said that they should be
but i call
yeah
for production of those letters from the twelve members of parliament
lord you can't deal with that er at the snap of the fingers obviously but i think you'd agree that er going from the number three upwards that if there is any reports from management er and if the letters from the members of parliament still exist in your clients file they would be UNK
well my lord i simply don't know erm
er no if they don't exist so be it
i simply i simply can't deal with the question because some of these are raised now for the first time
no i'm not i'm sorry i said some of them are raised now for the first time i was about to say i'm not complaining i'm simply pointing out standing here without the instructions i can't deal with the matter
no of course you can't now but will you have enquiries made and if er there are an existence of twelve members of parliament UNK any report from crisis management and any erm any er minute of a board meeting er at er directors at which the contingency er at the contingency fund was discussed or UNK any recording of value having enquiries make sure that they exist and then tell me er if you're prepared to UNK them
my lord sir
that's all
yes
i don't expect you to do it before monday anyway
no my lord of course i do
yes i didn't think you'd make any objection at all cos
no i'm not
i'm not suggesting for a moment it doesn't cross my mind nor has mr suggested that there has been any er deliberate failures to UNK something which was thought was which you've got and was thought relevant but it things do turn out to be potentially relevant in the course of the court appearance
well i i'm happy to have those enquiries there
thank you well you know the three categories now what about erm er i'm very anxious to proceed today as far as we can what about mr er remind me erm reading with two and three er i'm afraid i've forgotten exactly what you oh i know you wanted to know mr er before cross examine mr you want to know about all the additions of the various brochures is that right
my lord the officer is he's the wonderful from who is closest to the brochures and therefore
mm
responsible for er i never realized until the witness gave evidence the last witness that there were different additions
oh well i think it did it did emerge but not so clearly but it did emerge in mr evidence
my lord be that as it may if there are one two or three additions of the same brochures of the same development clearly we should be entitled to
oh
all that's been disclosed is one as far as i know erm your lordship can see that i at some stage need to have a look at them er before i complete in any way so i can cross examine mr er my lord may i just say this on the seventeenth of november that's two days ago we asked for the documents of the necessary twelve m p's two days ago
yes but er
i'm not complaining about it but i say i didn't raise it for the first time
no well some of them might have been don't do UNK about that
no my lord i have raised for the first time the board minute
yes
er my lord it wasn't i wasn't raising it for the purpose of your lordship mentioned er namely er about er contingency fund though indeed will be entitled to that i raised a question of the minute the board minute to do with the concerned with mr rest of the meeting about the placement
mm
that's why i was asking them for i just want to make it plain my lord
thank you
but my lord that subject to that er i don't think we'll loose time because i'm sure by the time lord has examined er mr i'm going to reserve a little bit of cross examination which is monday
mm in any event members of the jury i forgot to mention to you earlier er thank you mr you probably feel a wisdom of this having done several days of this case two and a half hours is just about as long as anybody can be expected to sit and listen to evidence and er what i was going to do and i hope it doesn't inconvenience anybody i was going instead of going on for three hours till one o'clock i was gonna break off about half past twelve to about half past one to break up the day as you know i hope that's alright so what we'll do we'll go on now and i'm sure i think it's doubtful if you would have got to that point by half past twelve and then you and lord sort it out and your learned duties as much as you can in the UNK and then tell me afterwards what the brochure position is i'm sure you've no objection to UNK any brochures that you've got that erm or can get er which relate to that point
a lot of brochures have been disclosed
yes
difference that for instance erm there were four house brochures
there you are
they've been disclosed it's eight nine and ten
they may they may have been in your list of documents but copies of them may or may not of been handed over but
simply don't know
well could you try and sort that out
of course
when we have a break preferably midday alright so i don't want to ask you to alter your chosen order of witnesses you see er but equally we want to get on if we can
oh entirely
i know i must see you think or mr can go on right let's have mr
mr
and get as far as we can and break off about half past twelve for an hour
could you hold the book in your right hand
just a minute no please just while those people just the wrong moment to leave court they should never yes try again
hold the book in your right hand and repeat the UNK after the i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth
shall be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
thank you
mr
take a seat
would you keep your voice up also please
certainly
towards the jury thank you
what's your full name and your address please
kevin erm
is that in UNK
that is yes
how old are you now
forty three
what's your present occupation
i'm a self employed marketing consultant
just a little about your background please i think you went to dundee UNK
yes
did you er obtain a diploma in marketing in nineteen seventy five there
not there it was at er another college
which was
thank you i think you're a fellow at the institute of marketing
that's correct
and er you have on occasions at various times UNK on marketing at various UNK of education including UNK university
that is correct i am currently doing that as well
thank you
when did you first become connected with any organization in the group
nineteen eighty four
which company did you go and work for
in nineteen eighty four there was only the one company they hadn't UNK so i joined er company in nineteen eighty four
what as
er a group marketing manager
did you stay in that position or do you erm change
in nineteen eighty six i think it was the company UNK and i was promoted to sales and marketing director of the erm i think it was the developments division which was the retirement housing division
so that's
that's correct
in er nineteen ninety one did you become marketing sales director for the whole group and a main board director
that is correct
now in nineteen eighty seven what did your job involve
well as a divisional sales and marketing director i had two particular jobs one would be erm in developing if you want the alteration of sales and marketing and the other one would be looking at overall strategic in sales and marketing
did you have people working under you
i had at that time and i'm trying to recall probably two or three people working directly for me yes
mr told us about regional offices about how many of those were there in nineteen eighty seven
i think at that time there were seven regional offices
would they also fall under your general control
no not directly each regional office would have a regional m d managing director who would actually be on the board the divisional board with me each regional m d would then have his own regional board on which there would be er finance er finance director sales and marketing director construction director land director not all of them all seven had that board immediately some developed that board grew that board over a couple of years
apart from being marketing director for developments er did you also deal with marketing of other aspects of the group
well not directly erm because the whole purpose of the UNK was to put the skill and expertise into each division at the initial stage of erm UNK there were no other marketing people immediately in those other divisions i was occasionally called on to assist but progressively as they built up there own marketing expertise then my needs were less they needed me less
in nineteen eighty seven were you familiar with the advertising budget and the advertising spend of and
yeah
prior to the daily telegraph article in january nineteen eighty eight had or had they been in the habit of spending large amounts of money on national publicity
most definitely not
mr er i think i saw a smile there why were you smiling
because part of the reason why were very successful and profitable was because they're very UNK on money we spend and on the resources erm they had been advertising but it was on a very small limited regional budget national advertising is actually they'd of been a or too
what was mr attitude to spending on national advertising in so far as you could work it out
we didn't think it was necessary and not necessary at that time we were success advertising UNK
er were you familiar with the brochures that were distributed
yes
who's responsibility was the contents of the brochures
well there was two parts to the brochure erm the there was the general part within the brochure about eighty percent of the brochure was general for every development the other twenty percent which would prefer specifically to that development so there was a corporate field to the brochure but for each development it would have it's individual flavour that would show pictures of the locality for example hence the golf and the erm lake and the erm specific costs of running that responsibility would be the responsibility then of the region putting in cos obviously at the centre i wouldn't know whether there was a golf course in that area or not
er could you have erm the agreed in front of you please and just look at c thirty that's erm you can see the golf club in this one at er the page thirty one and the man sitting on the lake at the top of thirty one yes i think we know the brochures we've got erm leisure UNK like bowls that sort of thing
who would actually draw up the wording of the brochure
the wording referring to the specific location in the location description would by definition have to be drawn up the region cos they would have UNK knowledge of the locality that er sorry and the costs would be drawn up by the region because they would know as i say UNK they would know that specific development
would you er still look at page thirty one please dealing with er top right under the are there hidden costs the answer to this is definitely no and then there are charges set out there there's the UNK security set up there and then the only other costs would be your apartment local authority rates individual electricity costs even if this means too low there's a UNK security set up there and then the only other costs would be your apartment local authority rates individual electricity costs even if this means too low small charge for using guest bedroom use to keep the general running costs as low as possible and then underneath them there's a block service apartment costs all maintenance warden and management services UNK security and then personal costs in an estimated weekly total er did you know that went into the brochure
yes
could you look also please at page fifty six in the same tag which is home which was forty nine it carries on to fifty six we can see there you've got the same thing but you've got a drawing there and not a photograph of something that's in the area court castle in UNK
i see
will the management charges greatly increase page fifty six the answer is no and then we've read this several times did you know that was in the brochure
that photograph yes
one of the things said there is time has shown the management charges rise at a rate either slightly below or at the level of inflation a fine record not easily beaten what do you say about whether or not that was accurate in nineteen eighty five for instance
it wouldn't of been put in if it hadn't been accurate at the time
now UNK again please if you would to the one we first looked at which is er see the costs set out on page thirty one there and we can see under personal costs with the star that refers please note that these charges are an average and depend on personal electricity consumption and are subject to UNK and local authority assessment er did you understand the difference between the management charge and the service charge
yes
can you ever control the service charge component to make it level with inflation as opposed to the management charges
no i would have said no
thank you
did you yourself come to know about the article in the telegraph
yes
prior to that article january eighty eight was it being your personal desire for about whether or not in the year nineteen eighty seven going into the nineteen eighty eight or to have national or wider advertising your personal view
my personal view was that we should have some form of two things one is communicating the UNK of the situation it's a fairly new market there was a lot of competitors in the market coming into the market there was a lot of confusion in the market there was a lot of confusion in the market as to exactly what it was that customer could buy there was also a lot of confusion of as to cos there are different types of customer and over sixty five there are about seven different categories there was a need for someone and i believe it should therefore have been the market leader at that time to if you want to establish UNK establish what they this was in the market and establish what the elderly would be would should look for when purchasing a retirement apartment
and what was your desire in nineteen eighty seven before the telegraph article about increasing on spending advertising keeping it the same or decreasing
well i wanted therefore to put take project into the national press and to promote the product given that was the larger product in the market place and therefore if you want that would set the standards for the rest of the market place that's what i felt we needed to do that with the increasing number of competitors moving into market place
but in nineteen eighty seven that expansion of advertising and therefore ad advertising costs in what were you thinking of in terms of roughly in nineteen eighty seven
oh i can't i can't remember sorry
are we talking about tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or what
if it was the national advertising campaign and knowing and er basically then i wouldn't of thought i'd be talking anything above a hundred thousand i would and i can't remember the exact figure but given
no i understand
the situation i wouldn't of thought i could of got away with anything much more than that
did you propose in nineteen eighty seven as an increase advertising spend
in specific terms i can't remember i would have certainly of said that for the year er nineteen eighty eight we should build into our budget an amount what that amount was i can't remember but er that was that was never given the go ahead
how was it dealt with internally
i mean you have the idea you want to expand advertising which means you've got to spend more money and you said it was never given the go ahead who at the end of the day would decide about whether it had the go ahead or not
well the board would
which board
er first of all i would put it to my divisional board to my colleagues to ask for their thoughts and their advice erm if they rejected it then it wouldn't go any further if they approved it then it because it was a budgetary item rather than just we can go out and spend it tomorrow it was going into the following years budget it would then go to the p l c board and they would have final say in whether that element should go into the into next years budget
and who is chairman of the board who had the final say
john
so that was not given the go ahead in nineteen eighty seven
that's correct
i therefore need to ask you about the article and what happened subsequently
now you saw the article
yes
it came out on a saturday do you remember where you saw it
yes i was on a coach to the boat show erm at UNK court when i read it
was it on the day of publication
i think it must of been it had to be on a saturday i believe
yes
yes that would have been the day of publication
now we already know that there was a meeting which was called fairly promptly for the monday of the following week which would have been the eleventh did you attend that meeting
yes
mr has told us there were well over twenty people there was the article discussed then
that was the purpose of the meeting
did you yourself have to do anything follow the art following the article
following the article or following the meeting that meeting
you're quite right following that meeting which was after the article
i'm not sure there were too many decisions actually made at that meeting
why was that
because at that meeting you can imagine that twenty people gathering then you end up not really making any decisions far too many people there was a lot discussed and UNK and it concerns expressed and it was a case and i'm going from recollection here it was really a case of let's go away and think about it and calm down and look at it UNK
er we've already seen a press release which was put out as prompt step what was your own view about what should be done after the daily telegraph article and it's comments about
well i think that the sending out of the press release immediately was quite correct because obviously people had ride that sorry people may have read that and something therefore had to be said my personal view was that really this article is you had if you like had UNK everything that we had been trying to do erm and put us in a bad light and it maybe my scottish background but i don't like people calling in to question my motives and the companies motives erm and i felt that it went straight to what we were really standing for given what i explained about my thoughts in nineteen eighty seven it was hitting straight to the core of the whole proposition and everything that stood for erm and that is what was the great concern and because it wasn't just like a mild slap in the face it was more like a knife in the UNK it was therefore required a lot more thinking about as to the reaction that we would then have to come up with
did you yourself give thought to the action that you thought would be required
yes
what conclusion did you come to
oh i came to several conclusions erm one of the problems that the article faced me with if it had been a simple UNK if the daily telegraph had simply taken an advert out as opposed to maybe UNK then i may of had less a problem because the problem with UNK is that they are believed companies adverts aren't believed well they're partially believed but an UNK carries a lot more weight and therefore when it's written like that it tends to strike home much harder therefore that my immediate thoughts were that if were going to react if we were going to find a way of UNK the problems we felt this had created then we would not have to follow any normal course of action we simply couldn't put an advert out because nobody would have believed it we would have to look at it a different way of actually UNK and that's part of the reason for the time taking to think it through
would you please go to tag l two six to begin with just to lead you into the UNK you have told us that in august nineteen eighty seven er there was really no interest in national budgeting er national advertising budget we can see this is a memorandum from you kevin dated the fourth of august and you're sending out to the regional marketing executives there's no national advertising next year which would be eighty eight
again marketing budget at two six seven the point made there again numbered item one in the bottom third no national advertising and then two sixty eight this is a meeting of the twenty fifth of february nineteen eighty eight present including mr and yourself today i send that's mr pointed out that so far our reaction to the recent media criticism had been totally defensive in future these actions to be UNK but then attacked in order to regain our credibility were you indeed present at that meeting of the twenty fifth of erm february
yes
in february had your own thoughts begun to UNK about what needed to be done in response to the article
yes
what had your thoughts sir UNK as
well my thoughts had UNK that we would have to change the direction of er we communicating with them as we've done in the past we couldn't just use adverts that we might have used regional in a regional press we had to pick out the point in the in the actual article so that four example there were six or seven points that had clearly been made statements that had been made i had to devise a scheme then er it was only a scheme in my thinking that actually i had to devise a scheme that would pick up each of these points encounter them now there was no way i could simply take an advert out and say they said this we say that because that would have had no credibility so what i was thinking at that time is how we might be able to use some other form of being able to counter those six or seven points and i started to come up with an idea perhaps using a third party because in our business third party recommendation are very powerful and when selling to the elderly because they do not take i'm sorry they take a long time to come to a decision they UNK over it and such like they take a lot of influence from people take advise from family accountants solicitors bank managers and such like so the idea of having a third party in a sense recommend then would have allowed us to get over those particular points so that's what was UNK in my mind at the time
and is that the thinking that lies behind the UNK getting of terry UNK and angela UNK
that is correct
that's in an interview format isn't it in the
yes
advertisement and do they actually sit down in an interview or is that simply the way that the advertisement is projected
well what in actual fact happened it's not easy to get terry UNK at a moments notice to come and sit down what in actual fact happens is that we draw up exactly what it is that he would be saying and what the answer will be he sees that and it's totally approved UNK he's not gonna put his name to anything that he doesn't believe is correct and that is how it's done and
i understood though i mean it looks from many of these er publications as though it's meant to convey that mr and mr UNK are sitting down and having a conversation or UNK isn't it that's how it's presented is that right
yes
but it didn't but that isn't actually that isn't what happened you're saying now
it's meant to show that terry UNK is asking john a question and john is answering the question
sorry i don't want to take erm of course out of hand
god but no for ease of er management what we'll do is we'll stick to the teams on the tables where you are now
erm working in what one team of four and two teams of three
can i ask you though to devise a name that you as a team would wish to be known by and then i can start er on the UNK
so
march
right have you got a name
the losers
the losers
i should ban that as er totally unacceptable
UNK because
no i mean the experts
with you were you all watching the experts yes
they are UNK i don't
did you miss it last night then
last night
so is it UNK or experts
sorry
UNK it's UNK
it's to say anything else
young males march
and the third team
wall street
wall street alright
good
now all good teams all good UNK have erm rules
and phrases
come on this is abbey life come on
erm all UNK have rules there's basically just one rule that anything i say or do is right but and that's the rules
yes it seems reasonable
UNK silence
you're the UNK
that explains it a bit more then
what's the difference between you
i'll ask you a question if you get it right without any help from your team or anybody else you're going to get three points for your team
if you need a little bit of UNK by the people working with you er then there's a possible two points for the team
if you then pick up a bonus because the team couldn't answer it maybe er you will get a bonus for your team
however i am not fair because the world isn't fair
so if for any reason i feel like adding on some points i will do and equally i'll decide to take some points off if i feel like it
so as i say we go back to rule one everything i do is right
yes
o k any questions
excellent
looking at me totally confused that's the best way to start
right david we'll start with you then
we're talking covermaster here what's the purpose of the covermaster plan
description of it or purpose of it
the purpose
the purpose
er protection
protection there you are
nothing difficult
right john can you define the covermaster plan for me
flexible whole of life assure
almost anything to add to that
flexible whole of life assurance anything else
er la
a little bit of help from your friend
unit linked
unit linked
oh yes right
yes o k so just the two for UNK
er gerald here am i mrs joe public and you've got to explain to me unit linking
hm mm er basically er what actually happens is with your premiums each month it buys x amount of units
right
er those units are used to purchase x amount of life cover depending on how much you w er assurance you want in your claim how much is to go towards savings how much to go towards whatever you want in your plan
the price of the units are actually allocated erm to each of those in individual areas
erm sort of
sort of let's think er tell me more about the units themselves
well the units themselves are actually erm bought each month
right
and they're actually bought in erm at the offer price
right
and what you have to what actually happens you have what is known as an offer price and a bid price
right
the offer price is when you buy into the plan and bid price is when you actually erm sell
o k excellent
i think i'll erm i'll give you three marks for it but i'll give you the opportunity for three bonus marks now because here am i mrs public and i didn't understand a word of that
i want to know what unit linking will do for me
will i actually be buying a unit linking life assurance plan and not a with profits life assurance plan
so what's the benefits for me in the unit linking
the benefits for you in unit linking is actually it's going to relate to like the cost of inflation
yes good
erm a no not really they're qualifying times erm
o k you pick up a bonus for that anybody else on the team come up with something positive about unit linking that'll make me say yes i like this one
you er ma it balances out the er benefits from like the whole of the term and it's not necessarily like a with profits system you get a lot of bonuses at the very end
right actually that's very true that's a v that's a very good point
yes certainly i'll give you a point for that
anybody else
david have you got anything to add
no not really
no look he's gone to sleep then there
i agree he's gone to sleep
anybody on this table anything to add
UNK easy travel easier opportunity for people to spread their investment
it's an easier way into the stock market
so i can invest in the stock market without having to be UNK about it
yes
and i can spread my investment
i like both of those in fact i'll give you two marks for that

it's exactly what you said and the other thing you said was
i can't remember now spread the risk and
i don't have to get do i
no
i don't have to make the decisions
who's making the decisions
fund manager
fund manager another bonus excellent yes
o k
so we must be getting round to UNK question
oh
right sue what does it mean a whole of life policy
erm it means that you take out the policy for the whole of you life no matter how long you live so it keeps going until you die
yes o k
erm
no that's right
no i'll leave it
you worked hard for that you didn't get any points
life's not fair anyway is it
right a whole of life yes it pays out when you die
it's not something like the one term assurance you know when you have a policy for ten years and if you live longer than the ten years tough
you know
just your hard luck
o k erm minimum and maximum ages at entry
janet
erm seventeen and seventy one
oh er seventy
minimum age at entry
yes
seventeen
seventeen the maximum age
seventy one next birthday
next birthday next birthday
only the two you missed off the next birthday
i will give them a bonus for not making a fuss about losing their marks earlier
right june er four ways that you can write the policy
erm on joint life
joint life
erm own life
yes
joint life last survivor
yes
and life of the
excellent a little bit of the first one you just said joint life if you want to be
first claim
first claim
first claim o k only the two marks because he jumped in too quickly there so you get UNK one of your marks you see
right er philip
erm what's the minimum monthly and annual level premium
er minimum monthly premium is twenty pounds
mhm
and the minimum annual premium is two hundred
good
UNK if the minimum monthly premium is twenty pound a month level and the minimum annual premium is two hundred pound a month does that mean if i pay annually i get a discount it costs me less
yes
yes andrew what do you reckon
if yes at UNK they give discount to pay annually what do they do in can't remember UNK
well no because they reckon they'd be invested two hundred pounds right at the very beginning you'd most probably make the f fall short over the rest of the year in the investment
you're still sort of saying i get a discount really you're still saying it's only going to cost me two hundred a year
yes
yes
yes
yes i suppose so yes
what about in UNK west
well i would have thought you'd get a discount if you're buying units in the fund then you benefit due to paying annually if you paid in a lump sum erm you're going to have more units you know at the start
which is almost like saying i get a discount
no you're still paying the same it's just
ah let me put it more clearly because i don't think i've put the question clearly enough
let's say that me as an individual if i was erm buying a covermaster plan for twenty pound a month the minimum premium let's say i could get fifty thousand pounds worth of cover
if i wanted to pay annually would i still get fifty thousand pounds worth of cover or would i have to pay two hundred and forty pounds per year
that's changing the question slightly so let's go back to UNK what do you reckon
two hundred
pardon
two hundred and you get
two hundred so you still you still reckon you reckon it's a discount
yes
o k er let's go back to andrew how much would i pay for my fifty thousand pounds of cover if i wanted to pay annually will it cost me two hundred or two forty
two hundred i still think yes
two hundred and who's the other person i asked
two hundred
two hundred anybody disagree
go on then
sue do you disagree
i disagree
you can have a point for UNK because you're right
yes erm you get what you pay for
right so if it was going to cost me twenty pound a month for fifty thousand pounds worth of life cover and i wanted to pay it annually i'd have to pay it twelve times i'd have to pay two hundred and forty pounds
minimum premiums are just the smallest amount that abbey as a company can make a profit on
so we could have somebody start at twenty pound a month and we know we can make a profit and we can provide a good service to the clients a good level of cover
when it comes to annually we will accept two hundred pounds per year as a minimum premium but in this case they'd probably get about forty five thousand pounds worth of cover
they'd get less cover
you get what you pay for in this world
o k any questions
is the difference then because they're saving it in
it's yes in that respect
we can make a profit from two hundred pounds a year
er you might just say well why don't we pass that on to the clients but we don't
right
they they've got to pay twelve times
i think it just gets too complicated when you look at the various contracts
if you have different levels of payment it just gets very complicated
any fu everybody happy with that
excellent
who had the last question
UNK
UNK
who had the last question
UNK
excellent
a bonus for being honest on this team and being awake
so it must be andrew your question alright
