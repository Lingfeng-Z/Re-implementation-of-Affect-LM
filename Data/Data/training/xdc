it looks like it's been on the m twenty five on a friday night and every UNK been over it
now that normal heart you saw you saw that normal heart i would ask you if it was in a twenty five four year old man do you think that man is alive or dead
yes he's dead he was killed in a motor car accident
and the heart of that that's been on the m twenty five is the patient alive or dead
twenty two years later and there he spends with the was our eight heart transplant patient
sam says before he had his heart attacks he had five six i'll have to change the story
twenty two years later and there he spends with the he was our eighth heart transplant patient
sam says before he had his heart attacks he had five six i'll have to change the story he has a heart transplant he developed UNK and he's later UNK
do you know when he comes down here he UNK about this
it's like my when he was eighty they asked him how do you feel
if i think of the alternative i feel bloody well
but it is very serious
he has one complaint every time he comes and sees us
what's that
money
this operation and this threat to his health has created a lack of possible to UNK the money needed for him and his financial independence has been threatened
you from the insurance industry twenty five years after heart attacks when he should have died despite the modern medicine
after twenty three years after the heart transplant eight years after UNK i want to give you his secret guess what he's got
he's got a life insurance policy
it's amazing
and that life insurance policy to him is of no help
he needed something new because we in the medical profession in responding to your new diseases from the abuse of your body have created the situation that you've got to insure yourself that financially independence not because you're going to die but because you're going to live
and that is the way that we develop the concept of great living insurance
creating these insurance to die is the number one need for financial independence because we as doctors are going to spread the news with our modern UNK because unlike the UNK patient you're not going to recover and go back to work unlike the heart transplant as the heart transplant or the heart attack or the cancer patient maybe at our expense
invest money
give you an example
if any of the you i challenge to go to your bank manager tomorrow and say to him i've had a heart attack i'm not going to pay my loan of a hundred thousand pounds
do you know what happens
he'll get a heart attack that's what happens
that's just the things we do with the UNK arteries we do UNK artery by passes i can i can UNK like any woman i can UNK your socks we stick the veins on and we re establish the heart going a bit faster
now three hundred thousand men and women suffer heart attacks each year in your country but many will survive
think about the word survive before i tell you what does that mean survive
we as doctors say we're so bloody wonderful you know we're very important
we're so wonderful our patients survive
if he drops dead when he gets out of hospital we no longer care about him as long as he survived
who is going to survive
seventy seven percent will survive five years fifty eight percent survive ten years and forty seven survive thirty years and we are improving
we are the miracle men have decided that you're not allowed to die
let us promise you are not allowed to die any more we are going to s to improve our treatment and you're going to survive but with daily increasing threat to that financial UNK that you've so UNK want that you want for your loved ones
do you want see your
isn't that beautiful
have you seen anything like that
that's the lungs
i wish i could talk longer because i'd like to tell you about the lungs but er time's still
a twenty four year old woman came to see me for treatment on the ward a smoker
i had to investigate her and i diagnosed that she had cancer of the lungs
there's someone out already
she came to see me a year later total loss of weight total short of breath hardly she's struggling to keep body and soul together
she says to me i cannot continue she's dead already i will never forget her face never
now what would have happened if her UNK came to this convention and heard about their disease and two years ago sold her a disease policy that would have given her two hundred thousand pounds on the diagnosis of the disease
that little girl had to struggle on because the flat rent had to be paid she had to struggle on because she had a car kids had to go to school until she died
now if she had two hundred thousand pounds what would it have given her
she could have stopped working
she could have spent quality time with her children
if it happens to me i will say i'll take that two hundred thousand and go to UNK and spend the night with UNK that would have been my choice
it would have been UNK choice too by the way
thirty percent of all people in your country your country suffer from a condition called cancer and ninety percent will be life threatening
how long they survive if you look at my age i'm a male thirty five forty seven percent forty percent will survive at least er five years
if you look at the chairman here this afternoon sixty four twenty nine percent will survive
but on the whole of the UNK of UNK made today more than fifty percent will survive more than five years
have you ever seen a person with cancer of the lung cancer of the stomach
have you seen what their survival means
it's a slow progression to UNK to perform their daily needs especially to start with the threat to the person of opportunities to greater income
only crystal will pay up on the diagnosis and make it possible
like samuel stated in a woman suffered strokes seventy eight percent will survive at least one have you ever seen a person with a stroke
have you ever seen a person with a stroke
it's not only the patient who lies there paralysed and unable to talk and unable to move it involves his whole family
his whole family is locked into caring working wives have to give up work to come and help them
there's a clue there's a clue for the need of insurance not because you're going to die but because you're going to live and that is the reason why i'm prepared to cross this world
i don't ask you to sell better ladies and gentlemen i don't ask you to sell itself for certain companies i'd like you to but i don't
what i ask you and i insist that for a great tomorrow for my patients you tell them about it
just tell them about this product what it can do and i assure you of the results
you never have to tell a person who's had a heart attack you never need to tell a woman when her husband has a stroke i have to
help me give me that great tomorrow by enough financial security
look at what we've done to each other er to ourselves in the young in nineteen hundred eight percent of people had heart attacks six percent strokes cancer four percent total eighteen percent
and now with the way that the human take it to the medical profession for giving them a longer life expectancy thirty percent of people are UNK
twenty one cancer and nine percent strokes
it varies from cancer in world statistics
you must watch our statistics
in america it's been shown that UNK that men have got more children than women
so be very careful with statistics
this is the figure of your country i think are very significant of the reduction of death rates of people are getting higher and higher and the time that's spent through illness off work and there's an increase in survival after the diagnosis of the dread disease
ladies and gentlemen that's why i'm very proud
i've been very lucky i'm not being charitable but i've a lot of luck
i've been lucky to be able to launch the first concept of dread disease insurance in south africa you might have heard about us
it's called living assurance launched august ninety eight for standard life assurance and UNK
when we changed the concept of insurance totally and we have said that the sum assured will be paid out on the diagnosis of the disease and not on death or anything else
we then created the first product which heart attacks strokes UNK and certain UNK artery disease which i can see
i believe you can see why first of it it's most common and second to UNK artery disease i'm a UNK surgeon i want my piece of the action too so we keep as well
we have a lot of UNK and a lot of things until we change them and you know why we changed it because you went out and saw your clients and told them products and they reported you and you came back and said but what about this what about this
and we responded to the need that you and i don't think you will ever appreciate it i cannot thank you enough for your input in this product of yours
you made it what it is
until we increase it by surgery for disease of UNK failure therapy for UNK replacement of a heart valve and organ transplant
and then the danger of lungs and in which i do quite well and you can say to us and we earn it
multiple UNK and any terminal illness
why any terminal illness
just in case somebody escape that net of dread diseases the lucky ones
if your doctors says that you're going die within twelve months we will accept it as a diagnosis of a critical illness
erm we are getting through on that are you going to suggest on it
we are going to improve and produce what i believe the UNK product eventually
and you know it it's amazing how since my involvement for the last two years in great britain all the problems that you have with critical illness all the problems
all those things about definitions UNK and all that
do you know what they said it's not justified tell that to the young farmer of thirty four with a dread disease his policy when we pay him two hundred thousand pounds in his hospital bed
say to him it's not justified on his policy i want the money back
it seems that it is not clarification of definition tell that to the woman who looked for two thirteen years after a stroke husband and they had to wait for his death that you didn't sell him a dread disease policy because there is not clarification of definition
tell the young mother whose child has just received fifteen thousand pounds after the diagnosis of UNK that you shouldn't have filled the policy because the UNK where not UNK
no ladies and gentlemen dread disease insurance is a success because it's needed today and tomorrow and it works
what does it do and then i'll finish and i'll summarise
if you want me to come back i'll speak for another five hours
what does it do
think about it very careful it UNK to the threat of loss of own ability
the person has his financial independence threatened by disease is helped by the dread disease insurance
compare it with life insurance death insurance
it UNK the pay out by one day two days ten days thirty days of the death plan because it pays out on the condition that's going to be the cause of the death and not on the death
so it UNK death
so death insurance dread disease insurance go to much will do it far better just quicker
that's all we can do
UNK to work permanent disability it UNK permanent disability because ninety five percent of the conditions that cause the disability will pay out years before you have a disability
i am would claim now for a man who has a disability claim
his accountant said that my stroke is UNK his left arm he's right handed
he can speak with a bit of UNK so what
he says he's got loss of memory without a stroke i have that as well so that makes no difference
he comes and he wants disability
he is not disabled and yet he makes like he never would have the diagnosis of disability recognised
but dread disease insurance recognised his condition long before disability and finally what does the dread disease insurance do
it does something even more wonderful it UNK critical illness diagnosis by paying out on the UNK condition like loss of limb where it creates a situation where the permanent person get paid out even before he has a critical condition because that condition UNK his chances of paying his daily needs due to financial independence
and to continue ladies and gentlemen i don't think you know where i come from i've got UNK parents you might say that you can see that
my father was a missionary had come from a UNK little town in south africa i've got many wonderful experiences in my life i've had experience of heart transplant
i've the experience of being in a political party that says one man one vote release UNK and all these things that we were nearly shot for
today they let prisoners of south africa say it it's amazing
but i was also involved in an insurance policy that has been made available for my patients when they have that worst moment in their lives you've got cancer you've had a stroke to know that in this threat to what's going to happen to them they at least have financial independence
i believe that creates the great tomorrow
life is not only quantity it's quality as well
you have that choice that chance to do that for my patients and i tell you to be with you to be part of you i'm as a i learn for you i think of you and i can just tell you i wish you all the best but i won't forget your responsibility to help the medical profession to make with the work they do for a better tomorrow possible due to your work your hard attempts to give that financial ability through the best insurance policies on the market today
god bless you everything of the best thank you very much
would you like to take a five minute stretch whilst before we continue
right
mr was also sharing his wife with mr
i haven't heard that
no
right
okay yeah right
so you see where we get to
yes
you go into the master bedroom man and woman in bed
isn't it obvious in a second that it's not it's mr and mrs
at that time no
no i'm afraid not no
you still thought it was
when you burst into the bedroom
i i'm being perfectly honest i didn't know who it was
i didn't know er and i didn't know the occupants of the flat
no but you did know that the husband and wife and
you had no reason to think that was er sleeping with the man's wife i say again
no
isn't it obvious within a second that you must be looking at the husband and wife
i have to say again i'm sorry no it wasn't obvious to me at that time definitely not
you thought it is this right you thought it could be it could be
i have to say that yes
and it was only er when this man could have been said what are you doing in my house
yes
you that you accepted that as UNK that it was and not
not UNK but certainly that is when i started thinking that we didn't have
that more likely is that you realised well UNK immediately that it was mr that's why you said to mr i'm UNK you for UNK an UNK
i had good reason then to suspect that it could well be
because of what he said
because of what he'd said and because i'd asked his wife who he was
not because he was in bed with his wife that didn't
i didn't know that was his wife erm
well i did bother to ask who you'd thought would be in the flat you said mrs mr
yes that's correct yes
one minor point you heard the give evidence you know it's a issue between you whether you shouted armed police or you didn't
of course yes
there's no point in me um UNK that
but why you'd just forced the door open prior to arrest why do you wait until you got to the bedroom indeed got the bedroom door open before shouting armed police
why isn't it shouted from the start so that everybody knows from the start who you are
okay right yep
well the situation there is firstly there is little point in shouting and identifying ourselves if firstly there's nobody in the flat or secondly er we're giving advance warning that we are coming along the corridor to a possible location er of somebody with a firearm
so what we would do then is identify the fact that we've come into the building and therefore UNK everybody that lo and behold down the corridor are coming police officers
but i thought you were saying in answer to a question my was putting to you that one of the reasons for shouting armed police was so that everybody knows you're armed police
that is correct yes but only when we encounter somebody in front of us
prior to that definitely not
you weren't more than from the hall you were about six foot to the door to the master bedroom
i can't recall
it was very close yes
crossing that distance i suppose in a hurry was going to take you erm considerably less than a second
definitely we don't if we were crossing an area that hadn't been secured by any other officer so we were particularly concerned that we should get out of any possible danger area
so i'd suggest again that the sensible place to shout armed police is as soon as you enter because the fraction of a second between you getting from the hall to the bedroom isn't going to make any difference
yes i'd argue that it does make a difference because we are UNK the fact that er we are coming along to possibly alert somebody er that we were coming into a building and then hence we encounter even more problems
you can't answer for the other officers but you can answer for yourself
would you agree with mr that on this sort of raid the UNK flowing
without a doubt definitely
is a specific gun issued to a specific officer or is it just er a group of guns issued to a group of officers
er the easiest way to answer that is er all of our guns have a unique serial number
so for example if i went on er a job on monday i could possibly draw gun number three but the following day if we went on a similar operation i might get gun number six
so there is no specific gun issued to an individual officer as his own personal weapon
yes i'm sorry i
oh sorry
didn't mean that what i meant was on this er exercise were was it written down for instance that erm p c has smith er smith and UNK number thirty two
yes that's correct yes
in the heat of the operation is there anything to stop you handing it to one of the other officers if that should be necessary
no not at all my lord
in fact er just prior to the start of the operation er i made a decision to change the shotgun holders over
i have to say now in at this moment in time i can't remember why i did it but it was an operational decision that was made en route to the flats that we UNK with er another officer
sorry
very clear you've got two officers with UNK do you mean that it's just he gave his shotgun to him and vice versa or you nominated two different UNK
i recall that i in effect directed that an officer should carry a shotgun as opposed to the original officer that er was down for that weapon
yes
the UNK were just ordinary twelve bore double barrel UNK were they
er my lord they're twelve bore single UNK pump action UNK with a slightly shorter length er than is a normal shotgun that you'd purchase in er a firearms dealers
oh
can you remember now who the UNK were originally issued to
i have to say i'm afraid i can't erm i have thought about this yes
because the UNK i'm UNK is this ah it is said by the both of them that it was you who had what they call a long UNK gun it must be a shotgun
yes
so i was hoping that there'd be a record showing one way or the other but if
okay
you'd UNK over the record wouldn't help is that right
that would be correct yes
so
but that is certainly not the case i did not have a shotgun
well i appreciate you deny it because er you said in answer to my friend that erm as i am required by rules to put it er i do put to you that yes you did have a shotgun perhaps erm borrowed from one of the officers yes you did put it to mr head and you did tell him to er shut up and wait for c i d
i can assure everybody that is not correct
that is totally wrong
now what about mrs
while you were in the bedroom where was she
she was er still in bed
on oh sorry in lying down or on sitting on the edge
er she'd sat up er obviously when we moved into the bedroom and from there i'm not exactly sure what she was doing in as much as she wasn't a threat so therefore perhaps i didn't pay that much attention to what she was doing
my direction was UNK er drawn to the man
let me try and UNK your memory
she says that when you erm pointed the gun against her husband's head she went towards you grabbed by another officer
right
do you disagree
well i disagree in as much as i have said that i didn't have a shotgun and ignoring that fact then that i didn't have a shotgun she certainly did not make a UNK at me
you don't seem able to recall what said either at the start or er somewhat later after he'd been UNK
what he says he was saying is who the UNK are you recall that at all
no i don't no
well do the best you can er i don't want exact words obviously but what was the burden of what he was the UNK the effects of what he was saying
with respect er i wasn't paying too much attention to er to what was being said in as much as this possibly sounds negative but our concern is not for what people are shouting at us our concern is for whether we've got a threat er in a particular area in this case the bedroom and whether we can try and sort that threat out before somebody is injured
whether it's us or an innocent member of the public
yes but forgive me you must listen to what's said to you because somebody might be saying to you lawrence is under the bed
oh yes yeah of course
so you listened what roughly was said
i listened but if it's of no UNK value there is no point in listening because i've got so much on my mind at that time erm to sort out that threat in there that i certainly can't recall what was exactly said or even along the lines of what was said
but i erm i don't think there's much between you and erm the plaintiff on this
you say when you had UNK him he said something to me asking along the lines of what were we doing in his house
that's correct my lord yes
well he says when he had been UNK i said who they were who the UNK are you
which sounds exactly the same isn't that right
along those lines my lord yes
yes
and er again i have to put to you i you've heard the say and i do think you'll disagree
sure
what i suggest to you is far more officers than the three you gave evidence of perhaps five or even the full six at some stage found their way into that master bedroom
that is not correct in as much as every individual officer was UNK to an individual action and therefore there was no need to come into that bedroom the area er if they'd have heard shouting or whatever in that bedroom they would have known not to come into that area because there was obviously a threat in there
well if what you say about this information that was in the master bedroom is true they might have every reason to come into the master bedroom to see if er the who was sleeping in the
no because our training is such that there isn't the officers just would not come into that bedroom at all because there is a threat in there and i'm dealing with that threat and unless i specifically call for another officer to come and give me a hand there is no need to come in and in fact if anybody UNK done they'd have been told to get out because i've got a problem there and that's my problem
so presumably two of the armed officers remained guarding this eleven year in bedroom two and two remained covering the kitchen
no that's not correct because i've also already called up to p c into that master bedroom when i've left or as i was about to UNK er the man
so we then have three officers in there and i leave leaving the two officers whilst i go and check the rest of the place out
so who was left guarding in the small bedroom one or two
i can't recall when you say guarding i can't recall exactly what the officers were doing but that would have been erm one of p c or p c or both i don't really know who was erm sorting that side of it out
you see i am you can see what i'm suggesting to you there's not much point in an armed officer guarding an eleven year old child it would have been obvious to go to the master bedroom but you deny it
right the reason that er an officer would still stay er with an eleven year old child a three year old child or t to get to the UNK of fantasy a ninety year old person is that person can still be at risk not necessarily from the police officers but from anybody else in that building and therefore they've got to remain er in that room until such time as i'm satisfied that everything is clear
again something that i just have to put
it wasn't you who helped mr get some trousers on that was done by the c i d when they arrived
i have to say that it was me i did that
yes and just finally no idea at all where this information that was in the master bedroom
i'm sorry i don't know
yes examination
you've had a number of questions from about whether you knew the man in the bedroom was mr or
i just want to ask you this
did it matter to you at that time who it was
no definitely not
was your objective to be to secure him
that's right and he we would have done the same if we'd have found six men in there er they all would have been secured until such time as i was happy that the flat was clear
and it's being put to you that not being it's been put to you straight you're in effect lying about guns that you had a shotgun
that's been put to you
now tell me tell me tell the jury again does a team leader is there any policy as to what gun a team leader should carry
no there seems no logic in taking a long UNK weapon er in as much as the team leader perhaps has a few more responsibilities than the other officers have and i would be going forward to UNK whoever was in that bo er in that bedroom
i cannot do that with a long UNK weapon
i couldn't do that er with the officer who had the shield
there there's no way i can hand over a long UNK weapon to that officer
so UNK there is absolutely no reason at all for me to have a long UNK weapon
well it's the plaintiff's saying is you had one and you UNK him nevertheless notwithstanding the fact that you had a long UNK weapon
i could say a
very smart answer to that but erm i've got to carry a shotgun in one hand and UNK in the other and still deal with en e UNK i just can't do it
and it's been yet again been put to you directly that mrs did indeed UNK at this imaginary weapon
now i wan i want to ask you about that
in your in your experience do er members of the public UNK at armed police officers
they don't and to be dramatic they'd be very silly to do so because i would take any step to avoid that happening
whether that was erm a child whether it was a woman anybody who tries to take my firearm from me would really have serious problems
because presumably if anyone was to get your firearms
they will use it to shoot me and i that will not happen ever
so in reality had mrs tried what has been suggested she may well have been struck
she definitely would have been struck
and she would have no doubt told about that
i'm sure
perhaps a matter of
and finally erm again we've been told that you either not remembering or you're lying about the trousers
is that something you can easily forget pulling a man's trousers on when he's got UNK on and lying on his front
i remember absolutely one hundred percent doing that and i have to say that if i was faced with a similar situation again of a naked man i really don't know if i'd bother to put his trousers on
thank you very much
further re examination
well just remind us a little bit now y you have been very definite you had a hand gun
yes my lord yes
and not a shot gun
definitely
what did erm the others have
okay my lord
you immediately erm followed the officer with the shield
yes my lord
what did he have
he had er a revolver that was UNK throughout the entire operation to the best of my knowledge that was the case
and anything else
no my lord no
and the shield of course
that's correct yes
and what about the others
er p c would have had a shield and a revolver that once again would have been UNK
p c would have had a revolver that i would expect to have been drawn
yes
p c had a shot gun and p c had a shot gun
yes thank you
my lord there's just one point i wonder whether i can clarify
yes certainly
this is a p c and had a shot gun
each yes
each
did they also have a revolver each
yes i beg your pardon
yeah my fault my lord yes they both did but those weapons would have been UNK
yes that makes up to the total number of guns
yes thank you
thank you sergeant
thank you my lord
yes mr
yes my lord can i say w your lordship says that and for the benefit of the jury that with the subsequent officers objections i'm not going to take them through their training or their
no certainly not
no
yes
lord i call p c
i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth
shall be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
mr could you tell the court your name rank and station
my name's at the moment i'm a temporary detective constable at police station
yes well could i ask you to er tell us a little bit lord the jury and in december of nineteen eighty eight what was your rank and job
i was a police officer erm attached or er on a permanent basis with the operations support unit which we were based in er
is the operational support unit what we call the firearms unit
that's correct
were you involved in an operation to enter
yes i was part of the firearms team that was er briefed to enter that department
and when would you first when did you first become involved in that operation
erm when we were UNK at home and called out to report to police station erm i can't remember the exact time that we got to police station and it would have been er somewhere in the region of four o'clock in the morning
did you attend the briefing about the operation
yes i did
who conducted that briefing
it was sergeant
were you given a weapon
directly after the briefing all the officers that were ordered to er or authorised to be armed er went to the UNK in police station and i was issued with a revolver
and were you given a particular role for this operation
my particular role erm in the operation was to carry one of the UNK erm and i also erm during the briefing was informed that i would be the first person through the front door and UNK consequently to the door of the master bedroom
first of all have you ever handled a revolver of that kind before
yes on several occasions
have you ever had been a shield man before
erm not that i recollect only in training
you'd used a shield in training
yes several times
and in your mind what was the objective of the operation
erm it was to hopefully UNK a person called that we believed to be er staying at that flat
and can you perhaps confirm for us that you were wearing tell us the gear explained by the previous witness
yeah the clothes i had on was identical to that of p c
every officer did all the other officers had the same
everybody was dressed exactly the same
again you needn't ask them all that erm if mr challenges
my lord
some difficulty breaking the door down is that your recollection
yes
and let's move on from that and when the door was broken down what did you do
as soon as the door was cleared from the door frame er giving us sufficient room for myself to get through with the large c shield with myself and p c ran the few UNK down the hall way to the door at the end of the hall way
now just let's just pause there and take it in stages
at that stage had you said or shouted anything
no
what did you then do
i then as far as i can recollect i can't remember whether the door was UNK or totally shut erm i would have put my hand to the handle and once knowing the door was free from its erm lock i then pushed the door hard with the shield make knowing that it would then bang hopefully bang against the back wall
you say hopefully bang against the back wall why's that
erm because it's part of our training
any interior door even UNK doors we push them back as far as they possibly would go
it gives us more chance to know that there is no object or person behind it
and after you'd opened the door what did you do
i UNK myself in the entrance to the doorway sufficiently enough to be able to see through the er the window we have in the shield erm to see quickly into the room to see er what's in the room and if there are any persons in the room
and what did you see
i saw movements from er the far side of the room erm which with due to the light erm i could distinguish as being human beings but er not immediately what sex they were but i could see enough to say that they were persons
and did you er do anything more at that stage
erm i just moved probably a half a pace so p c would get exactly the same view as myself
yes and then what did he or you then do
erm at that stage erm p c then shouted armed police raise your hands
pause there
h how did he shout those words
as loud as he could
do you think the occupants of the bed would have heard that
most definitely
what did you then see happening
we then p UNK ourselves further into the room er p c obviously was still with me behind the shield erm once we'd got ourselves in a in a better position as far as we were concerned p c then started talking to the people erm who were in the bed
yes and it's probably slightly UNK but tell us briefly what he managed to do
well first of all erm we wanted to find the light switch
yes
erm so we then moved back towards the doorway erm and then p c requested the persons in the bed to tell him where the light switch was which a male voice told him the approximate area where the light switch was
erm he found the light switch put the light on and er
pause there
up until this point had you drawn your gun from its holster
i didn't draw my weapon at any time whilst i was in the flat
and just help us with this if you can remember
what sort of weapon did p c have
a revolver
could it have been a shot gun do you think
no way
you got the light on what do you then see
i saw a white male nearest to us in a double bed which was at the other end of the bedroom
behind him was a black woman and i believe two small children
at that time p c then was speaking to the man telling him to get out of the bed
did the man get out of bed
yes he did
and what then occurred
the man with his ar his hands up in the air walked towards us a few UNK and then p c ordered him to go down onto his knees slowly and then consequently end up on his chest with his arms UNK
and er was the man wearing any clothes
no he was naked
what did p c do after the man was lying UNK on the floor
he then told him that he was going to go to move towards him to er to UNK him erm this is when i f i f i believe this is the t the moment when p c p c to come into the room erm
was it apparent to you why he would call for p c to come into the room
yes erm it was obvious because if he's already told the man he's going to move forward to UNK him erm he will not move forward to a person with his gun er in his hand
so i knew that he was calling p c into the room to give him cover
i couldn't give him cover because the see shield is quite a heavy UNK thing and it has two UNK behind it erm and they are obviously the means of holding it up and f for directing it wherever you want so i'm holding this all the time so he can't pass his weapon to me and he can't put his weapon in my holster because my gun was in the holster
what about just putting his weapon on the ground
it's never done
so did put his gun in his holster
he put it in his own holster and he put the er thumb strap over t to secure it in the holster
yes a and then what
he then moved forward to the person on the ground and UNK his hands behind his back
and whilst he was doing that operation where was p c
i can't exactly remember which side of the person on the who was lying on the ground p c was but he was in a position where he was not putting himself er he was covering the person lying on the ground but he wasn't covering to the point of fact that p c erm would have to walk in front of his shot gun
right
after the man was UNK did UNK do anything else
erm yes he i believe it th that stage was when er he said we'll put y we'll UNK we'll find some clothes for you mate erm i do recollect p c going i think to the foot of the double bed or near to the base of the double bed where he found a pair of erm jeans and i do remember him checking the pockets erm and then helping or trying like put the jeans on the man that was lying on the ground still UNK
he obviously had to get him up f erm sort of rolled him over er one way then the other to be of but the er the legs of the jeans on
did you remain in that room with your shield until you were called away by p c
yes
in other words w was that an established position for you in this operation
that was my that was my objective i for the master bedroom i had no other objective unless obviously the scenario changed
yeah
did you see p c point a gun of any description into the back of mr head
i saw p c pointing his shot gun in the direction of the man lying on the ground
yes
erm i wouldn't say he was pointing at his head it was just in the general direction of him
yes well it's being suggested by the plaintiff that in fact it was shoved into the back behind his right ear like i'm doing with my fingers
no at no time did p c get that close to the person lying on the ground
then how far was he away
he w
how far was the end of his gun away
it would be at least two three four feet at least my lord
whilst you were in that bedroom throughout the operation did you see any other officer point any sort of gun into the back of mr head
no
and just finally
are you able to give us an estimate of the time that UNK between breaking the door in and being called away by your team leader
i would estimate erm three four minutes the whole operation
yes thank you
if you could just wait there there'll be some more questions for you
p c as he then was p m as he now is gave evidence that he only shouted armed police once
and i don't think you gave evidence that you shouted armed police yourself so is it right that it was only shouted one time just immediately after the second door opened
as far as i UNK can recollect yes
my these they were my recollection may be wrong i thought it had been put to the yesterday and was that it was shouted a number of times but you were there it was only shouted once
as far as i can recollect
the only other thing that you heard sergeant say that some how at the briefing he'd been given information that was likely to be in the master bedroom
do you recall anything being said at the briefing to that effect and if so who by
the only thing i can recollect from the briefing in relation to the operation and the way that was it was erm o it was UNK
we knew for definite that it was only a two bedroomed flat and that is one of the reasons we went in at the time we did hoping that UNK e every person in that flat would be asleep
yes
and we had two UNK we had two separate teams to go immediately to the two bedrooms which in our er UNK that will be where any adults were more likely to be in the flat
oh yes you and i are entirely at one on that erm
well that's well that's all i can recollect in relation to why we did it the way we did
i'd go a little bit further and say well it'd be much more likely that husband and wife would be in the master bedroom with in the small bedroom but as you say er the adults or anybody indeed in the flat is likely to be in the bedrooms at that time but sergeant you see went a bit further and said that at the briefing somehow he got information that was likely to be in the master bedroom so i understand your evidence you certainly didn't get that impression at the brief
erm i don't recollect
my lord i have no re examination if you lordship has any questions
no thank you
thank you mr
i call er p c
would you raise this in your hand and
i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth
shall be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
mr could you again give your name rank and station currently
UNK currently temporary detective constable at
could you just spell your name so that i can get it right
yes
thank you
and mr in december of nineteen eighty eight what was your rank and job
my job in er december nineteen ninety eighty eight was er a member of the forces operational support unit erm a firearms officer with that team an also an external UNK with er police
and er when did you start as a firearms officer
in nineteen eighty three sir
were you involved in the operation to enter
yes i was
and did you attend the briefing with sergeant
yes i did yes
were you given a weapon or weapons to carry
yes i was sir
and what were those
they were a er revolver and er a shot gun
and is that a smith and UNK revolver
it would be so yes
and the shot gun is that a single UNK twelve bore
pump action shot gun yes
pump action
and er sergeant mentioned that the barrel was slightly shorter than ordinary ones you buy in the shop
that is correct sir
and is that because you'd UNK it off or
oh no they're actually bought from the manufacturers like that
i rather thought just wanted to contrast it with the other case and er it may not be obvious to the jury but why did you want a shot gun that's a little shorter
erm the shot gun is preferable in these cases the fact that er they are used generally as a support weapon erm should we UNK encounter any problems in the area that i was covering this was thought to be the best weapon capable of doing that job
do you remember when coming into the flat do you remember who entered it first
into the er back bedroom
yes
er p c
and er wh where were you in the order of entry
my job was er to actually open the door and then once the door was open the team would enter the flat and i together with p c would er cover the UNK inside the flat
mr were you actually were you the cover man
yes
is it usual for the cover men to have a revolver and a shot gun
yes it is sir yes
but again i think you've already part answered it why is that the er role for cover men why do they get those weapons
again that is the weapon that is suitable for that type of job
and you're referring here to the shot gun
yes sir
during the operation i'm going to come back to the door in a minute during the operation which gun were you carrying
shot gun at all times sir
did you at any stage draw your revolver
no sir
now going back to the incident with the door
tell us what happened there
well having er carried this appliance nine flights of stairs to the ninth floor of the flat erm my objective was to gain entry into the flat UNK sorry once the okay was given erm again the objective was to gain entry into the flat as quickly and as quietly as possible er by my mistake the equipment was not placed one hundred percent correctly and began to UNK er it started to make er a bit of a UNK noise and a bit of a loud noise and again the objective was to gain entry quickly and quietly
i made the decision to UNK using the apparatus and revert to an alternative er means
which was
a UNK sir
did you how many strikes did it take to get entry
at least once no more than twice
the sophisticated technique had not worked
yeah exactly
back to the old fashioned police technique
yes sir
the when the other officers attended the flat where
how long did it take from the time you started what was going to be the quick silent operation until you finished and got in
if i just can explain first er sergeant has already point out my lord
the piece of equipment is UNK er once the equipment is placed on it takes a total of between twelve and fifteen seconds for it to operate totally
it started to make er a bit of a horrible noise around the ten second mark and from there it was UNK immediately erm the UNK was handy and it was just a matter of seconds after that
so do we understand from that in the event it made only a few seconds difference if at all
yes sir
when the other officers had entered the flat did you go
i would remained erm close to the doorway covering the internal UNK er effectively looking down towards the kitchen and the living room area
and did you er did you hear of anything anyone shouting
yes i did sir yes
what did you hear
i quite plainly heard erm an officer i'm not sure who it was er shout armed police
and you were standing in the hall way
yes sir
did you remain in the hall way
until directed to otherwise yes sir
and who directed you to go other elsewhere
i heard my name being called it may well have been UNK erm come forward and i heard it i understood it to be p c voice
yes and so where did you go
to the main bedroom sir
and when you went in there were you directed or instructed to do anything
er my only instruction from p c was cover me
and state the jury how you covered him
well er by the time i arrived at the doorway to the room erm a male person was lying on the floor UNK er and my job would have been to cover him with the shot gun er to enable p c to go forward and UNK the chap
would p c come between you and the suspect
no sir
it's rather obvious but why's that
if erm things should start to go wrong and the chap on the floor erm was to make any movement or s sudden movement towards either p c or any other piece of equipment in the room which may cause injury or damage to ourselves or himself it would be down to me to challenge that man er and allow p c to get back behind er the UNK shield
w when you were covering p c were you sitting down or standing up
standing up
and can you tell us if your hands your UNK
i would have been more or less like that sir
yes and er you haven't changed in height since nineteen eighty eight
no sir
so your gun would have been at least four and a half to five foot off of one surface of the floor
yes sir
and it's not being too necessarily but at any stage did you get that gun and shove it into the back of mr head
no definitely not sir
er ha what did you estimate four and a half to five feet
i'm
i think you're a little bit much
am i sorry am i
well probably
it's about chest height is that what were you're saying
the gun would have been
slightly below my chest
yes
and effectively three and a half to four foot off the ground
the front of the gun would be
sorry sir
the front of the gun would be nearer to your waist as you're demonstrating
the barrel of the weapon isn't that long there's the erm the UNK is in me shoulder
yes
and the barrel would've been more or less well about that in height sir
well what do you think do if i estimate
about three and a half foot from the ground
yes so i three and half i think sounds better than your four and half to five but we'll
can i also tell you as a did you stick that gun into the back behind the right ear of mr
most definitely not sir
did you see anyone else do that
no sir
with a shot gun
no sir
and how far do you estimate the gun was from the man's head distance
i would have been standing erm about two or three foot away from him anyway sir so that including the distance height wise i could have been er from the end of my weapon to his head or any part of his body there would have been a maximum of between four to five feet at least
a and is that sort of distance and the sort of UNK you adopted er consistent with your training
yes sir it's standard practice
standard practice
how long do you think you remained guarding mr on the floor
altogether sir or
altogether yes
a matter of a couple of minutes
did mr remain naked throughout that time
no he didn't er p c found some trousers i'm not sure where he got them from er and put them on for him
and finally i'd like your estimate as to the length of time before between your UNK finally knocking the door down and you being called out of the flat
no more than four minutes sir
thank you very much if you just wait there will be some more questions
getting into the flat the er UNK door opener didn't work so you erm you knocked the door down with a UNK
that's correct sir
p s told the jury not three quarters of an hour ago that the automatic door opener didn't work it was taken off re fitted and the automatic door opener was used to open the door
i imagine you stick to your account and it follows that his account is not right
i was aware when p c was saying it was a slight contradiction all i can suggest sir is that er whilst i was putting the door in p c would have been controlling his troops
troops
er ready to enter the flat he wouldn't have been paying attention to what i was doing
sorry i simply didn't hear the first part of that lot sir
sorry
what he said no doubt p c was looking after his troops and he wasn't paying as much attention to what i was doing as i was taking
but how far away from you was he
i don't know sir i was concentrating on the door
it was only a couple of feet or a yard wasn't it
if you say so sir the only thing i can suggest is that fact that er that the noise the door opener was making and the fact i opened the door very shortly afterwards he can only assume the door opener worked
look forgive me and were the first of the two troops going in through that door
they're gonna go in through that door the second it goes down they weren't UNK at the end of the passage they were right by the door weren't they
that's correct sir p c was behind the shield like he was told to be
and somehow missed the UNK
the only other thing i have to put to you is this that i've already put to er what we UNK went on in that bedroom
are you sure that sergeant didn't take the shot gun from you and put it against er mr head
no sir because that wouldn't allow him to do the job he was there to do
the only other thing is this
you're in the hall you heard one shout of armed police
yes sir
any other UNK along
not as far as i'm aware sir no
great
lord i have no re examination
yep thank you
thank you mr
mr
p c
i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth
shall be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
like everyone else can you give your name and current rank and your station
i'm gary UNK erm constable pe p c and i'm stationed at
and in december of ninety eighty eight what was your job
i was a member of the operational support unit
and excuse me for how long had you been a firearms officer
at that time just getting on two years
were you involved in the entry and search of
i was
did you attend the briefing
yes the briefing was held in the early hours of monday morning
and were you issued with a weapon
yes i had a er smith and UNK revolver
were you given a particular task or role in this job
yes erm my task was together with er p c to go into bedroom number two
and what was p c role in that
p c was er carrying a UNK shield as already mentioned
what did you understand the prime objective of the operation
erm to UNK a er state UNK erm mr
and what did you understand about the level of force to be used
erm reasonable force to be used in the circumstances that dictated it
do you carry one of the cards that you probably saw p c refer to
i did at the time erm i no longer am authorised to carry
are you in a different job sir
yes that's correct
do you remember whereabouts in the order you were in getting into the flat
i was the fourth one going in erm there was p c p c p c and then myself
and we've heard how p c linked up with his shield man
can you tell us did you do the likewise or
yes it's standard er training standard operation procedure to do that
and where did you let him go
we followed directly behind erm the first two officers went down the corridor and er then straight into the second bedroom
and which of the two of you then went into that room first
p c as he was carrying the shield and afforded all the protection to both he and i
did either you or him shout anything
no b erm we didn't encounter er anyone and so there was no need to give the er warning
was the door open or shut
erm that i can't recollect
you after p c protection of his shield
what did you then do
i followed in behind him erm the curtains were drawn the room was in reasonable darkness and er i switched on the light
and what did you see
erm immediately as we went in it was er a very poorly UNK room erm i'm going in there's a window on the far side and there was a small single bed erm which to all UNK and purposes appeared un made at the time and there was a UNK covering it
yes and switching the light on and looking around what did you do
our first erm priority was to establish that there was no one in that room
yes
as already said the bed appeared un made
yes
erm and as such a likely hiding place for someone to be was beneath the bed erm i then lifted the bed with one hand as i had my revolver drawn in the other hand erm and then seeing no one was underneath it i dropped it again
yes and just at that stage did you notice anyone else in the bedroom
erm no i didn't er it wasn't until we UNK
on completing that did you notice anyone there did you hear anyone in the bedroom
no one at all
did you look anywhere else in the bedroom
yes we looked in the er wardrobe there were a built in UNK there
did you take it he was still a whether there was an armed man or any sort of man in that
i had to erm until the whole of the h the premises had been UNK and secured then i had to assume that there was someone in that room until the contrary was shown
and on searching it what did you think
that the room was empty
on UNK the room was empty so far as you thought what did you do
we then proceeded to search and secure the main living room area and the kitchen area
you said we
again lieutenant er constable
you UNK the kitchen and the living room area
did you find anything
no
what did you then do
erm my attention was then brought to the fact that er there was a child in bedroom er two
was that the bedroom you looked in
that was the bedroom i'd looked in
and when you say your attention was drawn how was it drawn
er another officer in the in the in the building told me
good
which one it was i'm not sure
you can't remember
no
what did on hearing that information what did you do
i erm actually went back to the room to see erm what condition or what the child was doing there
did you see anything
er yes i saw a small erm UNK child erm near the bed whereabouts he was i i'm not sure but it was near the bed
and er what condition was the child in
er she was UNK er upset she wasn't UNK just er crying
did you say anything to her
no p c er was erm dealing with her at the time
did you recognise at that were you in court yesterday
yes i was
did you recognise that young child
no i couldn't say that was the child erm possibly she's grown a bit quite considerably
after seeing the child was upset did you do anything else
erm by this time the mother er in the other room erm had emerged and i helped bring the other children into the er main room
how did you help to do that
oh i carried er one of the children into the into the main room
and upon putting that child in the room what did you then do
erm the premises was by now secured so i left the premises
if you had seen the young girl who was apparently in the bed what would you have done
my actions would have been totally different erm
what would you have done
what would i have done i would have asked her to er get out of the bed walk towards me and come out into the hall way where she could have been looked after by one of the other officers and al allow me to get on with my main task in hand
and just finally this er p c can you give us an estimate of the time between going into that flat and being called away when it was secure
er three to four minutes max
thank you very much if you wait there there'll be some more questions
we've got a photograph of julie taken er very shortly after the incident it's the one that everybody saw yesterday have a look
definitely
the one in the bed
no it was identified by mr and er the bed with julie si sitting on it taken the day after the incident
the day after
now er she's not here to hear me say it UNK she's UNK now and she was pretty UNK then wasn't she
erm n i as i say i couldn't see her the bed it was it was a UNK and
you did have a chance to see her when you went back and she was standing by the bed with the light on
that is approximately what exactly the size and the height and everything else that julie was at that time isn't it
again i j only from the picture i'd say she is er wasn't that size
i'd no difficulty in lifting a single bed with covers underneath with one hand
from a erm a low position
yeah i appreciate that
what i'm going to suggest to you however is er a child of that size being covered by a UNK you really couldn't have missed if you bothered to look
again i showed all due diligence i could do in the situation
the bed appeared un made and for all UNK and purposes i didn't see her had i seen her erm the situation would have been very different
i'm very sorry and erm that this happened erm but i can't say any more than that
had i seen her it would have been totally different
i appreciate that constable
did UNK er constable have a shield
he did
let me make it absolutely clear i'm not suggesting er on behalf of julie that there was any UNK in your mind or anything
what i am suggesting is you knew there was an armed man in the flat you were worried he was under the bed and if only concern was to get that bed up and over to check he wasn't there you didn't bother to wait to get julie off it
no erm as i say i never saw her in there erm i looked under the bed saw nothing was there i just dropped it with one hand
if was going to be in that room in the vicinity of the bed presumably two places he could be under the UNK or under the bed
or in the cupboard
yes in the UNK i didn't know the cupboards were near the bed but yes in relation to the bed those two places would it have taken a fraction of a second to strip off the UNK to check what was under it
it would er but as i've already said the bed looked made er totally un slept in it looked as though it had just been made up from new and un slept in which is why i took that course of action
had it i seen that there was someone sleeping in the bed my course of action would have been otherwise
so by UNK in you mean very tidy
it was UNK down it didn't look as though anyone had slept in it or was sleeping in it
well er i put the suggestion to you that i just said
what i suggest is you realised you couldn't have failed to realise she was there but you were in too much of a hurry to get the bed up and check wasn't under there
no that isn't the case
very good
just one matter of information sir
he said it would have taken a fraction of a section to pull the UNK off
how long would it take you to fire a gun
fraction of a second and a few weeks earlier there was a similar incident with a child in a bed er and er all our minds were on that as well
yes and er it's been suggested the final thing that was suggested that you realised she was there
erm no i didn't realise she was there
yes
thank you very much erm i've no further questions my lord does your lordship any
no thank you very much
thank you
i give two more witnesses for the defence
well let's get on with it you've got one of them
i call mr please
could you take the book in your hand and repeat after me i swear by almighty god
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
that the evidence i shall give
will be the truth
will be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
thank you
mr your current your name and current rank and your station
i'm UNK er police constable in police and i'm currently stationed at police station
and in december of eighty nine what was your job
i was a member of the operational support unit stationed at
and how long had you been a firearms officer
eighteen months
and it can you confirm you went to through the sort of training described by sergeant
yes exactly the same
and did you attend a briefing in connection with a search on
yes i attended the briefing
and what time of the day was that
er quarter past five in the morning
and were you issued after that brief briefing with a weapon
i was issued after the immediately after the briefing i was issued with two weapons a revolver and a shot gun
and were you issued with any other equipment
immediately prior to the entry of the house the plans slightly changed and i was issued with the see shield and my shot gun was given to one of the other officers
i it is actually perhaps rather obvious you can't carry two guns and a shield
that's right and i've carried the see shield on operations before
you'd done you'd done it before
yes
so again did you shield man
yes
and you had one gun being a revolver
the revolver which was UNK with the strap over it
did you at any stage take the revolver out of the holster
no
and who was your partner in your group
p c
what do you understand p c about the use of force in these sort of operations
to use such force that is reasonable in the circumstances
can you remember where you were in the order of those people entering the flat
third
and where did you go
having followed p c and p c as he was at that time through the door i went immediately to the bedroom on the right hand side the second bedroom
and how close behind you was p c
actually touching
he couldn't remember can you remember whether the door was open or closed
i think it was closed
and what did you do
pushed it open as hard as i could
and again is it for the jury was it the same reason as p c did it
exactly the same to make sure there's nobody behind it and if there is they would be quickly located
did you look into the room
i UNK into the room got out of the doorway and the light was turned on i can't remember with whether i turned it on or whether p c turned it on
throughout this period were you looking round your shield or through the window
through the window don't look round the shield
and did you see anything through that
no
did you look at the bed
yes i was looking
did you see
everywhere that i could
did you see anyone in the bed
no
did p c then do anything
p c and myself went round to the side of the bed and p c lifted up the bed with one hand carrying the gun in his other hand
did you hear anything any human sounds at that stage
no
did you notice anything in the bed at that stage
no
after p c had done that what did you do
we then er continued the search of the cupboards went immediately from there across the hall way into the lounge UNK the lounge through the lounge into the kitchen UNK the kitchen through the kitchen into the bathroom
UNK the bathroom and then made my way to the door the exit door
ye a an after you'd done that did you remain at the exit door or did you come back into the
i was just going to the exit door when i saw the young girl s standing at the second bedroom crying
and when you saw her what did you think
i di i didn't know what to think
i didn't know where she'd come from i didn't know whether sh come from that room or whether she'd come from the main bedroom
did you say anything to her
yeah i put the shield up against the wall because i knew then that the whole house had been cleared and er bent down and asked her if she was alright
aha did she say anything to you
she said she was alright
did she look upset
oh she was definitely upset
and did you do anything more with her then
no
where did you go after speaking to the little girl
left the house left the flat
yes er p c if you could just wait there may be some more questions
yes you were coming into a small bedroom with a
yes
shield
that reaches down to the floor as i understand it
not quite my feet just above my feet obviously i've got to move and it it's more of a UNK a quick UNK movement
yes erm
it is quite heavy
did you stop do you stop just inside the door did you with the shield
i would have moved slightly to the right i w i was the first objective while you're looking is to get out of the door
yes and at the same time your colleague er constable is also UNK behind the shield
yes
and what you can see is a bed
yes
the other side of the room
presumably with room for somebody to hide underneath it
yes
now it must have been mustn't it a possibility if been there at all that he was hiding under that bed
yes
why did then didn't both you and your colleague advance behind the shield to the bed
why did he rather walk entirely UNK apart from the body UNK
no
it's not it's not just one movement
you go in get away from the door first then both of us go round
but you didn't both go to the bed with the shield that's my point
you pretty much stayed on the he advanced on the bed
well i'm sorry but i'm not a lot of use to him if i let him just walk away from the shield
i go with him he goes with me
well does it follow then that both of you went over to the bed that's what i'm getting at
yes
so both of you were standing
but then at some stage he had to move out from behind me to get the bed up
yes
now that's the stage that i want to get to
whereabouts in relation to w the bed was up against the wall wasn't it
no i didn't think it was
was it just free standing in the middle of the room or was it against the wall
as far as i can recall it was further away from the wall there was a space for somebody to walk between the wall and the bed it's not as shown in that photograph
so
there is more room between
could you walk all the way round it or
no it the head of the bed was up against the far wall the as you look in the room on the right
so you could have been standing you with your shield at this point with constable with you either on one side of the bed or at the bottom of the bed or on the other side of the bed where were you in fact standing
nearer the foot of the bed
foot of the bed nearer sorry nearer the foot of the at the side but near to the foot or does it
all i can say is in the region of the foot of the bed
you and mr
he then reaches out picks up the foot of the bed as he said and UNK it
i can't remember if it was the foot of the bed or the side of the bed
one or the other
must have been
at that point were both of you behind the shield or had he stepped out from behind
he would have had to have reached out
so he well i knew he'd have to reach out
yeah
but that's only putting his hand out without being UNK about it that's not as dangerous as being coming out entirely from behind the shield
which did he do
i can't i can't remember
and the bed was tipped
yes and then replaced on its legs
constable when he was giving evidence it only takes a second to fire a gun wasn't that the reason that the bed was tipped because it had to be checked quickly that wasn't underneath otherwise constable may might have got shot
no
what you've got to rea no what you got to realise is the most obvious place for somebody would be on the bed but we couldn't see anybody on the bed so the only other place is under the bed
well you say the most obvious place would be on the bed if i may UNK agree with you also there actually was a rather fat eleven year old girl on the bed
that's her evidence
i know that now
but the UNK wasn't stripped off
no
even though that was as you put it the obvious place for
they say a fraction of a second we don't have fractions of seconds to play about with
no
re examination of this witness
no thank you very much
now i believe you've got one more witness have you
one more my lord
but i'm afraid that i must ride because i'm not at my next appointment so
and the other witness is
w was the w p c came in after the armed officers went in
i see yes
well we'll hear her and then we'll complete the evidence at half past ten in the morning
the er jury are going to be given copies of these UNK cards are they
my lord certainly that's my proposition unless my learned friend has any objection on that
no seeing as though they've been produced i've said i all in favour of the jury seeing anything that's referred to and then there there's no mystery about it then
they can have a look at the UNK if they like as well
listen in to everything which is
oh right
said
if i can get you to UNK your signature and today's date which is the twenty fifth on there
right is your signature UNK
ah could you print your name
it's just that she needs your name the fact that you're male th an approximate age within five years
that information
erm basically
oh right er twenty five plus
i don't know why people are a bit
UNK about their ages to be perfectly honest
you know
erm what is your job basically
you're a
well i suppose i'm a blind salesman
salesman
blind salesman that sounds good doesn't it
and fitter
i fit it as well
and fitter
right
so i have to make sure it's measured right
you can't blame anybody else for anything can you
okay that's lovely thanks very much
right
right it's not gonna
fall down on your plants
if you get the middle about the middle of it
dead in the middle yeah
or alive in the middle as they say
you want that supported
right
that is right thank you
with the lights UNK it's gonna be five o'clock in half an hour's time feed the dogs just before five and then see you see
i was a bit quicker in newark than i thought
it's a good place to be quicker in
delicate measurements
yeah well we don't want it UNK on your
the trouble is i'm quite sure that the UNK never did that
they just UNK it up don't they
yeah
there is a bit of difference actually
yeah
yes there is quite a bit of difference
well we realized that when we had the windows changed
yes i
mm
i haven't quite finished UNK i don't think that's gonna make a lot of difference is it to the
right i've got a range of prices
erm
essentially we need to know what you can do and what you can't do and
right
what's UNK we've never ever bought a blind
right
now what kind of colour were you looking for
white
white
it must be white
i don't think anything else is going to
er that's our reduced one
that would be sixty nine pounds
mhm
what are they made of
erm well they're usually
or doesn't that matter
well i a they're all UNK or
yeah
erm some are UNK
yeah
these are the UNK ones
mm
these are the most expensive
mhm
these have just come in the last year
bu i mean i'd only advise those if you have like er you know children with UNK hands and
or smokers
or UNK whatever yeah where it's gonna get really dirty
and we don't have children with UNK hands
no it's just you
well you see with those you can stick them in the washing machine
mm
and your UNK and you can iron them
right these are your UNK
erm i'll tell you how we price them
erm the higher up it goes the more expensive it is
mhm
mhm
mhm
with anything
that's a c you see that would one
mhm
erm that's an a that would be ninety eight ad so on
aha right
yeah
have a look
i quite like that sort of texture actually that's you know that's quite
oh yes that's quite nice that is
which is a d
yeah
mm
see it's quite nice but
we've got just a bit of sun
i can't see the difference between that one and the one that was
oh yes there is this is slightly closer UNK
mm
it just depends how difficult they are to UNK and that usually makes them you know more expensive
and if it's a difficult pattern
well we wanted something that you know wasn't just completely plain white that had got either
yeah
a bit of texture or a pit of pattern in it when the UNK shining through it
we've got some UNK as well that a few are quite sort of close to white
yeah
i mean if you're interested in one i'll take one out because
well
if you hold them up to the light then you see them
yes and then you see through that one's got a
you'll have to hold it up to
yeah
in front of that light then
mm
you can see it
mm
yes this is probably see them at night time
yeah
yes
yes
i quite like that one
which i think is the same
well on theirs i'm allowed to give you a discount i bring that down to a b the higher up you're going
yeah
i mean i can get a bit more off you see
right
so i can give you a b a b price for that one
it's difficult to say well i mean suppose with all of these the light the UNK is going to
mm
is gonna be UNK enough isn't it
mm
yeah
cos you can see
yes it's
see quite a bit through
mm
that one
well that would make
yes you can yes
but it's it would still
UNK
it would still you know erm stop the UNK from you know
mm
UNK your t v programs or something
yeah
or stopping it from UNK the furniture
yeah my main er our main problem is the
oh right yeah
carpet because this stuff does UNK rather
you're probably better off with something with a bit more texture to it then
mm
a bit UNK
more open UNK isn't it
UNK
i mean they will they will protect your furniture it's just that they'll take all the UNK then from the sun
mm
mm
i know white will probably d UNK a bit won't it
over
it's erm
a long period of time i mean we give a guarantee of two years on material
mm
and a ten year guarantee on the UNK
so
mm
if in the future you wanted just to change your UNK
yeah
you know you can do that
you can do it that way and it works out a lot cheaper
h how much do the UNK cost as a proportion
of the
erm i think it's about half
yeah
it's about half yeah
so you could you could replace the blind if you UNK and changed the colour
oh yeah
scheme or something like that for about half the price
yeah
it doesn't look like
yeah they don't call them other than UNK and white and
i'm assuming that the that when they're actually made when they're cut they are actually cut absolutely dead straight on the grain of the erm the UNK
yeah
or otherwise you know
no they're gonna be dead straight
er well it would be absolutely wouldn't they
yes
it's just that some of these of course the ones that have got like a square UNK
no you wouldn't get any sort
they'd look a bit funny if they were sort of
they would they would look weird if they weren't exactly
mm
oh no they'd be cut like you see them there
perfect yeah
if i got something and it wasn't
the price includes vat
yeah
includes the fitting
what's the waiting time
the weighting
wh
how long to wait
oh the waiting time
sorry i thought you were talking about the weights on the
oh no
erm it's two to three weeks
yeah
maximum
erm if it's if you're desperate for them we can rush it in
yeah
a bit quicker
mm
that one is not bad
it's slightly it's slightly i don't know i still like that one actually i mean w
there probably isn't no
that's liable to catch the dust a bit more than that i suppose
mm
well you've got to brush on the
when they yeah
as long as you do them fairly regularly you're not going to have any problems as far as erm
that's UNK and the other one you were looking at was UNK
mm
yes it yes it
no i still like that one actually
yeah
well it's you know it's up to you can look at whatever
i'd give you the discount on that as well
the UNK one was an e
no it was a it was an e i think
oh an e
i think it was an e
that would be a hundred and fifty two hundred and thirty eight
i'm not so keen on that much of a st i still prefer that
it's difficult isn't it when you've got a
well too much choice
bit of choice
is fatal isn't it
we've got UNK and we've got UNK and the expense what was the expensive one
UNK
you like that
yeah
UNK
it's just got some
yeah it wouldn't matter if it was cut slightly off square either would it
well it's not quite
and you get the UNK effect when you've
mm
when you've got them all up
yeah
oh they th
well of course you will won't you because you're gonna go right the way across
always assuming they match together
well no they wouldn't match together but that doesn't matter
erm might be a problem for you
no it wouldn't be a problem might be a problem for a my mother
er your mother yes
mm
mm
so what would that
well i'll drop that down to a c that'd be a hundred and fourteen
a hundred and fourteen
mm
cos that looks quite a nice one
mm
i want something really that's not absolutely completely dead plain
mm
well
because it's quite a bit window
yeah
i think mind you the rest of the walls everything else is white so
want something that's a bit interesting in your living room don't you
yeah
you know depending on what kind of UNK you have
but you've got white walls
yes
well i don't think we can go on any other sort of colour
mm
cos i think a big UNK of something that matched this would be awful really
well i was just i was just thinking if you had a UNK paper and then you had you're pattern in your
yeah
your blind as well
well yes i think we'll have to stick to white
i think that's
the background
mm
well we've got some sort of sorting out and thinking to do haven't we
yeah what about the erm oh what do you call the top bit of the rail
oh the rail
the erm
yes erm
wh which side do they go to the side
they actually go you can have them at either side
yeah
erm you can have your controls at either side the bunch going to either side
and you can
can you have it going from the middle
you can have the bunch splitting
cos it being a big window i think
yeah
it's better
i'll just tell you about if you have it splitting
mhm
erm the two middle UNK that come together will overlap slightly more than the others
yeah
right
so the shadow w when the UNK shining
you can see a slightly UNK one
becomes UNK er slightly larger
mm
that's the only er difference with those
but if er if it all going to one side i think it's going to be take up half the window won't it
i think it could be very heavy here wouldn't it
mm
look better going
it wouldn't quite take up it wouldn't take up half the window
wouldn't it
no
but a fair amount
it also depends if you have your windows open and you've got them each side and a bit of a wind they'll be flapping
yeah
mm
think about that as well
mm i still think the middle
you want it to open from the middle
yeah
it's this sense of proportion isn't it
no it's not really what i prefer
yes
right
and what about the UNK
presumably they're UNK
they're all UNK together
mm
with weights
and they go a hundred and eighty
yeah
degrees
that's right yeah
cos obviously that's quite necessary
mm yeah
the way the sun comes
which end do you want to have the controls
well it would have to be this end
you want the controls this end
no sorry same end as the other one same end yes the same end
yeah it's a bit more difficult to get in there isn't it
do you want to order now or do you want a quote
could you quote
probably the best is a quote
and then we'll
cos we've got one more person to talk to
right
yet
okey doke
if you can give us the two alternatives for the UNK one and the UNK
oh i'd better just er
so it's the UNK is the
that one
that one
the UNK is the preferred one
is the preferred one
and then there's the UNK
mm
and was it the UNK
no
just those two
just those two
i like the texture of that other one
which one
that well the
the UNK one
UNK one but er
yeah
you like the pattern of the UNK one
well no it's not that i just think it's the i don't know you can see through it more
yeah
i
is it mr
yeah
as in the flower
and the address again please
and your phone number
is
why am i saying all these
with the er white UNK or chocolate brown
white
white
white
that doesn't make any difference to price does it
no
what width are the are the UNK of the UNK
er they're five inch
yeah
these are three and a half so they'd be slightly longer
yeah
slightly wider
mhm
well i hope they will be slightly longer
yeah
right
you want it split
yeah
and you want it er controls on the
left
and the other one was UNK white
right i'll write this out again and if you decide to go ahead
yeah
then just cross the one out you don't want
okay
mhm
yeah
otherwise you get two
yeah
which could be quite fun
well you you'd have no problem with sun UNK then would you
no you're right dear
no
that would be
we already have a roller blind on the outside
i see
which is useful for taking the heat off the window itself in the summer
yeah
but it doesn't have any effect
it doesn't take the light off
i mean that's got a very open UNK texture
mm
ten right i'll let you fill that in when you're
okay yeah
it's a newark phone number yeah
right
there's a little bit more for you
competition on the toes
right i'll give you these
right
erm if you want to go ahead with it pull the top one off
yeah
pop it into one of these UNK envelopes
right
with the deposit in
and it'll be twenty pound deposit
twenty pounds
mm
yeah
and then as soon as our office gets that it'll be two to three weeks
right
that says plus thirty that's inclusive
no well i'll just put it on
thought i'd better ask
yes
thank you
and that'll be attached and when we come to fit it if you keep hold of the one you keep
yeah
you needn't sign that now
it looks a bit complicated but
no
no not really
got the idea
well that's marvellous thank you
i've been thinking about these blinds for such a long time
yeah
really just i mean a roller UNK just too the UNK too wide for a roller blind
and then at least you can see through while you're UNK the sun from that direction and then
that's right yeah
the other direction
seemed to be the answer
well thank you very much
yes you've got your measure
i've got my measure yeah
yeah
i've just well and truly broken mine you know i UNK the end of the
yeah
tape on the it went and did it again on me now and it's well and truly gone i'll have to buy another one
it was a nice idea
put this back
oh don't worry it's very it's very easy
there you go
they're all on rollers these days
oh right
right thank you very much indeed
hello there goes the phone
i'll answer it dear
right okay
how UNK we got
don't know what the reaction is
and they put theirs and whatever but if you do send something on a letter think
erm no
now this being about it being a permanent record could be positive or negative
yeah
yeah before you commit things to paper do be very careful make sure that it's not just because you're in a bad mood or something like that they can always come back and
it lacks the personal touch it lacks the personal touch which is why you never send your people letters saying you're fired or you know lost a job you always talk to them and it can be more expensive in terms of materials you use it's it is very expensive on UNK materials and cheap on time but it's a personal relationships that's the first thing okay that'll do so when do we use it
when do we use it
it is actually it is when we're in the office
oh
is it a job application
yeah
very important message that's what you're trying to say
like before the break when you want to have a permanent record of what you'd done so that you can't turn round and say well i don't remember them conversation
letters when erm copying of letters which do need a copy of what's been what's what permanent evidence what else
when you reply to somebody or send an acceptance or
when you reply to someone
yeah er okay
erm i'd cut out r s v p
okay erm yeah although normally you could do something like that while you can do that by phone you can call up and say yes we're coming definitely just to get in touch and say it
looking for two points not many can do at meetings as long as you pass it up there's two points two important points that we haven't talked about so far and there in the reasons why we do it they're in there somewhere
when you want to contact a lot of people
when st when staff can't all receive that information at the same time but they y'know they can read but they need the information but that can't all receive it UNK they as many staff many staff one more and the last one is one you like computer stuff like that where you've got a lot of detailed information you know that you want detailed information
such as this year's figures you know they're not paying you to somebody over the phone and expect to remember of course they can't so i've got the detail that i need to keep looking at and there about that's about it
they're the times when actually look at which ones we'd use remember the strengths in these some of the biggest yes you can go into greater detail you can see the reaction face to face you'll get feedback straight away verbal as well as non verbal er you know immediately what the answer is if there's if you're waiting for some sort of reply to it you'll have more effect because it's face to face erm cheap on material but it's expensive on time you don't have a formal written record and it can be very time consuming
the best times to use the personal the actual personal touch in talking to each other personal communication is when you give reward or praise matters of importance and urgency matters of complexity unpleasant matters personal matters or things like verbal UNK
okay
doing things communicating with people verbally can mean a lot more now sometimes with a lot of bureaucracy you can get UNK in to putting everything down on paper but it doesn't mean as much as it does when it's face to face communication
the strengths of using written communication is that it's on paper there's a record of course that can be a weakness sometimes be careful what you put down it means more you get hold of more than one person you've said it to more than one person who can be quite difficult to get hold of
okay
it can be read whenever it doesn't have to be read as soon as it's UNK received
you can make sure you can take time to make sure you get it right you get the information right gives you chance to UNK new ideas and put things in a different way until they have to be too many UNK
it can really be helpful if it's complicated and detailed information notice the difference between complicated and complex
complicated when it has to be written down to or detailed where there's a lot of information to be taken in and it's a lot easier if it's done that way because people can refer back to it all the time
the weaknesses are lack of security the time difference that it can bring if there's lots of replies going backwards and forwards erm it might get UNK it might never get read you don't know you can't be sure that people are actually reading the memo er you don't know what the reaction of the people is you can't go back on what you've said because it's on paper er and it lacks that personal touch can be expensive on time times to you but sorry erm but can be expensive not on time but on materials
important matters
okay can be used for important matters where you need a copy or a record of what's been done
it's useful when you've got to contact lots of staff or get information to many people at the same time and allows you to put detailed information down
well that's what i think what do you think
any comments
yes that's right no that's a load of rubbish
that's a good UNK
that's what huh
it wouldn't look very good if i gave you a great big UNK piece of paper now to tell you about communications
all i wanted you to do is put the highlights down it's all we need we need to know what the important things are okay just a quick breakdown of things we talked about
how many of you people do use a lot of written communications
how many never
not if i can avoid it
i mean is that because that because you've made that one of the things you want to do you want to avoid if possible or
well the only people that i actually need to write to are managers or agents and i mean i give them a print out of what i do every day
right
but i mean there's no reason for me to send them UNK
right
then know what i do the result is what i do i'm not doing my job they know
right okay
very rarely
not a lot cos you know in the department i've got it's ah we're in touch with all of the suppliers and all the sub contractors
right
erm and with agencies like inland revenue and customs and excise so a lot of the stuff we get in is written and we have to reply
okay
a lot of it's verbal
right
but it's erm an amount of written work that needs to be done
with ours it's a lot more telephone communication
okay
telephone so
i'd say mainly verbal just confirmation of orders
okay again i mean these are things that talk about confirmation i mean quite honestly i'm i'd be quite happy if we had offices where people talk to each other ninety per cent of the time rather than send UNK and UNK to each other and on the whole we are really talking about inside the office with the people who we work with i mean obviously clients as well trying to find something different we tend to find that it's very easy sometimes to make a phone call it's much easier to make a phone call and to talk to that person and give them the personal touch
really the only reason i could think of when it's you know it is important to put things on paper are really like the last three bits that we talked the last three things we talked about which detailed information would need to be there so people can read it when you know it's got to get to a lot people not all in the same place at the same time or when it's you need a copy
they're the only times really and as with the i b m the i b m people's the company i b m said if it's more than a page is it really worth sending it out
okay
gonna ask you to do an exercise now er it'll take us to four o'clock before we start talking about UNK what i'm gonna ask you to do is in one two three one two in two twos and a three i want you to put on paper one side one sheet of paper to sum up all the things we've done about communication so far today and it's going to other people on this course and it's going to be marked by one of them on this course
on the criteria we've been talking about today so find yourself a partner that you haven't worked with today somebody erm if you go in the same group that UNK in because then if it comes up to four o'clock kathy wants to go then you can be the other partner you've got half an hour to put on one sheet of paper clearly and UNK what we've done on communications
okay erm well if you go you go with erm neil and kathy then they can give you something different alright
you've got i'll give you twenty minutes and it's gotta be ready to be handed over to the other group in twenty minutes time
has just one of us gotta write it or
well we don't want no all we want is one so that at the end we want from each group to go to another group to be marked
that's UNK you hasn't it
that's one way of putting it
can we have some
erm
date
okay let me just i'm sorry
ah yes
have we just gotta list it have we
er
have we just gotta list
what've i just been talking about what did she say
you've gotta to do it so it's clear concise and puts across the information that you feel is important to get across
right
sorry you want some paper does anybody else want some paper
and you can speak loud because then it'll get recorded okay and then we can actually
expressing yourselves express yourself
erm
oh yeah oh yeah
yeah
paper gordon
he's going for it that's right
erm
oh yeah
yeah but you know
yeah
the set of circumstances described
yeah
said it was the minute or so
can we elaborate on that
erm the time the time i've given you seem to be quite busy another five minutes or less
five minutes five minutes that enough
okay five minutes
well it was there so i thought i'd bring it
i know you can't have it
huh
on to the ring road there
first roundabout i come to
yeah
well that's no problem
and then from there
even i can't get lost
famous last words
yeah
reactions
that'll be an area
should have been here this morning
i was coming so but um
yes i am but i don't being as far away as i am
yeah i mean i
yeah
west ham
oh dear
okay everybody seems as though they've finished right can you put your as i say team one team two team three please one two three
okay that's group three
you see just to prove i'm listening
that's for group one okay i'm not telling you who's doing whose right please mark it marks out of ten and i want you to be able to justify your marks
marks out of ten
okay just about it now okay gonna ask each group what marks they've given and why now it's not for the other team to justify it because it's all a subjective thing but the thing is we're hopefully marking them against the same criteria as everybody else because we've all been in the same place and listened to the same things and read the same things however now we know obviously it doesn't necessarily mean that everybody's taken in the same things
so let's just see how people have marked and what people see as the criteria
let's start with your group mark cos
yeah
right well we have given team two six
six fine
as we feel that they missed a fair bit out what they've written is very good but erm they've missed quite a bit out
so is it not detailed enough for you or
it is detailed alright but as i said what they've written is detailed enough but they've missed out erm various things that we needed to know
such as
such as er what we were trying to listen sorry what we were trying to talk erm with the person listening didn't listen er what we were trying to talk about
right okay that UNK more marks for that one but for missing that out
but kept on repeating themselves
okay so is repeated something being repeated and also something being missed out okay
any comments on that
group two
not really no
do you think it's fair comment
yeah
erm i think we felt slightly UNK in the timescale
okay
erm but er trying to get down as many points as we could in a way that you can express yourself but to show that you were
what was your priorities when you were doing that what were your priorities as far as was it to get it all down or was it just to get in down in a particular way what do you see as the priorities when you were talking about doing it
well to try and show that we'd covered we'd taken in as much of what was going on
okay
erm and trying to show that we'd understood it
right alright we say we do
ah group three well they got two it depends on what their criteria is if it's erm just listening a diary of events of what's gone on
right
then they got ten if it's showing an understanding of what was in that diary then we're give them four
good why only four
erm there's on certain parts of ah what they put has shown they they've understood what was in that part of the diary like in the exercises relating this morning to or to learning like with the roman UNK and the other thing they shown that they understood what was in that context but then on erm when you get later on it's just er
they've started off with it erm the report described what they've learnt but they haven't actually put what they've learnt
right okay
yeah it's
what they've done to learn it
right okay
you know on certain UNK it's like we've completed a questionnaire and then discussed it
right
they're not sure what they the discussion was really about
okay
whereas other parts they have gone into more detail which is ones they've gone into more details with
so what they've done is they've picked a way of doing but they kept UNK and changing the way they've been doing that all the time
any comments group three
yeah at the beginning was when sort of got twenty minutes left to do it erm we were fine there and i think it was the beginning part was and then we started UNK then like sort of after that you said oh do you want five minutes or more and we all sort of looked at each other you know and we didn't feel that we had enough time erm so we just sort of really
okay
and yeah we did forget the first paragraph of the of what we had learned so we just covered what we'd done really
could this be time pressure then
we also er actually what was meant to be on the course
yeah we weren't quite sure if that was what you wanted
yeah
yeah you know
before you mark it i did mark it
don't know what you were asking us to do we were a bit unsure of
in what way
well we really know whether you wanted us to put what we learned from the report what we'd actually done that day as in just listing it as you said like a diary
or
why didn't you ask
we were a bit
why didn't you ask
that's why we were UNK and changing because some of you'd say one thing
somebody that couple of times
well you could have asked you know
questions like that you can ask then
you know here we come down to very basic premise of communication
yeah
remember what we said the first thing to date you have to understand what you're trying to do
it's the same with written communication as well being clear and if you're not clear then make it clear
now really it's the same thing don't be afraid you can't be afraid to ask because if you're not clear in your own mind how the hell is the person who's trying to communicate with you going to be clear
so that's why well done at least it was a time question of course time pressure is supposed to be there it's not supposed to be nice and comfortable
a because we haven't got that much time and b because the little bit more pressure you're under the more likely to leave certain things out so maybe you've got the point
but you know you agree with the comments that came in there
yeah
UNK well done well done both groups okay and then i need your comments on this group over
yeah we gave them group two seven
seven
yeah
good okay
erm they've covered all the areas discussed but they didn't sort of UNK the areas of the ah like again something like this what we actually
okay
that's what we're really sure about that's why
erm like you we read the first passage and it was kind of what's all this about if you wasn't in the room and you didn't know what was being you haven't got a clue what was going on because it doesn't tell you but the rest of the sections that put down they do give a sort of brief analysis
so worth seven you reckon
well we was being a bit generous
like if you take them down to six
what were you trying to do
what were trying to me what were you trying to do
cover everything in the
cover everything that was your main priority was it
yep
okay and they did that do you think
they covered everything they to do that but they just if i'd have just read that without knowing what had happened you know i
well the middle group said that your one was
yeah
how does it compare to your one then how do you feel it UNK to your one
well we went we went into a bit more detail
bit more detail yeah more at the beginning
measured by the middle group's criteria they would've had three then would they
eh
we're not that cruel
no we're just looking at what criteria we're measuring
yeah
and you know this brings another important aspect up which is very important about communications erm you know we've UNK along talking about what communication is making sure people know you know what you want etcetera but also don't forget that different people can have different perceptions of the same things but as i say here we are we sat here we done we've done about an hour an hour and a half on written communications and yet you know when we passed the papers around it hasn't been too bad but there has been different things that people have gone for both in the writing of these reports and both in the marking of them as well
so you know what this is a measure of it's not a measure of anything it doesn't mean that one group's done better than the others it just means that's the way it's been measured the work that they've done has been measured by another group which isn't good or bad it's just hopefully picking out the important criteria and applying them to the work that we've done and the notes we've produced and the way we've marked other people's
now having said that different people might make take put the emphasis on different things
bear that in mind and also an important part of communications that's why there's always so many problems about which is right
everybody sees a different picture and of course most people see don't see it anyway because by the time they look and see what's happened it's already happened
right well done yeah fine no problems
have i
no leave it in you don't want any homework tonight
right
exhausted now anyway
sorry
if they don't turn up till eleven o'clock tomorrow
yeah
okay alright i want to move on now quarter past four now i want to talk about UNK
UNK always seems to be one of these subjects that really i don't why but it seems to get to get people talking about being aggressive about UNK about lots of different things and i think assertion perhaps is one thing that we need we need to clarify
before we do anything else
let me ask you a question
i'll give you a minute each write down what you think being assertive means
what does assertive being assertive mean
UNK done ya finished
all done
what do we mean what is assertive mean to you this is gonna be quite interesting i suspect
anybody want to start the ball rolling
erm it's how confident you are in yourself and the way that you actually put your point across
on the same lines as getting your point across and not being afraid to do it
your point across and not being afraid of doing it
okay
being afraid what sort of things scared ah what people might think or saying
good
i've got trousers on
right
getting your point across effectively yeah
getting your point across effectively
yeah
apart from being positive in putting your point across and erm being clear in things that you say things that you do being strong about it
clear and strong when you say strong what do you mean
or is it you know how can you be strong
making yourself understood clearly basically knowing what you're talking about
knowing what you knowing what you're talking about being clear okay yep
more or less on the same lines having a point of view and putting it across without UNK don't erm
cover your point
yes getting your UNK yeah
okay
yeah okay
having a point of view and putting it across to other people i think we've
and words are put clear and strong and i think i'd use the word UNK
UNK okay but the other bit you're happy with
oh yeah
great
what ya say
great
are you scared
erm the one thing that i thought was under person who is who is talking he's gotta be i think he's gotta be firm so that the person understands that erm that what is required but he's also gotta be fair at the same time hasn't he
than fair okay good what's a person like when they're being assertive
anybody else
right think of a time when you were assertive
when was a time when you were assertive just think you can be anything assertive over anything it doesn't matter think of a time when you feel you were being assertive anybody think of a time when they were being assertive
UNK cleaning the windows
a bit like all men
oh now here we go
right you be careful you're letting yourself in here
is gone
she's
that's being assertive
i can be a man
okay just think of a time when you were assertive and you all everybody think of a time when you were assertive can you think of a time anybody can't think of a time when they were assertive
you not gonna tell me even if they can now you know you're being non assertive
think of a time when you've been assertive it can assertive in the very slightest form it doesn't matter assertive of some sort
got a time
yeah
yes
great
i know i have been but i can't think of one at the moment
make it up make one up what would it be like if you were being assertive
alright we've got that time you were being assertive think of a time when you weren't assertive
think of a time when you weren't assertive just think of a time when you weren't assertive can you think of one
yeah
if you can't think of one make it up what's the difference what's the difference
well erm i wasn't being assertive i was a bit walked over
you let yourself get walked over okay
what made it what it feel as though you'd been walked over
well erm it's just a sense of ya know i couldn't care less it's yeah go on an do that i don't give a stuff
did it bother you
not at the time no it didn't it bothered me when it was done because i thought you've probably done something and the outcome would be that so at the time it didn't bother me because i wasn't interested in the situation
so is that being as you weren't being assertive at the time
yeah
not bothered
yeah i think what it does i mean because i had the change to alter the situation
okay
uh i wouldn't take the chance
so what's the difference between the two situations in you
in me
i dunno i felt like i let myself down
you feel like you let yourself down okay
i'd agree with that
you feel like you let yourself down what how would you say you let yourself down i don't mean to be specific but in what way did you let yourself down
erm i let the person do what they wanted to do and not what i wanted to do i just went along with what they said
okay you feel you let yourself down because of that
yeah it could've be done better
okay right
at the time i think when i wasn't being assertive and when i wasn't the difference was the person was younger than me and i was being assertive and then when i perhaps wasn't and like said you feel after that you've let yourself down
the person was older than me and he's a bit higher up the rank than me and it's all about it probably comes with experience he's to stand for yourself really but it's when you're our age and a bit younger you don't want to be seen to be UNK the boat if there's something that's going on that you don't agree with but you're asked to do something that you don't want to do valid reasons you haven't got the time or it's not really up to you to do it
right
those are the two
you'd have liked to have turned round and say look i don't wanna do it
yeah
it's difficult when you're a customer
yeah that's right
alright
erm with me i don't feel comfortable being assertive
what's the difference then
like
what's the difference what stops you being what stops you
it's not knowing who i can be assertive with
done it i don't think it comes naturally either i mean you have to work at it don't you
okay
ya know some people can
not coming naturally not being there you just sort of
no i find the other way
i find that i am assertive whereas at times i shouldn't be in fact most of the time i shouldn't be and i am
and i'm the opposite
okay you find it hard you find it hard to do to make a special effort what is it you have to make a special effort to do
to get aggressive
to get aggressive
yeah erm because it's not in my nature to be aggressive
alright
erm i find that when i'm not being as assertive er i'm not very good in a one to one situation thinking your answers back straight away
i can go away from a conversation and half an hour later i think i should have said that
right
erm where i am assertive it's where i'm working to a rule book i know those rules backwards and i want somebody to follow those to the letter
right
then i can say that goes in that holder you do that and i don't want any variation just do it
so you're very clear about what it is that you want
yeah
when you're clear about what it is that you want you can be assertive
yeah i can be assertive
when you're not too clear about it you find it difficult being assertive
that's it yeah
okay what's the difference between being assertive and not being assertive what's the big difference between the two
a matter of confidence
a matter of confidence okay
no i was just about to say confidence really i find it quite difficult to get assertive erm but when the situation does arise i suddenly get a gut feeling about it later
okay
whereas you look back at the end of the day and if you haven't done what you did you sort of feel like a bit down ah and you wish you had
being true to yourself
yeah go on
i mean is this being true to yourself and letting yourself down and you know not saying what you feel you should've said erm perhaps now i wanna talk about one area in particular and that is this thing about you know UNK it seems that most people look at things that disturb you either as UNK or aggressive
a lot of people tend to look at assertion as being aggressive there's a total difference
being aggressive is just as bad as being UNK it really is because people swing to one side you know it some people are very good at being aggressive and are very good at UNK in and getting their own way and just ju by being aggressive it's naturally aggressive
now the only problem with that is i sometimes look that these people i wonder are they really happy being aggressive all the time does that really make them feel happy
i don't think so really it's just the opposite problem of what we've got over here being UNK now we all know what being sub UNK yes we let people walk all over us we don't say yeah we listen to what everybody else says and therefore the opposite is you're gonna get aggressive to get what we want
they're both two sides of the same coin y'know being aggressive isn't what it's all about being aggressive certainly isn't what it's all about
what's the point of being aggressive with somebody when they're gonna walk away feeling as if they've just been walked all over so you've still got the same situation you've got one person walking away feeling a little bit fed up and the other person not so if you talk about UNK in terms of aggression and in terms of submission i e there's going to be a winner and there's going to be a UNK depending which way round you look at it then you still haven't quite UNK what we mean by UNK
you don't have to be aggressive to be assertive look at some of these comments we've got here how confident you are in yourself and how you put your point across
how you put your point across getting your point across and not being afraid of doing it doing it effectively putting the point across being positive in putting your point across so it's all about putting your point across effectively clearly UNK i e my body says what i mean
i don't have to shout i don't have to be aggressive or UNK people i just have to tell people what i feel think etc
does being assertive mean getting your own way
not necessarily
it never does it should never it should never be tied in with getting your own way
aggressive aggression might be tied it with getting your own but being assertive is not about getting your own way
being aggressive is about exactly what you put up here this is me this is how i feel about what we're talking about
this is what i think not just hiding away and saying get on with it you know get on with whatever you want to do no this is what i believe is what i believe that we're doing
it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna get it but it means that you're being true to yourself because you're putting your point across
and it's how you put that point across if you put it across and if the body language you use when you put it across and do you know what makes the biggest different the biggest difference about how you put it across the most important factor about how you put it across and what you're trying to do
any idea
we talked about it being clear being clear about what it is that you want
any situation with any person you need to be clear in your mind what you want before if there's any UNK if there's any way i'm not sure that will stop ya it's being sure being convinced of what you want is you know exactly what you want you know which direction you're going in
if you don't there's plenty of people out there that do and they'll walk right all over you to get what they want
so it's not about being aggressive it's not about being aggressive or UNK it's about being clear to true to yourself being aware of what you want from any given situation
just because you're assertive that doesn't mean you're gonna get everything that you want because you're not being assertive just means that other people are aware of what you want
being UNK is the co point where what happens when you're UNK you keep it inside you don't feel you're worthy enough or you haven't got you haven't got the self esteem to rate yourself as being able to have what it is that you want so you keep it inside and you don't say anything and then you walk away should've said this and should've said that and all it does is eat away at you and it does that to you physically as well i mean scientific tests are already showing now that physically these sort of things you do if often be UNK enough what that does it pretty much helps you to eat your body up from the inside and causes physical problems which pretty much do that anyway
because you keep it all inside it against you begin to feel bad about yourself you begin to lose your self esteem erm you know and that's the most dangerous thing about being bullied in terms of being at school or whether it's even at work and being UNK is withdraw UNK and to take it out on yourself
all this is you're going to take out on somebody else you take it out on yourself
the total is different opposite on the scale instead of all this stuff inside of you just let it build up and you let it build up until UNK and you throw it outside at other people and that itself that as well causes physical problems
apparently i mean i've read this but i don't know how there was actual references to it as well but apparently what they used to do run a test they used to do was they used to get people very angry take some blood from them put them inside of rats and it would kill the rats
when you get angry you pump all sorts of different chemicals around your body and they don't do your body any good that's for sure you know you get the UNK that starts making everything well making the blood move faster heart beat faster you get other chemicals ready and if those chemicals aren't used properly or if something doesn't happen and it uses those particular chemicals and they're left inside the body then that causes eventually physical illness in some sort of physical wearing of some sort or another so gradually just the opposite of this where you're not UNK your throwing it out but there's a hell of a lot in there that's been stored up there and bottled up there before it throws out and when you do tend to be aggressive it's not because you're being aggressive on purpose it's because it's just something that just happens and wells up when you get to a particular point and UNK out it comes
so you know there's the don't link aggression with assertion two difference
assertion you're clear about what you want you can't there's no need to get up about it there's no need to worry about it this is what you want and this is the way it is you don't have to shout you just have to stick to your point
exercise that you do in terms of assertion in terms of helping build people's assertion is what we call a broken record exercise okay where one person wants something and the other person is trying to change their minds okay you get it in conversation when people don't take you seriously and you've asked for something and they don't take you serious they try and avoid the point they try and change the subject
assertion comes into being when you still bring the conversation back this is what i want nothing else will do and bringing it right the way back all the time to discuss what it is why it's called a broken record exercise we'll give it a quick go now
what i want you to do is in your couples i want one of you to pretend that one of UNK got a UNK okay think about it before you do it
one of UNK got UNK and you want something done there is something that you want done and the other person is the person you want to do it or the person who's got a part to play
now this other person is trying to trying to change the conversation trying to take you away from what you're trying what you want done
what i want you to do as the person who's being assertive is to stick to the point
stick to the point even if it means you're acting like a bit of a broken record get that person make sure they hear what you're saying even if you have to repeat it over and over again
what i want you to practice doing is to try and get yourself saying over and over again regardless of how the other person tries to ask you questions to get you out of it and then swap over
okay what i ask you to do as with being assertive first of all be clear about what it is that you're going to try and do be clear about what it is and what the situation is explain it to the partner and then try it and let's see how it doing
okay working with anybody just for just for a few minutes each it's just because what i want you to experience is what it's like to continually go over the same thing i want you to experience that to continually stick to your guns just experience that okay
alright off you go
okay let's swap over what i want you to remember is it's not a conversation it's not the try not to get into a conversation what we're trying to do is we're trying to stick to one person's trying to stick to their point the other person's trying to take them off it okay
i want you to try and do that for as long as you can the person's who's trying to take them off it you try and take them off that point as long as you can the other person stick to your guns okay
swap it round then off you go again
okay
how did it go
erm difference
different
yeah because i mean it's not a real life situation
so i mean you can't talk the problem with me is i will always listen to the other person's point of view as
i found it difficult to keep going because of the hypothetical situation you know we were talking it about it early
yeah
the second time was better
right
again i was i was willing to listen to what you got and what was saying
okay
and i was
okay
have you got a problem with the
yeah erm yeah it was different erm with it only being role play it was a bit erm difficult to keep up with it sometimes and actually keep it going like erm if it was the real life situation outside right you'd know that the person you were talking to had more had been through that situation before
right
we used the situation of taking faulty goods back to a shop
right
so you the person you'd be talking to would be erm trying to put you off to stop you getting something a direct replacement
right
they'd be offering you a
okay i understand that
yeah it was difficult to get your what you need back because you always change what
erm okay
bear that in mind thank you
al although you you're trying to make the same but you do try and change tack a bit
right
erm word it a bit differently
right
but a when somebody when it's becoming apparent that somebody is i wouldn't say is not interested in your little complaint that you've got and that they're trying to change to subject it's difficult to keep them on it
right
but erm i felt er are the he did alright because he i don't think he was trying to change the subject he was trying to justify it
right
but er what had happened as opposed to trying people trying to get
right
but er but that was the only thing really it was difficult
okay it is difficult okay good
i agree it is it's very difficult to do when it's not in a real life situation
difficult to do when it's in a real life situation believe me it's harder to do in a real life situation than it is in a situation we've got
yeah but
harder but it might not be for you i dunno is it
er well i found it harder to do it
right
because you you're not actually talking about anything in particular
yeah
i mean you know if you were complaining about something or if you were asking for something you'd be asking for it because you knew what you wanted only as you said it's all about being clear about what you want
yes it is true
erm if like i mean for instance we weren't clear about what we were talking about
right okay
so there's a big difference
okay good point and that is that is a point that you need to be clear about what you want to role plays on as good as the real thing you know but then again sometimes you know sometimes i've listened to people saying well role plays are a bit harder than real life harder than real life why are we talking about being assertive now
you know yeah may be may be and it is difficult situations do it but i think some of the problem comes in that it's very difficult for us to stick with the point and hear ourselves say the same thing over and over again because it doesn't feel right how many how many of you didn't feel right doing what you were doing
how many of you
don't want to be UNK do you
that's right don't want to feel you don't want to be a pain
yeah
mm
and you carry on but sometimes it is the only way to do it stick with what you say and keep going
now yes there are times when other people give you arguments and will try and change it around and you know yes we will listen to them and will agree that but what we want to know is ultimately is what's going to be done about it
now what's gonna be done about the way we feel is anything gonna be done about it is the other person taking note of what way we feel and are they gonna do something about it or are they trying to dismiss it
and i think what we're trying to do is to see that we're being treated fairly just as we might listen to that person's argument as well
so it's not a case of just really being listened to it's not just a case of just being clear in terms of what you want by telling people what you want and then finding out if they're going to do it
so assertive is just being clear in what you want being prepared to keep going until you've got something along those lines rather than letting people dismiss you or make you feel as though they've dismissed you and your point not being considered i e your point not being heard or going away feeling that your point you didn't have a fair crack because you didn't give your point properly
it's just a case of being true to what you feel and being true to yourself giving yourself as good a chance as any of being heard
i've got a little graph up here now one thing about communication and with good communication what you can do is you can actually increase trust and co operation amongst people
you know if you communicate well with people what happens
trust increases because if you can talk to people openly and they talk to you openly and you're communicating then you're quite trusting with that person
if your communication is good and you can work together to increase that co operation and co operation gets better really puts us with trust and co operation puts us on a high scale
these are the two real components that we need from people everybody needs to get trust and co operation
if you trust somebody okay you're quite open to them they're quite open to you if you co operate you're flexible you're being flexible and you like to work together and what happens is if you've got low trust and low co operation with somebody well what you've got is really everybody both people or everybody involved being defensive constantly being UNK defensive if you don't trust somebody and you know you're not co operative you're constantly looking over your back what are they doing are they doing that's gonna mess something up you know what are they trying to do now
now here when you end up with a lot of having arguments and listening to a lot of arguments a lot of them are like win lose
as far as being listening to you talking today earlier on it seems to you set up in your minds a win lose situation i'll show that
that's a win lose you might've lost that time but you're gonna get it back another time
if we look at a relationship or any type of communication as a situation where somebody's going to win and somebody's going to lose there's not gonna be much chance of two people working together on that so what happens is somebody's got to lose
nobody wants to lose and if nobody wants to lose it means it gets UNK and it goes on for longer and it does takes a long time to resolve if it ever is and often to the UNK of one person to the success of another
you don't have to be win lose all the time because otherwise you're gonna have a battle
one person doesn't wanna lose and the other one wants to win and is going to go backwards and forwards you just end up pushing and pushing and pushing against each other UNK
but think about it any form of any form of problem that you have arguments that you have tend to tend to develop like that
you have up here you've got neither win lose but it's like it's a respectable thing you know you respect each other you don't trust them completely and you don't co operate completely but they just respect just not you're just not willing to go that further little bit and it becomes more of a more of a rather than a win lose or a win it's more of a people half and half okay i'll give this much if you give that much
now what's the word that i want it begins with a c i'll remember it tomorrow if you ever need to talk about it tomorrow
i haven't got it written down oh a compromise that's it yeah a compromise
both sides are willing to give something up okay
so nobody wins nobody loses anything and nobody really gets what they wanted out of it at the end anyway or not everything that they wanted
however there are ways of coming up to here we've got a lot of co operation a lot of trust and here you get what's called UNK new names have you heard that name before UNK
no i'll try to explain later on
basically it's two things coming together and becoming more than their whole you've got two things two people working together producing more than what two people can produce it's the relationship that produces that extra little bit more
UNK and what happens here there is no such thing as a lose you've got win
both parties can get something from that situation if you trust people and you look at things a relationship over a period of time rather than this particular thing this is what i want now this is what i'm gonna get rather than well okay i'll help you do this now and later on they'll help me do something else it becomes a win
now how you watch look at the relationship what your UNK like how much trust and how much you got co operation you've got will depend on what type of a relationship you have
that doesn't necessarily mean that everybody is going to have a win relationship all the time but why not go for it
what stops us from going for it nothing stops us from going for it
just because you're looking for win relationships all the time that doesn't mean that you're gonna get walked over all the time because by being assertive and by this is this is really what i want what is it that you want and looking listening to the other person's point of view as well as making sure your point of view goes across as well somewhere in all of that through all this down here there's a way of finding something for both people
if one person's aggressive and the other one's UNK win lose
we're not looking at that point of view we're looking at more like working together to find a solution
it takes a little bit of a little bit of maturity a little bit of communication skills and not everybody's got that
so who does the responsibility come down to in the end
it comes down to you us you can't blame the other person the other person's what the other is you've got no right to change that other person ever
that person is that person it's the way they are
the only person you've got a right to change is yourself
therefore if you've got a relationship with somebody and all you seem to constantly to be doing is constantly arguing and it's either i win or you win you're never gonna get out of that unless other time
if we look at a relationship or any type of UNK mean taking a bit of a different look at things thinking well what is it that this person wants from me and what is it that i want from this person
and when you can be clear about what it is you want and be clear what it is they want you've got more of a chance to get the solution to win rather than if you're just interested in your position and your side
any comments
any comments
no
right no
alright if it's so easy why don't we all do it what stops us
because you don't want to be the one to let go
to let go
it's a case of if i do what's gonna happen if the other person don't do it
right
i can trust
trust somebody's gonna do it somewhere otherwise it just UNK
but surely to if you've been working with your partner for a long time he's gonna it anyway
yeah i agree with that if you know somebody well especially if you know somebody well and if you work with people and you communicate with people you build up trust and if the UNK there and people are talking to each other and passing on information UNK going round and round UNK be there the only time trust UNK is when somebody feels somebody's keeping something back
not giving all of the information
when you work with people and you communicate you listen to what they say and you make sure you say what you need to say then that trust is there and that trust builds and it UNK trust and really that's what we've gotta be looking for in the work situation
the problem with the work situation is that sometimes we tend to settle in and there are you know there are people who it's very difficult to be trusted to be trusting with to be co operative with because we tend to feel that they're not the trusting or co operative type
maybe that's a mistake we've made and that's the way we've turned it round looking at people
maybe there are other ways and other ways of forming relationships without people getting to know that person or working with that person
maybe just listening
the onus is on nobody else it's on you
you know and there's no such thing as failure at the end of the day there's only results
so you know you might think well i just can't get on with him
well all that means is that you just haven't got on with him so far or you haven't quite found the right way to get on with that person yet
gonna stop there
i'll want you to think about that tonight i'm gonna hand out a few sheets that might explain a little bit of UNK erm i believe UNK this is my this is more of a sort of UNK view
now i'm not i like i like the thought of but i prefer the thought of in work and how people can work together using this type of thing and think about it in the context of work rather than in the context that it talks about erm and it'll be interesting to talk to you tomorrow so if to see what you think have the think about the things we've talked about
tomorrow we've got quite a lively day ahead of us erm by the time we do our group work tomorrow first thing in the morning and also tomorrow after that you'll be doing a role play as well using the things that you've picked up today and seeing how many of them you can practice and put into action what you talked about
fun day more fun than today and today i hope i've provided some of the ground work can't there's a lot of things i would've liked to have gone into more detail and generally i do but today there's just there's just not enough time in a day to do it
you know communications is a very big area there's a lot to be talked about erm certainly UNK and leading and things like that you asked for that we could've done a lot more with the type of language people use we could do a lot more with but when we've got a limited time we're gonna have to take a limited UNK and i hope that what we've done so far today you found useful and i hope when we put it into practice tomorrow maybe you can understand a little bit more of some of things that we've been talking about today
please have a think you know have a think about some of the things have a look out if you get out anywhere tonight watching people when they're together just watch them any ideas that you have tomorrow we'll start off with the first ten minutes just going over some of the things we talked about this evening
thanks very much for your time it's five o'clock have a nice evening and i'll see you in the morning
nine o'clock tomorrow okay the things that we've talked about you know the complete of the company worker and you're happy with those
oh yeah
okay thanks
i think in certain aspects as a team member it could be me er low in dominance i mean that certainly is me
right
erm i know it's easy to say but i was prepared to anyone says which is obviously you know what i'd be prepared to do
right
erm but i'm not the sort to sort of push meself forward in front of other people
right
try to put my views forward
okay
erm extrovert i don't quite know about that
alright the terms extrovert and UNK here i mean we've had two comments on those are used slightly different
extrovert doesn't necessarily
doesn't necessarily isn't necessarily you know the image the popular image of an extrovert which means you know somebody who's always the UNK noise at the party and always that's really slightly not quite right picture of an extrovert
or likewise an UNK doesn't necessarily mean it's a person who doesn't talk to anybody who keeps themselves to themselves and is a miserable it's not like that at all
what it basically means is that an extrovert tends to tends to have a wide area of interests but won't investigate them as much as perhaps that deeply and that includes friends as well and that includes people around them and they look at the UNK rather than the depth
UNK are more the other way round whereas they've got narrow interests narrow fields of interest but they look at them in depth
likewise with friends they've probably got fewer friends but the friends they have got are very close friends and they know them on a much deeper level
that's really the interpretation of extrovert and UNK and the fact that it can apply to you know being loud and UNK as an extrovert or being quiet and keeps to himself as an UNK that's more of a popular view which isn't the sort of thing we're trying to put across
it's more of the way that you see things
wide and not so deep for an extrovert very narrow very deep for an UNK that type of thing alright
so don't put too much emphasis on that
so you've probably got a wide amount of interests
yeah
but you don't got you might not have one that you go into specifically in too much detail
not particularly no
alright
okay like friends probably got a lot of friends
yeah
and then maybe only one or two or three other interests you got you go to into very deeply the rest are just sort of friends
yeah that's
okay well that's extrovert so we in that particular instance
alright did that make it make it a little bit better
yeah
okay good
i agree with the a
i'll jump into things first and yeah and get bored half way through somebody else
um could be worked out
yeah speaking about it because i do like to
okay
the chairman
okay well don't worry don't worry he can't you know just think of something though having said that if you look at the role that you played in the group moving towards the chairman's style taking over the group perhaps becoming and you weren't a person that sort of took over and forced your views on everybody but you were certainly up there at the front with and listening to people taking information and UNK everything that you had to fit what was coming in from everybody so that does show chairman's skills chairman UNK
yes it was UNK though
well perhaps in the future that it might be one thing that you might want to lift up and develop as time goes on well done mate
is it is it
i mean there there's very heavily team worker isn't it
yeah
a person that would like to share their with everybody
that's a classic team worker
to me yeah
that's a team worker alright okay
now having said all this you know let's not identify with these too much like the that's me you know okay it gives you an UNK an idea of your in of your stance where what sort of attitude philosophy and UNK you prefer to have within a group okay and if you match those back to what we saw in the group erm then it's not surprising that the group got on so well together and you know we didn't have too much conflict with the amount of team workers involved because nobody in there wanted to upset anybody else in the team
you know that's really why we've got so many team workers isn't it
and i mean i put an UNK down there to say that's what i thought was going to come out quite heavily simply because this is the case on these courses you know the people that we get on these courses every single one of these that we've had and we must have had coming up to what over ten now every single one we've had people that the most the majority of people have had team work very high on the score
i wonder if it's something to do with the job that you do or the people you have to work with i don't know but that's generally the tendency of people in these groups team workers come out quite highly
let's go through all the different bits and see why i mean all these all these type of things would indicate a different type of person different types of personality
company worker and team worker are very similar except the team worker is more of a person that's interested in the other people within that team whereas the company UNK more interested in the organisation of the company itself
you know so it's six of one and half a dozen of the other really but the company worker UNK to be the guidelines the rules the UNK of the company and er also really backs up the company line you know and what they're doing for them really is for the company
big quite a big priority there so and you know are obviously people that like them like the guidelines that come with the company like the ideas of belonging to the company and like the ideas of actually UNK the virtues of the company and following the company policy
ah chairman
chairman's the person that can sit in with the group of people and is good in terms of receiving information from people and UNK information and giving it back out again making sure that everybody's being brought in so he's a person really not so much a leader but he will be a person who can keep the group together and can make sure that all the information flows around the group and that everybody's getting a fair say a fair crack of the whip in terms of what's going on in terms of UNK towards a task so everything's towards a task you need towards a task
the chairman will make sure that it stays going in that direction and everybody works together rather than against each other so you got a high score there you know and as we saw in the you might not think you've got those chairman's skills but then what you did in the group where you were quite a central part of what was going on perhaps indicates that these can be developed
okay
UNK
well UNK are the people that say this way chaps you know no
says this way and the trouble is if you get two or three UNK in a group the group sort of starts going mm an
mm
in different directions erm we very fine UNK in this in these sessions
i've had two or three i think very rarely do we find them and UNK tend to go out on a limb they tend to want to lead they tend to want to control they want people to follow their way they do tend to be the people that dig in and say you know this is the way we do it
hence if you have a few UNK you might have noticed the UNK in the group discussion that we had because there'll be people digging in and saying no this is the right way to do it
no i'm right and you're wrong and you can tell very clearly when you have a UNK within a group
one UNK in a group isn't too bad more than one UNK in a group you start having a few problems
the plant is not somebody that sits there and grows
the plant is somebody that comes up with ideas constantly
ideas everywhere ideas all the time what am i do this what about this how about this
some of them are absolute rubbish some of them are very good
but the plant can't work in a group unless they have in order to evaluate or you know or other people sharing other people listening to those ideas and saying what was that idea again
how could we use this what are the benefits of doing this or the disadvantages of doing this so that you've got people within the group who could as a plant and know what to do with those ideas he comes up with them or she comes up with them don't know what to do with them just comes up it's up to the rest of the group and monitor evaluate you know the person that's always putting things that never work
to do it no that'll never do it erm constantly they need
but those people even those these people have their necessary place because otherwise the whole group would UNK go on and do everything they decide to do without somebody sitting and saying wait a minute why are we actually doing this
so the UNK important because the plant has the ideas
plants need to be UNK they need to be looked after and they need to be made they need to know that they come out with id with their ideas
otherwise if they sit there and be quiet you lose a hell of a lot of ideas from that one person
and the ideas need to be caught they need to be done something with by the rest of the group
resource investigator resource investigator got a phone stuck to his ear
you know you want something he knows where to get it
you know you need some information resource investigator can either give it to you because he's got it or can find it for you
the resource investigator can like a team that's always looking outside of a group to try and find the information necessary outside of the group for the rest of the group
so he'll go out and bring information into the group from various different sources
he'll find the sources from one of his various contacts
he's probably got a lot of contacts along the way for anything you want you ask him okay
he's the man
so and again resource investigator is the person that you pack out to br to gather the information for the rest of the team the vital information for the rest of the team
i mean you came quite high in that i would imagine that's something you quite enjoy doing
you're into facts and figures and knowing people and knowing where to get
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's resource investigator
monitor UNK they can usually make themselves the UNK of the group because everybody thinks they're so bloody negative
pessimistic boring old UNK i think
but you know having said that they are there for a reason and the reason they are there for is if the group didn't have somebody to pull them back down again then they'd might be going off in all different directions doing all these wonderful things and ending up nowhere because you haven't had somebody who pulls them back and says well hold on a minute
if you're gonna do this have you thought of this and what about this and how does this work
they help you monitor those ideas and what's going on
usually very pessimistic and always look always look on the on the pessimistic side of things you know all that sort of stuff but you know they are a very important part of the group you know given their space to be like they are you know don't take them too seriously remember their job is to criticise and their job is to pull things to pieces
team worker i really want to make sure that the whole team as people work together well that everybody's happy such is the comment is everybody happy he wants to make sure that everybody as individuals is getting on well there's no stresses or pressures through individuals individual relationships he tries to keep things smooth within the team
UNK well if you want something done give it to the UNK
other people that have UNK in UNK is people like secretaries
because they always end up having to tidy all the knots tidy everything up and finish things off
and these are people like you say have got pride in finishing things off you know there's a lot of people within groups who don't mind starting things off but don't fancy finishing them
you know start off and then they'll drag and it needs that UNK to actually get that close it down and say right that's done off it goes
and finally the expert again we spoke about that a good example really is in the computer world where you have individuals who get on really well with computers and UNK but put them in a group and they really don't provide any in fact if anything they take away from the group
their presence is a UNK in the group because they're not willing to add to the group you know you've got to have this attitude if you're in a group well the attitude you need to help the group is how can i help that group
and not i shouldn't be here i really don't know what i should be saying i really haven't got as much knowledge as everybody else that doesn't matter if you're in a group it doesn't matter what you know and what you don't know there's still things going on within that group that you can contribute to
the group you don't have to be an expert on something to contribute to the group
you can question other people other people might have that knowledge and you can question and clarify and form in your mind the ideas that you need and maybe put them to the group as a group
so we need people with different personalities and different types to be within that within any group for a group to be very successful you need some sort of share of the different types of group if you had a UNK of UNK you'd get nowhere
if you had a UNK of company workers where everybody run around following the rules well there'd be nobody else to do anything else
erm chairman UNK you need one or two UNK so you can actually pull the whole thing together and keep the group together
plant we'll you've got to have your UNK from somewhere your ideas have got to come from somewhere that's the plant
resource investigators the information the group needs to work on has got to come from outside somewhere and resource investigators bring it in
monitor UNK to actually check and to give you the pessimistic side of everything to break everything down why it won't work why this should be done why that should be done instead
team worker to make sure everybody's working together and happy
UNK finishes UNK because at the end of the day that job has got to be finished off
so everybody plays a specific role
now if there's only three or four or five people in the group you'll probably find that people who works there their strengths and if there's anything missing in a group then sometimes in a good group other people come up
take over those particular aspects where they haven't got people to fill those needs
so in a group you don't need one of everybody you could have just half of these but everybody could fall in maybe two roles within that group
but you do need the different personalities to come within a group to make a group successful
it takes different people different styles who like to do different things to different meanings to be part of the rest
so whenever you see people who're not quite like you and maybe there's something about their UNK that you don't like think about it this way
there is something that those people contribute to the group as a whole
the important thing is to make sure that those people that have got those particular skills are given those roles to be able to perform that role perform use those skills
if they're not it's a waste of a skill
bear that in mind
any comments any questions
any observations
bear in mind you've got all the information there you know what you are what yourselves and remember that just because these are the scores you got today that doesn't mean that is what you are it means they are probably the UNK that you've got at the moment
but that doesn't mean to say that you can for example you could become build up these chairman skills that you've got okay
you can work on those and you can build them up in two or three or four year's time job changes this might take a bit more of a higher priority
so therefore your team worker might come down a little bit score just to add on to your chairman's skills
likewise you look at any of the other scores that we had fairly high up for example you rate your plant it's a possibility there that you've got you know you've got these ideas that you're not putting forward that you could do and develop that side of
so just because you've got those it doesn't mean that's what you are and that's the way you're always going to be it'll change and it'll change as time goes on it change as your role changes
it'll change as you get older erm you won't necessarily just have that all the time we used to run these courses for students who had just come out of college and they were joining their company to work for the first time and we used to do this and we used to find that many of the people who had just taken out the job for the first time had very flat scores
coming from college a lot of them used to work in groups but a lot of them had worked more individually and they had very flat scores i e everything was quite equal and they didn't have anything coming through okay
probably because they hadn't re used they got there by two or three or four years time when they came on to the next level of management the junior management erm we did this with them again and you would begin to find certain skills had evolved and certain team strengths had arisen because they do change over the years
bear in mind what strengths you've got what strengths you'd like to have and if you know that you know what to improve and how to improve how to develop those other areas that you'd like
okay
useful
interesting
good remember that when you go back into a how many people actually do work with other people where they work where they work
yep
one
from outside
okay right as well as inside the company
yeah
but more outside the company
ah inside mainly
right
i work with a lot of different people we've all got individual jobs that tie up with each other 's jobs
how many people
well i'm actually in my own office but it joins on to another office
right
and there are three other people in there that
right
to do with my job
okay
yeah well it but ah similar to contracts personally
mr chairman ladies and gentlemen
we're all aware that for th for their number patients with UNK bladder cancer provide an enormous amount of our workload and for reasons partly of UNK our precious resources and also because lots of these patients come up with negative checks reducing the amount of UNK and upset to them it would be useful if we could do less than we do
many people have looked at this before and they've come up with various UNK some of which are extremely complicated
but perhaps the erm the simplest erm UNK routes were suggested by the m r c working parties which general UNK which was mentioned in the last presentation
they combined erm the four hundred and fifty odd erm four hundred and seventeen sorry patients in er several m r c studies and looked at them from the point of view of erm UNK for UNK and they came up with two factors which UNK were more important than the others
the first one was the result of the three month check cystoscopy either positive or negative and the second one the number of tumours at presentation either single or multiple
and from these two factors you can erm form three UNK routes
a low risk route will have a single tumour at diagnosis and a negative three month cystoscopy
an intermediate risk group with multiple tumours at diagnosis or a positive three month cystoscopy
and a high risk group multiple tumours at diagnosis and a positive three month cystoscopy
the suggested UNK for these patients were as follows
the low risk category one patients would go straight onto annual check cystoscopy following the first three month check
the intermediate risk group would have a three monthly cystoscopy for a year and then go onto six monthly for a further year and then annual thereafter
and the high risk group would have three monthly check UNK for two years and then go onto annual check UNK
any patient who UNK after the three month check cystoscopy is UNK going back to the beginning and they may be UNK to one of the o one or other of the groups erm depending on that
one of the criticisms or possible criticisms of the m r c figures was that these were all patients who had been entered into UNK bladder cancer studies and they don't therefore re represent all because people are selected to go into the trial and perhaps they are lower risk patients than others and in fact i believe that the recurrence rate in the m r c studies are lower than you would expect for er UNK bladder cancer in general
and so we did a sort of what if analysis looking a at the impact of implementing erm these er UNK categories on our patients
now this was a retrospective analysis bit it was done on UNK recorded information
hundred and fifty nine patients all come as presenting with UNK cell UNK of the blood and they all have UNK follow up date for more than twelve months following the first check cystoscopy
you'll see that there is a mix er of grades and stages and because it's the real world erm in some of the tumours a precise t category was not erm decided by the UNK
again a mix of single and multiple tumours
when you look at er the arrangement of these patients in the UNK groups you'll see that the information from the er the number of tumours at presentation and the result of the three month check cystoscopy is quite independent of grade and stage
er there's no well there looks to be a trend towards higher grade er in category three patients an and again more er more t one tumours
i the differences are not UNK significant
now this is a sort of cost benefit analysis based on what would have happened if we'd followed these UNK ourselves
you'll see that the majority of patients fall into the low risk group with progressively smaller numbers in the intermediate and high risk group
erm four patients erm fro from the group overall subsequently developed cancer
if we look at the actual numbers of UNK performed you will you see that there were the vast majority of work was done in the lower and intermediate risk group patients er and the positive er cystoscopy rate erm was much lower in the lower risk group as you would expect than in the higher risk group
if we had followed the m r c UNK er the numbers er would have been much smaller in the lower risk group and erm the erm there was more effort placed in the high risk group than erm there would have been we actually did
and a as a result of that our positive cystoscopy rate was more comparable across the three groups than it was previously
you can only say what's
what this a doctor in this policy would have done in terms of UNK diagnosis in the lower risk group patients because clearly the other groups of patients are actually having more UNK performed but because it's a retrospective analysis you cannot say that you are UNK the diagnosis of er of more frequently occurring tumours
there were thirty tumours from patients that had their diagnosis delayed by a mean of four months
if we followed the rules er the m r c rules strictly one of the lower risk group of patients was a g three p t one tumour and that patient er progressed and in fact all the patients who progressed all the four out of the hundred and fifty nine patients who progressed erm from the total group had either g two or g three p t one tumours at diagnosis and i think there's a very strong case for making these a totally separate group of patients erm for follow up
that just shows UNK what the change in the workload would have been
this is our actual workload and this is what it would have happened if we'd followed the m r c er UNK
there would actually be a two percent increase in the number of UNK done but the work would have be been much better targeted er than we actually we actually did
so in conclusion adoption of the m r c follow up follow up policy would have resulted in targeting of UNK follow up to higher risk group patients a two percent increase in the UNK resources required and delayed diagnosis of tumour progression in one patient and as i've said i think that g three p t one tumours should be excluded from er this type of protocol
perhaps other uses of er this type of erm protocol would be to use
flexible UNK er flexible check cystoscopy early in the lower risk group patients and perhaps give the intermediate and higher risk group patients UNK
thank you
er i think it would be useful to have er mr back and we could er discuss both of these papers together
questions
microphone number one
p k from lincoln
a question to both the speakers
do you consider the smoker as a high risk group and do you change your attitude in checking them
erm i think it j just adds a little bit of complexity t to it
i think trying to keep something very simple erm you know a simple rule for everyone to follow and all that following this protocol requires is that er that the UNK is at least partially sighted
it doesn't depend on a UNK or any oth other information
yes i i'd agree
i think if you've got a UNK or well differentiated tumour and i it's UNK and it's small and they're clear at three months tell them to stop smoking by all means
can i just ask you both er are you UNK to modify the standard follow up er cystoscopy for g three tumours and for t one tumours or is it just for the g three t one
i think steve you were you were suggesting that it was only the g three t one
erm well all the patients who pr progressed had either g two or g three p t one tumours at diagnosis
they seemed to be a very high risk group of patients
right and a g three p t a
erm well there quite a few of those and none of them progressed
microphone three
chelmsford
if i come to you at three months with a p t a tumour that's grade one or two how long would you be er willing to accept that i should have a recurrence before you treat it
how
but you sorry a g two
a g one
g one
p t a tumour
how soon should i get it treated
does it matter
i think it probably it probably doesn't
i mean the r the risk of progression is i would think is UNK erm and erm you're only talking about changes in size not risk of erm muscle invasion and i think therefore
so if it's not causing me any symptoms i should
no what i'm say what i'm saying is that leaving it for a few months probably isn't going to do you any harm
i mean clearly it will continue to grow and therefore any that you do will be will be greater
the longer you leave it
i do think answer for that one er erm i'm not aware of any paper that's published presenting that and we came as close as we could to answering that but nobody really knows for sure
erm okay first things first can i just have your full name please
sarah
is that
erm and your date of birth please
and your address
yeah
and are you on the phone there
no
okay just so i can assess whether i can give you reduced cost advice under the legal aid system are you working at all at the moment
do you receive income support
okay what we'll do then is get you to sign this form here we call it a green form fairly obviously from its colour and that means that i can do up to erm about eighty six pounds worth of er a bit more depending on what we have to do and you don't have to pay us anything towards that
i take it as you are on income support you've got no savings at all
no
okay could you sign that for me please down the bottom there
right what can we do for you
i was advised by a policeman custody advice
okay
er can you give me the name of the father of the child
alan
alan
and his address
and the child's name
ricky
r i c k i
y
okay
no middle name
alan
and his date of birth
er and does he suffer from any serious illness or disability
no
right er custody no longer exists it's called something else
erm what you apply for if it goes to court is what's called a residence order and what you would probably know as access
yeah
is known as contact
okay all the rules changed er UNK about a year ago now
s are you having problems at the moment with the father
well erm when i was living with him
yeah
he assaulted me a f few times and the last time he did it i involved the police and he was in court last thursday and he was found guilty of assault
and that's the only time i've seen him since boxing day last year
convicted last thursday
yeah
what happened to him do you know
erm got fined a hundred and ninety six pounds and has got to pay me fifty pound compensation
apart from that you separated in december ninety two
mm
erm did you say boxing day
yeah
that's the last time he saw ricky as well
he's never been in contact
erm are you expecting a problem from him
that's why i was advised to come and do this
right what are you expecting to happen
well he doesn't know where i live at the but it came up in court that he was going to take me to court for access making it out as though it was my fault that he hadn't seen ricky i was stopping him from seeing ricky when it's his own fault
i've been told by numerous friends of his that he doesn't want anything to do with ricky at all that he's said
why do you think that he said to court he was gonna go for
i don't know it's just i think he's trying to make me out as a bad mother
did he ever use any violence on the child towards the child
well he's hit me while i've had my kid in my arms and quite a few times
he's never actually gone to harm ricky
does he work
no
have the child support agency had an interview with you yet because from april this year er they are pursuing all absent fathers for maintenance
yeah
even if he is not working they will want er i think it's two pounds twenty a week out of him
last i knew it was five pence a year
yes it's all changed
but the child support agency deal with that and courts don't deal with maintenance these days
mm
he has said if i do go for maintenance he'll deny that UNK his
there's nobody else it can be is there
okay this is erm an application for full legal aid so that we can deal with an application for residence
can you just sign that for me down the bottom there
i have to say i'm a little doubtful as to whether legal aid will be granted because the courts now take the view that if there's no contest between you and him as to who's going to look after the child then they won't make a court order
they will only make a court order if there are major problems
erm for instance if he's asking for the child to go to live with him and you oppose that then court would make a decision as to where the child s should live
er in terms of contact they will also make a decision giving days and times of contact if it can't be worked out between the two of you
mm
er but otherwise it won't interfere
it'll leave it to you er both to make any arrangements on contact
i take it from what you say that you don't want him to see the child
well
no not really because he's a heavy UNK
aha
and when he's been drinking he's very violent
and i definitely don't want him to have him at weekends because that's when he's at his worst
he plays football as well
he's got a daughter from a previous relationship and he used to have her at weekends and he used to leave her all the time so he could go and play football and go out drinking
the name of that child
rachel
rachel what
okay
there's two things we can do
we can either that's the wrong way to phrase it
we can either do nothing erm and just wait and see whether he com comes back to you and says i want access contact to er to ricky erm in which case we can then do something about it
erm or we can make application for legal aid to go to court for a residence and contact order now
the disadvantage of doing that to my mind is it simply UNK him into doing something
mm
it may be that what he's said in court is purely something to get back at you and he doesn't really mean it
well i was advised to do this because m my dad's a policeman
yeah
and he thinks because i've he's pleaded had to plead guilty in court
yeah
that's he's gonna come back at me cos like i've got one over him
right
and he thinks he's gonna come back at me somehow
i think on balance i mi i my advice is that we do nothing just wait and see if whether he contacts you at all
mm
erm firstly because as i say it may prompt him into doing something if we write to him saying you're making an application to court yourself
erm he may then decide well i'm gonna do something about it
erm and secondly because a court won't interfere if th if er there's no need to
mm
no need to protect the child
you have all the rights as a mother
you have what's called parental responsibility
erm he has nothing at all because he's never been married to you
so the only way in which he can have any rights at all to ricky apart from you agreeing is to go to court himself erm and i'm inclined just to say lets see what he does
if he does make an application to court then at that stage we can er we can oppose his application
mm
erm it may be that what he said in court was purely UNK
er i what i don't want to do is to prompt him into
yeah
taking some action himself
now if he does come round and creates a nuisance
he doesn't know where i live
well
the only way he can contact me is through my grandma or my mum
mm well if he finds out where you are or even if he visits relatives and starts making threats saying he's gonna get you or he's er assault you or he's gonna hurt the child anything like that then er the first thing obviously is to contact the police to warn him off and secondly contact me cos we'll then be able to apply for an UNK to stop him coming anywhere near you
mm
that stage hasn't been reached you see because you've not seen him since boxing day
apart from last year
right so i think really i've said about everything i need to say
er you follow the follow my argument
yeah
erm i think we'll just wait and see what he does
if he starts creating harassment for you let us know and we'll stop him
okay then
okay
right thanks
thank you very much
bye
bye
bye
the er gentleman said yes approved yesterday mr
good yes they nor they normally let you know there and then the
right
the outcome i mean it's very rare that we do get a refusal
yes
it was rather UNK actually because he said er you must now go and make an appointment to see mr and i said well actually we already ha
we already have
he said i'll catch him out on this one
yes sometimes when we get people that are anxious to start immediately you know we make the
of course
interview there and then even before
mhm
we've actually got the letter back saying yes we can sign
yeah
you onto the scheme
right okay like schemes there is quite a bit of paper work to do
okay
so this is actually this first form here is an application for the scheme
yeah
so if you want to start sort of UNK
okay
away and if there are any particular queries on that you want to ask please do
in the meantime i shall complete one or two of the others
okay
in which case i will UNK this until the talking starts
one query only
yes
erm will my business have any links with another business
erm
in the context of the enterprise allowance scheme no
probably not
yeah
because i wondered wha to what extent those links were in that i shall have obviously informal links an and talks with other people who are doing similar things than what
yeah
i'm doing but they're not formal business links
no
so that'd no that that's quite alright
please check and make sure i've done things
yeah
i don't know who reads all these forms anyway but erm
well th they're there in case they're needed i think you see
yes that's it
and the government auditors actually sort of er come round
i UNK previous the word previous
word previous
in that
these are these are estimates
yes yeah it's basically a question there to ensure that people don't just put down that they're whatever they're doing just purely
UNK walking the streets for twenty four hours a week
yes
i it's to cover the other things like doing the book keeping
yes
doing the marketing and your advertising and general
yeah
UNK
it's not just purely
yeah
yes
well i haven't included the advertising of things in that
maybe i should
erm sole trader yes
previous employer yes
right
there will be
yeah
in that nottinghamshire county council was my previous employer
i've actually heard from them today
good
from the personnel department asking for details of what i was offering because the medical reports had now gone to the medical officer
they could see no reason why he would turn them down and they're setting the paperwork in motion to put
good right
me on the appropriate lists
so er that's coming
do we have any indications approximate percentage or
i've said to them that i'm prepared to work for them
obviously i'm limited by the terms of my erm pension situation
i've said i'd be prepared to work for between two and three days a week
right yeah
for them
yeah
i mean that need not necessarily be kept
i could undertake a whole week's worth and then
yeah
do nothing for a fortnight of course
it depends on demand
there's school holidays and
of course
yeah no that's okay
right
i mean they're all basically for different schools anyway but it just so
of course yes
happens they come under one education authority
it's a it's a rather a UNK thing as to who is actually your employer
that's right
yes i UNK i shall have to go and talk to the tax people i know about er the set up
yeah
right
fine
er this next form is basically one that we have to send to the benefit office
right
the d s
of course
the inland revenue and the tec office
right
i'll UNK this
you would need to be in touch with the benefit office UNK them
right yeah
that you are going onto the enterprise allowance scheme as from monday
i i've got all the necessary papers to do that
you have
it's just a question of i was waiting till we'd had
right
this meeting so that it was then
yeah fine
official
yeah
obviously
well this goes by UNK route and eventually will get to newark
yeah
erm basically we've just got here your name
okay
can i correct the spelling it's one
you know when i UNK
it's two in UNK and one in christian names i always think
i must admit on every form i've put the two and i thought UNK i'd better
it's a minor thing but er you know
on some of them i've just put john p i think
that's right yes well that's how i'm intending to trade
yes yeah
your national insurance number
that is correct
the type of er business you are setting up as a music teacher
right music teacher and supplier of musical services in fact yes
erm trading name
is just john p in fact
right
and the card that i'm going to do will be have john p you know erm teacher UNK
right yes
UNK or whatever it's i don't want to limit myself to just saying i'm a teacher other things as well
no fair enough yes that's very
the address business address is happens to be your home is
is correct yes
your home address and the enterprise allowance money will be paid from monday the twenty fourth of january nineteen ninety
right
UNK four right through to saturday the twenty first of january nineteen ninety five
got it yeah
the first payment due to you which will be UNK to your business bank account will be on week UNK the seventh of the february
which will be a fortnight after
yeah that's right
the actual start yes
i'll change that
the they were going to actually pay fifty pounds a week for a
yeah
shorter period then on a reducing scale
but the computer can't do it and so
unfortunately they'd already printed the forms
yes
and so but it it's back
oh i understood the eighty pounds a week anyway
yep
yeah
providing that the forms get down to the computer in london on time
mhm
then erm the first payment in some occasions is a cheque direct to you from the tec
i see
then when the cheques stop then check with your bank further two weeks
go straight to the bank
okay
if there are any queries on that you haven't erm received the money or anything just get back to us and er we'll
okay
we'll chase it up
i know where you are
yes
so that form we will send off to the various erm departments
right
right
this form here it's just a fairly short one i could you just tick the appropriate boxes for me
it's a bit of a market survey research
how did i hear about it
erm well i didn't actually hear about it i'd already known that sch that such schemes existed
right yeah
and it merely occurred to me actually i was sitting in the unemployment benefit office and i said to them er at one of my interviews
mm
probably i'd be better off going self employed wouldn't i and they said well in that case you'll need to talk to the chamber of commerce
right
so i suppose basically
yeah
the job centre
mhm
is that okay
yeah that'll do fine
erm i think i'd have my business later probably about six months
months six months
i'm glad you said that cos if too many people said they would have gone on started business without it they might drop the scheme
they might drop the scheme yes yeah
mm ah i suppose so
i object to these things actually on principal
i
i've refused to do them for notts county council on occasions
i could i could prefer not to say couldn't i
yeah you could have done
erm long term health problems or disability
yes
well
and no
retired on health grounds but i
well i mean we are yes we are aware of the
right so i will say no i don i don't have a long term one and no i'm not registered
for that one
thank you
right now this next form is the one that we need the bank details
which i just happen to have with me somewhere in here
i seem to have every form the inland revenue has ever published at the moment
ah to the back of the
in the bank manager's own handwriting
ah mm
i have to sign my life away to get these yellow forms
mm
secretary of state cos i mean in the wrong hands their worth each UNK worth two thousand and
of course yes
eight pounds
yes
so this one we have to be very careful with it
right the sort code
the sort code is
and the account number
is
UNK account number
and the account name is
is john p
john p
business account
right
which account er bank is it
there you are
UNK west
right
okay that's fine
erm industry code
i looked up that early earlier
fifty three
we have a big directory that we've got to put all these
oh i see
depending what type of business you're in
right when erm did you finish actually work with
on the thirty first of august
thirty first of august
last year
right
approximately how many weeks is that
erm hang on
september october november december erm we're talking about sixteen eighteen we're talking about twenty plus weeks twenty one weeks
twenty one weeks right
and in that time you were in receipt of benefit were you
yes
yes was it er do you know the weekly amount approximately
erm forty four something
well whatever it is the standard
yeah right
forty four
it to eighty nine pounds twenty something pence in total
so it's for just over
right
forty four
that's two and six
one two
right if you'll just erm check the details
if you want to just check the bank account cos we don't want the we don't want the money going to the wrong
okay yes that's important
close your zero there in case it looks like a six
o one ninety four
yes obviously that's the date isn't it o one ninety four
yes
i never appreciated that before
no
oh i knew that
one actually because our other erm accounts are rather similar
right
business yeah
i don't know oh yes
right
seventy two ninety four
yes that's the date of the first pay first payment
yes of course
your national insurance number
yeah
date of birth
erm
you're male
the industry code
that i've looked up
previous unemployed twenty one weeks
previous benefit level forty four
right
that's correct
signature of applicant
and the twentieth
UNK
one ninety four
right that's that out of the way
one there is a contract agreement here between you and the north UNK tec
right
erm there's nothing very sort of horrendous about it
if you just have a take a few moments to
have a read through it
the handout that they refer to here
have you read erm handout number one
it's one of these which i think did i give you initially
i have got a copy of here
that's it
yes
i've actually been through it as you will appreciate
a total of my own expense and ticked the appropriate bits UNK with them
fine yes so that actually refers to that
yes
particular account there
right
in which case i will pause this again
the only erm problem i had i think with the basic er terms as outlined in this document are the fact that i'm going to be wor erm intending to work for fif at least fifty of the fifty two weeks in the year at it when of course erm certainly as we'd already agreed on my erm business plan within the summer month from the end of july until the beginning of september
yes
it's highly unlikely i'm gonna get any business at all
right yes
in any case because of the nature of
yes
what is being offered
and the market that it's being offered to
yeah
er tha that's alright yes
i mean the UNK if you're sort of wanting to take any holiday or time
yeah
off i mean just keep yes
that's the time to do it yes
keep us informed and er
keep us informed yes
tha that's okay
do you want to know about occasional days or you you're presumably concerned with full periods
i mean it sometimes is that for instance we have a daughter in york and i have parents in london
yes
and sometimes we'll take a long weekend
it's really full periods
go friday to monday or something
yeah
like that
it's really if you're sort of gonna be away for a couple of weeks
yeah
anything longer than that erm it just depends really on the time of the erm your the time of the year or how many months you've
right
actually been on the scheme
for example we need to see you at
is it three six
er three months and at six months and then again at sort of the twelve months time
and then at fif
we're always still here and available
and eighteen i think isn't it as well
yes that's right
yes
so it's if it's coming up
yeah
to sort of three months and you
have to be away and we don't hear from you we think oh you naughty boy yes
you might get worried yes
we'll take him off the scheme because he hasn't replied to any of our correspondence
yes
so er
no i'll certainly keep you informed
no that's alright yeah fine
right this is the last form
this is my copy of the form
erm have you been s yes you've been signing on
i've been signing on UNK in fact
yeah
and it's been less than it's between six weeks and five months has it
it is it must be yes
erm ooh no hang on it's just over five months
right so that's six to twelve months
that's six to twelve months wasn't it yes
i must get my glasses changed
they must print their
yes
forms on slightly bigger pieces of paper i think
right
er do you have any long term health no
no
right here you have the opportunities to prefer not to say as to your colour
oh go on i've said it once so i'll do it again
right
it's just basically
right
basic details name and address telephone number
okay yeah
national insurance number date of birth
erm another code number form a directory
start date of going onto the scheme
that's today
the end date yeah
and forty pounds
a week and that's erm the code number for the for the tec
right
so sign and date that one
ninety four
that's it
that's it right
you're now UNK number o one six four two
that's great
one of those numbers to
i'll write it down on here
o one
o six o one six four two
six four two
right
not that i shall probably need it at all
right
well thank you very much
so that that's everything
now as i say erm the next formal sort of contact
mhm
that we will have will you with you will be in about three months time when
right
we'll er we'll want to see you
we normally on the first three months do it on a group basis
okay
but if you happen to have erm an urgent appointment or you're
mm
seeing a client on that particular morning
yep
then we can do it on a one to
how much notice do you tend to give of these
it's about a couple of weeks
right
yeah
erm but if
if it happens
yeah
you're saying well every wednesday morning or whenever
mm
it is that i have an appointment
mm
with a with a er client then we appreciate the business comes first
mm it may it may not be in that nature because the nature of supply teaching work of course is that
yes
there tends to be a phone call we're desperate
can you make it
can you make it in half an hour's time you know
yeah
it's a
should that occur
yeah
i mean
yeah
i think business
yeah
must come first before
exactly
yeah we UNK we appreciate that
erm
erm
now at that int er we we'll send you a er a couple of forms but UNK to complete but there's also the main thing that we're really looking f at is erm
how you're keeping
yes
up with that business plan
that's right
UNK filling in the UNK
right
of your erm your cash flow
well the actual book is already started and is sitting
good
up and running as it were and er i shall be i know already that some of these figures are UNK
yes
having had rather a nasty shock when i had the car serviced the other day
right
it needed new UNK and new UNK
yes unfortunately right
which didn't help matters
the travelling and UNK expenses for two hundred and seventy five
ooh the they will be double that
double that yes
i've just paid three hundred and eighty five over to a certain garage
yeah
and that was before we bought the petrol this morning
erm the form that comes out is different to this but you can use
right
put it in pencil in this one if you want and we so we
yeah
can on the day make a photocopy that's all
it's more of a management exercise to
of course
make sure that people are
yeah
controlling their businesses
mm
and their costs as opposed to actually erm
i've actually got a complete copy of all that
right
anyway having been
you UNK did you want the original back
erm
or erm
yes alright unless
yeah
you wanna keep it
we have got a copy as well so
oh i see
yes
well ha had i known i would have told you not to take a copy you see
that's alright
i i've been these routes before
yes
and i never give out documents that are going to be important without copying them first
no exactly
i mean sometimes people go to great lengths and trouble
mm
in getting a nice document together and they would
they would like to have it back and so
yes
we take usually just take a photocopy of everything
right
have you got the form for the i think the inland revenue
the tax man and it's a
erm what i
little green booklet called i r twenty eight
ah it's changed colour hasn't it
what i have i r
twenty eight
twenty eight
i think it'll be one of those
here we are
i r twenty eight
yes it's cha changed colour
the form is actually sitting in the centre
that's it
which is one of the two that i've got because the other one i've got to deal with is the self employed national insurance contributions
right
form as well of course
can i just take the numbers off those forms
you can indeed yes
we have no problem getting well that's we have no problems getting
yes
them from the inland revenue
they send us lists
right
of what's in everyone's
this came as part of a package
right
i rang hill house in mansfield
right
useful
how about it
i have another matter to talk with them actually about my wife's liability to class to contributions
there's a long outstanding erm discussion going on between us and newcastle
it's been going on for about seventeen months now and the in chief man at hill house was rather interested to hear that we'd not actually had it resolved yet and asked for the reference numbers and
newcastle were on the phone to us within twenty minutes of him putting his phone down
things now seem to be moving
good
to get these from
you can go UNK go down to local benefit office
mm
we can get a small you know quantity but to actually get
well thi this is a complete pack that comes and there's obviously erm from the information that was included with it erm here we are
erm they obviously run a check on what was actually in the pack
pack right
and whether you asked for anything else
yeah yes
and does it give an address or
i think it was nearly your area
mm
office of course
i haven't seen this new pack you know we
mm
i've had some of the old individual leaflets
they even give you an envelope for it
it's very charitable
it is really
that's a useful er you know a useful
it is
yeah
get some
it might be an idea to have a supply
mm
yes shall pay another call to our benefit office and say i want some of those nice UNK coloured
i suspect i suspect the local office probably won't because it was they when i rang them here in newark and i said look i'm about to go self employed
mm
oh we don't keep things like that it's where do you live
southwell
it's hill house mansfield
you've gotta apply there
lincoln
so from newark it's probably lincoln
yeah
isn't it
yes
yeah
normally that erm
southwell faces mansfield which rather gets us in the stick you see because we have to come here for benefit office interviews and things like that but you got to mansfield
for other things
that's right yeah
but most of the people who come here for interviews goes to lincoln
yeah
and er with my son particularly earlier on in his career things were going round and round in circles and in the end i had to step in at one point grab all the papers as they came past as they were and saying come on
cos one office was playing the other office off against each other
yes yeah
it was quite amazing
fine
so that's
i'm looking forward to this
virtually everything
good
as i say we'll be in touch with you in that three months time
right
but if in any reason you know you wanted to come and have a discussion or there was a problem or
er there's anything
things are looking clearer now than they did you know a few weeks ago
yeah
fine great
and so i think
i'm looking forward to
possibilities are definitely there
mm
i can start advertising myself now
right certainly
and i'm hoping that the local authority will start coming across with a bit of work for me
good
how long did the interview last at the tec
was it a fair was it an in and out quickly or
erm fifteen minutes
fifteen minutes right yes
yes
most of which time we talked about organs
i can play you the er recording of the interview
right
if you like
it's on the front of this tape
but no i'd better not had i
no
confidentiality
yes
that's er
yes alright
yes a very nice gentleman
yes it was john
john yes
right yes
they do occasionally change them around
yeah
erm and some people that we send out sort of tend to be there for either half an hour and others sort of
it possibly depends on the nature of what you're intending
yes
to set up
i mean my application essentially i should think was one of the simplest
yes
that could possibly be
there's no stuck movements and
mm
things like that involved
no i mean we do send the business plan up prior to the to the
of course yes
but even so i think some
yeah
of the ones yes
they look at it when the client comes in
rather than
i mean we did have
yes
one which must have been probably about so thick
right
and i can't UNK the chap reading that in a
no
and UNK it and er they just want to make sure
mm
that the person there is er
actually did write the plan
yes
and knows what they're about yes
but even but even in that case we did have er did have a case with a young a UNK lad who his accountant had written it
oh
was very UNK
yes
financial projection side was fine you know
right
full of cash flow charts and budgets for three years projected profit and loss and all
but the written part was only very UNK
mm
on erm one side of a four and it was obviously wasn't written by a young man
right
and erm the they di did pass him but
oh
they did obviously have to ask him a lot more questions
yes
so hence the interview
yes
lasted quite a period of time because they wanted to make sure that he knew what he was doing and everything
right
was you know factual within the in the written part
i must say i've also been er you know very impressed and er learnt quite a lot just attending these courses that you've got running here
yes
it helps to put things that you already knew back in focus
yes
and remind you of some of the other things that you didn't
mm
yes so i at one time to get onto the to apply for the enterprise
mm
allowance scheme one had to attend a mandatory seven day start your own business course
right
yes i realized this
this was when they first started wasn't it
that's right which was run two days a week for over for three and a half weeks
right
then produce a business plan and the UNK go for the interview which looking sort of month six weeks
yes
before you could actually get onto the scheme
but here in newark because we don't have sufficient numbers coming through
no
we tend to do it all on a one to one basis
right
and have a back up of the you know the individual days sort of
then in a position
yes
to use your judgement as to whether you say to somebody yeah you must finish this before i'm gonna consider you or
yes
yeah okay we'll put your name forward but it would be nice if you attended
mm
but before it was a mandatory seven day course regardless of that person's expertise or you know qualifications
might have been their own company life before they
yes exactly
went unemployed and then decided to take advantage
yeah i mean we do get people who come in on the sort of the friday morning and they've already got their done their business perhaps sought out professional advice elsewhere
yeah
they just really need a d discussion with somebody local get some a bit of extra information
and sign on
but to make that person go through a seven day course and wait a month
is nonsense so it is a much more flexible now
because we don't have the sufficient numbers and can't keep people waiting for courses we tend to have these do it on a one to one basis which you get i don't know
i think from generally from courses are quite good because you do learn something and you're
oh yes
meeting other people in similar circumstances and no matter how much you tend to know you'll learn and feed off each other
mm
whereas one to one it's just you and that particular you know business
i've been most UNK of the erm clarity and UNK of 's set out
she's very
she she's a born teacher
mm
should i think the tax erm UNK private tax advice gain is the is the education with her
mm
she she's absolutely excellent
yes
we always get er you know very good erm sort of report back er from the courses that she runs yeah
yes
i think it's a difficult subject er in one where somebody's starting up own business who hasn't erm had any experience before
mm
that you know book keeping finance and taxation i it's
mm
a UNK in a wilderness
it's a bit of a headache isn't it yes
and something that one can be quite erm fearful of
i'm rather lucky in a way
i've a father in law who was er for a long time in charge of the erm er financial side of the p a y e side of the er national dental estimates board in UNK in sussex
mm
and he knows these things
he could he's still good enough to stand in erm sainsburys alongside the till and add up the prices as they go through
yeah
yes
and reach the same total at the end
yes
or argue when his total doesn't match hers
yes
and he's always right
mm
does he do that as a matter of practice when he goes shopping
oh yes
he just stands there and does it
mm
click
i can tell you what it's gonna be
mm
and it is
amazing yeah
he worries me
yes
lesser UNK need these things like
yeah
UNK to er
makes you very lazy i think
oh i think so
it's rather interesting at the erm book keeping course last wednesday i did it all without using a calculator because the examples essentially were quite simple
mm
basic arithmetic
yeah
er everybody else used UNK and i was first finished every time
mm
now that can't be because i was that much better at maths because i'm not i mean
mm
musicians can only count up to four
beyond that they it's UNK of twos and threes
yes yeah
i'm no i'm no speed merchant as far as maths is concerned
mm
at all
mm
i think you can get UNK down in the button pushing and making mistakes
yes
i must admit i
maths wasn't one of my strong subjects at school and er i rely very heavily on it to
mm
but even sometimes when the calculator is not immediately available and you start adding up the finger er the figures
yes
i it's getting slower
yes
unless you're doing it
i st i have to use my fingers these days to carry forward the
yes
the er the tens and all this
yes
kind of thing
well i'd better get out of your hair
fine
okay well my next UNK
thank you very much for this
actually cancelled
that was the telephone call
ah
get down and do some paperwork
thanks very much indeed
pleasure
right mr gordon i think the room is now as full as it can get so we'll kick off today's proceedings er could you start by introducing your team for the record
yes of course it will be a pleasure
i'm jack gordon i'm director general of aircraft one with the ministry of defence
i'm the project manager for the united kingdom er for the eurofighter two thousand project at the international level i also chair the n e f m o board of directors
on my left is mr william perry who's the director of finance and UNK air one in the UNK executive
on my right is mr er nick evans who's the head of resources and programmes air and on my extreme right group captain granville white who's deputy director operational requirements air four
right thank you very much mr gordon
er can i just say at the outset that some of the material we'll be covering this morning may well be classified
yes
er when you feel that you can't answer our questions in open session if you could indicate that then we will go into closed session at the end of the morning and cover that ground in that way
understood
looking first of all then at the operational performance of the aircraft you have told us already in written answers that in the light of the changed security situation you have relaxed the eurofighter requirement
can you tell us an indication of how much the changes reduce operational capability in percentage terms
erm well perhaps before i answer that question mr chairman i could just briefly UNK across the programme and bring you up to date as to where we are and then we'll go directly on to that point
very briefly would
yes very brief
er well the committee will recall that shortly after it published its report in spring ninety two the new german minister of defence questioned whether the project was still required at that degree of UNK
for our part we had no doubt about the continuing need for an aircraft of eurofighter two UNK broad capabilities
this view was subsequently confirmed by a thorough review of the operation requirement which was carried out under the direction of the four UNK of defence staff
the review of the requirement and the options for meeting it er UNK in an agreement between the four ministers of defence in december ninety two to re UNK er the project
we provided a note to the committee in january ninety three about this
well re orientation of the project has involved a line by line review of the european staff requirement the e s r d to see whether it might be relaxed in the light of the changed international security situation
it also involves UNK the whole programme so that decisions on commitments to production can be deferred until nineteen ninety five with first deliveries to united kingdom and italy occurring in the year two thousand and to er spain and germany in two thousand and two
work by the UNK in the four UNK of defence and by the nato agency n a f m a to re UNK the project in line with the minister's directions is now at an advance stage
the revised european staff requirement document has been signed now by the four UNK of air staff this was done last month
a revised schedule for the development programme has now been agreed with industry and this will be taken into the contract
the four governments are also resolved to cap their financial UNK for this programme
so negotiations are in progress on revised prices for the development phase
these have taken somewhat longer than we anticipated but we are at last making good progress towards agreeing prices for the UNK contract and we are expecting to receive more acceptable price quotations from eurofighter very shortly for their part of the work
the changes to the programme also require a new memorandum understanding with our partners
the draft for this is almost complete but it can't be UNK until the costs of the revised programme have been agreed for each of the participating nations
all being well this new m o u will be ready for submission to ministers by the middle of this year
turning now to the development work itself in general the development work is going well
there have been no fundamental technical problems
there has been a very considerable delay to the first flight but this is now scheduled for april this year
the delay has been due mainly to the need to be absolutely certain about the integrity of the flight control system software before the aircraft takes to the air
while the delay to the start of the flying programme has been much longer than anyone would wish much more progress has been made in the ground and rig testing than at the comparable stage of any previous project i have been associated with and we are very satisfied indeed with the results that have been obtained so far
there is assessment in the wind UNK for example is complete and the results are good
the structural test programme is also making extremely good progress and the results from the engine test programme are ex very encouraging indeed
the performance of the engine on the bench already meets its full specification for thrust and fuel efficiency and even it UNK it slightly in some respects
so overall we remain very confident that the eurofighter two thousand will meet the full operational requirement
so now turning to the point which er i think you asked us to address
can we quantify or explain the areas in which we have made some relaxation and i'll ask group captain granville white to answer that
well the specific question i asked is whether you've UNK in percentage terms erm perhaps group captain you could give us an indication of how it has affected it
yes certainly yes
the point about er UNK and what impact it would have on its combat capability
i think the important point i'd like to make at the outset is that when the review of the requirement was carried out it was carried out both nationally and on a four nation basis the ministers once that was complete the ministers decided that and stated publicly in december ninety two that we will continue with the existing UNK and engine combination and that each nation er based on a family of aircraft concept could decide from a menu which UNK it would fit according to their individual requirements and their budget and we looked individually at each of the items to see what impact it would have on the operational capability if we were to remove them and what erm was decided in the end and the requirement reflects this was signed last month by the chief UNK staff is that some nations have decided to remove certain items of equipment but for the u k we felt that it was necessary to keep all the major items and therefore as far as the u k is erm impact on the operational requirement is concerned there is no significant alteration in its operational capability and therefore in overall percentage terms there is no decrease in the capability at all
now individual nations who've decided to do without a particular item of equipment clearly that will be developed into the aircraft and therefore they have the option to if they wish to d decide later on to fit it in
thank you
i'll i think at least four particular areas where the united kingdom has decided not to as it were take the full specification
er can we have a look at those or at least has accepted specific changes to those specifications
can we have a look at those four and if you could i'd be grateful if you can tell me what change in the security situation as envisaged by the government has led to our acceptance of those changes
now the first one which was mentioned by the minister in the r a f debate er is the reduced requirement to operate on damaged UNK
what change of perception in the security situation has led to our accepting that UNK of capability
yes the there are two aspects really to that one is the length of runway operating er and the other is the surface erm if i could take the first one
when the requirement was originally written erm and agreed in nineteen eighty seven all of the nations decided that erm we required a short take off and landing capability and that was based on the sort of the then cold war situation where the prospects of UNK and UNK being very severely damaged in a sort of central european type of scenario and therefore the possibility that there might be only very small operating strips available from those UNK and that was the basis for the particular length that was decided at the time
because of the changed security situation and that type of er conflict not being envisaged in the same way now what we felt was important was to be able to operate er apart from main operating bases but also from sort of general purpose erm strips flying clubs and those type of smaller UNK and therefore rather than looking at the damaged runway situation we looked at the smaller strips and took a length that we could sensibly operate from erm and took that as the UNK but clearly notwithstanding that there is the prospect of damaged UNK and therefore the slight relaxation would also apply to damaged UNK but perhaps damaged to a lesser extent
i think perhaps if i just add a point to that er although we have as four nations agreed on the revised requirement there i believe it's true to say that development has progressed to such an extent that probably we will have the original requirement in practice even though we've no longer specified it
that's very encouraging
for no extra charge
can we then look at the reduced engine thrust erm this presumably would have a significant impact on combat performance er why is there any change in the security situation that would warrant such a relaxation
yes the particular item that was deleted was known as the combat UNK facility which erm was really a trade off erm to provide extra thrust against the reduced life of the engine and clearly if one operates at the top end of the engine spectrum in er UNK conditions and higher er r p m then clearly the life of the engine will be reduced
now we had originally had this extra facility available er so that we could trade off life against the extra thrust in an emergency but there was clearly the possibility erm that might be used er when it really wasn't necessary and we would end up with extra costs extra life cycle costs shorter engine life and it was felt on balance that with a reduced threat overall that it was sensible to take out that facility and to accept a longer engine life but not there's no reduction in the total normal thrust but its merely its UNK combat facility
i it doesn't speak very highly if i may say so group captain for r a f discipline if what you're telling me and telling the committee that you think that pilots should be using this facility would be using this facility when they're ordered not to
no i wasn't suggesting that mr chairman
well why would it be used in circumstances when it was not needed otherwise
i was only thinking really of erm particularly extreme situations erm and i would expect it to be used for example in normal training or anything like that and er certainly all the studies show that the normal thrust full thrust that was available was sufficient to meet the threat and this extra capability really was a sort of an extra that was added in early on and really wasn't felt on any of the combat modelling to be necessary
i think i would actually like to pursue that point group captain but i think i'd rather pursue it in the closed session than an open session
now can we move on to the reduced quantities of role equipment
can you tell us what role equipment items have been deleted
yes it was not so much a UNK as er a reduction in the numbers because we were very UNK erm in going through the requirement erm and not making significant changes as far as the u k was concerned and we needed to make some savings in cost if at all possible and therefore we carried out a very comprehensive review of all the items of role equipment such as drop tanks er UNK release units and those type of things which had been UNK earmarked for a very high intensive and fairly long running conflict and it was felt that if we were to make some savings then it was a sensible balance to reduce those numbers on the basis that we could save some money in the programme but at the same time many of these items could be bought later on at relatively short notice clearly not within a conflict but in the years to come
on that point
