what it does and i think we're also dealing with a with a with a people like right and is probably UNK worse right who've never really had any sort of responsibility before and they not quite sure where the lines are drawn
and in a worse position than because the north they've never done any deals never seen anybody national accounts done nothing in that area in terms of deals and negotiations and things like that and it was only six months ago that where could actually find out he could do deals
i mean that's the worst scenario than the one you got into
oh yeah absolutely at least we were able
and what they do is all this typical UNK structures and UNK bloody this and that run like the fucking civil service
but we not UNK in this department we're flexible that's why these things are happening cos we turn our hands to whatever we believe is in the interests of the company
yes i know that
see what i mean
but it cuts across no there comes a point where the of this world say oh am i allowed to do this am i allowed to do that if you've been here for more than three years right and it's particularly UNK in scotland oh are we allowed to do that oh i didn't know and that's old that is old to a certain extent you know she's been around longer than has and been around but influenced by who's been around a long time you see that's where we get it you see we don't get the initiative coming in that area we get we get the oh christ bloody hell let's shove that one out the way that's a national account
you know
that's what happened over hadn't really dealt with big tour operators in the past and i think she got a bit nervous about it
well yeah
erm and ended up dealing with it but that's not to say she shouldn't deal with it erm she just got to be trained how to deal with it
she's put allocations on that list cos the other the other field sales people don't see why they can't get involved with the tour operator who wants an allocation
well we don't normally do allocations
i know
it's only on UNK that we've done it because that's what the market demands
we don't want pe i mean we don't want sales reps agreeing to allocations i mean at the moment we haven't got anybody to administer them it's being done by groups it's going to be a nightmare in a big way
well we've actually turned away i think that the best thing is that you er that the three er obviously there's
i think that's there's certain things implied from area and er and er there's misunderstanding coming from your area
i don't think it's misunderstanding
it is
total misunderstanding from area
they're not quite clear at all
i can hear that just in the last ten minutes
yeah i must admit
i mean i must admit i was talking to beforehand and not clear not sure on certain things
she's asked me
whose responsibility or whose supposed to be that is irrelevant it just needs to be cleared up
okay
all right moving on rapidly
before you do anything i'm gonna interrupt here tea coffee
which would you like
er black tea
i was gonna say same thing
a lot of these queries or some of it UNK from the fact that we're also conscious of the fact that we can't keep passing things to gary when he's only got one person
wants to go full time into erm groups and she's trying to do a one hundred and one different things
can we not say that we say if we don't have agreement by the thirty first of january we can take someone like who we've already identified who will do the job for the money and take at least one person on pending a decision on the salary increase
i think we've got to
because we need at least one person to do it it's go it's getting out of control now
i think we'll have to take a person internally
do you have sugar gary
well is the strongest internal candidate
sugar
yes please
well let's
do you see what i mean i don't want this to drag on and on
no well i know that and i know
even if i can get rid of the tour operators erm or put somebody like onto because we got up and running now and i haven't got anyone to deal with it
well i think your group selection thing with the internal candidates that's all gonna take time again isn't it
no that's what i'm saying we've identified one person who'll join us for the summer
if we don't get approval to increase the salary by the thirty first of january so i can have the two people i want can i appoint this lady and bring her on board cos i know she'll do a reasonable job in a certain area
well i think you've got to i mean
don't say no please because things aren't getting
no i agree with that i think you've got to yes we'll agree that and also hopefully by then we'll have clarity the clarity on the salary and then we'll get in there in which case you're laughing right
so we'll say deadline by thirty one january
if we don't get agreement we take on this lady from oxford
because internally we still haven't got anybody that UNK out have we
yet
that's why i would like to do a group assessment erm but yes long term
group assessment though is a luxury isn't it at the moment
i think for a day's er work it's worth assessing the three top people identified with the six outside people that i've identified who are you know in the next division down to see how they compare
i think we owe it to people like or at least to give them another crack at the whip to see if they've come on in that interim period cos it's a good six months since we interviewed
well i don't think we owe it to them we just delivered them a nice big salary and they've got more than enough work to do
i think we were in that situation six months ago i don't think we owe those three candidates anything now
well do you think
would you like to see them in against the outside candidates if we look at this
i think it's not very likely though is it christ almighty we're talking here about getting people on board to help you out the assessment are bit academic
right well if we haven't got the decision then by the thirty first of january you're agreed we can offer one job to from
yeah to do the leisure things
yep
alright
and then if we get agreement on a salary increase then we only have to pay it to one person
well we've only got one person to pay it to
well no we got two in the UNK we got this indian guy who was not coming for a second interview until we can say we'll pay him
well you don't know i mean you don't know you might say right twenty grand and then he might say oh no i've re considered i want twenty two and then he might say i'm not gonna turn up
he might turn up he might turn up and then say no sorry twenty grand forget it don't want to work for you anyway
it's all a bit UNK in the clouds
can i just make a point this thing about salary because i know we can't people we want at the salary and all the rest of it but then there's if we're go if that's the s if we're now saying that that's the salary for the job and there's no way in my conscience UNK clear really that we should just pay that to one person
it isn't it's not ideal i mean i've got a problem with
well he's happy
and i can't see any way out of it
well
i want the best people for the job and it if means i gotta pay one or two thousand more
but i'm not sure that's right i just i mean i spent three years
it's not right we know it's not right it's the fact that it's an UNK measure
we need staffing people in that area and she's an internal candidate that's come through she's done a good job right and now she's you know it's not right but at the moment it gets us over a q over a quick fix
you can always red circle that salary at a later date and hold her increases down against other people
there are all sorts of options
but as you say it may never happen anyway
anyone else think we should bother about that yet
no but it's all tied up with this role of national accounts
it's dragging on too long
yes a tricky issue but i think we've got to get to grips with it
well we can get to grips with it at this meeting when you talk amongst yourselves er as to how you divide up the base accounts yeah
but we can't get that meeting any earlier for you
no well as well as an issue
but there's people holding a shotgun to our heads saying yeah i'll come and do this job and i want x
we've been all through that we've got the salaries re graded and we don't pay a bad wage now
well not at national account level i've seen lots of people now and i'm sorry
we've let five people go who would have joined for another two grand
so we mis judged the grading of my people when we UNK the salaries
the evidence is there in UNK
we got it there or thereabouts for sales executives right the area development exec job but we didn't get it right we were two grand UNK quite clearly UNK evidence that we were two grand UNK on that pay and i've asked now to agree to UNK the pay level and if he does we might get some decent people and then we worry about the UNK of that afterwards yeah
but that's always the way it is in
yeah
you go for a quick short term fix right
yeah there are there is another quick another quick short term fix is promote people from within
good luck to them i'm not convinced in my own mind and i mean we've interviewed these people that there are people internally ready yet that's why i said perhaps we should
well what're you saying then what are you saying that are you saying that is now ready
in an ideal world of course they're not but i'm saying if you're looking for a quick fix then that's a quick fix
you say there's three candidates there who get one who is actually earning the money that we pay and two that aren't the quick fix is to say right we given you an opportunity to do this national accounts job at the same salary for six months see if you can do it and if you do it we confirm the salary
now that's a quick fix and hasn't cost anything hasn't put anybody's nose out of joint and
it has cost you
no it hasn't
you've lost all your back up a very high proportion of it on your own team
have i
sorry i thought you were talking about two
he says you've got one that would join at the money and can do the job
my top objective is to get on board because i believe she is the best person for the job
i've worked with her now for nearly two years and i think she'd do an excellent job
now she may accept if the salary is not confirmed a lower salary
i mean we've got to offer it to her and see what her ultimate decision is
she could be UNK we don't that do we for certain erm yes we have got one who will accept the salary yes we could take one from outside the field that's why i wanted this deadline so if we don't get the increase in salary by this date we can then start planning and take on board the second tier level
because there's no doubt i'll find somebody to do a field sales role
oh that's two a penny
well they're easier i'll find somebody easier
well it's easier to recruit at the lower level than it is the upper
yeah so i mean
but don't forget this is a very important time with the all the increase coming in they've got a UNK lot to take on not just learning the company but they got the new routes and everything and it's going to leave i would've thought very short in an exceptionally busy period
no more short than
i'd rather had the people i can survive with one person one person down
from the three that you've got
just moved from sales hasn't she
i i've put forward
i thought didn't want to do it anyway
due to location where she lives
do you think she wants to do it
yeah not UNK
yes
yes she very erm keen to give it a go
you see we've gone from paying these people twelve thousand to fourteen thousand to eighteen thousand
in six months do you
see what i mean you don't pay her that for six months you say to her right this is the score we will review this first july nineteen ninety four
would you pay her an interim amount
no we can't she's on trial
if she UNK the job she gets it if she can't she goes back to what she was doing
okay we'll give it until the end of january then
if we find we can't get an increase in salary
in fact you're in a stronger position now because then you can say she's not s she's not suitable and pass her back
well you're in a stronger position than if you take somebody on and find out six months later that they can't do it where you gonna put them
okay we wait until the end of the month and see if comes up with the salary and work along that basis
why is do we know why he's taking so long
who
he hasn't
he's not taken that long
i only asked him the other day
oh beg your pardon sorry i didn't realise
gone you see
yeah
i mean if this had all sort of come before left we'd have got it through no problem
right
unfortunately the bloke decided to leave too early
erm well one way or the other it's got the result
i'm quite happy to do that take and put on a six month's trial if we don't salaries through
well something's gonna be done
which is this
this is an outside candidate
oh beg your pardon i'm sorry i thought you said internal right
you see i must admit you see not i don't gonna do as good a job as
don't think she's gonna do as good a job and that would definitely make it
if we got internal candidates
well UNK gone under the bridge since then
yeah
UNK gone under the bridge since then be fair did not perform well there's no question about it and we have worked with her in the field erm she wasn't she wasn't brilliant
no she
she got a i think she got a bit of a shock you know she actually probably thought she was better than she was and a lot of people had been giving her a lot of UNK on the back and i tell you where half of that UNK from was down the corridor
and other various UNK who were sort of giving her UNK on the back and they were making all sorts of UNK noises about her weren't they erm UNK
somebody else did somebody else said something
yeah wasn't it
yeah that's right
saying oh what a great person you've got
totally UNK judgements yet again UNK the issue
she probably had a real great impression of herself right she did and then when she turns round and we said well i'm sorry and said well sorry no got a bloody big shock gave her a shock to the system and to be quite honest what i've seen of her since then has been a UNK sight more er UNK up and a bit more on the bloody ball than she was before
yep
witnessed at the tottenham UNK game and er
tottenham UNK game what else played a role in that is the two people going
yes
which is a nasty shock
shock for everybody
and the
and the course she was UNK on the course she was UNK on the course
yeah but she also that we a tough course
and she was very ill at the time was it
so i mean she's and i said to her when all the things were going wrong with i had to have a lot of UNK with her and said well you you've got to prove that you can UNK from this
yeah
you've just taken a knock you didn't get the job it's not to say a job won't come up again now what you gonna do give up or keep trying
and she's kept trying and that's what makes me think she's got
i got it here
but she's not i'm not saying she's hasn't got a lot to learn
yeah but she's only got as much to learn as the girl that girl
seventh of UNK
seventh of UNK
you can make a judgement after that if you're not impressed after the
have you worked with her in the field
with the greatest respect you can't actually cos you haven't worked with that many of them have you
but horses for courses you see there are not an option cos he won't move from scotland and there's not reason why he should do and so you can forget anybody north of forget anybody in area
if you don't think that the girl that you've interviewed is gonna do as good a job as
well it depends in which area
this girl's quite switched on the tour operator side
well she's worked she works for a tour operator she worked for a
she's worked in a number of different areas
she hasn't gone out and sold it though has she for one or two fairly decent names er
yeah well her travel experience is fairly late
yeah but i mean that's not necessarily an issue i mean what did she do for b m w cars
sold cars it's nothing like what we're doing
she's financing on cars
well it's nothing like it is it
well you see in an ideal situation of the six people i've got on the second list there's better quality people there but they've got absolutely zero experience but we're not the sort of company who can take these people on and train them really
i'd agree with there
so you know we're stuck between a rock and a hard place
yeah but at the end of the day is she is she better or worse than
yeah
i would've put them on the same level in all honesty
where do you put them then
i would go for every time better the devil you know for that reason alone really
in many ways i wish we'd taken on that girl now who we saw right at the very beginning with
fucking hell what
oh i don't think she was right either sorry old son
yeah you see but when i was seeing them one after the other tens and twenties you don't see the UNK you see
well i know i don't see
nobody's UNK you nobody's making i'm not making a criticism of her cos at the end of the day right if we now talking the scenario that we're painting now let's take this girl on not girl on right you can have cos she's far more impressive
you would have had if you played the scenario back take yourself back in time when we interviewed this bird you would have had well i would have had her
well i gotta say i
not in the UNK sense but you know what i mean
i was quick to snap her up before you changed your mind she wasn't right for national accounts at that time she'd been good in the groups role
yeah but you haven't got the right people now have you
he hasn't got anybody now
no what i'm saying is we'd have the right people if we pay more money that's the core of the problem
that's moving the flipping UNK isn't it
i think the thing you have to say that as far as i'm concerned from what i've see of her so far and i haven't worked with her in the field yet but far UNK in your department than that one we interviewed the other day
all i'm saying is i've got to have people i've got confidence in me because at the end of the day i'm responsible
well this right well i know that i know that
all i'm try we're only speaking from the best interests here speaking from the bloody heart rather than the head probably here but we do want th we do want the best but it's the old story it's UNK it up isn't it it's UNK it it's trying to fit a square pet into a role cos we pay crap money y'know
yeah if at the end of the day it's a quick fix then
yeah quick f if a the end of the day it's a quick fix we may as well take somebody we've got
yeah exactly cos at least they know the culture
culture they know what an agent looks like and they know what a tour operator looks like and they know and they know one or two other people around and so on and so forth
they also know what's expected of them
okay we'll set the deadline at thirty one january
right okay
do you want to dictate it to me
it was agreed that thirty one january would be set as a deadline for recruiting national account execs pending a salary review
are these national account or key account
key account
key account
thank you
right i'll just put national account execs key account execs right okay
alright well i think well i think actually well i know we've UNK on about it for half an hour but i think it's worth a discussion to be quite honest don't you
i know it is it's not exactly doing a lot for me either but er cos it gets raised every bloody management meeting but i think having discussed the matter we've actually opened ourselves out a few more options than we probably thought we had
yep
right
and i think that's
it'd be nice to have and say in together
well let's see you see at the end of the day will probably suit you better er cos she's quite mature isn't she for her age
yeah
that's just because she's married to an older man basically er she's i know it's a sweeping UNK but it is it is a fact that and she's more your type
what does that mean
well she's quiet and quite steady
well we have to be we have to be because erm
i know you do it's not don't get UNK old pal it's not a criticism
you do in account management is a different discipline than field sales
account management is a lot about files and backup and administration and sorting this out and sorting that out
yeah it is it's going out and doing the business as well but it's gotta have a lot more intellectual input er in you know in terms of having a having a greater insight into how a company works how an airline operates how the marketing department operates and so forth
why do you think i why do you think i gave you the fucking job eh
national accounts department
you know
would've UNK in that job
he'd be the first to admit it
i'm struggling in this one
you know it is you do need that quality people who have a bit of insight but got a lot of those
yeah
she's got a lot of those what what's the word
skills
not necessarily skills she's got a lot of those erm
disciplines
erm
do you think they've come on then since we interviewed here
cos it's sad in my opinion that going back to where we were several months ago because we set out to attracting higher quality people paying them more money and we've come back again to basically seeing the people who we saw in the first instance
yeah but time's have changed
things have changed since then
you've only gotta look in the back of the t g because there's now four pages of jobs compared to half a page
that's why all these people can now ask for more money
eighteen months ago they wouldn't have been asking for more money
they wouldn't have UNK
well you wouldn't have got and er when you did
no exactly no
you wouldn't get them now
you wouldn't get them today
wouldn't get them today no
tell you to stuff you know get UNK
i think i think we know where we're coming from there and i mean that's worthwhile
point six he says quickly what does that mean point six
point six means that wh just to remind you that when we had the sales conference we did promise these
yes i know i remember that that's what i thought it may be
i thought about it last night and i was laying awake all last night thinking about it
so was i
i think we i think the only way we can actually really do this is to pick one from area one from your area one from area and one from europe and just have er almost arbitrary er decision but justify it
fucking hell
we have to come to an arbitrary decision and then justify it
yes so it looks UNK
and i think what we should have is a fifth person which is an outstanding sales award or something like that which covers all regions cos in europe you UNK you wouldn't vote for any of them would you
i don't think there's any question about that
we'll make a case that he can't
we'll kick him in the UNK if he questions it
your area's got have one got have one erm and we have er one i think deserves something er i think erm one other person may be deserves something who that is god knows who
but i mean is gonna struggle cos he ain't had many people for very long has he
the only person he's had through the tr the UNK and UNK of the last year is and you wouldn't give her a
you wouldn't give her anything should have it
i don't see what's wrong with frankly she's been through it all and she's hung on in there
which is a very er
don't pre judge it has gotta decide you've gotta decide your area that's one north one south
europe well we could beat about the bush but there's not a single rep on the road that ever gets out the office so gotta win it cos i actually saw i actually we i actually saw her go out and see a customer so she must she must be er
she saw two with you
well she saw six with me right that's eight times more than any of the rest of them have seen so i mean that's er
that's not fair does a good job
yeah
so er is a waste of space so and he works he works for so er that's stuff it
you pick who you want but you gotta justify it and er and then so okay for arguments sake you pick say for arguments sake picks
is picked in er europe er that's three
er outstanding achievement award er UNK up title say er and then runner up to that or something like that or something like that yeah
yeah
i think that would be a good mix actually
and then you got five yeah
yep
well we promised them a week in UNK didn't we
how the UNK we'll get round that i don't know
what the five of them together UNK
no the five plus partners we said didn't we
plus partners yeah
and there could be one outstanding person of the year telephone sales which god knows i wouldn't wanna pick that
dear oh dear
who'd wanna pick that
i think they UNK drop res out of it
it's too complicated isn't it
can you image one sales agent getting a flipping prize like that mental there'd be a riot
so that was that point was it
yep
so let's say we award five categories shall i put that down
five categories of award for nineteen ninety three performance er awarded at sales conferences yeah
i actually think that i know it is more complicated and messy but i think that she should pick someone from res
i think you've got to keep er you've got to keep that momentum going because
yeah well i'll speak to about it by all means but i'm not quite sure how the hell she's gonna be able to do it
yeah
know it's difficult
no it's alright there might be a way i mean i could be wrong i could be wrong
i know it is more complicated and messy but i think that she should pick someone from res
i think you've got to keep er you've got to keep that momentum going because
yeah well i'll speak to about it by all means but i'm not quite sure how the hell she's gonna be able to do it
yeah
know it's difficult
no it's alright there might be a way i mean i could be wrong i could be wrong
right having put them under the banner clear banner of sales you know
yeah
to be excluded and then you know when all the UNK around there's no one there again
i'm sure that's gonna work against what you've been trying to do since you got here
you know maybe we pick someone from groups who've been doing a lot of good work lately perhaps or something or you know some something like that just er so they're not left out the frame
you're gonna want to support someone in groups aren't you
sorry
you're gonna want to support someone in groups with the changes coming on board know what i mean
alright let me speak separately to about that
what about er then
well the have agreed the contract
er i did bring it with me to give to but obviously i'll have to send it now
i've got the phone number er it's just a case now of er getting on and getting it advertised and marketing it but it's all been signed
is the UNK line
yeah
are we marketing it then
through all the literature the produce
not doing a brochure then huh
oh got to produce a few sheets of stuff and we've gotta get the addresses of the bases and get it distributed and it's a task i'm gonna pass on to
but the don't do their own brochure th
yeah they do services booking services yeah
we he's giving us free advertising in there for issue anyway
w where do they ring
what number do they ring
erm
i don't want the number where is it
norwich
oh it's in norwich is it
yeah they wanted to put it in norwich
well fair enough
i just hope she's got it right cos i've explained it all to her and sh
well to be quite honest i think the reason she wanted it in norwich was cos UNK over loaded as it was i think and they had to learn new skills and staff support and therefore it might not be a good idea to have them as well
right so that's fine so i've got the number i've got things signed they've got the rates can handle it you know she's all ready to go and get the advertising in and that should start
and when does that start then
well it's started really
what do you mean it's started
well at first of february
is it
yeah paper work's all been signed now
and what's it called leisure line or
yeah leisure line
alright okay
cash er cheque or credit card and then i said to you that's really some it's really a special market that leisure line
it's a special market
well no not once it's set up it runs itself doesn't it
well someone's gotta liaise with the someone's got to make sure that re erm res are up dated with rates
yeah but rates just get so whenever we up date those they just get the new rates
yeah but i mean someone's got to open it
they're not getting i t a flights they're getting for full fare aren't they
no UNK passengers
cor this looks a good deal
it is a good deal that's why
fucking hell is not as generous as that
i know it's not
full fare
is only flights ours isn't
what d'you mean it's flights
it's any flight thirty percent off our is off peak flights class
plus a ten pound booking fee
so i can't remember everything you know
ten quid booking fee i got out of them as well so it's better than
ten pound booking fee
yeah per booking not per passenger per booking
so they're gonna pay ten quid for booking
yeah
well UNK i'm k i've just had long had long memories of the
you've done well i think you so what has the said then is that a national account or is it
well i suppose ultimately it is if they use the yeah
they come in as a net fare operator
someone's gotta organise all the literature and the
oh well maybe you discuss that at your meeting on the second of february yeah cos er where that lies with i'm not bothered who it lies with to be quite honest er so what you're saying basically on point seven then is it's all UNK is it
yeah
yeah
open for business
open for business
cor i've heard that phrase before
it's only taken two years to
staff travel policy part eight erm well
made his comments about that
does anybody really want to have a UNK on the erm staff travel comment cos
cos had her UNK put this together brilliantly before he left
where is it then where's the
these documents i mean it deals with ev everything apart from the main things about
one of the big changes that they propose is that should be put on an exact par with within
not th not talking about travel on other carriers but within
the service charges well
UNK service charges for tickets er things like firm concessions god almighty erm who is going to decide whether UNK suits look quite smart
i put that
suggested that they be allowed as they can be quite smart
something from the seventies
dress
we should seriously look at UNK this rigid code of dress
some sports jackets and UNK suits are quite smart and these would be quite acceptable to the group of companies
what is not acceptable are jeans with holes in the knees etcetera
oh when we travel with other airlines you must UNK by the specific code of dress
you're gonna really cloud the issue if you if you s if you say UNK allowed
go on tell him what i said directors
yeah directors policy would be dealt with separately
this was in paper
entitlement for directors to be reviewed separately right it says here
as none of the directors are shareholders in the group right surely they are employees
yes they are
quite right
anyway it's a bit of a can of UNK that to be quite honest
i'll collect my p forty five later on
you should be so lucky
have you seen a pencil UNK in here
he's obsessed by pencil UNK this guy

final sales update
very quick erm for the new route to already got all his plates for UNK erm we're under negotiations with
to go in there
well we're trying for first of march
i don't know if UNK be ready because they've got to set up new bank accounts in norway and denmark and accounts with the credit card companies in both of the countries separately
erm as far as we're concerned we can get it under way
i'm seeing on tuesday to see how he wants to g us to go about it in norway
i think because we're going to have lack of erm UNK setup erm in either country
denmark is a priority
we'll almost certainly erm use the contractor over there the recognised contractor both for supplying and servicing all our planes
it's erm a modest cost
i'll do a complete costing on it but i think er the only thing is of course there are so few agents total
we're talking just under two hundred in denmark and just under three hundred in norway it may be cost effective for us to do it ourselves with initial distribution from stansted and maybe a local person doing any new UNK but i think in all honesty it will be as cheap for us
you see because does that
erm i think accounts are gonna be pushed f pushed for the first of march
UNK whether we really needed to be in it and i told him that sales wanted it and the reasons why we wanted to be in erm even the fact that it was going to k erm give us more accounting work erm UNK what bank is it
yeah
there are four banks in all and that means extra accounts and what are you going to do with all that money
i said
remind you that all money at the moment goes either to first which isn't quite so bad cos they're family but a vast amount goes into and both of whom have therefore access to our commercial sensitive for want of a better term information and we want to control that
we want to put it back in to
we also want the money quicker which erm i would have thought would more than UNK any of the so called extra expense that you've got and er i said we regard it as an essential sales tool to be get m better recognition in the country so er he is progressing with the applications
as regards the purely administrative side i can see no problem at all can see no problem
erm it's extremely highly UNK both in respect of the agents and the reporting and everything which er says will actually be very good for them
erm but what we will have to do is set up our local procedures as regards agents queries and things like that in both countries both with and also whatever you decide in denmark of how we run the procedure but that can be something later but what we'll need to do is no doubt before we actually do the distribution to the agents and the erm the information out to them th why we're going into on our own as opposed to being served by the other carriers
so erm that's really it
i'm not intending to do anything with any carriers as regards new stuff through the
it's me
alright dear
schedule just in case we suddenly find we haven't got slots and
yes i got the message
signed up and until they give us a firm this is it
but there will be one or two quite good new opportunities i think
one or two of the long UNK in UNK who are erm
UNK as well
UNK yes sorry there's existing ones but there's erm i think UNK and is it denmark somebody like that
you got my note on
yes thank you
cos that's quite easy to set up
no erm do they want it on er full and UNK
two separate rates and do they want it net or gross
you need to contact that guy
okay so i'll t i'll talk to him direct
okay
erm but stansted paris and stansted UNK centre business trips and
really
of course they've got the
so they can go round the circuit
yeah
using us as the middle bit it doesn't matter which airport they use
cos we need to cos we need to sort of all hands to the pump next week cos we've got a big change over yeah but i know ink well no cos the leaflet he's got has only just been approved and it's going out next week yeah well i mean you're to ha you're to handle their enquiries er deal with their enquiries and then tell them to phone yeah but you see it's the mailing that's gone out and then he's got to do some advertising first two weeks in UNK
UNK gone out
it's not really made it clear that it's for bookings and reservations as well
it's not made it clear
it says this is the only number you want but as read it and said well it doesn't really make it clear it's for reservations and bookings and it doesn't really so we'll just have to make sure that it damn well happens on the advert
the other thing is i need er we need to monitor the source of er UNK reg information regarding the UNK phone promotion so i've devised a form which i'll get UNK yeah in other words where did they find out about the promotion
right
oh other people
so when they phone up your girls and they say oh i i've seen this promotion about a UNK phone i want the girls to ask where did you hear about it
well i've UNK i've got a special form for it mhm yeah right okay and we well this is this is a different type of form and it needs it we need it more specific
we need to know whether it was from the mail on sunday or the sunday times from the television all those sort of things and it's just a simple form they tick a tick a box
right so i'll post that up to somebody right
well i'll fax it first thing in the morning on monday right or somebody will so you can get it y'know we just need to monitor it for a week and that's it
no longer so just to get a feel f
she lacks what i would call sales technique
yeah but it was well it in until two days before christmas
that's one thing she has done more of in this last six months structure
if i showed her this you know what you've done there
yeah well i mean i wouldn't
and a number have had two or three on time UNK with the incentive
i can't see the reason
no but she works from home she's got
got an advantage she got a fax at home
yeah well that's probably not a bad thing
no well i don't want anybody going round saying that the phones have been UNK in norwich because we because we haven't UNK the number properly cos that's our fault not anybody else's
come in every day does she not if she's got calls to make from home
i don't mean today i mean if she's going in to london or something you know she's got a base in london to do something in the morning before she goes on a call as opposed to some of them who haven't got a proper office space
well it will be for a for a month at least until people find out the number
running a social club
well i mean the sort of like in reading will probably only call once every blue moon yeah but you've got a situation where there's and sort of and th she's not gonna tell is she th what's going on
all that off her own back y'know only a little thing but she's doing that as well
yeah
i don't know you'll have to
yeah
yeah well b well what i'm trying to say and i can't emphasise it too strongly is that i don't want anybody going round like writing another stupid letter to somebody saying that erm you know the reason we're UNK that it hasn't been advertised properly cos i tell you what it'll come back right in our faces cos it's our bloody fault well that's right well we know that i mean i told them all i told them all quite clearly when i was up in glasgow that they'd be quiet for at least a month because p it'll take time to filter through
you know the number and i mean hasn't been able to get round to buying space in the t g and travel weekly until the first two weeks in february cos we were so late in UNK him i must had this conversation has taken away the brochure so there's not a copy here but we'll try and get hold of some as soon as possible but i mean they're mainly for glasgow but had been up there from r and d y'know and she said that the people up there didn't seem to know the slightest thing about UNK how to deal with UNK tickets and agency tickets and all that sort of business
well i think that well what UNK oh good thinking
well good th yeah right yeah
well she c well when she came down there i mean she wasn't trying to score points or anything
i just think that she was genuinely worried that they didn't seem to know a lot about it
i said well i thought well has been up there been up there er i thought had been up there a had been up there
yeah
now that's not account management in the same way that isn't it
well between the two between the two no the only between the two in glasgow is that you've got to cover it all anyway
whatever
i mean if glasgow breaks down for i mean if the UNK get called out for two weeks it's not gonna make a big deal of difference at norwich
but you know what's gonna happen
some UNK right is going to pick up and say oh well i phoned up this and y'know and then phoned the bloody managing director
based on a two for one that's hundred and ten quid
yeah well exactly that's wh yeah that's what i said alright
that's what we that's what we sold
right no
anything like that again just
yeah well you know it's okay well you know i well you know yeah it's just that it worried me about this meeting here and three people out of the five people in the room didn't realise that it was a reservations and booking service
they thought it was an enquiry line that was yeah well it just shows you though doesn't it
it says it's there is a moral in the story as they say
well you can never you never assume anything
and thought it was a reservations line oh was sorry it wasn't a reservations line and that it was just an enquiry line
well i know i know is the only one that realised i would've been more shocked if had yeah i would have been out on the pavement here UNK with a UNK there you are that one no not yet no
no it's er the initial the initial report that's gone back has said that you're gonna have a bad knee very shortly but apart from that you'll be UNK with some physical injury
yeah well par for the course par for the course
well i hope you're alright anyway
put yo put your foot up y it's about time for home and away now so you've gotta get that on
no i'm not i'm not starting to get worried UNK
alright
no i'm only phoning you because you phoned i'm only phoning because you UNK yeah no we've been here all the time and the phone didn't ring once well
some houses some houses for sale in your village aren't there
yeah there's one little minor adjustment that you y you might be aware you might need to be aware of
due to UNK that er is g for the meantime is go in the interim is going to man glasgow er on saturday afternoons
well he's just gonna make them stay longer isn't he
well that's fine don't worry we'll get round it
just for a couple of weekends to see how many actual calls we do get
ah just a couple of people that's all two people and er they'll just have to get round it somehow but we don't yeah well you speak to him right yeah well they can have they can have what they want but i mean it might be just a short term thing
it depends it depends on how many calls we get but says that the agencies are all open on saturday afternoons you shouldn't get lots of leisure bookings and yeah
i heard that
no he no way she didn't say that
i could hear her thinking it then
he could hear you thinking that he was a silly old UNK
do you know this UNK being taped
you've missed you've missed this today
you've missed this today
we're having a k our entire meeting's being taped for er for an interest of science in the interests of science for UNK for a survey on english language
no this is being done by a university or longmans press or something like that surveying the use of language in the nineteen nineties
however they can hear me but they can't hear you so that's no we've had a fairly usual frank and honest er discussion
right okay
right we'll leave it at that then
have a nice weekend keep on taking the pills yeah well you know what it's like y'know there'll be so many people dying for this to fail well they don't know what's going on but all they'll get is one call UNK which says i can't get through i can't get through or i've tried this number and it doesn't work and blah you know usual thing but right i must keep on taking the UNK bills
yeah that's right
yes amsterdam no i'm UNK
i'll be UNK
i'll be in first thing for half an hour and then i'm off alright
i'll be in amsterdam sales office for the af from two o'clock in the afternoon yeah
there's a UNK for ya
alright cheers bye
right sorry about that chaps
sorry
right then
are you doing an internal notice on the changes to all departments including the other airports and everything like that or who's gonna put that out
well i was going to but i was i was hoping to get some news on er summer UNK cos i'm gonna do a whole sales department down in UNK and changes first
but i'm just thinking the UNK should know and also the UNK should know
well i told knows
don't look at me like that cos i know that means
no it's alright
i think that there ought to be a proper company wide UNK or certainly u k wide instruction going out so that everybody's aware of the changes
alright
i'll send a note round then
you watch some bright UNK will say
i think you're gonna get that anyway whatever you
people don't mind being referred if it's something that is genuinely but say they phone leeds and leeds don't know and leeds refer them to a number they think it is and then they refer to a third number then somebody gets
if leeds say it's not something we can deal with here this is the number you ring and they've been told the wrong number that is a very bad impression and all the airports get calls constantly as you know from b a days so no matter what it's about people will ring a local number no matter whether it's in two foot high UNK saying for enquiries ring this number
yeah
even though it says it's free for you to do it they'll still ring up another number
alright so are we have we done point ten have we
yeah
yeah
point eleven
you've got the notes
you were just saying about us not knowing
there's my notes from the when i actually passed a repeat and we didn't say that travel agents sales were going to be done on that number
i wrote them down trade enquiries then i
don't you remember i stopped no you won't remember but i stopped because i was writing down exactly what we were doing
alright i won't repeat what said
thank you very much
all i'll say is you missed a good lunch
right air passenger duty
th the notes that're attached are actually for er he's been looking into the matter and basically it's for information only really
it's completely comprehensive and really the only thing i would say in addition to that is er there are further meetings coming up
the next one is er got a meeting on it er i think the airlines are going on a very much a co UNK thing er i think most people are probably in agreement with this size eight exemption make a group specific because really the idea when they put this original proposal in about the size of aircraft was to protect things like the and troops that are shall we say and i think most people would go for that line of thinking because as put in there why the hell should something again on cambridge when we can't on stansted but it was really designed to protect certain things
erm somehow or other it's going to come along and i think most people's UNK are that it will be shown as a tax item on the ticket as are the taxes in other countries
as you can see the erm where is it we've got to have or the airlines have got to have their submissions in by the end of this month so if we have got anything really that we want to say from sales we ought to be letting have it in a formal thing
er the other thing i did mention is we're not the only people who have erm problems with typing
UNK
did you know that i was the only one in the management meeting that picked that up
you were
i was the only one that picked that up that i was UNK spelt
and the other one that caught on second was which says something doesn't it
and even when it was explained to he didn't clock it
really
no he just looked at everybody blank
i went to erm whatever her name is no is it
training cabin staff lady i've forgotten her name
yeah
and said that really shouldn't our cabin staff announcements be changed to say that the use of portable telephones is not permitted on the aircraft
she says it is
i said well will you please stop the girls saying the use of portable telephones are not permitted
i said three flights that i've been on in the last fortnight
she said stansted crew i said yes and norwich and glasgow
apparently it is laid down as is but they're all saying are because they thing it's telephones are not use is
that's a good one for the tape isn't it
considering they come from the pick and mix department at
is that another one of phrases is it
oh it's a fill in i thought that was sort of more like a personnel type phrase
UNK
the pick and mix department from oh brilliant
no it's the personnel statement is well what do you expect from UNK who can't talk proper
while we're on the subject of can we clear
no well that comes last
please can we get on with the serious stuff please
oh this is serious i'm sorry it is
oh hang on a minute wait til i've finished please
okay sorry
right last one then
twelve summer schedule ninety four
does anyone want to say anything about that
i don't know cos we thought you'd be the only one who actually managed to get a copy when nobody else could lay their UNK for the af from two o'clock in the afternoon yeah f UNK
well it seems that being a member of the UNK club gives you some benefits
yes
is it worthwhile talking about it now or shall we leave it til next week
probably best
asked for a second rotation on scotland to amsterdam on a saturday
yeah
in fact what they've done is split the morning service
separate aircraft from aberdeen and edinburgh so that will double the capacity but it won't give us two UNK of cost
so i mean that's
seventy five percent of solving the problem because the big problem for capacity was the in bound on a saturday morning which of course will be solved now
well we need to we need t there are one or two what i would call relatively minor UNK issues that we need to keep a handle on and again it's the usual it's the east coast and essex stuff isn't it
you know UNK norwich that sort of thing
i mean one or two i mean t you've got a copy haven't ya of latest UNK on this which was the twenty third of december actually about all these things
i think he went into far too much detail about it
i'm worried about this amsterdam because it's obvious from paper
mhm
right that have got a bit of a UNK round about five o'clock from bloody amsterdam and we're getting UNK
i looked at it i looked at the er
yeah it's a question of what goes up comes down
it's all the same stuff you know we can't move forward unless it comes forward at the other end
well you see there to seventeen forty and stansted to the comparable er
yeah
service is nineteen fifty
we're getting UNK on that and on the other way round
th that's now what's the w what time is the fifth rotation
seventeen hundred
it's crap it's in the middle of the day it's a load of shit never sell that
it needs to be it needs to be at one at four one at six or something like if we can possibly do it
in fact you know that's probably one of the only ways we can attack on this
exactly well it's look at this report
of all the things that UNK out at me on the paper in this report that we could actually do something about was to slot in a fifth round about the five o'clock crunch time and taken them out the market but i
do something about
er eighteen forty five to stansted is ours there's a seventeen twenty
yeah it's much better
well it's much more user friendly schedule than we've got
they're four a day we're four a day
we've got five a day
we've got one more than them therefore we should use it to our advantage
we haven't got the aircraft at that time it's peak time
well why do we then shove it in a stupid s four o'clock job
because that's when the seats are available
yeah well come on i mean we ought to be able to be a little bit more creative than that
that's one issue that i don't like
the other issues are aberdeen to we're gonna get UNK again cos have got a different schedule now haven't they
they're going to today
yeah are they
but aren't they going from seven o'clock nine o'clock or something like that
no
no
no not now our schedules are perfect with that they're planning cos i spoke to the other day
oh well
are they still ahead of us out to aberdeen back to though
they're gonna be after us now
are they
before us but their plan now is to come after us on a d c nine
oh right well that's not so bad then i'm happy
so if we get
on this
i'm not sure about the er i'm not sure what the issues are regarding aberdeen
short spain
yeah short which is what you suggested get this plane from and then we can probably er
and we need to put an end to the UNK about stansted i mean it's ridiculous
well this i that's a lunch club UNK because that one has not been to airport
yeah but that
you what
you what
had meetings with airport
well i mean that's
cos wants to keep the door open
i mean by all means talk southend is the latest one over there so
stansted doesn't it
airport are desperate
were gonna do it weren't they
well you can almost swim from there
just for the opening of the channel time that'd be perfect timing for us wouldn't it
just the sort of wrong time you know
who wants to go somewhere when the channel tunnel
well has got to have something to do hasn't he to justify his job because i mean he's talked to in the past he's talked about everything
can we fly er stansted or whatever bloody hell towns there are stansted i mean it's stansted every bloody place in that's got a UNK airport
i don't think i
it's a bit of UNK licence there but i think
if an aircraft does come back it would be an ideal way of getting our market share back from by putting it on the east coast
well apparently our load facts according to i mean they're sixties all the time so
apart from where we've only got one or two
oh well crap yeah
yeah what i don't like about if they're doing
yes i know
if they're doing the business on they could be pulling off that's what i don't like cos the UNK are too so close together like it's too you know too er right shall we revert i think more sensible to talk about this in the beginning of february yeah
yes
well it's getting close
well it's up to the managers but i agree with stansted four times a day i think we're losing a lot of traffic because we have nothing between seven in the morning and three o'clock in the afternoon
that that's
yeah
the other ones on saturday and sunday i mean
was UNK that we shouldn't be using out of er stansted airport they should be UNK
what aircraft could we use for it
then will have twenty seven
that would be too late wouldn't it for that though
twelve o'clock
yeah fourteen hundred
well i can't see why we want the other two but i can see
yeah this is at weekends
has already UNK himself about the visit cause extra work of course but er the er however we should er revert maybe we'll keep an eye on the schedule and things er but we need to tie it up tight so we don't get a cos i mean what's being said now in the corridors of power is that the schedule is totally sales driven and it's the sales department that's put it together i am only the UNK i only i d i completely take my orders from the sales department quote unquote in front of everybody at the management meeting
looked around and said well he said looked at me said er well cos he was just about to g throw a UNK and say well surely the sales department should be dealing with this should be should be giving him the information and he just turned round and gave the UNK quote and i just sort of went yes it is
i said but you do appreciate there are some dead sectors in the timetable that wouldn't w that even the greatest salesmen in the world couldn't sell because they're UNK sectors
and he said oh well that will always be the case that will always be the case
i said well it shouldn't be the bloody case at all and that's when we got into the debate about er aberdeen to er one following half an hour after the other
i said well why the why the UNK does it do that
we don't need two services f for the from aberdeen to one half an hour after the other
why doesn't it cut out airport and fly one less stop you know
they said oh well we'll have to look at that you know
well they're doing that now aren't they
take it to then back through
according to they're according to i should say they've adjusted it that it's g it's not gonna go aberdeen it's gonna go aberdeen or even aberdeen direct so which is pretty
how many years have we been flying that route
right okay erm so there's the UNK it's UNK rather than radical changes that we're talking about here really isn't it
i'm glad i'm glad he said that cos i'm having a bit of a problem on flights for the summer we want more capacity than
i am in fact a self employed business advisor management consultant
mm
call me what you will
under contract tec come here usually one day a week to carry out these interviews erm they UNK me in any corner they can find
yes
erm i started my business some nine years ago when i was unemployed under the enterprise allowance scheme
very much a rubber stamp exercise in those days and as a result of that only one in four of the businesses that were supported was actually surviving at the end of the first twelve months
mm
so when the training and enterprise councils were given responsibility for a new stream of scheme they said quite rightly i think that they would only support UNK businesses
they wanted to ensure that people sufficient skill and training to run their own business and that they'd done their homework
that policy appears to be paying off in as much the national survey run at the beginning of last year showed some seventy two percent of businesses were still there after eighteen months
and locally we carried out a similar exercise some six months ago which showed that eighty two percent of the businesses were still there after months
still there but not necessarily making a profit
right
okay
yes
right you seem to be pretty well qualified
i hope so yes erm
what made you give up education
erm quite frankly i erm pulled out because of stress
right
it was a doctor's instruction basically
he i i'd been to them over a period of about two years erm with all sorts o of different problems and in the end he said you know i can increase your drugs but that won't help
mm
i know how to sort your problem
it's to remove you from the source of this and that is the school you're working in
right
so i took his advice and left
and you are actually qualified to teach the organ
organ piano erm harmony theory anything to do with music basically
i mean did you progress to the organ through the piano or
erm yes and no
it's something that i worked on er independently as it were
my father who was a er a UNK taught me the piano from an early age and er i first became interested in the organ purely for money purposes in fact when at the age of fifteen a local methodist church in durham where we lived at the time said er we need an UNK
we've heard you playing the piano for the local sunday school erm we'll pay you sixty pounds a year which in nineteen fifty whatever it was a lot of money provided you spend half of that having organ lessons
and i duly accept their off accepted their offer
right
from that
erm we pay our church UNK i think twelve pounds a year
yes it varies from one to another i think
mm
the royal college of UNK wouldn't be pleased to hear
and you have you own organ do you
or
no i've go i've got access to several in
right
a cathedral organ or
yes yeah
do you play in the cathedral yourself or
i have done in the past not recently
there have been other things UNK me recently
right
yeah
and do you find i mean you mention somewhere in here that you have one or two potential clients
that's right
are any of those for the organ
one is yes
he's got his own organ at home erm
mm
erm but essentially now i've discussed with him as i mentioned in my er plan er the intention is to meet anybody who wants musical services and find out from them precisely what er they really need
he doesn't need organ lessons and i've advised him as such and he's accepted that
what he was particularly interested in is he's been taught the UNK method in fact
right
where his right hand he's a very confident music reader and plays but his left hand he's merely sort of UNK there like a UNK and plays the odd UNK
mm
and he wants the same facility with his left as with his right
so i am proposing with him to er undertake a fairly simple but comprehensive business of reading the bass clef using the left hand and introducing it into the kind of music that he already plays and at the same time getting him to play other music as well which he seems to be very happy
right
erm organs are classified by the number of stops they have or something isn't it
erm not necessarily no but er yes that is partly important in that if it's not there you can't use it
mm
i mean how do they i'm just trying to remember because i remember
yeah
having a session with an organ builder right
right
and he was talking about one two three four stops
have i got the right term
yes oh yes
a stop a stop is a UNK because it's in fact a starter
right
when you draw it you allow to enter that rank of pipes
but what okay some organs have one or two UNK
two UNK yes
some have four
right
that i've seen
i mean how do they UNK that
does that relate to stops or what
no each division is a separate erm section of the organ in fact
right
erm and in the traditional er properly made organ as it were the pipe organ erm each keyboard er is available to you to play from
each keyboard has its own ranks of pipes and each sound each rank of pipes is controlled by one stop
right
so that for instance you can have four stops on one keyboard three on another and the three sounds that are available on this keyboard are available from those the four sounds that are available
okay
plus the feet UNK
plus the UNK
and you can then also couple between UNK so that if you want to you can play the sounds from this keyboard on the lower one by UNK the two together and making them work as a pair but that UNK the UNK of being able to set one against the other
you make an interesting comment about your wife's experiences that ones ends up with a private practice
what does she do
she's a piano teacher
oh right
yes
okay
works from home
so she can give you her UNK work
well yes
okay
alright
in fact one of my one of the pupils i am proposing to work with he's one of her people who have contacted her and she's quite deliberately limiting the number of her days in the week she teaches to two
we have a son who still lives at home who in fact has been quite ill for a long time and erm she you know the amount the work she has done therefore has been seriously limited
she's definitely erm reduced it to two days a week
okay
er you will i think have one problem er in working for the l e a erm i happen to be a school aid inspector and i'm finding now quite a with er with the income tax people at the moment
mm
because i'm self employed and you're intending to be self employed which means you're
that's right
taxed under schedule er d
d
and i have just done some work for derbyshire and they have deducted twe tax at twenty five per cent and for my invoice
erm and the difficulty is proving to some of the l e as that you're actually self employed
so you're gonna have to if you do any work for l e as
yes
set that up right at the beginning which means going to the inland revenue
to the inland revenue yes
and in our my case give a zero or an infinite i'm not sure which way round they'd do it erm tax UNK which i find
mm
annoying cos i sort of UNK up with them and said well quote me the law and they can't quote you the law i mean they it's just someone who they seem to be we do it
UNK
yes
well they're creating law i think
mm
yes
another issue
now i've been told by other people who've er erm gone down this route that i'm proposing to follow with l e as that erm there are two ways round it
either you've got to do what you're suggesting go in right at the start and say it's all sorted here's the UNK this is what you will apply the inland revenue have agreed it already you know don't use your own system
or you accept precisely what they do and claim it back at the end of the year
well you hope you claim it back at the end of the year
well you hope you claim it back
but you haven't got the use of that money in that the government has
no of course yes
right
on principal i don't like that idea
now what are you going to do i mean you you've listed out here your marketing approach
yeah
erm how much do you think you'll need to do that
well quite an amount of it has been done already
erm the talking about the idea with various er colleagues and contacts within the southwell area obviously continues
it works on a continuing basis
i was talking with a erm a well she's not a colleague actually she's another piano teacher only about two days ago while walking dogs she's walking hers i'm walking mine and oh i see from your recent advert in the local paper you're accepting piano pupils
yes erm
ah i don i don't want to you've advertised
yes
no well erm this was a form of market research
right okay
it was try trying the waters and er i merely you know UNK place placed a reference there saying erm was it possible
and er she said i have occasional requests i'm full at the moment erm would you mind if i passed some of my enquiries on to you as and when they occur
perfectly alright thank you very much
those contacts exist erm i UNK anticipate publicity in communicating with local schools and other institutions and things like that and there after merely maintaining some kind of a regular advertisement slot in the local paper that says yes i'm still here because people forget
erm perhaps operating a mail shot at the beginning of the academic year with the er appropriate educational and other institutions
it's be the best system for this kind of thing
my wife's never ever advertised in fact
mm
people just got to know about her
okay
in fact as far as local education establishments are concerned i've already had two enquiries from direct enquiries from schools saying are you available
i'm not available yet erm because i retired under erm health on health grounds
the authority UNK or did refuse to consider me as a supply teacher in nay capacity until six months had passed
this was a ruling the medical officer er UNK
but er because i've had requests i've approached them and said well we'll get your documents released and see if we can speed matters up because use your experience
happens what about the public schools around
public schools there are only three or four fairly close
i've written to them all
erm i've not had any replies from any of them
erm but i intend to er contact them again and say to them well you know i'm still here and should you hit problems or find that you've just lost one of your erm staff who were providing the kind of services that i do don't forget that i'm still here
okay
UNK erm i'll put it through as approved
erm a letter will go from the powers that be here er later today i should think
it certainly should get out today
erm back to newark enterprise to tell them you've been accepted
right
the business plan will go back with the letter to them
i'll tell you why in a moment
give them a ring on friday to see er that they've got the letter
if they have then organize a date and time UNK acceptable with them to go in and sign on
when you go to sign on you will need to take with you evidence of having opened up a business bank account
the business plan goes back with the letter because they will require a copy of the business plan so that they when they see you at three six twelve and eighteen months
right
they can compare your books and your progress against the business plan
and you will also need a copy if you haven't got one have
complete copy of everything i've given you
so there's no problems
right any questions anything i can do to help you
erm actually i've spoken to ian at erm newark tec and he's already arranged to see me tomorrow afternoon
now he does tend to jump the
he's quick off quick off the mark
i shall catch him out one day
he actually suggested that i might like to call and see him this afternoon but i wasn't available for that so well
yes
tomorrow it would have to be
okay
erm apart from that no unless you've got any other suggestions from your long experience as being a self employed person by way of guidance
well the only thing i think you will need because you're going to go onto other people's premises and i
yeah
don't know if you've got it in here or not it doesn't look as if you have but you will need public liability insurance
that i'm organizing in that i have now done a little bit more research
i've contacted the UNK union and the incorporated society of musicians
yeah
erm membership of the incorporated society of musicians which comes at about seventy eight pounds a year does actually include public liability
yes
and i am making i'm in the process at the moment of making application to be accepted by them
i mean you might fall over and smash his precious organ or something
oh this is true yes
and er if he UNK you er well at least you
yes
would be covered for that sort of thing or
no this is covered
with people coming into your house for instruction if they fall over the front door UNK
yeah
and break a hip or something you know then
well that's already covered in fact within our house because we my wife as a
ah right yes
teacher erm our we've already made sure that our own private
yes
insurance does cover that
right
which she won't want to know about
we've got a hearing coming up on the sixteenth of july in
yeah
in norwich or wherever it is
erm we've sent all the UNK down to er an agent there and we've still not heard from the other solicitors as to what this erm
mm
thing is but i'm pretty sure i can identify it
yeah
from the stuff that's now been introduced to us
cos there is there appears to have been a display kitchen at some stage
so i gathered after mr and mrs were
yeah
erm just track the letter down where he said that
between february and march nineteen ninety
two five eight nine seven two in which exactly er the amount that was
yeah
now i can't identify what these numbers mean but i think it relates to
mm
erm a display kitchen
it says display account
yeah
erm creative UNK kitchen wise
but i this was actually addressed to erm the mansfield address
yeah
so maybe that's why it's not come to light before
erm i presume that the s are right in saying that this relates to the display account at newark
mhm
yeah
i mean i dunno whether you whether you may want to
well i as i er as both myself and my wife understood it everything had been paid and then obviously when we got the letter saying we owed this amount of money it didn't come to light till mr and mrs came to see you
and said yeah
yeah
but they UNK on their side as well with credits owed and all
i mean i had nothing at all to do with UNK business except i went in partnership with me wife and that
right
so er obviously i didn't know anything about the money owed or we would've UNK to pay it off straight away when we went to the bank er originally when it went when it folded
right
erm there's two points really
first of all you've got to be satisfied that actually relates to the unit that was at newark
mm
and as i say the UNK is that it was actually addressed to mansfield
erm i don't represent mr and mrs as you know although they've been in to give us a witness statement
mm
erm you're fairly are you're fairly confident that they're not telling us a UNK about this
well i honestly don't know
we've had erm i wouldn't say a fall out but er we're on UNK terms to say the least
right
this is doing me no good at all whereas it seems to be all me and my wife it's but like we went to court mr and mrs who were equally involved in it
sure
are not you know haven't been UNK or anything
don't worry i've told the solicitors that are appearing for us on the sixteenth of july that that's the situation that the have not joined in all of the partners
mm
joined in too and that they really ought to be invited to put the s in the frame as well
erm so i think this hearing on the sixteenth of july will be quite useful in trying to be able to i identify that this display unit relates to newark and not to mansfield
yeah
assuming for the moment that is right then obviously that sum is outstanding
yeah
er and to avoid racking up costs which is a thing that worries me
that that's what i come to see ya yeah
erm i think that some sort of offer ought to be made
now we we've got these suggestions that you have problems with late the later deliveries from
mm
which created inconvenience at the least and expense in you having to buy units from elsewhere customs
er if we're doing the job properly as i said to you before we really need the UNK for various
mm
customers and how much it's actually cost you to put the jobs right
erm but taking a very broad approach to it may be that we can suggest to the UNK of that erm taking the inconvenience the extra cost and so on roughly say half of that account erm
mm
can be wiped out
er and just going through my mind at the moment
is that like settling out of court cos that's
on yes
i would settle for that
oh yes
as you know i mean i'm only a working man
yeah
wi not an UNK amount of wages and we've just had this two hundred pound for the to be transferred to mansfield
sorry what's that
erm well i bought in two hundred pound on account for my cost to you and then
oh yes i'm sorry yeah that's right
had a letter
yeah
this weekend
for another two hundred pound for if i get it right is it to fetch it over to mansfield or their
UNK over in norwich and
yeah
obviously you don't want to pay us to travel over there
no
so erm i'm just throwing this out as an idea that we perhaps we offer one half of this amount here
yeah
erm each side to pay its own costs
yeah
and we get the s to pay half of the half
yeah
well
if worst comes to worst and they don't accept that
aha
speaking on my own for my own personal point of view erm if they if they insist they want this full amount
yeah
would it be possible for me to pay my half of that and the s pay the other half because i'm not i it it's really started to worry me and concern me a lot
i'm
now
i'm sure that's right and includes a lot of interest as well
that's right yeah
building up every day really
i mean
the object
as far as i'm concerned is to try and kill it as quickly
yeah
as we can cos of the cost side erm i'm not happy about the way they've drawn up the writ because it doesn't say precisely wh it doesn't say what that invoice says it's only
no
because we've done some digging around that we've actually got that information
mm
it doesn't say it was at newark erm and i think you've got reasonable prospects of knocking it back because of the problems you had with towards the end
so i think you know erm
we've got no proof they were labelled deliveries or
customers complaints or
er i mean the interest is one thousand one hundred quid so
yeah
we're talking about three six aren't you at the end of the day that's what they're trying to apply for
erm i'll start on the basis that we offer one two fifty
yeah
what i want to do is clear that with mr and mrs as well pay half of that
yeah
i think
so does that sound okay to you
it sounds very good yeah
but you're saying anywhere between those two figures personally you will pay half of the two thousand five hundred and eighty nine
just to finish it off yeah
i mean if they insist they want all that i mean i'll if they insist they want the interest as well then i'm in er a bit of a spot
yeah
okay leave it with me
i'll er telephone them possibly
i'll telephone them tomorrow and see whether we can sort something out
thanks a lot them mr
okay i'll be in touch
i feel a little bit better at least
yeah
thank you anyway
alright
cheerio then
ta
er shall i pop in tomorrow with the two hundred pound for norwich then
er yes if you wouldn't mind
okay then
it may be that we don't have to use all of that
obviously you'll get a refund if i can solve
yeah
this fairly quickly
okay then mr
thanks a lot
alright
cheerio
bye
good morning erm oh it does work it UNK
at least everyone can hear right
good morning then ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this annual general meeting of the national council for voluntary organisations
my first er but sad duty is simply to say that sir kenneth our president had hoped to be here but he's had er an operation and er he is not really quite well enough so i was asked as a vice president whether i would stand in for him at the weekend and er i shall do my best and erm i'm glad to have to opportunity of doing one or two things but we'll come to those in due time
er i should also re remind you so my brief UNK me of the no smoking rule which was adopted at last year's er a g m and which means there's no smoking er in this room at any rate and certainly not during the meeting
now erm i think that er we er should first er seek to adopt the minutes of the last meeting which i hope you have all seen and studied with due care and attention and er i should like to ask first whether there are any amendments which anyone would wish to put forward to those minutes
and if not i will move from the chair the adoption of the minutes of last year's a g m those in favour of that
and those against
carried UNK
that wasn't bad for early in the morning
erm good now then we come to er well perhaps i should ask first whether anyone wishes to raise any questions arising out of those er minutes
please
UNK round the u k yes
i think it was resolution six on disabled people er resolution eight sorry
the sentence reads the council UNK the executive committee to take whatever steps it considers necessary to ensure that this council shall employ at least UNK the minimum legally required number of disabled people
i couldn't read a reference in the annual report to a review of the this matter or an agreement that the council had actually taken this on board and it was operating
i'm hoping to hear that is the case
simon to er reply to that point thank you
i hope people at the back can hear erm we obviously took up action on the resolution passed last year in two or three different ways
firstly erm we undertook a survey of our own membership er in order to see what sort of action people were taking themselves er about UNK issues and especially about the employment of disabled people within their own organisation
erm we had i think in fairness a fairly small response to that and the executive had a discussion recently about how to take the matter forward further
we included in that discussion at the executive what n c v o's own position was and how it would seek to improve own practice
it was agreed at i think the last executive committee that as a follow up to that survey and to take on board er n c v o's own practice a small working group was going to be established of people from disability organisations those which are both disabled led organisations and others to enable us to take that forward over the next year
so action has been taken both in terms of our membership and n c v o for itself
thank you
does that erm answer your question
yes that's perfect
good any other questions arising out of last year's minutes
alright now we come to the erm first resolution erm but before i invite alan morgan to er propose this resolution let me just say it will of course be the last occasion i've never seen such a remarkable er demonstration of the interest which we all have in the future of alan
you are surrounded by the latest edition of the n c v o news so you know that this is the last occasion
i shall have another word to say about him you're not getting off as lightly as that alan er but erm i think that erm what i should now do is to invite him as our chairman over the year in question to er move the adoption of the annual report
mr chairman nineteen eighty nine has been a significant year for the voluntary sector and we have witnessed some important developments including the publication of the white paper charities a framework for the future
the announcement of the efficiency scrutiny of government funding of the voluntary sector legislative changes in local government and housing bill are also likely to change the relationship between voluntary organisations and local authorities
also the government's recent announcement on community care will give voluntary organisations new responsibilities in this important area
there have been significant changes in UNK british society over the past ten years
whereas a decade ago voluntary organisations was perceived largely as an UNK to the state now we are increasingly seen as equal and independent partners working alongside the public and private sectors
their importance in the economy still needs to be given recognition
we hope that two initiatives by government this year will help to change that
the first is the white paper on charity law which we believe UNK the flexibility of the present system of regulation with a set of controls designed to increase public confidence in charitable giving
the second is the scrutiny review of voluntary sector funding which we hope will encourage the government to use their funding as a strategic resource to provide a stable back drop for other forms of fund raising to UNK a proper status to voluntary sector funding and to devise more coherent arrangements for its ad administration
we are confident these reforms will contribute to the recognition of the voluntary sector not only as a third force but as a sector in its own right
at the same time n c v o has been active in addressing voluntary organisations own ability to meet the challenges of a changing world
among the initiatives which we have undertaken this year is the establishment of a working party under the UNK of lord UNK to make recommendations on developing and maintaining high standards of effectiveness and efficiency within the sector
matters under consideration include the role and training of trustees UNK management education public relations and financial accountability
it must however be UNK that these matters are not an end in themselves but a means of enabling voluntary organisations to achieve their aims and objectives effectively and i understand that working party report will be published in february and we all UNK it very much
voluntary UNK relationship with government is but one aspect
it is equally important that voluntary organisations develop an interface with the private sector
to enable us to do this n c v o in may launched a corporate affiliation scheme to enhance the understanding of in industry about the voluntary sector and vice versa
to promote partnership between companies and voluntary organisations
our corporate affiliation scheme which will provide a UNK made service to companies wishing to develop their links with the voluntary sector has already attracted more than twenty leading companies into membership
n c v o has the voice of the voluntary sector in england plays a full part in UNK the development of our society alongside government the corporate sector and others
views of n c v o are based upon policy analysis and development work with it members and the wider national and local voluntary sector
meetings for our members have been held on both of these issues and in response to the scrutiny review we circulated our membership with our detailed submission to the government to inform their own responses
through n c v o's constructive dialogue with government and parliament through the parliamentary panel on charity law UNK by tim UNK m p and serviced by n c v o voluntary organisations have been kept closely in touch with developments on charity law
when the white paper appeared in may there was much to welcome but not a lot to surprise
in response to n c v o's growing and varied membership the executive committee have agreed to changes in the way that the organisation works with its members on policy issues which has helped break down barriers between different interests as UNK as organisations now meet around UNK issues and issues of concern
a good example of this has been the work on broadcasting and the voluntary sector which n c v o has embarked upon this year in response to rapid changes in the broadcasting field and the government white paper broadcasting in the nineties quality choice and competition
a range of organisations including age concern the community radio association community service volunteers and the volunteers centre u k are now working together with n c v o in the broadcasting consortium which aims to maintain and develop standards of quality in broadcasting and promote relationships between UNK and voluntary organisations
we have tried to respond to increasing demands from what is now a growing membership
in the spring of nineteen eighty nine a number of voluntary organisations involved in running telephone help lines came to us about b t's plans to introduce compulsory UNK for all customers over the next few years
help lines were very concerned about the effect of that possible breach of confidentiality could have on their services and the vulnerable people they assist
we responded UNK co UNK a report UNK the possible effects of UNK
through case studies in th entitled breach of confidence the UNK widespread publicity and pressure at b t's a m in july from n c v o has caused b t to think again
i think a good example of n c v o helping voluntary organisations to help others
this has been another busy year in parliament with major legislation affecting the voluntary sector including the local government and housing bill and water and electricity privatisation
on electricity privatisation n v c o played an important role in bringing together voluntary organisations representing consumers of the service with environmental organisations
n c v o works to improve the effectiveness of voluntary organisations at all levels by providing support through advice training and UNK on very wide variety of issues and problems
this includes advice on management financial management new technology legal personnel and other issues
let me give you a few examples of the way in which our departments work
for many organisations the first port of call is the legal department which this year has continued to receive a range of enquiries on charity formation interpretation of UNK company law trading activities and the contracting out of services amongst others
during this year the legal department has had up to three hundred active cases in hand at any one time and this shows no sign of slowing down
our management unit has played a key role in the development of efficient and effective management within the sector
over this year the unit has built good links with the open universities and others developing management resources
it is working to ensure that management training is relevant to the UNK real needs and is more widely available
advice through workshops training and UNK is a cost effective means of taking n c v o's expertise to those who need it most
an example of this is the local development UNK short courses programme which organised over one hundred courses last year through local centres and local trainers
we all know and we all experience that voluntary organisations are changing and are having to change
we're having to become in many ways increasingly professional in a competitive world
the increasing impact of this greater UNK particularly on salaries for instance has led to a consultancy being provided by n c v o's personnel unit on appropriate levels of pay in one organisation
each week in addition to the many requests for advice n c v o receives hundreds of information enquiries about the work of n c v o about the work of its UNK units and the work of the voluntary sector as a whole
our information and intelligent unit receives an average of two thousand letters and over four thousand phone calls each year as well as UNK visitors to the library many from overseas
the enquiries have been from those in government both central and local UNK as well as students and UNK
our specialist units also receive many requests for information and our UNK project UNK has been no exception
the UNK of interest in green issues has meant that UNK in its second year of operation has seen a dramatic increase in enquiries on waste recycling
many of those enquiries coming from UNK which prompted UNK to develop an information pack for use in schools to ensure that future generations are less UNK of the world's resources
this year we launched a new information UNK n c v o news which our chairman today said you're surrounded by and i'm extremely embarrassed by
a monthly publication containing information and articles on the voluntary sector
over two thousand organisations receive it your initial response has been very encouraging and many people saying within the sector that it is essential reading
we try and produce a wealth of information and research both for and about the voluntary sector
one report which everyone in n c v o and many more besides wouldn't be without is the voluntary agencies directory from which n c v o publishing in print UNK square press puts out
we try and bring the voluntary sector together to discuss areas of common concern and a major event in april was training for employment nineteen eighty nine
the first national voluntary sector on employment training
another issue of concern to many organisations is the government's review of the national health service
the subject again of a conference in april the n h s and the voluntary sector the next forty years
the conference enabled voluntary organisations who attended to consider the implications of the review for them and their work
i happened to chair that conference and i think i was surprised by the depressing effect that this reform was seen to hold for so many of our membership particularly the smaller local voluntary organisations
the international flavour of our work was much in evidence at the first UNK international fellow UNK conference held in london in july
we contributed to the programme of this major event jointly sponsored by the charities aid foundation and the UNK university UNK
now let me for just a few minutes look forward if that's not too UNK for a chair who is moving out
over the coming year we expect to UNK and develop this work
much work will be necessary to help voluntary organisations devise appropriate funding structures to support and an increasingly central role in service provision and to respond effectively to the outcome of the government's efficiency scrutiny
we will be promoting debate on charity law issues and on how voluntary organisations should organise and manage themselves in order to respond to the contract culture which is being created by changes in the organisation of community care the n h s the role of local authorities and other fields
we also intend to play a full part in the debate around the single european market and nineteen ninety two
as we move towards the next century voluntary organisations will need to develop further their contribution not only to our national life but also to the international community
against these dramatic changes we intend to remain at the centre as an effective resource for the voluntary sector and an important bridge between the sector and others
voluntary organisations speaking on the basis of our wide experience in local communities and in national life are an influential voice which is respected throughout society
ours is a voice which cannot be ignored but if we are to use our influence to full effect we must both recognise and be capable of using our strengths
this is where we at n c v o feel we can play a vital role by helping the voluntary sector to recognise this shared interest and above all to act UNK
for the last three years n c v o has been at the centre of the critical debates
if we build on and enhance that experience we will be in the right position to face the new decade with confidence and vision
in november nineteen eighty six i was elected to succeed peter UNK as chairman of n c v o this year the call of other duties UNK me to step down
i feel that a very reluctant decision in many ways but it is i can assure you a realistic one
i have found the experience of working in the voluntary sector first of all as chair of c v s n a and vice chair of n c v o for i think about five or six years and finally as chairman in many ways on top of all my other work UNK
but in many ways it's been UNK exciting UNK and above all enjoyable
i think you would agree that it would UNK to single out any one person to thank
there are n c v o members and staff my fellow honorary officers and executive members and so many others who have made it such a UNK time
above all i would like to thank the sector for your friendship and warm support and i have every confidence that sir jeffrey my UNK i assume that resolution two will go through UNK unanimously will be car will be able to carry forward with your warm support the vision i tried to outline for the next year
finally chairman i formally move that the annual report for nineteen eighty eight eighty nine be received and adopted that the statements of account for eighty eight eighty nine be received and adopted and that UNK ross and company be appointed auditors for the UNK year
thank you all very much
i now call upon jeffrey foster er honorary treasurer to second that resolution
thank you
the accounts that you have for this year have been UNK
they've been UNK and now comply with the statement of recommended practice on accounting for charities
i commend this statement to you those of you who are responsible for the accounts of your organisations i hope you will also seek to comply with the standard so that the charities of all organisations the accounts of all charities can be seen clearly so that er you can understand the activities of your organisations from the accounts and so that one charity can better be compared with another charity
end of commercial though
the effect on our own accounts is that we now show all the UNK activities of the council together and they are then separated out from the entries for all the other funds appeals and trust funds and so on
this enables us to show clearly the most important features of the accounts which are the volume of the UNK activity of the council and i'm sad to say the deficit that we incur on that UNK activity
last year i reported to you a deficit of three hundred and thirty thousand
over ten percent of the UNK turnover of the council and which was in fact doubled from the size of the deficit from the year before that
i had hoped this year to be able to report a turn round and some substantial progress towards our target of achieving a nil deficit for the financial year nineteen ninety one ninety two
in fact though we have merely UNK the trend of increasing UNK rather than reversed it and the deficit for the current year is three hundred and forty four thousand
the reasons for this deficit are largely associated with the trend of pay and price increases UNK our income and UNK our projections of what we would have to spend
i think the this is quite well illustrated by the figures on employees where the numbers employed fell by getting on for ten percent though our spending on employees remained about the same partly as a result of pay increases partly also as a result of changes in the profile of grades of the staff at the council and a movement towards better staff better paid and then finally the saving we make each year as turnover of staff occurs and we don't have to pay salaries during the UNK period from one person to another that saving that has reduced because the turnover of staff has reduced
i have to say also that the future looks even UNK for us
the current trend of pay and price increases is more than we had hoped and it's certainly more than er than er the planned increase in our income will cover and i have to say that the rate of turnover of staff has reduced even further and so we will be spending more on staff for that reason than we had planned
nevertheless our target of erm achieving a nil deficit by nineteen ninety one ninety two does remain and therefore radical action is required to enable the council to continue to deliver services effectively in the context of continued financial constraint
and we will therefore need to exercise great judgement and UNK in the assumptions we make in planning for the future
not only on the expenditure and the changes required but also on planning our response to changes which will happen in the future because it is unlikely that we will ever be able to forecast everything which will happen to us exactly
the deficit this year was met from the legacy fund and the appeal fund
the appeal fund contributed two hundred thousand which is its target for annual income
the balance was met from the legacy fund
overall if you look at the balance sheet it still appears quite healthy erm nevertheless i must point out that the balance sheet is composed largely of funds with specific purposes and these specific purposes do not include simply UNK up UNK on the UNK activities
so we can't use the funds in our balance sheet simply to carry on the way we are we have to change
and we need to use the reserves that we do have in the balance sheet we need to spend them UNK in order to achieve our objectives our objectives for change and we must recognise that they can only be spent once
nevertheless i would like to end on a UNK note erm those of you who are UNK students of the accounts will have spotted the UNK liability of twenty eight thousand six hundred and sixty
basically we are required to report anything erm any liability which we know about which doesn't actually formally have to appear in the main accounts but which could arise in the future
i'm happy to say that this matter which arose from a misunderstanding on the basis of a grant from the european social fund
this matter has now been resolved and no liability exists for the council
i therefore second the first resolution that the report and accounts should be adopted and the auditors should be UNK
thank you erm jeffrey
now er before i put the resolution to the vote er i'm sure that all of us would welcome any comments or suggestions or questions that any of you might wish to put to us here
so let's have er anyone who wishes to indicate that
i think in my experience this is unique
erm don't hold back it's your opportunity
alright well then er with that expression of what i hope to be confidence in erm the management of our affairs over this last year erm let me put the resolution at as on the paper before you i won't read it again
resolution number one to the meeting those in favour
er those against
that appears to be carried unanimously
thank you for that
now it would be UNK of me to er speak at any rate at this UNK er on resolution two that is the appointment of honorary officers but i understand that elizabeth UNK er is ready to propose it
we've just had a remarkable vote of confidence i think in management but n c v o like many organisations relies very heavily on the abilities energy and commitment of its honorary officers
we have been and are very well served in n v c o our president sir kenneth our vice presidents and in particular the chair the vice chairs and treasurer give us a great deal of their time and i do mean give as they work for many hours on behalf of n c v o without payment
i hate to think what effect it would have on our deficit if it included realistic UNK of the value of their time
and we really do appreciate it
our two vice chairs barbara and kay are well known to all of you
towers of strength and energy whose experience and judgement is invaluable to us
our treasurer jeffrey foster has the sort of job usually described as UNK
persuading others to accept the hard financial facts of life is not usually a very popular job but he does it with great UNK and skill and under his guidance i do believe that our deficit is under control and that it will be reduced
we do thank him most sincerely for his work
i am very glad that all three of these people are willing to stand for office again
alan morgan our chair since nineteen eighty six and active in the organisation for years before is not standing this year as chair for a very happy reason which you all know about from the erm literature on your seats
he will be missed although the contribution he has made will remain with us in the present form of n c v o to which he very greatly contributed
i'm glad he's agreed to stand as a vice president
a candidate for the first time for the chair that alan has left is sir jeffrey
new to n c v o perhaps but with a wealth of experience in government industry and the voluntary sector
he began his career originally as a journalist working for the b c and the financial times before he moved into industry
he has strong interests in education and management training and much experience of negotiating with government something that we all need in n c v o for some years he's been a member of the council for voluntary service overseas
i know that all his experience will be called upon in the new role he's ready to undertake on behalf of us all
we very much appreciate his willingness to join us
i have great pleasure in proposing the honorary officers for appointment as they are printed on your order paper
thank you and now colin er is er to second this resolution
hello yes right thank you
i can do no more than endorse the statement made by the UNK and would just like to formally second the proposal resolution number two
thank you
erm does any member of the council wish to make any comment on this resolution before i put it formally to the vote
very well i will put it then to you that er resolution two as printed on your order paper should be approved by the council those in favour
and those against
well that's seems also to be carried unanimously
and on behalf of all those who have received this support from you i should like to say thank you
now there are two other things i want to er say at this UNK
or rather two other people to speak of
you will have read what i think to be a very UNK and properly enthusiastic tribute to alan by peter his predecessor in the chair in this number of n c v o news which incidentally i think is er a considerable step forward from the various er experiments and the like that we have er conducted over the years
alan and i served er together as er deputy chairs or vice chairs or whatever the appropriate words are for several years er and i erm well i think i would adopt the words that he used about the experience that he has had in the chair to UNK that his UNK and his contribution to our affairs has been UNK and particularly enjoyable
erm i'm very glad that his er departure from the chair does not UNK any UNK in his commitment to er our work and activities
it is a big job it doesn't just mean changing the colour of your stock er and it's difficult to think of erm er alan wearing the purple so to say but erm i'm sure he i went to his UNK in york about two months ago it was a very moving and er enjoyable occasion and he's erm er now entered upon that inheritance
i can hardly UNK i'm sorry for if it's er a bad UNK but er i can hardly UNK to say that it may be that i that UNK can do with what one might describe as a dash of the robin UNK which i think alan may er bring to it
so alan you go with our warm thanks and our very best wishes for a future which i know will be as valuable to the church as it will lead to a gap in our ranks which it will be difficult to fill
now then erm if anyone erm can perhaps achieve that objective i think it is your our new chairman jeffrey
one of the things he er did er as was UNK erm by er barbara was erm to erm er be a UNK and journalist many years ago now jeffrey
well i also was er a UNK then in the b c and so he and i had some UNK at that time since when he has obviously gone from strength to strength
i need not bore you with er a UNK of his many UNK i just would single out one additional one and that is his sterling work for the royal society of arts er its shorter name erm of which he has UNK really the development of an activity described as industry matters
thus to bring to all our attention how much it matters for the encouragement of arts commerce and trade which er for manufacturers which is the full title of the royal society of arts
so we're very lucky indeed i say without any hesitation whatever that jeffrey has been willing to take on this
the child victims of war
images that are now a daily UNK in dozens of countries across the world
millions of young lives have now been UNK
it's all placing an UNK burden on charities like save the children who say far too often the international community is not pulling its weight
in UNK the combination of war and UNK claimed a quarter of a million children dead last year
today in the capital UNK a hundred thousand more driven from their homes are dependent on food aid for survival
in bosnia the war has been especially cruel on children
one estimate puts the number dead in UNK alone at twelve hundred and some fourteen thousand wounded
in northern iraq over a hundred thousand UNK children are still unable to return to their homes after being forced to UNK saddam UNK army
many are living in appalling conditions without clean water and proper UNK
in UNK more than two hundred thousand have been UNK or separated from their families
three quarters of a million children have been forced to seek UNK in neighbouring countries others are disabled for life
in the west african republic of UNK where eighty five per cent of the population have been UNK children some as young as eight are being placed in secure compounds to prevent them from going back to fight for the UNK
children who've been given at a far too tender age the terrible power of holding a loaded gun and be able to command everything in sight as a result of that have actually got to get back and UNK childhood
lost UNK a pattern that's sadly being repeated across the world's battle grounds
bill UNK b c news
can anybody fail to be moved by those pictures
children really are under fire throughout the world literally and UNK
even in those countries where the real firing has stopped there's the UNK
many of the wars most of the wars are civil wars and you know the UNK the UNK after a civil war doesn't help the children who have suffered from that war
also just think of the troubles in our own northern ireland right on our doorstep
think of the problems that children have there
but even where there is no real UNK man's UNK to children has caused serious UNK of rights and of benefits generally
food health support education UNK care affection
these are all features of a child's life that they need
otherwise children without those grow up physically UNK damaged and the purpose of save the children fund is to work to give children the chance of a better childhood and the chance to grow up to be adults who won't repeat the sins of their UNK
your royal highness ladies and gentlemen welcome to this annual public meeting in this our seventy forth anniversary year
some of you er may take it UNK if i were to describe you as UNK but my by contrast this is my first annual public meeting and not just as chairman
i've never had the opportunity to attend one before
although i have been a long time supporter
today her royal highness nick UNK and his team will talk about the very impressive work and the tasks that lie ahead in the fifty countries and the u k in which save the children operates
i will talk about the fund as i found it in my capacity as a very recent chairman
a fresh pair of eyes
a fresh pair of eyes of a relative new boy and the first thing i noticed was my family's reaction
it was as though they were saying to me at last you're doing something worthwhile and respectable
my first impression was how well everything runs and in saying that i really am paying a tribute to previous UNK
for whose efforts on behalf of the fund i really do thank them and i'd like to make a special thanks to lady UNK lucy stepped into the breach as acting chair about a year ago and since i was elected has done a tremendous amount to help me settle in quickly and i hope effectively
i'm most impressed also with the hard work the dedication and the sheer efficiency of the director general and his top team
i was talking yesterday as it happened to the chairman of another very large children's charity and i asked him how his the spend the annual spend of that charity was distributed between the work of the charity the purpose of the charity and the support functions and he said about eighty twenty
now i have to tell you that last year we raised a hundred and thirteen million pounds and of that over ninety per cent that's a hundred and four million pounds were actually spent on projects for children and i'm very proud of that ratio indeed and i think it ought to give you the UNK of money a great deal of comfort because for a fund with two headquarters buildings which operates all over the world this is a distribution of funds of which to be proud
now i've met not many yet but very impressive a few very impressive field workers
i've not had a chance to visit abroad yet but i think i've got two visits booked next year to various UNK parts of the world but i've met some who are on leave UNK from the circumstances they've been in sometimes illness sometimes just the sheer tension of being under fire
each country presents its challenges some physically demanding others morale UNK there is disease there are primitive conditions in which to live and work
i'd just like to mention one UNK
i'd like to pay a tribute to the courage of our people there both the UNK er workers for the fund and the ex UNK who've gone out there to lead that work
we're in touch with them every day they refuse to leave and we're very grateful to them for their efforts
but those in the field the front line could not continue without the less than UNK work that has to be carried out back here in h q they also serve who work in our offices collect our money keep our accounts make sure the administration is working well
produce the educational material which is superb
and i visited both offices and i'm most impressed by the UNK dedication and sheer hard work and efficiency of the people i've met
but the people i want to thank most are you the volunteers
people without whom we wouldn't be able to raise so much money
it's your UNK efforts as fund UNK that enable save the children fund to survive
if children are to be helped in the u k and throughout the world then we all have to succeed in persuading people to donate
those who work in our shops those who arrange events those who collect great and small sums of money from companies and from individuals are all playing a vital part in the continuing work of save the children fund
i think we call er the volunteers or those who run the shops anyway UNK army and that is in my way a tribute to sally UNK who's chairman of our branches advisory committee and does so much to make sure that the money does get raised in the field
it's a chairman's very pleasant duty to thank you all
as you will know we're given large sums of money by governments the e c and others to work in countries in need to tackle specific tasks
but the money that comes in that way never fully covers the expenses involved in supporting our efforts in those countries
the money you raise therefore is extremely important in enabling the s c f to tackle major tasks
without that money we would not carry on and we could not carry out our work effectively
i therefore am thanking you not just as a courtesy but in order to convey just how important your efforts are and just how important the seventy fifth birthday appeal is going to be next year
if that UNK we really will be able to maintain the momentum of the fund and the work that it does throughout the world
if we don't raise our targets we shall UNK but i'm absolutely confident from all the news that comes in from the field that we shall raise our targets
i know that plans are well advanced throughout the country for a massive collecting effort next year and i want to wish all of you involved all the very best in your efforts as we approach these days that's to say donation days in the coming year
i'm sure your spirits will rise to the occasion like the UNK in our UNK and the UNK at the side here
rise to the occasion
but i cannot finish er without also thanking most UNK our supreme supporter in the task of fund raising her royal highness
i know you will agree with me that her example is UNK to us all
save the children fund and children throughout the world have every reason to be grateful for her UNK efforts
it's not often a chairman has the chance to thank her royal highness publicly and i do so with pleasure now
and now to illustrate aspects of save the children's fund and its long term health work here now is a short video shot on location in UNK in southern africa and in UNK in UNK
thank you
save the children's work is not just about dealing with emergency situations
it is mainly concerned with long term development
UNK is one of the poorest countries in the world surrounded by south africa it has few of its own resources
in places like this poor water supply and UNK is a major cause of death
contaminated water kills more people than any poison
nine thousand children a day die from one of six UNK diseases around the world
to combat these problems needs a UNK and effective approach
UNK is one of eight countries across the UNK in which save the children has introduced the riders for health project working with the ministry of health a successful programme has been developed which provides primary health care to almost five times as many villages that could have been reached on foot
the save the children fund programme with the UNK has made a very big difference to the number of visits that health assistants can make to villages
before they had the UNK they had to walk which meant a lot of travelling time and then less time at the each village when they arrived
now with the UNK they spend less time travelling and they can spend more time in the villages doing their educational and health work
we found that the number of visits that on average that they can do has increased by four or five hundred per cent
in fact they couldn't really do their job without the UNK
previous attempts to start the project before nineteen ninety had failed because of poor maintenance to the UNK and accidents
by introducing specialist training and good management the UNK have been used extensively
that's good well forwards excellent well done very good
the learning process from this project has been invaluable and it's allowed save the children to move forward in several other countries
recent research into how governments and UNK contribute to the provision of health services shows that effective long term systems need to be put into place
these can be worked through with local cooperation
riders for health is a good example of what can be achieved through good planning
i think that the riders for health project has given us ah a model that can be used in a great many other situations and we've found here in UNK that many other UNK and government departments are interested in what we're doing because the UNK if used properly can provide a very cost effective form of transport
it is their work in the villages which is most impressive
the local health workers are able to spread basic advice on health and UNK as well as providing cheap but effective medicine such as UNK and UNK salts
most importantly the workers help to improve the local water supply
clean water saves more lives than any medicine that can be provided by the human race so far
UNK is three years old
she lives in a remote village ten kilometres from a UNK road
she now has clean water from a pump that UNK her health advisor helped the village to organise and build
it is these basic measures which can make a difference to saving lives all over the world
each year five million children die from the lethal effects of diarrhoea four million from UNK diseases like t b and UNK
it is through prevention that save the children can make the greatest impact on life
but it's not just in africa where children are under threat from poverty and disease
in the u k save the children has shown the link between a poor environment and poor health
UNK is a housing estate in UNK where one in three adult males are unemployed
health is a big issue here
UNK has the fourth highest number of smoking related deaths in the u k low birth weights are more common
well obviously unemployment is very high in the north east and er all the major health indicators are related directly to income
so consequently er poor people live shorter lives and they suffer more UNK illnesses
and this is also er true of the children
twins rachel and UNK seen here at just over a year old live on the estate with their mother carol
when the twins learned to climb up the stairs carol was terrified they might have an accident
she probably could never have afforded a UNK so save the children lent her the equipment from its safety loan scheme
the safety gates have made a big difference since i've UNK them erm i've got peace of mind for the stairs and i can answer the phone and i haven't got to like keep trying to pull them downstairs and do different things
the family centre provides a place for people to get practical help and advice with their problems within walking distance
save the children have developed in this area
i mean before they came to the centre i think people felt save the children only did work in countries abroad
makes us all realise what a good job save the children do in our country as well
whether it's the u k or africa simple and appropriate solutions with the cooperation of local communities can have the most dramatic effects in improving the lives of our children
it is in these areas that save the children has consistently moved forward through developing long term strategies which are being added to and developed year after year
your royal highness ladies and gentlemen good morning
i am michael taylor and i'm the director of the united kingdom and european programmes department of the save the children fund
what we've just seen UNK up for me some positive messages of direct impact upon children and young people's lives through our work in this country and overseas
this is very much my experience of this organisation in the eight months i've worked here
prior to coming to save the children through the media i was more aware of your work the emergency work all over the world
as director of social services for the london borough of UNK i knew of the work with refugees in my role in UNK i was responsible for services for child UNK at heathrow airport and i worked closely with save the children on the successful effort to get specific recognition for asylum seeking children in the asylum and immigration appeals act
what i didn't know was of the ninety plus pieces of work both large and small which save the children undertook in the united kingdom
i believe an important issue for all of us in the run up to and throughout the seventy fifth birthday is the need to increase the understanding and raise the profile and the value placed upon our work in the united kingdom
i feel we UNK achieved significant progress if we have turned i didn't know you worked in the united kingdom into it's good to know that the rights and needs of children are just as important to you in the united kingdom as they are overseas
for me this has been a very exciting year in which to take on a UNK of the department
this is both in respect of the run up to the seventy fifth birthday and also with the increase in responsibility to take on the remit for the development of our work in relation to the european community central and eastern europe
we have already have significant contact through the international save the children alliance partners in europe and we have representation on the european forum for child welfare
on particular issues such as work with UNK children and work with UNK and UNK families there is already established european UNK
it seems to me there is a massive potential to develop opportunities for practice sharing across europe and for practice and policy initiatives of the former u k department to be assessed and developed in the european framework
specifically though the european programmes division with the department will lead the development of our programmes in eastern europe
this will be done in partnership at all times with the in country non UNK non UNK organisations where such exist or where they can be developed with governments and where appropriate with european and international agencies
the massive changes brought about by the ending of the cold war and by the collapse of state mechanism in some eastern european countries opens up a significant opportunity to undertake work in the very near future
save the children fund has been involved already directly in partnership and with other international save the children members in providing direct and emergency aid to former yugoslavia
however i think it's important to stress that right from the early days of the conflict we had determined not to be involved in providing large scale emergency relief
this was primarily due to a concern that given commitments elsewhere we did not have the UNK support and any activity in former yugoslavia would mean a major diversion from a already established programmes overseas
however this summer a temporary programme coordinator has visited the region and a short term programme of material support to children's homes has been provided and we are now working to put other facilities in s to institutions in UNK and are hoping that through the restructuring of children's services when the conflict is over and we believe obviously that may be some off that we can UNK can contribute to meeting the longer term needs of children in that war torn zone
in UNK a UNK has been advising staff in UNK camps as to how to respond to the needs of UNK children
in UNK we are supporting an agency which provides direct assistance to UNK families and to young people
this work in former yugoslavia will become an established part of our european programme
in UNK we are planning to work with UNK save the children and to help the UNK government in its juvenile justice system which is sadly in need of major development and change
we're also engaged with the european community in discussion over a bid for funding to develop social work child protection and alternatives to institutional care and to other child care systems within UNK
this work again will be undertaken in partnership with non UNK child care organisations in that country
through g contacts already established throughout the u k department links have been d established and developed with work in poland russia and UNK and we're working to assess the policy practice development or programme contribution we might make in those european countries
i believe our credibility and our strength in these new initiatives in europe flow from our status as an international development agency and from our high quality work in projects in the united kingdom
i'd now like you to hear directly from a young person for whom access to one of our projects in the united kingdom has made major changes in her life
to caroline home is a room for her possessions abandoned by her mum and dad as a baby she spent her life moving from one set of parents to another
when you haven't got no one you have to sort of like find a way of doing it for yourself and it's much harder
today caroline lives alone in a room in oxford
without family guidance she sometimes finds it hard to manage especially money
while some of her friends have taken drugs UNK been in trouble with the police for stealing from shops
in the beginning i did it to look good cos i wanted the money towards the end it was doing it to live it was literally doing it to live
i hated doing it
i used to go into a shop and i'd shake and i'd know that i was doing wrong and i'd be really scared and i'd just knew i don't want to go to prison so i decide to stop it
now when she needs a hand caroline turns to life chance
a partnership between save the children social and youth services it helps youngsters help themselves by turning UNK into action
really we're trying to give young people a voice put them in the driving seat
gradually it sort of like brings people out of themselves and do you know what i mean they learn to do things
whilst as a worker i might see the process to me very important i think there's a lot of concrete outcomes for young people feel we have achieved this we did this for ourselves it's ours we own it
you've gone and achieved something you feel like you've done something good you feel like you're somebody
this is when i was pregnant went to put my name down on the housing list and they said to me sorry you can't we've got too many people on there already
life chance workers hope this can homeless teenagers who will be the next to benefit from the project
building up trust and friendship takes time but for hundreds makes life chance a UNK
i think that UNK experience as portrayed in that video is not unusual
many children and young people get caught up in crime
either through the necessity to obtain items which they believe are essential or through a desire to be one of the gang and valued by their UNK
interestingly caroline expressed both those needs at different times during that presentation
children who are caught up in crime are getting a lot of media attention lately
many people say that the solution is to take the young person who has committed a crime out of their community and lock them away that will achieve a solution
save the children UNK years of experience shows it doesn't work and indeed that form of UNK can lead to some of the tragic circumstances of self image damage and even death which have occurred in UNK institutions and been reported recently
we've also we believe got concrete evidence to show that community based alternatives do work
at UNK park in the north east of england we offer classes in motorbike maintenance and land conservation to young people
they build on young people's skills and confidence so they feel that they have something to offer to the world and to their own community
latest figures show an overall twenty seven per cent decrease in crimes reported in that area since the project began
because of our experience at UNK park and in many other projects in the twelve years we have been working with young offenders we along with the other children's charities oppose the government's proposals on persistent young offenders
kenneth clarke when home secretary announced the establishment of secure training centres where young people aged up to fifteen years could be UNK for a period of up to two years
we took the view that this was a UNK use both of the finances required as it would divert money away from community provision but also that there were no success criteria guaranteed other than removal from community
the children engaged in crime often come from families where there is high unemployment already and where the prospects of employment are actually denied school UNK
they're children and young people with a very poor self image and where their investment in the education system has probably been partial to say the least
there is little out of school provision and where the youth service is actually suffering savage cuts in terms of local government finance
projects such as UNK park have shown that there can be alternative provision and that you can meet the needs of children and young people and respond to those in their own community and develop the investment in that community
in taking this view we are not denying that the loss of liberty may actually be necessary in a few extreme cases and this should only be where the child presents a significant danger to him or herself or where there is a significant risk of major further UNK and severe damage to community
these UNK are very rare and actually UNK through the courts do exist using the care facilities which are already available to the local authorities and the secure accommodation
we know that custody does not stop young people committing crimes when their sentence is over
seventy five per cent of young people released from custody re UNK within two years
we believe and we know that re UNK rates after secure UNK are much higher than after community based schemes and the well being and safety of children we believe can be UNK by UNK in secure provision
because of that view and because of the UNK which we as an organisation UNK we chose to challenge the position that the home secretary had adopted and raised we believe the debate in the media and in the parliamentary setting of what should be provided to meet the er needs of young people
we've demonstrated the direct link between investing in community support and reduced crime levels and we believe that programme valued as it is in local communities has a message larger and wider for policy makers in the united kingdom
we recently had a similar experience in terms of a media debate and entering into it in our work with lone parents
reading some sections of the media recently children of lone parents are talked about as if they're nothing but a drain on state resources
as an organisation we believe that children in these circumstances may well need support but they're also a real resource to our society an investment in children's welfare and children's education is a sound investment in the country's future
recently government ministers and the media have tended to concentrate on the small minority of very young women who have had babies and who live on their own
in fact according to government statistics only two per cent of lone parents are aged under twenty
the majority of lone parents are older divorced separated or UNK women
in reading the media recently one would believe that those figures were actually reversed
housing policy in this country has traditionally given priority to children's needs and we would find it very worrying if that priority were eroded in any way by the introductions of policies aiming to discriminate against children in one setting i e children of lone parent families
a recent report by the institute of housing managers confirmed that no specific priority is given in the analysis of housing need an and the UNK of points by which housing is allocated
but again the suggestion through the media would be that in order to gain top priority you need to be a young single parent with at least one child
we consider that UNK policies such as cutting benefit payments or not providing adequate housing for lone parents or their children would immediately damage the health and well being of children and we consider that in itself is contrary to the u n convention on the rights of the child
we will continue to encourage government to take positive steps to improve the situation of families in poverty like providing better child care and better support services to families and maintaining and improving benefits at a level which actually ensure economic stability and UNK that housing safe and proper housing is available for all children in our society
our experience at our projects demonstrates that given the opportunity lone parents like any parents want to improve the situation of their children by working and by not being dependent upon benefits
at the UNK project in london and the UNK project in glasgow for example mothers are provided with adequate child care and it enables them to attend courses and gain skills and qualifications that give them a better chance in the job market
the very positive self image the change during the first week that single parents experience those courses is absolutely striking
we believe that the children of all lone parents can best be helped by po policies which support their commitment to their family and their children and UNK out of poverty should be built which ensure that all families living in poverty have the chance to change their situation
like your chairman i am a UNK to the fund and my induction experience has not been limited to the division offices in the united kingdom or visiting projects in the united kingdom
in july of this year along with the overseas director mike UNK i spent seven days in UNK
we visited both city and rural programmes and were struck by the amazing capacity of the people to overcome UNK both natural disasters and the extremes of poverty
the desire in all the work which we saw there was to extend to develop and to move ahead with new ideas to meet needs
the video which follows now UNK some of our work in UNK and i'll provide the commentary upon it
UNK is a large industrial city in south western UNK
it attracts many UNK families from the surrounding rural areas and as such is similar to many of the cities in UNK
people flood to the city seeking employment seeking security and actually trying to find a means of UNK family life
many seek employment in UNK manufacture in working with textiles in stone breaking in ship building metal working and in paper manufacture
the UNK people live in have open UNK housing poor UNK and UNK drainage
eight hundred to a thousand people will live in a dense area and are subject to the UNK of government and landlords
UNK are UNK overnight on occasions to make way for new developments
these people live amongst the UNK residential areas in all of the cities of UNK
the seasonal UNK bring a UNK in the living conditions and without effective drainage sewage UNK into the homes
children are more UNK to disease
these were the conditions in the UNK which we visited in UNK
UNK these circumstances save the children fund UNK are providing primary UNK programme for UNK mothers and young children
local clinic staff are appointed from the community itself and they provide UNK family planning a UNK and post UNK services
more importantly they provide training for local volunteers and they give health education advice
this has led to a fall in the emergency attendances with almost a hundred per cent registration rates from local UNK families
what's more these families are paying for the clinic service that they have come to appreciate
the clinic staff make weekly visits to every UNK home providing effective follow up to clinic visits whilst encouraging good health practices at home too
there is a massive investment in health education and in improving diet
the clinic has acted as a strong focus for UNK living mothers to campaign for improved conditions in their UNK
for example making arrangements to cover up open UNK
as a collective people are contributing financially to the installation of new tube wells
the cleaner water supply has UNK dramatic effects on the children's health
every clinic UNK regular surveys to monitor the effects of the programme proving that infant mortality rates have dropped whilst UNK and UNK have decreased too
mike and i saw a very young child being washed at a tube well those UNK us round the site were very impressed by this the child was rather UNK and surprised as normally it was taken down to the river to be washed
women are now participating in credit saving schemes organised through save the children
in groups of five they each save weekly after which one of their number can take a loan and invest in an income generating project
each group opens their own joint bank account manages their own money does some basic budget planning and UNK to fill out the forms and paperwork necessary to record all the transactions and keep track of the state of the fund and their management of it
we saw numerous examples where people bought equipment
for example UNK has bought a sewing machine
this will give her financial independence and a steady income
she has UNK the debt and now has sufficient money on which to live
UNK and her daughter purchased the materials necessary to men to make UNK sticks and again have achieved a degree of financial independence which six months before could not have been expected
some people use the money to buy fishing UNK
our integrated health programme has provided a UNK for UNK families to have a hand in controlling their environment and working together to benefit each other
free of money UNK and learning to save and contribute financially to their own programme is an important step towards long term self sustainability
thank you
thank you very much indeed mike for that excellent presentation
and now i would like to ask her royal highness to come to the platform and address us
thank you very much ma'am
chairman ladies and gentlemen
well i'm delighted to see so many of you have taken the trouble to come and join us today for yet another annual public meeting and in welcoming you can i give a particular welcome to our new chairman mike UNK thank him very much indeed for joining us
he has an excellent background in support not involved in the running but continuous interest and support and for him to take on this challenge shows a particular kind of commitment to the work of the save the children fund and we're very grateful to him for taking it on and i sincerely hope that he will enjoy the experience especially after meeting all of you today
mike thank you for joining us
today is an important occasion for the fund
it always is er a moment to reflect to look forward to renew UNK to UNK the batteries to get new ideas and that's quite right and this public meeting marks the eve of a particularly important year for all of us at the save the children fund
our seventy fifth birthday year
i hope it will be a birthday year in every way er but it's not just a good excuse to have a party there is very serious intent behind this birthday
when UNK launched the save the children fund in may nineteen one of her aims was for the fund to work for its own UNK
seventy five years on that day seems more distant than ever
UNK also said that children are always the first to suffer and that is certainly as true today as it was then which means that the save the children UNK work is needed now as much as it was then
b but the funds to support this work are harder to come by and you don't need me to tell you that
yet the need is such that our spending at home and overseas has doubled in the last two years and still vital pieces of work in the u k and overseas UNK funding
the sad reality is that nearly seventy years after UNK drafted the world's first charter of children's rights the charter which became the foundation for the nineteen eighty nine u n convention
children's rights to health to a good education to safety to a secure childhood are still threatened
in short children across the UNK are facing pressures and conditions that are no longer considered acceptable to an international community that sees so much suffering around the world
they want to do something
i believe with our experience that the save the children fund can do something positive that will last
we urgently need funds to be able to respond effectively and to meet the increased demands being made on us as well as to maintain our existing work
that's why save the children is marking this seventy fifth birthday year with the biggest and most important fund raising appeal in the UNK history
our target is to raise in cash and in UNK an additional twenty five million pounds over and above our normal UNK
but before i talk in more detail about how we hope to raise this money let me spend a little time explaining why i feel that this appeal is so vital to children everywhere
i need hardly remind you of the many UNK that save the children has responded to in recent years
the most recent was for UNK and you responded UNK helping to raise over five million pounds for relief work
but as you know the needs of the world's children go far beyond the immediate UNK like those in UNK or UNK
the need for sustainable health education and welfare services is as acute as ever
children in the united kingdom face different sorts of problems but they too are under threat
parents need help with their own lives so that their children don't suffer from the unemployment and homelessness that contribute to ill health and an unsafe living environment that too many children have to live with today
it is only by establishing and maintaining development programmes and by working in conjunction with families with communities and with governments that we can begin to achieve lasting improvements which tackle the root causes of the poverty and inequality that threaten so many children
investing in human resources is a fundamental part of that process too
it helps to promote the political stability and economic growth that is an essential UNK to any kind of lasting change
but as you know the save the children is just one development organisation and with limited resources so a major part of our task is to use our influence and authority to press for change on a wider scale by keeping the issues of poverty and inequality and of children firmly on the international agenda
UNK in north west india very distant remote UNK a harsh environment for any child to grow up in
most villages are UNK over ten thousand feet up in the UNK
many can be reached only by walking for several days along UNK footpaths and they may be cut off half the year by snow
in winter the temperature can drop to minus forty degrees UNK
UNK live from farming and UNK and believe me they know how to do this
they know how to cope and they have very sophisticated forms of UNK
but although they are largely self sufficient needless to say UNK in these sort of conditions and communities are on a knife edge
the growing season is short and the tiny fields are extremely difficult to plough
for health and welfare most villages depend on village UNK
but unless this is combined with techniques like UNK and knowledge of oral UNK diseases like UNK and diarrhoea are child UNK
to net to get an education beyond primary level children have to leave their village primary schools because the terms UNK with the peak agricultural seasons
save the children d went into UNK fifteen years ago to provide emergency feeding for UNK children
today that emergency programme has evolved into a broad based community programme focusing on health education and economic status and training of teachers and health workers
to give UNK children a better start in life means supporting services that work in harmony with local structures and UNK
now there is primary health care for all mothers and children however remote their community
families have become involved in income generating schemes and children have better access to education and in all these areas the UNK particularly women work closely with staff to play an active part in the development of their own community and the securing of their children's future
now a glasgow inner city area UNK may seem light years away from all this but in many ways the need is just as acute
and they are still a community under pressure
UNK in glasgow where unemployment is high the housing is high and poor and there are few safe areas and precious little UNK provision
many of the residents are single parents who often feel isolated and trapped and unable to improve their situation
save the children's UNK project which i visited in june is working with parents and children providing quality child care with individual attention for each child and offering courses in computing and child care for women to improve their skills and equally important their confidence
in other words giving people the raw materials to improve their lives and safeguard their children's future
both of these UNK are successes in their own right
they apply to different communities they have responded to different UNK needs but they also contribute to a UNK effect of achievement at national and international levels which will ultimately benefit the lives of many more children
they are setting standards of good practice that we in the save the children fund can then help to spread
these children the world over need your continued help and that is what this birthday appeal is all about
with seventy five years of working with children under our belt and with our many achievements on behalf of children with UNK schemes we have the experience and the expertise to achieve real and lasting change
so where do we start with the UNK task of raising an additional twenty five million pounds
i have little doubt that nineteen ninety four ninety five will be a challenge especially in today's economic climate
this is going to be a year when we will all have to go that extra mile for children
but i'm afraid your reputation UNK you are UNK for rising to challenges like these and i feel sure that you can build on your previous successes and that together we can and probably will do it
i will be launching the birthday year in january when i hope that among other things we might succeed in gaining recognition for UNK and our many achievements for children and i was delighted to be asked to chair the birthday advisory group and to be closely involved with activities during nineteen ninety four
one of the activities we have great hopes for is our private appeal which will run alongside our public UNK
this is a first for the save the children and we will be approaching wealthy individuals foundations and trusts for donations towards our work
that will not be easy because most of them are heavily involved in funding of all sorts of other organisations and they have their own interests
we will have to be very sure that we know what we're talking about when we meet them to persuade them that we need their funds more and we can make better use of them and we hope to raise around half of that twenty five million pounds from them
i'd like to take this opportunity to thank sir david UNK the chairman of s g UNK for UNK the private appeal
sir david is a long term supporter of save the children and has sat for many years on the industry and commerce group
and i'd also like to extend my thanks to his very able committee
our corporate members are ready but they very much need your help
we are relying on you and all the other volunteers around the u k in your contacts with the public to help make this year a success
you are the public face of the save the children fund
the people who have carried the fund raising banner throughout the years
the people at the fund raising coal face who have the skills and the expertise to ensure that our seventy fifth birthday year goes down in save the children's fund raising history
this year though we want to attract new supporters and search out people who haven't traditionally supported save the children as well as building on the commitment of our existing supporters
you are all familiar with our loyal supporters but what about those people on the UNK who may have given a donation or done something for save the children in the past but never really followed it up and there are the people who are interested who think it's a charity i feel i ought to support
let's see if we can move them on this year so that they start to think it's a charity i know i really want to support
what better time than a birthday year to persuade all these people to become active and long term supporters of the save the children
plans are well UNK for next year
i know that many of you have already come up with some interesting ideas on seventy fifth theme
many branches have already scheduled a range of exciting events based on the birthday in addition to the events that will be happening nationwide
like the thousands of birthday parties that we hope will take place on may the nineteenth
there will be more on all these UNK later today
other fund raising plans are well advanced too
i'm delighted that our old friends at UNK a founder corporate member of save the children are once again lending their generous support
in nineteen ninety four they are making us their charity of the year and offering to work with us across the u k to help raise an extra million
i would also like to thank another of our corporate members UNK limited
over the past eighteen months UNK and save the children have worked very successfully together UNK three UNK nationwide UNK and running a promotion on chocolate bars
i think that was probably the most popular
as our seventy fifth birthday approaches UNK hopes to stage more events and UNK to help us meet our seventy five million t pound target and meet our commitment to the world's children
all in all it promises to be an exciting enjoyable and hard working year for save the children and all its supporters
it is going to be hard work
nobody would pretend that raising an additional twenty five million pounds is going to be easy but time and again you have risen to the challenge
we must make very sure we know what we're doing it for
it will help to remind ourselves of the challenge that UNK took up
her clear sighted approach to bring long lasting help to mothers and children so that children could benefit wherever they were whatever their country their colour their situation urban or rural their culture their religion their society in the sense of its development and their expectations and their infrastructure
she was frustrated by short term UNK
when knowledge of basic principles might cure for future generations many diseases and even UNK and that education might set solid foundations for extending and repeating that knowledge as well as the economic viability of the community and a sense of responsibility
a sense of responsibility in the children that we help that they all grow up to be responsible adults
in seventy five years the fund has remained true to her principles and yet it is as UNK as she ever was
i hope she would be pleased by our efforts in spite of the fact that we are still here and needed
i know she would be proud of you the fund UNK who make it possible
as you set about making your plans for next year let me leave you with this thought from UNK if children of any country are physically or morally abandoned the whole world loses by it and the whole world gains if children grow up healthy capable and ready to work for the good of their neighbours
good luck
thank you very much indeed for that superb key note address
and now let us proceed with the next business of the day it gives me great pleasure your royal highness to er invite you to present several save the children awards this morning
these awards are given in recognition of outstanding services to children

when she has finished sally UNK branches advisory committee chairman will make her presentation
thank you very much
your royal highness ladies and gentlemen
it is a particular privilege for me to be here today and part of me feels not totally qualified
i have over the years sent my postal order regularly and it wasn't until two years ago that i became more actively involved in the work of save the children fund raising
i was invited to give an entertainment at the bristol old UNK theatre the wonderful old theatre royal the oldest UNK theatre still being used in the country and one of the oldest in the world a very beautiful place erm and i was asked if i would do an entertainment that i have called come for the ride which i was persuaded to UNK by my home town of UNK in the north west of england
i did it there originally and then did it at UNK all over the country
i have a particular affection for bristol and the west country i'd like you know that those of you who've come all the way to london from the west and i so i was very happy to have this evening and be able with er an UNK and musical director to provide entertainment that would raise money
i was told early on that it was possible that your royal highness would be able to be there and indeed you were and it gave us all one of the most UNK nights
i remember after the show you spoke for twelve minutes without a note and not only that but you came round afterwards and spent eight or ten minutes with us the artists which absolutely made our evening
it seems to me that attention to the moment is significant of the great work that you do for this particular charity
now i recently have UNK unto myself a UNK that i didn't originally seek
and certainly didn't expect but everywhere i go it comes at me
it gives me great pleasure because people are extremely kind and extremely generous
we're very obsessed with things called viewing figures in television and i worked out quite simply that if everybody among the eleven million people who are supposed to view keeping up UNK every sunday UNK a penny into a money box for save the children fund one sunday night that would raise a hundred and ten thousand pounds within an hour now why don't we get going and encourage people to do that
multiply that by seven and it's seven hundred and seventy thousand pounds
what we are able to do in my job is to do what i was happy to do which is to give a performance in aid of a charity one soon UNK how to UNK one's energy and in which direction to focus it
earlier this year on april the twenty second her royal highness the princess royal UNK various representatives from the world of entertainment and sport and UNK at UNK palace
we had the most wonderful evening it began with a film show an extremely well er composed film to do with the work that is being done the variety of work that is being done in the variety of places
various reports a plea for support a plea for interest particularly for the seventy fifth anniversary year next year and after that we had the most lovely party
i have a list here of people in my particular part of the profession who have UNK themselves to assist with the great drive forward for the seventy fifth anniversary
a number of UNK were appearing in the UNK sponsored UNK around the country and supporting the save the children fund raising activities
these include UNK joseph jeff UNK bobby UNK john UNK and UNK and ian UNK
pam UNK from the darling UNK of may is actively supporting the fund and will help with UNK and er fund raising UNK and fund raising in the birthday year
UNK the comedy UNK has been advising on the seventy fifth birthday plans with television book and consumer magazine support she'll be visiting UNK in october with a b c television crew to film a UNK and will be visiting and UNK save the children fund projects while she's there
UNK tessa UNK and linda UNK all lent their support to this year's UNK and we look forward to their continued support in our birthday year
next year i am going to be very active in the theatre and i've already this morning UNK the seed er for possibly er giving a particular performance er of one of the plays in this particular season i'm going to do er for save the children fund and i've said
i've said move fast get on with it
william UNK nearly two hundred years ago wrote this my heart UNK up when i behold a UNK in the sky
so it was when my life began so it is now that i am a man
so be it when i shall grow old or let me die
the child is father of the man
and that is what it seems to me is the purpose of all our support for this fund
i've been particularly impressed with the officials and executives and workers that i've met
i've been particularly impressed today to learn how people come here every year particularly for this meeting and of all the various ways in which money can be raised
the money is there we know this
i always say that we all spend our money on what we really want to spend it on and put a bit by for what we really desire to achieve
it is wonderful all the work that you do
and i applaud and admire it
i am here partly because i was fortunate enough to have the UNK and UNK of UNK and i see it as a very happy obligation to try to do my best to ensure that all over the world it is possible for other children to enjoy something of what i had
god bless you all and i hope to be walking alongside you during the seventy fifth year anniversary efforts
in sri UNK thousand of families have moved from the countryside to the capital UNK in search of a better life
instead they find nowhere to live nothing to eat and poor health and education
save the children is helping families to rebuild the UNK to make a better life for themselves and the next generation
in the UNK cities are surrounded by huge camps filled with victims of a five year long civil war
it's a poor part of africa but most of its problems are man made
fighting has cut off supplies to the refugees
save the children works with organisations like the red cross to restore that life line
poor children in UNK often fall UNK to drugs dealers who offer them clothes and shoes in return for carrying drugs
save the children helps youngsters living and working on the streets it runs schools where the poorest can get hot meals and lessons
just one more example of how save the children does just that all round the world
yes
those are some of the reasons why i and many others support save the children and thank you UNK for talking to us today it was a pleasure listening to you
hello everyone
once again it is lovely to see you all
well this is it next year is our seventy fifth birthday so today is one of our most important meetings we will ever have
it'll be a very challenging year for volunteers i'm sure you'll all agree
in the past year i've been invited by many of you to meet branch members and to make shop visits all over the united kingdom
it's been a privilege to have done this and i'm overwhelmed by the enthusiasm i've UNK
you save the children fund volunteers are determined not to let the recession beat you
the message i've given to london is that volunteers are in very good heart and it doesn't stop there
the really good thing is that there are a huge variety of plans for our big year
more of that later
but what about the last twelve months
what stories do our figures tell us
well while we were all delighted about the tremendous increase in income two years ago we were also a little concerned about how we should hold on to it but we have
last year branch income was on target at seven point eight million pounds a massive increase on the UNK of five to five and half million pounds we were on before skip lunch
congratulations to you all
and the shops well there are now one hundred and fifty nine shops
together they have raised five point seven million pounds last year a wonderful result and thank you all
i particularly want to highlight the shop cash donations
we've introduced a new donations box and some shops have special donations secretaries and many helpers encourage donations too
what a success story
shop cash donations have gone up from five hundred and sixty three thousand to six hundred and twenty nine thousand a marvellous increase
right erm eighteenth of january er department of finance and administration UNK meeting
er great north house northern development company
o k UNK would you care to kick off
yes o k erm i brought what i thought would be a help from last week
did your report back we didn't have a meeting the first week did we
UNK and i wasn't in the last week so i doubt whether
do you want one on last week
it's all there i assume
o k right o k yes
erm the quarterly report went out towards the end of that first week erm with the annual finance statements erm we're UNK quite encouraging because of the erm s and e enquiries were actually done on his proportion for once
only just but because er a hundred and eleven if the UNK a hundred and six or UNK which is quite good and obviously december was really quiet but then that's standard anyway because quite possibly not because it was sort of erm he's shown with an which didn't
so it's something folded back on one side yes
i mean it's not that vital to me but i hadn't
yes
yes
but i'm not surprised so erm in our previous visit they did give us
then was down in middlesbrough for a couple of days that week and er i think UNK everybody by calling it miserable all the time i dread to think what
i told you how he was on the phone that day i mean he hadn't the UNK idea of what he was doing or where he was going i don't know
i think he got on er quite well down there because he'd spent a few days up here he had a better idea of what he wanted to ask and what he wanted to talk about and so on but erm only because his UNK and
do you want to ring
ah right i don't i think it's now been called regional christmas day
makes a lot more sense o k
at mercury he UNK the sponsorship erm late last year
right i must get some literature actually from barry because as you know it we can't get it all out of the now
right oh and phil went to the stoke conference on that thursday and friday
he got bored silly and considered it a complete waste of time
which i did try to tell
erm i seem to remember that's the day that east anglia kind of just disappeared in
mm yes
that's right
i was supposed to have a meeting on with erm a couple of guys from the british coal enterprise down in middlesbrough with but unfortunately again the weather caught all of them out and they decided not to come but didn't occur to them to say they wouldn't come so i sat down there for an hour and eventually managed to find a phone number and get in contact and the guy was still there and he said oh no i'm not coming up
this was like quarter to twelve he should have been there at eleven o'clock
no he got stuck in london the night before because of the bad weather and he started saying oh i'm sorry i don't think i'm going to be able to make it
well i said i was a bit concerned i said it would be nice if you could let us know and
especially since you travel er twenty or thirty to get there
yes that's right yes i mean until you get there
i mean he knew that because he'd contacted me up here and i said well to make it easier for you we could meet in middlesbrough save you coming up from er mansfield
i said well it cuts the it cuts the journey in half then
i wasn't too happy about that but never mind
erm what else last week i had a meeting with mike and UNK from d t i and phil
i was looking forward to talk a bit about er what they're doing er in the way of seminars and so on this year and how we can tie in with it and how we're going to erm actually take over the forum plan for UNK
it's typical they just accepted it all so it didn't really achieve a great deal but mike told me quite a lot of things that i don't really have any idea or i didn't know about
what achievement of financial business will four year plan will it make anything else
i can't see that they can afford to be a high profile company
they're going to erm they're going to give the money towards running a forum but not a great deal and then it doesn't even cost that much it just really a question of erm UNK and twice yearly events or whatever
you don't think it'll be once they put the money
yes so it's you know it's like two UNK up once a quarter or whatever minutes and i'm paying for a lunch
you're thinking of direct costs but erm phil was going to ask jeff if he would chair it and also if he'd be willing to be sort of editor in chief of UNK so that was yesterday and i haven't seen phil since don't know what happened with that and went to him that it was a briefing meeting
yes
this individual just about won in fact it was over by ten past two
yes oh i yes i can see here yes that's only two
it's more than i saw of him
mhm
why i'm not sure
UNK
but erm yes so i still don't know what's happening with that yet and i'm waiting also for them to confirm a date for this first sort of do business in france seminar that we're going to help them with which was originally going to be february and is now going to be march
we think it was going to be the seventh and the eighth and the ninth and they've told newcastle city it's the ninth but she was meant to confirmed last wednesday and she's still not
so erm i've had a word
are export involved in this i mean it seems quite if they're not
mm yes but the trouble is they're not going to be interested in europe so they're not western europe
they don't know how useful it would be but anyway they said there there's it's a slightly odd event because it's actually going to be just in the civic centre and er and kind of UNK on some workshops and things so i'm going to help her with workshops and have a display stand and so on but other than that we've not really got any direct input into it because it is very much sort of you know this is how you do business in france these are the financial problems type of thing
it's just a good workshop yes
which i was for UNK off anyway because i don't think it's any of our business
i'm mean they've got export people that know about that and e c people one of those things
yes that's right so i said you know it's on a general level i said yes fine
but er other people start bringing up sort of problems with the french tax situation on such and such a structure of company or whatever which is not anything we want to get involved with
so i had a meeting with UNK to talk about the workshops and so on so we've UNK out the format and er and what we think we'd like to do but it's partly dependent on d t i because it is their event and we want to be seen to UNK it
erm i had a meeting with ian and erm do dorothy
mhm and told them that you wouldn't be your present arrangement
erm yes quite
they took it remarkably well really but er i think there needs to be soft there must be have contingency because UNK go up the wall over that
you know i don't know it was sort of well have a little bit of a boss at bill then as a UNK influence
in the past
i'm no help either i did sort of wonder what she'd say but she's
they've been sort of so UNK jolly in the past it UNK me
many successful shops seminars too
the topics discussed included how to attract new volunteers how to make the most of the window the shop layout how save the children spend the money and oh the list goes on
they were all very enjoyable and useful seminars
if you attended the lunchtime fringe meeting on shops you probably had even more food for thought
now looking for the future is there an opportunity on the shop front for further growth
here's a mini report
welcome to save the children in UNK where children from school have taken over the shop for a day
school is a big supporter of the save the children fund
princess anne is the president of the charity and she visited the school three years ago for the golden UNK
the children running the shop today are all aged eight and from the third year at school but how much do they know about what the shop does
erm it likes erm
not much it seems so i asked UNK janet to explain
the money we make in this shop goes to erm save the children fund which supports children in countries abroad particularly in africa where you've probably seen pictures on television
children starving children who are UNK children on the move refugees erm people that have nothing at all and a lot of the money is spent in this country erm particularly in cities very poor areas of the cities
the children learned how to do all the jobs that make a shop work
opening the boxes UNK the cards i've been on the UNK and serving the customer putting the things in bag
time to hand back to the grown ups
and time for this reporter to go back to school
congratulations and thank you to shop and branch volunteers large and small
you work so UNK for the fund many of you are in this hall today now and thousands more are not
please pass on our UNK thanks to them all
i would also like to thank the staff who work with and support the volunteers in so many ways
thank you for your help and guidance
so what will our birthday year be like for volunteers
challenging without doubt
because we need to raise twenty five percent more in branches and shop donations to hit our target
but the year should also be exciting and enjoyable too i hope
there is so much fund raising knowledge and experience amongst our volunteers
i was amazed during a recent visit to headquarters of the number of requests for posters and tickets i saw when i was UNK through that bible the design it file
the variety of events were as ever absolutely UNK
UNK in UNK book sales craft fairs cream UNK open gardens
in canterbury you could go to an evening of wine and wisdom
UNK branch held a wonderful UNK salmon supper
in UNK they chose UNK and UNK
on the music front scottish string UNK a UNK box UNK a opera were in store
this fund raising fair is our bread and butter and it is top quality
so for success in the seventy fifth i say to any volunteer who asks me do what you always do stick to your tried and tested methods because that's what you know best
but go for a little more
many of you have played what we come to call the seventy fifth game where we round up to seventy five
so if you used to charge fifty p for programmes consider could you charge seventy five p
if you held and event last year and fifty five people attended
could you go for seventy five this year
invite groups to raise seventy five pounds for us or seven hundred and fifty pounds or dare i say it seven thousand five hundred pounds
in shops could you select better quality goods for a seven pound fifty rail
and could the shop team keep shops open an extra seven and half hours in the best trading week for example
so please everyone put a little more into the seventy fifth and get more out
i now want to draw on some major fund raising themes directly linked to the seventy fifth
there are four national events some of which will be familiar
the first is save the children fund week
as you know the seventy fifth will be launched on the twenty sixth of april nineteen ninety four
can you make the most of the week and the wonderful opportunity we'll have for collecting in UNK stores
we have a real chance here
just look at your superb performance to date
nineteen ninety three save the children fund week raised nine hundred and forty six thousand pounds a UNK nine percent increase on the previous year
more branches than ever joined in six hundred and seventy four in all and UNK took place at more UNK than ever two hundred and twenty five
the increase has been steady thanks to all the tremendous effort put in by our volunteers and staff
i particularly want to mention the east anglia and east midlands region where a hundred percent of branches UNK yes an UNK to us all
in northern ireland where unfortunately there are no UNK stores there is a set target aimed at getting a minimum save the children fund week involvement in seventy five percent of branches
this is ambitious but i know you will do well knowing how UNK motivated and generous people of UNK northern ireland are
but where there isn't a branch near a UNK how can we make sure that the UNK are still carried out
well i want to encourage you to think of asking other groups you know to help and individuals too
if you can come up with lots of names let the nearest branch or your area organiser know
this is the way we'll meet our aim of covering all the four hundred and fifty UNK stores
the second event is our birthday parties
a fund raising idea of judy a volunteer from scotland the actual birthday is the nineteenth of may as you know to mark this we are asking all our supporters to hold a party for us on that day or as near to it as possible
it's a wonderful opportunity for volunteers in shops and branches and one off groups to contact all the people who've supported them and save the children over the years
we want it to be a day of celebration but not only that as with all parties we hope to receive presents but the presents must be money for save the children
i can't stress enough how we would love to get a hundred percent response for the parties from all our branches so get the UNK and the collecting bins out please and please make the most of the idea
thirdly there will be a national raffle with a car as the main prize
this year many branches are keen on the raffle arranged by ian the treasurer of UNK branch and david area organiser for yorkshire south
lots of you applied for and sold tickets and the winning ticket was drawn by the princess royal during the lunch period
in the right place a raffle can be a winner by persuading a friendly car dealer to loan you a car to put in a shopping centre or at a country show
many branches have raised a hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds a day or even more
check as there may be insurance problems but don't be put off or how about getting a dealer to supply a cardboard mock up of a car and using this it still UNK the attention
shops helpers are vital in selling raffle tickets too
so let's really all commit ourselves to the national raffle and make it the biggest and most successful raffle save the children has ever had
UNK on a musical note we are very fortunate that richard UNK is UNK a special piece of music for save the children the theme of course is childhood and we are putting together a menu of music and readings which will include this new piece
the idea is to invite UNK and musicians from all over the united kingdom to use our menu the sheet music and the pack of the fund raising ideas
to this end we will be working closely with music aid a group of volunteers from the music world who set up after the tragic UNK in the mid nineteen eighties
we will invite musicians and UNK to raise money for save the children
so many of our volunteers in branches and shops belong to or have links with UNK
we are calling on all our helpers both adults and children who enjoy music to spread the word or the song
look out for the pack it will be ready next spring in time for the events which will continue throughout the year with of course a big christmas push for all those carol concerts
so four major fund raising schemes and a lot is being planned locally by branches and by the councils in scotland northern ireland and wales
but also special seventy fifth birthday committees are UNK coordinating large special events involving branch and non branch volunteers like the youth music festival to be held in canterbury cathedral in nineteen ninety four
save the children really UNK and values the skills of fund UNK both volunteers and staff
your efforts and achievements are always UNK
let me just mention some of the ways in which you the volunteers are getting together UNK your skills and supporting each other generally in support of the seventy fifth
in london a deputy area representative UNK is working with a group of well established trading secretaries to encourage other branches less confident in trading to spread their wings
UNK is well supported in this by the staff and i would like to mention how much we appreciate the changes to the trading goods which have taken place in the last year
things have really taken off our whole output has gone up a UNK
if i had t to give one word to describe it would be quality
just look at our christmas catalogue
there has been a great improvement in the range of goods and cards i'm sure you'll all have noticed it too
on the education front i believe we've had one of the most successful ever branches residential meetings at bristol university
it was an opportunity to place save the children UNK current and future aim into historical context and for volunteers a valuable lesson in preparation for the seventy fifth
UNK available this year for the first time UNK the opportunities to attend
also throughout the united kingdom there are now school speakers training sessions
they began in scotland and to take just one example we are very lucky to have UNK an area representative coordinating the programme in the midlands
thank you UNK
so to summarise whatever the event whatever your skill whether you're a branch or a non branch volunteer i encourage you and everyone else to do something to save the children in nineteen ninety four
here's one example for this year of how save the children can work with others
the UNK pie costs nine pence the spotted dick is tuppence in fact all the prices of the staff cafe today were the same as they were sixty years ago that's because today is the UNK anniversary
so today we UNK back to what we used to do and it's traditional dishes which quite frankly what we build UNK on sausages UNK and UNK pie chips and peas
and the added twist is that the menu is at nineteen thirty three prices or a donation to the save the children fund
the cafe was opened by UNK sixty years ago it's now run by his son UNK
one shilling and ten pence
how much have you spent today then
i've spent one and ten pence old money and a donation of course
is that a bargain
that was an absolute bargain yeah
one and six please
there you are
who said the west UNK expensive at least one place in UNK here today where you can get a square meal for less than two bob
er that'll be one and six please
american express
you must be joking
save the children benefited from that event and the publicity because we were the quickest off the mark in responding to the star UNK request to help with their anniversary event
well that takes us on nicely to more interviews this time i'm coming down to meet members of the audience
can you hear me
first i am going to look for kathy
kathy is our area representative for sussex a very busy lady oh yes i see you
hello kathy i think first of all you should tell us what an area representative is
an area representative is a volunteer just like everybody here in this audience today and i act as a link between the branches and headquarters working with the area organiser but representing the branches for me personally in sussex
you're a very busy lady i know and i also believe that your area's got some fantastic ideas for the seventy fifth something to do with a special cake recipe
can you tell us about it
well when you say cake don't get the wrong ideas erm my idea of a cake the vision that i had of a three tier cake came to me as i was UNK home from a meeting across the downs and i had this vision of a three tier cake
the base of the cake was the branches us the foundation of save the children fund doing what we usually do but doing it very well and very professionally the UNK the coffee mornings the fashion shows the sort of thing that our reputation is built on
and then there was the second tier of the cake something a little bit different something a little bit more special for the seventy fifth year but still perhaps working on the tried and tested
then i saw the top tier of the cake and that has got to be the er piece de resistance i think as the french say and i know that some very exciting ideas are coming out of the south east region
in particular kent has put together a very interesting programme of a festival of food and drink which is taking place at UNK place near UNK wells the last weekend in june and again here at the UNK next year after this particular annual public meeting music aid who you mentioned earlier are putting on a concert er for save the children fund and they hope to raise twenty thousand pounds on that night
sussex is still working on its piece de resistance but i hope that we're going to get erm what we hope to do together very soon
isn't that wonderful er and thank you kathy for working so hard for us
now i'm going down
sally erm well scotland is very enthusiastic about the birthday appeal and we have five major events planned erm two in the glasgow area and two in edinburgh and one up at UNK and erm in all of these events we're actually pulling in on our people's expertise to widen our contacts so it's not just the fund members who are running these things
we've got a ladies UNK in glasgow for four hundred and the organiser ruth the chair of glasgow branch is being helped by two ladies from the business community erm linda from the UNK award and tessa who has her own marketing company so we're hoping to sort of pull in a lot of people from that erm judy the chair of scottish council is yet again holding her charlotte square ball erm this was very successful two years ago i think you know erm and we're hoping for the same success erm we are very lucky that the royal UNK show has chosen us to be er the charity this year for the gala UNK of the show erm this is er for three hundred people a UNK reception erm sponsored by the bank of scotland so that you go and see the flowers before the show opens the next day
so that's rather nice i don't think i'll have any difficulty selling the tickets for that
and then up at UNK we have a pro am UNK golf UNK and that's in conjunction with a dinner and a fashion show and yet again the interesting thing is that the scottish p g a is actually going to run the golf UNK for us so that's a great UNK
erm these are all very exclusive events and ticket events so we felt there was a need for a public event and erm what they say in glasgow something for ma pa and the UNK and so we're having a family fun day at UNK country park just south of glasgow at UNK
we're hoping and i'm crossing my fingers here that we'll get in excess of five thousand people there and the interesting thing is we've got a commercial exhibition at it to give it a flavour of scotland where people will show all the good things made in scotland and we're calling it the taste and touch of scotland and hopefully that will offset the cost of all the other er stalls and things that we're holding
so erm we're going to be very busy i think
i'm sure you are and thank you for being such a wonderful chairman
it's now my very great pleasure to look for UNK who's our shop leader of UNK shop
some of you from that part of the world will know that it's a wonderful little shop in fact it's a gold mine and UNK going to tell me a little bit about her recipe for running that shop
hello UNK
hello
i think i'll come and sit beside you as there's a spare seat
can you tell us a little bit about the recipe for running such a successful shop
yes i think that one of the most important things are to have a band of UNK helpful happy smiling volunteers behind the counter
it makes all the difference to the members of the public and the good will that it builds up is terribly important
the other things that are important are no cups of coffee no UNK on the table er my helpers don't wear trousers or UNK because helpers like the goods come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and some of them look good and some of them don't
erm there are all sorts of little rules the every black sack that comes in has to be gone through no matter how UNK somewhere inside it there might be some really very valuable piece of equipment
i think that's right
i'm sure some of you last year or least last week or even last month read about the black sack that had all the wonderful UNK in it that came into a charity shop and i think it's a lesson for us all isn't it not to miss anything in a black sack UNK
absolutely the other tip with black sacks is tip them out on the floor do not UNK the hand into it you get UNK and i have actually had teeth
so it's one of those things to be very wary of
the other thing is window dressing
window dressing is incredibly important change the window every other day if possible look for professional help in every aspect
hold special events erm linen sales UNK a UNK anything that's got an appeal to the public but do it through the window
i mean the seventy fifth we're going to be able to use the window to great advantage it's going to be a great display time
i'm sure she's right and i hope that's given some of the shop leaders who are sitting round about me some ideas
i think we can't emphasise too much the importance of the shop window don't you agree
oh i think so but above all i think that the helpers and their UNK are the other things that are so important after all they are the UNK of the fund
i know you've got some other amusing stories i don't know if we've time just to tell one more
have you got one other story to tell us about your shop
there are so many of them
one man came in took all his clothes off tried on a load of things and walked out in them
i think we'd better end the interview there don't you
th thank you UNK
oh no you've got something else to tell us
one further point is just remember UNK is big fashion so it's UNK
thank you UNK
now it's my very great pleasure to i think probably introduce the youngest member of our audience here today and a very good supporter of save the children erm i am sitting down soon beside UNK who's travelled all the way from norwich
hello UNK i'm going to ask you first of all how old are you are you six
no i'm seven
you're seven are you oh right
now you've had a very good idea for fund raising i believe haven't you and it's something to do with your UNK
wh what is it can you tell us about it
UNK always UNK his pockets
he UNK his pockets
well what does he keep in his pockets
money
lots of money
yes
i think you is it the pennies you collect
yes
and where do you put them when you collect them
in my jar
in your jar and i think you've also taken this jar to school haven't you
yes
are you going to tell me what you did with the jar at school
i think you asked all the children to help you didn't you
yes
and what did you do with that jar
you took it round the school
UNK
well if it was UNK what was it what did you do
tell us about what you did with your jar
i collected lots of money
that was very good and we heard somebody else talking about pennies and how important pennies were this afternoon UNK mentioned pennies as well
so with your pennies and her pennies i think we should all make a lot of money for save the children don't you
yes
good luck next year
are you going to do it again for the seventy fifth
yes
that's wonderful and thank you so much for coming today
i'm now going to look for another young person who's sitting here in our audience
i'm looking for UNK who's come all the way down from dundee to be with us today
she's a student at dundee university and has had some brilliant fund raising ideas amongst her friends at the university and she's here sitting in the front row
if i sit beside you i think that's easier hello UNK
hello
now i believe you've had a fashion show is that right
yes erm my sister and i organised a charity fashion show in aid of UNK last year
a and what made you raise money for UNK did you see something on television or
oh yes we saw the news reports found them rather disturbing erm we thought we'd do something to help and decided on a fashion show
erm we thought it'd appeal to young people and we thought it'd be great fun which it was and we raised er one thousand seven hundred pounds
congratulations
you told me earlier it was fun
what else did you do apart from the fashion show
erm well we had a big raffle erm we wrote away to all the local shops and UNK ask them to donate prizes and we raised a lot of money through that and also my mum erm cooked indian UNK which we sold during the interval erm which everyone loved and so it worked quite well
and i think there was a bit of dancing was there
yeah well we thought we would erm try and get the asian community involved and we included some UNK with asian clothes with asian music an tha that was all very UNK for the white people as well as the asian people in the audience
what a good idea and those of you sitting round who have a lot of asian students at your universities i'm sure that's a very good idea for you all to think about for next year
i think we want to be encouraging young people because you told me that they're all quite keen to do something for save the children fund now it's the seventy fifth year
would you like to say a little bit about that
oh yes i mean if there's that you're good at or if you've got a good idea that's simply fun i'm sure all young people would be really willing to help
thank you very much and thank you for coming down and talking to us today
thank you all
i have really enjoyed hearing your fund raising stories
everyone have a good seventy fifth year
keep up the good work and really rise to birthday challenge
the children are counting on it
thank you all and goodbye and i'd now like to thank hand over to nicholas UNK
thank you
thank you very much sally
watch it UNK silk
your royal highness ladies and gentlemen the foundations of save the children
may i begin this afternoon by adding my thanks to those of previous speakers for all that you've done to raise money for save the children during the past year you are tremendous
i have just completed a round of visits to most of the fund raising regions in england and wales and i've been most impressed by the UNK that are UNK to prepare for our seventy fifth birthday
of course UNK in themselves do not raise money
that together with the continuing recession explains why we are this year having a very tight year financially
this fact makes it UNK that we all succeed and have a tremendously successful seventy fifth
i have every faith in every one of you
if i had any criticism of our organisation it would be that we have a tendency to hide our light under a UNK
we seem somehow to be shy of shouting from the UNK of our many achievements over the years here in the united kingdom and overseas
last week last thursday saw the launch by the disasters emergency committee of which save the children is a part of another appeal for africa
among the ten african countries for which the appeal was made there was a mix of hope on the one hand hope for progress in UNK or UNK or UNK and on the other hand countries of despair UNK that we've heard about today or southern UNK and of course UNK
i'm certain that those of us who heard mike save the children's overseas director on the today programme or our field director in UNK on the evening television news yesterday can have hold nothing but pride what they had to say of save the children's work in that country a country described as the heart of darkness a country with the world's worse infant mortality rate
i was also UNK proud when UNK who UNK last week's b c d e c appeal told me that words could not describe the tremendously high quality of save the children's work in UNK and UNK which he had recently visited in order to film for the d e c appeal
that i believe was perhaps unfortunately obvious from the film itself
we do indeed thanks entirely to you all have a great track record
anything that you can do to support the d e c appeal for africa will be more than welcome
it has so far reached a total of rather over half a million pounds
as you well know our mission statement save the children's vision UNK us to using our experience gained here and overseas to achieve lasting benefits for children on a far wider scale than would be the case if we just confined our work to those children and families who happen to be involved in the projects we run
let us go back to the beginning to nineteen
for we can be rightly proud of one of UNK major achievements five years later that of drawing up the original first ever charter on the rights of the child and persuading the then league of nations to adopt it
as you know this early and UNK simple document eventually became the basis of the u n convention on the rights of the child adopted unanimously by the u n in nineteen eighty nine and since by the majority of member states as mentioned by the princess royal this morning
it is worth reflecting what a most remarkable contribution women have made to save the children throughout its seventy four years history
this fact reminds me of a tale i was told in the states recently whereby president clinton and his wife hilary and major kay drove into a garage quite why this was necessary the tale does not relate as the petrol or gas attendant began to fill up the UNK hilary clinton UNK out of the car and became involved in an UNK conversation with the petrol attendant
on her return to the car the president said how is it you know this petrol pump attendant so well
mrs clinton replied that she'd been at college with him and they'd had a very close relationship
the president UNK i don't think so
so claiming that had this relationship continued hilary would probably have ended up as the wife of a petrol pump UNK rather than the wife of the president of the united states
no recorded hilary had i married him he would have become president of the united states
moving on i am sorry we need to nineteen forty five which saw save the children's first involvement with pre school UNK here in the united kingdom
now a facility that is almost UNK available if often under funded
nine years later in nineteen fifty four s c f UNK hospital UNK and now again UNK if again under funded
twenty years later as many of you will remember save the children launched its stop UNK campaign which in turn led to UNK prevention becoming an integral part of world wide UNK programmes
how many lives has that have you saved
in nineteen ninety one we'll all recall the desperate scenes of our television screens of UNK refugees UNK up the mountains UNK from UNK saddam UNK
the delivery of essential supplies clothing food shelter to those people seemed ad hoc at best
it was this UNK that led s c f on the path to arguing for a reform of the international system for UNK relief
s c f has much experience to back up such an initiative
experience in UNK or UNK
we may indeed we have not always made ourselves popular in arguing for reform of UNK aid system but it has certainly been effective and we are never but never ignored
i was reminded of this in a recent UNK village a visit to the united nations in new york
i went to meet a friend in the UNK there for coffee
we got the coffee he paid for it and we walked to the UNK part of the canteen behind a sort of screen why here i said
i wouldn't be seen dead with you in here was his reply
in nineteen ninety s c f began its work providing facilities for UNK families in UNK road in belfast norwich prison UNK and here in UNK prison for women which i visited at the beginning of june
this has enabled s c f to persuade the home UNK prison department to run such facilities and budget for such facilities in every prison to be UNK and there appears to be no shortage of those or designed from UNK after
this very year save the children's reports making ends meet and our contribution to the world health survey have enabled radical alterations to be made to the world communities practice with regard first to UNK and food aid particularly in east africa and secondly to primary health care practice
this is a magnificent record thank you and in nineteen ninety three i would like to announce the day that save the children has been unanimously chosen by the charities aid foundation as its first UNK of the charity of the year award nineteen ninety three
this in my view is a tremendous tribute to everybody in this hall and the many thousand who cannot be with us today
well done
i'm proud in your name i shall be proud in your name to receive this award from the home secretary michael howard on four november at the UNK queen elizabeth hall here in london
well done you and a very special thanks to the princess royal without whose leadership it would not have been possibly at all
on a somewhat linked matter you will i am sure have read of the home office sponsored report on voluntary organisations or charities published last week
i do not want to waste your time today discussing this rubbish
i just want
i just want to let you know that chief among my criticisms of this report it is that it is a total insult to all of you who give of your time freely to a unique cause to which we all belong
to remove charitable status at a cost of some five million pounds a year to save the children fund to UNK us to the status of a quango is absolute UNK nonsense
let us give the report no more publicity it does not deserve it
europe has UNK large in the past year and i am delighted that save the children is among the first of united kingdom non UNK organisations to establish an office in brussels and mount a pan european operation
my thanks are due to all those including volunteers who have become engaged in this initiative
i am confident that in some ten years time save the children will be a strong pan european organisation perhaps the strongest as such within the european community
well at the end of the day all our work is for the benefit of children individual children individual human beings like you or like me
perhaps the most lasting memory i have of the past year is a conversation with a small nine year old boy in UNK in west africa in august
he was resident in an UNK which is supported by save the children
a boy who during the vicious war in UNK has seen first his mother and then his father his two elder brothers and his two elder sisters UNK in front of his eyes by the UNK troops
in the middle of this UNK he had UNK into the garden terrified
the soldiers sought him out he was not UNK but UNK into the army as a boy soldier
as he told me that he had killed perhaps ten eleven or twelve people during the course of the war
an UNK first nine years of life this was a little boy who had seen things that little boys and little girls should never see
thank god for the work that s c f is doing there his only hope through counselling of being able to regain any form of UNK
thank you very much
just before introducing our final speaker today i would wish because i would think you would want this for me to express thanks to the two key people on my staff who are responsible for organising today
which i think they call the a p o annual public
appointment linda UNK the minister for overseas development is unable to be with us today
she cannot get away from the house of lords because of important parliamentary business
i think i'm right in saying that she drew a very short straw and is the first reading in the lords of the bill to UNK the railways
we'll send her our good wishes shall we
but it gives me great pleasure to introduce mark UNK the parliamentary under secretary of state the foreign and commonwealth office a position he's held for some time
amongst his responsibilities are the relationships between the united nations and our government and of course for us his very special claim to UNK is that he is the younger brother of our former chairman simon UNK
your royal highness ladies and gentlemen
may i add first of all my apologies on behalf of UNK that she's not able due as we've heard to business in the lords to be with you today
i know she's disappointed as you are but may i coming in her place thank nicholas UNK and his colleagues for having me at the UNK at this important annual public meeting
