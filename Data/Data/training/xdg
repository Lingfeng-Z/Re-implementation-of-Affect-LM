this is a matter of personal conscience and what every member in the council chamber today must be aware of is that there is a UNK and committed group of people we know that because we've all had a great deal of communication from them and interestingly enough i have and most of the communication i've had has been in favour so victory people who write must be extremely UNK in with er marketing the that's not the point we all know that there is a committed and UNK group of people whose UNK do not lead them to the same conclusions as mr 's conscience and the issue really is do we in a liberal and democratic society have the right to impose our UNK on those of other people who live in the community and quite clearly and quite UNK take a different view
that's the issue
now i believe that you test the liberal democracy not by the ease with which UNK get their way but on the extent to which you accommodate the views of committed UNK and we've lived so long with majority rule UNK as democracy that we've forgotten that is more UNK to UNK than anything else
so for that reason i do not believe that i feeling strongly as i do should im impose my views on others
this issue comes up time and again for example there is an equally divided community in britain a divided position on matters like abortion
there are some people who say abortion is murder it should be not allowed
that there are others equally we say that we women to determine what happens to their own bodies and their UNK is for them i respect that view too but in those circumstances you don't resolve problems by the majority whatever it happens to be determining what the minority will do
you in fact leave the matter open so that each of us as individuals do what our personal UNK tell us
i would never hunt i will also not demand that anybody else UNK and i don't think other people should say to me what i should and what i should not do and i think that's the issue
mrs
thank you chairman
erm i would like to say at the start
i don't hunt
that makes a lot of horses in leicestershire very happy
what i would say chairman is that i will defend the right of the tenant farmers to make their own minds up just as much as i will defend the rights of council house tenants to say what goes on in their houses
it is the very same thing erm could i say that two people have written to me two of my constituents and i do agree that they have a point
they are asking that i should support the ban on fox hunting
one is a mr fox and the other one's a mrs fox the cards are here if you'd like to see them
i also chairman have the easy answer to the control of UNK
don't vote labour at the next election
right we've come to the end of the speakers we now have we now have the
wait a minute i'm coming to that
we now have the right of reply in the er second reserved remarks of mr er mayor er mrs and then finally mr
so will you like to come in now mr
not a lot to say mr chairman i think it's all been said one way or the other
but a few comments which seem to be UNK erm we don't want to kill animals with cruelty do we not
what about the UNK meat in this county where three years ago we had a meeting and they decided that animals that were UNK without being UNK with sheer terror who are allowed to UNK to death because this is what a particular group believed in and we did it
er mr brought UNK into it but no one had more UNK than india and the UNK and what about UNK where UNK were burned alive on the funeral UNK of their husbands and still leap and still the system was des er was stopped by the english just a moment the door was opened by mr talking about UNK we don't shut it on
UNK and UNK and all sorts of things
i also remember mr at a previous meeting told us we have no right to UNK on moat centre because we didn't live there
but you've got every right to UNK on the on the hunting even though you don't live there er mr i dunno UNK is this is this for the labour a free vote
i don't think the UNK know a free vote if it bit him on the leg
i accept the UNK is and so's the conservative but i'd be interested to know whether anyone allows a free vote ever in the liberal party
mr when he proposed this er amendment said precisely what it was
we are not talking about the merits and de merits of fox hunting we are not talking whether they die slowly or fast or what should be done
we are talking here about the rights of the tenant farmers to use the land which they have from you and what do you suggest that it be done
at the moment the tenant has the right to ban any fox hunting from his f er land if he wants to
that of course will go and what's more there's going to be some drag hunting on his land of which he will not be consulted because if you had to negotiate with organisations for controlled access to its land for the use of drag hunting
i presume a committee here will decide and sit as to which land shall have UNK drag hunting and the er the land the tenant will have no rights in that at all and if you're thinking you can control horses that are taking part in a drag hunt any more than you can control horses taking part in a fox hunt you've got to have another think
you'll still have the same trouble
you are taking rights away and you are giving them no consultation at all
this says quite clearly what mr moves
there's one person group of people not mentioned in his amendment in his proposition and that is the tenant farmers
can he remember moat centre
can you remember we had a UNK review
he went there and back and do nothing to the people bol er involved being consulted and we've had that going on for two years no consultation here has taken place with the people who it affects and there's nothing in your motion to say it will
i think this ought to be thrown out not necessarily on the rights or UNK of fox hunting but on a procedural thing that you've brought about where a UNK attitude is brought about by the labour party that have the right apparently to say exactly what'll happen on someone else's land
now if you want to do this in a proper way then you do it in a proper way
i don't mind if you write to all the tenants and say please don't have foxes on your land we don't like it
that's alright
but you're not right for you t start passing laws which any case you can't UNK to until you have new er UNK you can't enforce them
i don't know whether it makes any difference for the price you will get in the land for the land from a tenant if you restrict his rights to use it
don't forget that in his UNK agreement he has a duty to control UNK which includes foxes
you put that in his deed but the way that most of them do it through UNK through er hunting you're taking away from them
this is a whole of a UNK i think we ought to go back to what we did in nineteen ninety two its the twenty ninth of january and to UNK the rights of tenants and other occupiers of land to allow or stop fox hunting or any other hunting over land in their care and least trust some people instead of this business of we know best
this is not about democracy this is UNK your trying to practice over a minority of people in this county
here
please
er the debate this after er this afternoon has centred on adult views of fox hunting
well i'd like to say that it's not only adults who have an interest in this subject and have been watching what the county council is going to do about it
at the weekend i received a letter and a petition from a young girl called UNK aged nine years old and it brought it home to me that it isn't an adult centred er erm issue that it's one for everybody who lives in leicestershire
unfortunately it was received too late to go through the formal council procedure but i do hope that you allow me to hand it to the council secretary later who it is addressed to
the letter is short and i would like to read it
it starts dear county secretary
i am writing to you on my views of fox hunting
i was against this sport all along but it is only now that i have read the page in the leicester mercury that i feel bold enough to speak out to you
sport i agree can be played but i don't call fox hunting or UNK hunting a sport
it is an UNK a murder an UNK for and UNK murder a murder of innocent lively living intelligent foxes
we have a fox that lives near us and i have spent many a night and a morning watching it UNK and jumping about and it breaks my heart to think that many of its kind are suffering death at its worst
imagine if you were a UNK scared and frightened seeing her UNK destroyed
many suffer this way yet some people don't care
some people like and enjoy it
there are jobs around that don't involve animals
now i talk fox hunting
think it and dream it
in my mind i won't rest till i know that i have done something no matter how small to bring this ban closer to a stop
i look forward to hearing your opinion on this matter
signed UNK aged nine
nine
and this child
that's right and that's a credit to the education system of leicestershire
here
and UNK has also collected a petition of sixty four children at her school which i will also hand over to the county secretary
i think it's very clear that its fox hunting should be banned in leicestershire
i support the motion of councillor and councillor
thank you chair
er before i call mr can i compliment the council on the way that this debate has gone
a lot of people anticipated a lot of ill feel well a lot of ill feeling being expressed
thank you for not doing that
thank you for the UNK way you've acted
mr
that's UNK my reply
now i won't i won't go for this vote because at the end of the day i don't think it'd be er productive it'd be UNK erm i do hope that you around the chamber tonight do look inside and say look if you're fed up with it coming to the council mr whatever your name is i forget the new guy er it will only come back next year
get rid of it now
vote for our motion and go for higher places
mr
er i do apologise but erm i've never known a fox yet drop a cattle a stock er something that big when you said farmers and their cattle their d mostly dairy farmers and all the rest of it i've never seen a fox do that
in actual fact i've got a friend and i go UNK with him we meet he's a UNK farmer he's a sheep farmer and er we meet and he says you know what i've got a problem with on my land not foxes dogs and walkers that haven't got them on the leads and UNK at UNK time cos they UNK their eyes out and things of that UNK he says yes i'll tell you what i'll bet you i've had animals taken by foxes he says i probably have he said but i've not had this kind of UNK killing as
okay what can we do for you
erm i don't know where to start to tell you the truth
i take it you're the expert on employment law
i do a fair amount of employment yes
well that is what i'm solely here for
mhm
erm i work for a company limited
mm
or did erm for the last five and a half six years
three and a half years ago i was promoted to manager
yeah
last september erm i was UNK by another manager so in effect there's two managers running the place
was he a new er appointment
i beg your pardon
was he a new appointment
that's right yeah
he'd worked for before
erm yeah for a short period of time perhaps about two years ago
it was very short and certainly not in that capacity anyway
right
when he came along erm was about he was more or less asked what terms he wanted and said that he was no to show no UNK
i was given a pay rise because they wanted him as well you see
part of that was a company car
erm i'll men i'll mention him by name it is a mr
mr
how do you spell that
yeah
erm at this stage for the simple reason that together with the erm promotion package together with the wages package we was both given a company car
now at this point mr after having his either his third or fourth UNK drink drive just come out of court six month had come out of prison after doing a three month stretch for drink driving
mm
s but what they say is part of his managerial status demanded him having a company car to which i was given one as well but in effect that then became his wife's because he was still banned for drink driving
yeah
yeah
you with me so far
yeah go ahead
erm on the on the twenty third or thereabouts on the twenty third of march of this year i myself got stopped for drink driving
it was erm close very close
do you know what the reading was
erm i think it was either forty four or forty six
mm
er the blood count because it did go for blood count the blood count was er ninety three
yeah okay
erm
so you got a twelve month ban
well i then
don't make the appointments you see
mm
and i spoke to erm who appointed mr to take the case for me
mm
as a direct result of it erm without anything about it erm mr in court just wanted to get in and out
he accepted the twelve month ban fair enough
i see
i got a twelve month ban anyway
erm the managing director in front of mr erm said to me it won't affect your wages but what we will ask is that you give the company car back until a period of time that your wife passes a test in which case it can be given to your wife as indeed managerial status mr
yeah
mm
on the seventh of june it took this long to get to
on the seventh of june i got my statutory twelve months
yeah
erm on the seventeenth of june i was told that there was gonna be a meeting on the eighteenth erm to which i would have to appear concerning my drink driving
on the eighteenth of june attended this meeting erm perhaps this on rather than you UNK down
perhaps UNK you more
but although this says minutes of the meeting it's not actually minutes of the meeting
it's just notes taken because after things that appeared on here
you don't accept them as being accurate
n no they're quite accurate but the relevant details are missing
okay let's have a look
what does do
UNK and UNK
er c t d what does that stand for
er that's the managing UNK initials
what's his name
er charles
does seem a bit UNK that he UNK of drink driving and then prison sentences
precisely
well i don't know but it's there's certainly a lot of UNK there
erm so basically he's still there and they've got rid of me making it as an excuse but charles as partner is his brother nicholas
now whatever nick brought up doesn't appear in there as if nick never spoke
wh what did he tell you
erm it's hard just off hand but h he mentions several things
what they're saying is that colin was purely administration
i mean i've never needed a new licence for the last three and a half years but nicholas erm prior to this in the UNK to me appearing for my drink drive which is in a matter of about ten weeks i believe in the UNK to that nick said on several o two occasions anyway while other members of staff were present well this is a way of getting rid of him without having to pay him redundancy money
and that was in front of witnesses
but all the while i was led to believe by this statement another thing is that the day that made the made the appointment for me to appear sorry are you reading
no carry on mm
the day that made the appointment to see and co nick after coming out of that meeting with nick we called in at the office myself and my wife and whilst i was UNK some things up because i'd got the remainder of the afternoon off UNK wife said to my wife my wife actually broke down in tears and she says what's up
is it just because of this drink drive and my wife UNK said well it is yeah
and she says well don't upset yourself about it because worse things has happened than this
think of colin and his UNK
also it may be a UNK to you because as soon as you drive that car becomes yours
straightforward conversation wife to wife well again she must have been told that by her husband to even mention it
what's his wife's name
shirley
is she er involved in the company
yeah she's erm company secretary i believe
when you say that er said that this was a way of getting rid of you without paying you redundancy who was present at that who UNK him say that
erm it was myself paul an employee erm a couple of other employees who i believe to be dave and
any of those still with the company
all three
do you have a copy of your contract of employment or terms of employment
no that's another thing
i've never had a contract of employment in the six years that i've been there but erm less than forty eight hours after all this happened every employee was issued with a contract of employment
now paul this is what i've found out since you see paul erm said to them why suddenly this and he says oh we've actually had them printed for the last two years but we've never had the time to give them out
mr 's status is identical his abilities are different and it's necessary to have a manager who is mobile
what's the difference between you and mr
well mr never been before at least i've done it for the first few years that i was there
been out in the field done all the erm and worked my way up to it you see
this r a f UNK job that they are referring to s w f c
sheffield wednesday football club
right
erm do they involve you travelling out there on a regular basis
well on the UNK job he said he wanted somebody there you know er myself as manager to UNK the job but on the sheffield wednesday job incidentally i'd i got the contract from them both the sheffield wednesday job was done i'd only ever had to visit it once and that was at my request not at anybody else's and either way both erm the UNK and the sheffield wednesday er there have been other drivers going
er i have never had to go solely on my own so to speak
have you actually gone UNK
er i've followed them down but the vehicle i could have got in another vehicle
isn't the argument gonna be that you make sure everything's okay and then you come back again
i have spent all day there
all the lads leave at the exactly the same time that i leave
but that's how it's been happening anyway
mm a bit more information
erm can you give me your full name and date of birth
it's geoffrey alan
is that g or j
g
and date of birth
and your address at the moment
street
and are you on the telephone there
now after that
erm whoa can i have some more information off you please
i'm sorry
first
er what were you originally employed as by the
aerial engineer
and three and a half years ago y you were promoted to manager
what's your UNK title is it just manager or is it something else
it's in a reference here to something
manager
internal field manager
manager stroke coordinator
what's your pay
wh what
erm two fifty basic
per week
per week plus commission
and what was your average take home
erm it touched it touched twenty grand last year
or nineteen and a half something like that
and you got a company car as a benefit as well
yeah
was there a pension scheme
erm yeah but it was there was something that only certain employees that time the start of the pension like myself erm i have to pay five pound a week after tax for my pension
it is a UNK scheme
that's right and they paid some child
any other benefits paying erm UNK
no
private health
no
telephone home telephone
okay
erm normal hours per week how many hours a week were you working
ooh erm hard to say
that figure does include overtime erm
yeah
the basic hours are forty two and a half
and when did they actually UNK the employment did it take effect from the eighteenth of june or what
no that was that was the friday and as it says th well i don't know if it says there or not but they said what would happen they'd think about it over the weekend and they'd contact me the monday afternoon erm to make a final decision
the monday evening they phone me up and said that i was to attend another meeting on tuesday which i believe were the twenty second to which they said we've thought about it and we've decided not to continue your employment
and a formal letter will follow
have you ever had any discipline problems at all in the past
not that i can remember
okay
on the tuesday i went in and they said that a letter would follow right that was on the tuesday the twenty first something like that then i never heard nothing from them until this came lunchtime post this monday recorded delivery
twenty eighth
what we're saying here is er if you take an ex UNK payment you are not entitled to apply to the industrial tribunal
i couldn't understand it because it UNK itself twice
yeah saying that they're entitled to dismiss you without notice
we are going to give you one week's pay in respect of each couple of years of UNK years' service
if they've made you redundant that's what they have to do
they have to give you a week's pay for each year that you have been employed them a as pay in UNK of notice
that's redundancy as opposed to dismissal
so they're saying this is an ex UNK payment in other words they're offering you that payment as er some compensation for the fact that you've losing your job
but it says here should a tribunal require them to pay a basic award for compensation then that payment is on the basis that it's offered and accepted in satisfaction er towards those payments
it's very UNK language but i think what they're saying is that if you go to the tribunal and you get compensation anything they pay you now is going to have to come off that
erm but then later on th they're saying that you you're accepting it in full and final settlement
contributing towards
towards these yeah it's not full and final settlement it's towards these payments
i don't understand this bit to pay a basic award of compensation following an order
a tribunal will either re UNK you or it will say they have to pay compensation
mm
it won't be both
i just didn't understand it that's come for the advice for you see
well
well you got you got three months from the date of UNK which you can take as effect from the twenty second of june to make a claim to the industrial tribunal
erm it's very much what i would term a fifty case
the strongest argument we've got is that has got a driving record worse than yours and he has been taken on despite that record
erm you are of equal management status your abilities are the same erm why should you be differentiated from him
er that's your strongest argument
if he wasn't there then i would say that you you'd be on a UNK wicket because most terms of employment say that if you er have a driving licence and you lose it then your employment will automatically finish
mm
and virtually all contracts of employment where anybody is required to drive during the course of their work should contain that clause from an employers point of view
mm
now you've never had a contract of employment so that goes in favour as well
erm we're entitled to ask them for er entitled to ask the tribunal to say what terms of employment wou w should have been
erm the tribunal may well say that one of those clauses should be if you lose your driving licence you lose your job so it's a fairly dangerous thing to apply to the tribunal to get terms of employment sorted out
the best advice i can give you is simply to go for unfair dismissal on the basis that you've got two managers who do exactly the same job there's no need for you to go on site there are other drivers that could get you there therefore it's not necessary to finish your job simply because you've lost your licence
erm even if we're wrong in that then they should have looked at alternative positions within the company which didn't require you to drive erm that's the basic advice at the moment
yeah
th the other thing erm reference that this other manager has not at no UNK on no occasion has that car been used for company use
right
not even as f far as getting him to work in the morning
some other employee has to go and fetch him in the morning
yeah
deliver him to work take him home in the evening
that company car has never been used for company use
then the other argument as i can see is that they've led me to believe i don i know you said that it's automatic twelve month ban but we just accepted that because i was led to believe that my job was safe
in certain circumstances if it is close it has been
sorry say again
i in certain circumstances if your job's on the line and that
only if only if you're a UNK
erm
if you've had UNK er UNK points and you were up for UNK because you'd UNK up twelve points
mm
then you can argue what's called special hardship
you can't do that when it's a drink driving
you can't
i see
it's an automatic twelve months
yeah
nothing you can do about that
has to be a ban
mm
so i can't criticize the decision of the court on that or the way the solicitors dealt with it
i mean twelve months is the minimum period it could have been more
mm
you can't argue hardship on a drink drive
no
right well erm so y at the moment have they paid you up to date
what they've paid me wha what i'm entitled to is erm obviously my week's wage that i've worked UNK holiday pay
mm
and then we have what we li call a floating week which is made up of five rest days you can have them at any time yeah to
yeah
make your third week
now i've had two of those rest days prior to all this so i would be owed a UNK holiday pay plus three rest days
what they've sent me is erm a week's wage and my three rest days but no holiday pay
you're not this so called ex UNK payment
no
i've not contacted them
i mean i suppose i could contact them and say yeah i'll take that
i think you've got to be careful how you word the letter on that because what i don't want you to do is to say yes okay and then find you're blocked on an industrial tribunal application
mm
so what i would suggest is that we reply to this for you
puts them on notice that you've been to see a solicitor
they may withdraw it then
yeah they might
mm
that's a risk
at the end of the day it's a matter for you
i mean if you want to make sure you've got that in your hand i would simply say to you
you see
make sure it's done so that you're not UNK your industrial tribunal case by saying that you'll accept the ex UNK payment but you also reserve the right to take legal advice about the UNK of your employment
something along those lines
mm
you see er what i'm worried about is that erm basically i wanted to see you first before i even answered it before i phoned them up and say yeah okay or wha what have you
erm the simple reason is i've been signing on erm they've suspended my unemployment
i've got a wife and two children
yeah
does your wife work or not
no
y you could say no
how old are your children
er four and nine
i've got one i pay maintenance on as well
and how much are you paying in maintenance
well th that's not a court order that's just straight out of my bank account into her bank account
what do you pay
ten pound a week
so at the moment with the earning that they paid you up to date two hundred and fifty quid i can't give you reduced advice under the legal aid system at the moment because you're still being paid
as soon as that stops and you've got no income
well that was last week
i've had nothing this week
so you've got no income as of today's date
er well i don't know
i don't know if i've got that UNK holiday pay to come or what
have you got any savings at all anywhere
er ha well i've got a bit in my building society account
does th those savings exceed one thousand six hundred and thirty five pounds
i think there's about two grand in there but
mm
i alright i'll just stop you there
i can't give you reduced cost advice at the moment but it may be that in two or three weeks' time your s situation has changed to the extent where i can
yeah
now i can advise you in the office under the green form system if you are eligible for it because you you've got no income coming in and your savings are below one thousand six hundred quid
right
that covers me for office work to negotiate to try and settle this case
it covers me for the preparation work to an industrial tribunal
it will not cover me for the hearing
legal aid is not available in any form for industrial tribunal UNK erm so what i usually say is that we assist the client up to the stage where s it means going er to the tribunal itself
yeah
and then if er you want a so solicitor with you on that day we'll have to come to some arrangement with you privately about the costs
but today's date even that doesn't apply because you you're UNK above the level at which i can give you advice
yeah but that's only because i er i owe a grand in poll tax you see
right well as soon as you can come to me and say i've no longer got that amount
mm
we can you sign you up to one of these green forms
i can't do it today
mm
erm er basically i'm going to h have to boot you out because i've got somebody else waiting for me
right that's fine
erm you've got to make a decision what to do
er erm i wo obviously make sure you keep hold of those cos i'll want UNK of those if you want me to do anything more for you
mm
erm i would suggest that if you are going to contact them yourself about this that you make sure it's done without prejudice
put it in writing marked without prejudice
mm
erm to your rights to apply to an industrial tribunal
erm and then y you know you get your cash and three months from twenty second of june to do something about it
yeah
right
but you would certainly accept it for now then
yeah i think you've got a case worth pursuing
mm
i don't know how strong it is because as i say erm most contracts of employment do include a provision that if somebody h has a driving licence and loses it and driving is part of their work even if it's only a minor part of their work then the employer can erm dismiss
well what they said to me was
but your advantage is you've got no em contract of employment
but wh what they said to me was although erm although it's not a driving is not a major part of and your role was changing and whatever that means
and you didn't know that did you
well plus the fact that erm it's not that you haven't got one or it's not that we'd need you to drive it's that you're denying us the privilege of being able to send you
mm
well there is some argument in that but you know they should be looking at alternatives somebody to drive you out the sites where they the whole time they would take you there and bring you back
mm
it seems to apply doesn't it
plus that other thing that was at you know that it stated it's a way of getting rid of him without redundancy
yeah sure
i mean if you can come up with the witnesses that are prepared to stick their head in the UNK and say that
that's going to be your problem because they're all still wor working for the company
mm
but if you can get somebody to come along and say that then er erm y your case gets a lot stronger
okay
so i'll leave it with you
it's just that i i'm finding it well i'm not
my wife's getting very upset about it the whole affair and everything like that
mm
and er i don't know whether to it's the money aspect of it because if my UNK stopped
well we'll stop
i mean
at eight weeks say they stop it by erm
twenty six
twenty six it's these days
or up to twenty six anyway
er do they should give you income support as opposed to unemployment benefit
yeah but even that it's UNK low
yeah
erm
in terms of h what's your objective
er do you want to go back and work for them is that the m the main thing so you've got your job back cos if you claim compensation th the basic award is equivalent to redundancy which it sound as though they may well pay about of half that to you
erm that's if you prove your case
you'd get a basic award equivalent to what would happen if you were made redundant
on top of that you get compensation which is a maximum of ten thousand pounds and depends on erm whether you've got another job erm whether you've contributed towards your own dismissal and i think th the tribunal would knock something off for that
a at a guess i would think they would probably give you about three to six months' worth of pay as compensation if
mm
you proved your case
mm
so it's not a vast amount in comparison with having no job
no but it goes somewhere near half way i mean
a question of whether you can go back
the reasoning being that i've gone into the aspects of erm income support and that and basically i it's about seventy pound a week to live on
yeah
now which is UNK my wife
but in the mean time my wages i've had last week have been spent
mm
i don't know i don't know how long income UNK going to be i don't know how long my next pay UNK gonna be or what have you
the sooner you're on income support again i can sign you up to one of these green forms so i can give you some advice on that
you can
yeah
i can then advise you
well i filled all the forms in and that
it's just a matter of delivering
yeah
your capital at the moment takes you just over so you know once your UNK below sixteen hundred quid
mm
i can then sign you up to that
mm
it won't cost you for my advice
well what i'll do is i'll stick it in my diary for a couple of weeks
yeah
would you
y
would you recommend that i got rid of some of it then by paying my poll tax or doing something with it or use the money to live off
it's very difficult to advise you isn't it
i d th the natural UNK is to say use it t to live off because you don't have a problem over the next twenty six weeks
mm
mm
and then again if they pay me this money as an ex UNK payment
you have to tell the d s
or i've got to get rid of that as well haven't i
mm
but i think you've got a case which i would say is fifty
it's one that we can perhaps put a bit of pressure on if we issue an application for you by getting UNK involved and seeing whether UNK can either get you back there or er get you a compensation off them
yeah
so
they'll be in trouble to start with cos they had no contracts of employment out at that time
yeah
so what do you want me to do for now then
well you follow up what you want to do with the company when you've thought about what i've said to you
yeah
erm let me know what you do
yeah
erm and then i can put together
contact you within the next fortnight something
yeah
like that
yeah and i'll put together er a tribunal claim for you
get it to you for checking
thanks for your help
okay
okay then
right
just let me know what you want to do and we'll put it together for you
okay then
thanks then
cheers
that er it should be any account for a pension fund should carry the name of pension fund and any transactions involved with pension fund money wh it should be a duty of the financial institution to make sure that any account they were paying money into was a pension fund account
if i may say so the key point isn't it that a lot of the transactions you discussed were off market transactions they were unusual transactions and the financial institutions that were carrying out those transactions whether they were acting as UNK or acting a as UNK they would have had knowledge that those transactions were not normal market transactions
so if the law was clear that in those circumstances they should have been on notice and should have therefore watched where the money was going there wouldn't have been a problem and are we not saying that legitimate stock lending which i think is what is about is suggesting if carried on properly on the market would be all right but if it immediately goes off market into the back doors and back rooms and people can't see what's going on and the financial institutions take part in that then they are doing something that un undoubtedly is probably going to cause loss to pension funds and shouldn't there be a clear law which makes them liable in those circumstances
no you were saying weren't you
oh i'd say it is
yes
wrong anyway in that er i'll say it's the er early on it in the report good defines what he determines a UNK trustees duty and as i said to a sort of effectively UNK enter into a tr transaction which immediately cost UNK kind of money rather than making money for the pension fund er is against that duty in the first place but it to it should however be ma made explicit that it is against that duty which i will say stock lending may be okay for a pension fund but not stock lending where the er pension fund is acting as the UNK rather than the UNK
right ken any other points
er can i er i started to comment on about the er bank accounts and which are y you know er my the reaction that i saw was all round the table er i think we would go further but er any company handling pension funds should carry pensions somewhere in their names on all on all their paperwork etcetera so that everybody's totally clear that they are dealing with pension funds and er to agree with a comment that you made in one of your earlier reports that er designation of bonus of shares of pension funds should be clearly er marked on those shares er that also would have a at least UNK these financial institutions as once again that they were handling stocks belonging to pension funds and they still ignored it in that w case that they did but er they would have not had the excuse that er apparently some of them have made that er they were not aware that these were pension fund assets
i think they are still claiming well it's not that i didn't know but anyway ken
er we did we were gonna raise a point on that the clash of the regulatory rules and the UNK duty of under trust law you know and i think there you know there was a comment that i picked up with professor UNK you know in his report which i think where he said the government obviously have greater confidence than i in UNK on UNK trust law in relation to modern commercial developments such as unit trusts and occupational pension schemes which its founding fathers never UNK
now there was nothing in good really that i think addressed this UNK between those two types of law
now i think that the good did say oh well there is a law commission report expected but i think that you know the good should address somewhere tha that problem of trust law and regulation should and then i did in fact on going through the report and er you know and also your own reports erm there's the one about designation of assets you know which i think was a very good recommendation of yours i think the actual area of responsibilities and the wider role of actuaries was important
i think the UNK independent UNK for actuaries was another important factor custody confirmation by the auditors UNK of transfer of assets independent auditors for pension funds independent UNK arrangements in house investment management you made some comments co ordination of the various regulators co ordination of the professional UNK establishment of the pension tribunal you know now as far as i was concerned on my sort of looking through it those were all recommendations that you have made over your two years and i couldn't really find any response to those in good and i think that's er you know we personally found that disappointing
also i mean er we take your point and we've made it before ken that there's a real danger of asking for a report from someone like professor UNK and then picking it instead of actually taking the whole thing because it does actually add together in some sort of UNK erm and had professor UNK report been an exception in this entirety we may not have been had the pleasure of having you back again today but thank you very much er all three of you for coming points so clearly
thanks very much
at the end was very good wasn't it
mm
that's good
mm
very good
yes
all right we want to make a start if we can if people could settle down
what i'm gonna ask you to do if you could introduce each of yourselves and say which pension fund you er come from er and if we start from your left my right
oh the thing in front of me it's malcolm adams and i'm with the national association of british steel pensions
it's john UNK also with the national association of british steel pensions
i'm gay UNK general secretary for the national federation of post office and b t pensions
i'm ron smart chairman of the british erm federation of post office and b t pensions
jim castle member of the imperial tobacco pension fund
i'm michael UNK chairman of the impact which is the imperial tobacco pension fund
gay
thank you chairman erm i would like i know that you've been listening to the first er part of our session this afternoon erm and i'd like to ask you to discuss with us one of the questions that we asked the group the pension fund erm and that's to discuss the balance of power that exists between the employer and the various groups and classes of pensioner
perhaps if i just start with that simple question and see how it UNK
what help us we we'll go to we'll direct the questions to different people erm and if you agree just say you agree so that we don't have er erm a session of people just UNK what everybody else has said but if we start with you erm jim sorry i can't see the
michael UNK
yes right
erm we feel very strongly about this that there should be a balance of power with the employer UNK no more than half of the trustees
after all he's put the money in to pay pensions and the beneficiaries ought to have a strong hand in saying how that money is used so we see half the trustees coming from the employer the other half from the members of the pension fund and we've got a pension fund with the very heavy weighting of er pensioners and not so many employees and we would like to see the remaining seats er half the trustees elected partly from the current employees partly from the deferred pensioners and partly from the pensioners and reflecting in a broad way the numbers in each of those categories
erm
we think that would be a fair way of erm managing the fund and avoiding the case of having UNK trustees who do what they employer tells them
b t same or different
erm well slightly different in the fact that er we er have two close schemes with far more er beneficiaries than there are er UNK members and at the moment that are four nominated by the er employer and four by the unions er we wish to say a pensioner erm that the rights were a pensioner UNK to that board of trustees because we feel that er the situation is er is going to increase we've got so many beneficiaries and that the pensioners have no representative er i know that erm people on the boards of trustees are completely UNK but on the other hand there is no pensioner there the members are unsure of the fund because of what's been said not that i'm implying it's not a secure fund it is a secure fund but they think why are they keeping the pensioners off they there is some sort of hidden agenda they will not have us on there because neither of the businesses although we have tried for several years er they will not entertain at the moment erm a pensioner trustee and yet professor good in his report UNK the merit of pensioner nominated trustees er particularly in the sort of schemes where we've got wh where th the majority of beneficiaries
great british steel
yes er i think we're just slightly different again er chairman UNK that the british steel pension scheme at the moment has fifty ce fifty per cent employer er trustees and fifty per cent nominated trade union trustees
we too would like to see some pensioner and pensioner trustees on that trustee board but we do also recognise because it is er a large scheme heavily UNK er with er pensioners and deferred pensioners in the very fact that it has been transferred from the public centre of public er sector into the private sector that we would like to see an independent trustee er appointed on to the er committee of management it would er sort of act as a balance and be able to provide er specialist advice to particularly the trade union trustees and for that matter the employer trustees so as to keep a broad balance of what's happening within the that time
very good er we may come back to that in a moment
thank you
but listening to you make that case it's very similar to reading the great debate on franchise reform in this house in the last century when people said we should be included and that people like us should be able to have the vote and put people into parliament it's i mean it was just that you were you were making that plea about pro that the board should be representative as being like the group who are UNK
you've made very UNK erm and i'm that's a point that we'll take on board
when you talk about this split fifty could we go back that way
who UNK the chairman
well that's er that's another thing that's happened within the british UNK er scheme the chairman seems to be elected in himself or by the company it's certainly not e elected by the trustee board and er a and we would like to see
you mean UNK in is he
yes he's certainly UNK in
all right
but who but that's describing what happens how do you think the chairman should be elected
i think
even letting you you've all talked about the you know employers are paying money in and so on we don't want the schemes wound up er if i was the employer might i not be concerned if you elected a chairman that wasn't erm favourable to me
er you might er the company might well be concerned about that point but er i think if the composition of the board was er correct that er that possibly wouldn't arise
what you mean you'd have blocking mechanisms
yes
yes very good i see the point
thanks
i see no reason UNK why the independent people on the board should not act to protect the company in the same way as they're trying to help protect the other members
yes but your colleague has also made the point that the constitution might have a blocking mechanism so that people both sides could be satisfied wasn't it
but post office and b t management appoint the chairman of the trustees there are four trustees appointed by the
yes
management four by the trade unions and the chairman is appointed by the management
right
no the present the present one was a i think he was a chairman of a big building society before he came into the post office and they use these are on three year terms but er the previous post office one er spent nine years as chairman spent three UNK three terms of three years
so they're there for three years
yes
right and er is it a full time job the UNK
erm i don't know i don't think it's erm i mean i think it UNK er seventy five percent of his time but it isn't full time
no i was just thinking we we're debating the in the commons at the moment changing the UNK board from having part time members to having UNK full time ones which are on limited contracts and that clearly puts those UNK board members in a different position to the home secretary and one it's ju you just do it because it's a part time activity you may get some expenses that you think is important and i just wanted to get clear whether the chairman on a limited contract a large part of their work appointed by the employer
thanks
our chairman is appointed by the company and is usually a senior management member
right
the erm pensioners and the employees have no say whatsoever in that
very good
that's the present case but i think er impact would say that with a fifty split then those trustees should elect their own chairman and should be free to bring in independent trustees so if you had a board of say four company members and four elected by the members er of the pension fund they might decide to have two outside UNK one of which they would choose as the chairman
so you no longer have a fifty split then do you
er you er you'd have two outside UNK and you couldn't say how they would be but they would be elected by the whole te whole er board of trustees
jane
er i'm forgive me if this information is already available to the committee but er are each of your schemes are they money purchase schemes or final salary schemes
ours is a finance salary scheme
committee did draw distinction between the two different kinds of schemes erm perhaps if i could just ask you what do you think of the committee the good reports er conclusion on training for trustees where they er the recommendation was that it was a UNK objective but should not be made compulsory
er can i answer that
we er are fortunate enough in having a training scheme in fact we were able to elect our first pensioner representative trustee two years ago and he is with us today we've just had another election and er two this time were elected they will be trained they had er mr hill had a two day training by our actuaries er UNK which are a big company er but in talking to him about it he felt there was a lot to be said for having continued training not just at the beginning of a two or three year UNK but UNK later
it's a big responsibility which is very much on the trustees shoulders he is he is standing on his own there and it's
we were we were only smiling then because UNK also trains us
it's one of our advisors
no but we feel that's very important indeed
absolutely no
no we understand the value of that don't we
erm well we would like to see training of the trustees there is no training at the moment er for the trustees in erm either of our schemes er and we very much in our submission came out we felt there should be er training from the trustees
right
yes we would like to er certainly see er training become compulsory with trustees and we would also like to see er guidelines set er for that particular training so that train so that the trustees within all schemes would receive similar training rather than piece meal by one set of actuaries or another set of actuaries
erm can i just clarify this point the impression i'm getting from the from the phraseology in the way you've chosen your words is that your trustees in your particular pension funds which all er former UNK industries er haven't received any training
is that correct that er
that is correct
well the as far as we know the er certainly the trade union
don't get any
don't get any
when the management trustees get any training we don't know
yes in british steel they do receive training they do receive training
right
even if but i'm not saying that it's er the proper type of training that we would like to s
you were saying that in fact you still don't get any training
that's correct
yes so you're UNK
that's correct
yeah
just to make a party point is that all right
even accepting the fact that training is desirable i think that the trust law is so complex
i know
that it's very difficult indeed to be trained to know all the parts of it
in the last analysis is the innate honesty of a trustee who UNK that perhaps something is going right and takes advice
could we just quickly who should pay for the training of the trustees employer or the trust
the trust
the trust
the trust yes
pen pension fund
very good
david
of course the role of the trustees is re UNK really by good who er says that there under the under trust or as he sees it the trustees should remain the legal owners of the fund and i wonder if we can move on to ownership
i think you were all here listening to the erm pensioners before you were they were talking about their ideas which were also our ideas in our er report on the designated ownership of the pension funds and in particular they had a couple of ideas which you may have heard about having the word pension in the in the names just technical points er pension in the names of er of the funds and people who were er giving advice on behalf of them
i wonder if you could like anybody would like to elaborate on that
we'll start at the far end
can i can i just pass for a minute and think on this one and come back
mm
i will pass as well temporarily
erm
it's really sorry it's really the question of whether the pension fund belongs to the trustees or is it has been found
well erm in our organisation and it was in our submission that we felt that it er it should belong wholly to erm the employer erm it should belong to the beneficiaries as well because we feel very strongly that the pension is deferred pay it is deferred salary and therefore they should have an ownership of part ownership in that fund
they pay in six per cent of their salary why should they be UNK from saying that they own part of those funds
we feel that erm you know that they're both very good schemes an and well run but we still feel that erm the e fund should not be owned entirely er by the employer
british steel
thank you
well we consider that er pensions er contributions are deferred pay including the employers contributions erm that the fund should be held on trust by the trustees and that the employer should have no ownership in it whatsoever
very good
er i would i would echo that we feel that they money has been paid in for work or services done by the employer and by the er fund members themselves have contributed and i don't think it belongs to either of those parties in any more it's held by the trustees to pay pensions if for nothing it's been put there just to pay pensions it's not a UNK bank for er for companies to draw out with the with their UNK er trustees allowing it it's money the trustees hold in trust and i believe that's the law at the moment and er i think we would like to see that confirmed in any new law
good thank you
off that er i think several of us believe that the UNK of trust law at the present moment can make it very difficult if one agreed
our own particular case is our case went to the high court some three hundred thousand pounds when perhaps if we'd had a dedicated pensions act setting out what could and could not be done that would never have happened
you have a history of legal actions don't you
sorry sir
you have a history of legal actions
not we ourselves
no
but the companies which we belong
doesn't it yes indeed
what's the state of play on the second one did it were the trustees all dismissed or did brown UNK judgment stop that
erm th the net result of it the proposal stopped dead are those who did not wish to transfer meaning the pensioners had an increased inflation percentage as a result er pensioner representatives have been appointed UNK have had a increased pension
how much of that flows from the court case i wouldn't like to say but my guess is quite a bit
so you won on that didn't you because the proposal was to be no increases unless you transferred wasn't it
mm
yes indeed
thank you
any other comments
it goes on in our case that both of our pension funds have had massive surpluses i e erm there was a reported surplus by UNK the actuaries of one point erm seven billion which suddenly er UNK within one year to a seven er seven hundred million deficit and
er it er seven hundred and fifty three million
of course our members er of which we've got a hundred and twenty three thousand flood the lines into luton wanted to know what happens they imagined a surplus as being some pot of er big tub of notes that they can dip it and we can dip into but of course the surpluses have been used basically by british telecom in particular for funding early retirement schemes er we're in no way in knowledge whether the money's every been paid back
we've been told that er everything's done in the relation to the trustee but of course when you're talking about massive sums of one point seven billion our members er who are seventy five eighty olds who suffered the problem of the UNK years their pensions haven't kept pace with the with the people that are retiring now
we're gonna come
although there's a lot of people who feel they're all living in the lap of luxury if you're post office or b t pensioners they aren't and we haven't been able to get this surplus er in any way used for the benefit of those people and er and that's where the ownership of the fund really and the surplus are tied in together
we're gonna we're gonna stay on this issue of ownership and surpluses for a little time cos it's actually so important but it's not unreasonable for your pensioners to think that here was this pot of money to which one could dip into but the only thing is the pot of money disappeared didn't it
yes an and what really upset the erm the members of the scheme and the pensioners was the fact that the money was going to actually erm fund the redundancy per programme er for the business and was going to the benefit of the employees and none of it was going to the actual pensioners
although they didn't they didn't act UNK they didn't say right we're going to make the redundancy payment act but what they did say you retire at fifty we will make your we will enhance your pension to what you would have got at age sixty we will enhance your lump sum to what you would have got at age sixty and erm give you a redundancy payment from the firm and obviously everybody fifty and plus they've gone in thousands they had enormous waiting lists and then they had to say no you can't go you know too many people wanted to go
what happened people should have been paying in for ten years were suddenly taking out for ten years and these huge enormous sums and obviously the surplus which our members had helped to build up er and provide through the years and we've got seventy five year olds on you know extremely low pensions hardly making ends meet and there were vast sums of money being given away to the employees that the employers took a contribution holiday and so they weren't paying into the fund either you know and all the profits of b t as you all know were UNK and partially because of the use of the pension funds and this has greatly obviously erm upset our members and we feel very strongly about it
right
as you are probably aware chairman from the media that the british steel national association of british steel pensioners also have a problem with a surplus and are seeking legal advice as to what has taken place
er certainly the surplus was used to er create a new scheme for the present contributing members and er to the maximum benefit of the new UNK company which er in the pensioners view er certainly er caused a great lack of security to the fund in our view of what they have done and er it is of in our opinion a matter of public concern and that we welcome the opportunity and i believe that you said previously that you're gonna come up on the ownership of surplus so perhaps getting away from it
we absolutely no you'll find we won't leave this topic cos there's three people who actually want to come in now and i'm going to bring them in round the table
UNK first and then er
can i take you back to the er the good report er about trust law i it the report er concludes that it should be retained as the framework for er occupation of pension schemes
now i m p a c say that they believe there should be a dedicated pensions act to replace trust law and the national federation post office and b t pensioners say trust law should continue to be the basis of pension funds
could tell could each of you tell us why you take a different view
one way or another i'm not quite sure what the state of the
we believe now UNK it was never designed to deal with the current situation the modern situation and when you are talking about
debts of some four hundred thousand million pounds trust law does fall down
the only UNK the only resource anyone has is to go to the courts for the courts to decide what the law is at that present moment
now that's a costly business as we know to our cost we didn't have to pay the three hundred thousand pounds the pension fund did but we had to risk paying those to go to court
now next year something else might happen and somebody may be forced to go to court if they cannot go to court they cannot get justice and they have to wait to see what happens
now we have in the companies act a table a which gives you a suggested er model memorandum of association and articles association why not a dedicated pensions act which says in here these are the minimum terms you must contain in your trust deed
you can better them if you wish but you cannot go below them
people would know exactly where they stood then and we wouldn't have to go keep going to the courts to develop the theory of trust law
so you'd leave the trust law in existence so you wouldn't call cause a total legal revolution but you would impose on that a UNK of legal requirements which if trusts wish to through trust law enhance they could but they h all have to bring their agreements up to that minimum
up to that minimum yes
yeah very good
a model trust deed
yeah
yes b t
page two of your submission
yes
paragraph
we felt that erm trust law had worked effectively erm you know over the years erm w we were happy with the extra powers that the er committee were recommending and the extra precautions that the committee were recommending that we brought in but erm we would be happy with that backup to continue with the trust law
even in the situation that we find ourselves in with the maxwell pension situation where we find that the erm trust law didn't prevent the things from happening which did happen
do you still take that view
but they hadn't got the backup of erm like th the regulator appointed
i'm sorry i couldn't hear everything that the maxwell people were saying sitting behind me you you've lost their voice and you know i couldn't hear what they were saying
but wi with the appointment of er of the regulator and the oth the other erm recommendations that were made by the report we think with that backup w we are still basically happy to continue with trust law
well i er we i wasn't speaking about the evidence today i'm speaking about UNK that have been taken in the past where we had even trustees before the committee
we informed the committee that regardless to the fact that they were trustees they were in no position to challenge mr maxwell and under those conditions then they felt that the law should be changed that the trust law wasn't sufficient to er look after pensions because they felt that in certain circumstances in fact gave evidence to the committee various people gave evidence along those lines that they were almost UNK against mr maxwell and that's
that's why i'm surprised you take this
can i put UNK point to the point that we're still discussing er which is about the surplus and how both your legal UNK you're advocating relate to the answers you've given us about surplus and the concern about surplus
now if i am i right in saying that b t is happy to continue er with the present framework of trust law because within that framework you've proposed to us er a er a body of ideas about the composition of the numbers of trustees and who they should represent which would make it much more difficult for employers to raid the fund
yes because you would have your pensioners and your employers yes
and b t so and imperial who's had a different experience to you after a UNK bid from a new employer clearly wants a legal framework steel UNK put within trust law to make it much more clear where power lies in th the UNK operation of the trust and that possibly one of those steel UNK would the law would relate on h who could get their hands on the surplus and in what conditions
so to some extent your responses re i is quite naturally a response to the position you face with your employers isn't it
our response to it was of course that er since the post office was re released from the civil service in nineteen sixty nine to trustee to pen the trustees there's been a minimum amount of trustees er i can recollect on those on the funds and we've not had any problem
i don't think the management UNK with the fund like the maxwell situation
certainly in our meetings with the with the presentations we get from the trustees every year about the fund we meet the trustees we haven't er any erm real worry of saying that the pension trust hasn't operated because i think our the trustees of those two funds are much more independent than the maxwell ones er were
i'm not trying to put them on an equal par but later maxwell erm action group were concerned with four hundred and eighty million disappearing
yeah
you've told us one point seven million disappeared in surplus
well
deficit
UNK
UNK into a deficit erm that there are large the problem we're looking at now is these very large transfer of assets which people feel that they built up with their contributions and whether that's right or not
can i just ask british steel that i mean you're hearing the other two groups
in a sense responding to our questions naturally depending on how they've been treated by their employer can we have your comments about the sort of legal framework you think the pension fund should be in and then jeremy will take over
right well i think the biggest problem with trust law is that it expects too much of trustees
it starts off essentially defining them as people who are UNK and in no time at all we are talking about them being nominated from different sector interest
however i think the UNK in the situation are that we have to face the fact that they are not going to behave UNK and you see we have a classic example in er the circumstances of our own situation as described by john
we have an equal UNK of company nominated and member UNK and union nominated trustees
they basically UNK up our surplus between them and each supported the other and overriding all of that is that each and every one of them was an active member of the scheme
now how under those circumstances do you achieve the UNK that's supposed to be the UNK of trust law
that's brilliantly put
right jeremy
yeah really the question i want to put is to the er b t post office er representatives that y you made a perfectly reasonable objection to the way in which b t funded it's early retirement scheme from the pension fund
obviously this was challenged at some point
what i don't quite understand is what was the legal basis on which they went ahead with this despite the objection presumably as some of the trustees as to what was being done i could hear we're talking of er a deficit of one point seven billion appearing or it a surplus disappearing into a deficit which is actually four times as much has disappeared out of maxwell
okay we know where it went and we know what it was used for but er my question to you is it a legitimate use of a pension fund to fund a business development scheme which involves early retirement
well we did take some er legal advice on it and we were told that it was not illegal erm i mean we think it's highly UNK erm but we were told it was not illegal because they did not actually use the er the redundancy money did not come out of the fund only this enhanced pension etcetera which was using up the surplus and we were told
and it started the pension payments at a younger age or something
pardon
they started paying
yes at fifty instead of sixty they said you retire at age fifty and we will make your pension up to what you would have got at age sixty and we will also do the same with you lump sum and so now you know this and they did that with thirty thousand i think went in one year it doesn't take long to get rid of one point seven billion pounds when you're doing for that er that number of people erm and
i think the problem is that this one point seven billion was er an actuarial assessment by UNK i it may never have been that amount of money
directly b t started erm saying well thirty thousand employees will go this year under b t ninety two scheme i e they will go at fifty they will draw their pension at fifty which isn't the trust deed and for many years inland revenue point blank refused to let anybody draw a pension below sixty
they changed that so the money er it's a bit different than the maxwell the money hasn't been erm a switched over to the UNK islands and all over the place it's stayed in the but of course we're told by the trustees and by our legal advice that nothing UNK taken place the money's been used to st er finance early voluntary retirement etcetera
if the trust deed says the pension has to be paid at sixty then the trust deed says it has to be paid at sixty surely that you know that's something you can't get rid of
the schemes now are paid a pension at fifty but the only the only UNK i understand is it isn't inflation UNK until fifty five but people are drawing their pensions and they get their lump sums at fifty and it's enhanced to take into account the actual and expected earnings for the next three years so er you take thirty thousand people one point seven billion can soon erm
disappear
can soon disappear
clarify a point here
i if someone's their pension at fifty
yes
and they had joined british telecom at twenty
yes
then they will have paid some thirty years
thirty years yes
into the pension fund
yes
presumably the maximum was about forty or was forty five
forty eight er yes
forty eight and presumably many of the people who are perhaps seventy drawing pensions they may not have even paid in thirty years themselves i mean they may be many of them may not have been around for that period of time
so in fact there may be a quality of treatment actually between someone retiring at fifty or fifty five in terms of the number of years paid into the pension fund as someone say age seventy
well i doubt it actually at the moment
pardon
the operative word there is might
yes erm because i doubt it erm at the moment with the fund that we're talking about the erm the close scheme because most of these people in b t were originally erm in the post office and of course when the they split erm then the erm post office workers went over to b t they get a b t pension but in actual fact they paid into a pension scheme erm for many of them for forty years because they come into that age group where so many people you took a job when you were twenty o or sixteen and you stayed with it for life you didn't chop and change like people do these days and the majority of our members erm we can go down and i would say the vast majority of our members have actually worked for the post office or starting with the post office and then b t or staying with the post office for forty years there's no end of them they've got in there forty years service
so no i can't agree there that there is erm UNK they think they are being hard done by
also history if i might just say that when the post office er split from the civil service the firm was in deficit for twenty years and of course post office management say quite clearly that they were putting in sums of eighteen per cent of the pay bill when it was only supposed to be nine per cent of the pay bill and that's why they're entitled to the to the surplus
b t say the same that for twenty years the firm was in deficit and both UNK put in much more than the trust deed says to keep us to keep the fund UNK
but that
employees paid their six per cent of their erm salary
mm yeah
but the both until b t split from the post office the post office put in if i remember rightly in negotiations those days er they were putting in something like fourteen per cent of the pay bill
i don't want to get on to that
i think the point has been made er and let me er ask you to correct me if i if you don't i it's a fair assessment the point that's really being made is there is a UNK issue here as to whether a surplus arises from over funding by an employer er substantial investment performance or effectively unfair claiming between either the deferred pensioners or the pensioners and i it can be that all of those interests have to put into the pot and it's a judgment as to who actually is doing best in what circumstances
i said i didn't want to get on to this area because it's you know we could go on all night discussing whether this well whether that
we ar it was really helpful if we are concrete in actually the answers that we give rather than speculative
jane
doesn't it come back to the issue of wh who they trustees are and who's interest given that trustees are expected to be independent in the end who's interests do the trustees represent because i've had experience of working with a pension fund that was in massive surplus and the UNK actuaries refused to agree their final report until that surplus was dealt with so that the trade unions and the employer through the trustees had to negotiate a way of spending that surplus and er given the pressures of the actuaries to say we were not allowed th the funds to continue unless you deal with this surplus then it comes back to the issue of how the board of trustees is made up and if we accept that there is a degree of representation on that board then just exactly how that representation is divided
well in both our er UNK what happens is that the UNK recommends what erm should happen
UNK actually recommended what should happen with both the surpluses and their recommendation was that both businesses should take a contribution holiday for the next three five and maybe even be ten years in the post office depending how investments go erm an and there was no discussion erm between or negotiation between anybody
that was recommended to the employers the employers said yes that's the action they would take they put it to the trustees the trustees agreed it and that was it
full stop
well i it's becoming slightly unfair because UNK isn't on the stand UNK would also you know probably spell out in a little bit more detail but their advice was comprehensive that there were inland revenue rules that it would put the UNK and so on and one would want to s to say that tha that as well but i do want to move on
british steel yes
yes i would like to come in to say how our er scheme was transferred from the er british steel pension scheme to the new scheme in nineteen ninety
now once the benefits were approved er by the trust deed and er bearing in mind that the chairman at that meeting informed the trustee and i quote in determining the structure of the scheme the company was prepared to enter into consultation with the trade unions and trustees but this was a consultative process only and not a subject for negotiation and their company then went on to seek the er the transfer of the present contributing members er and a hundred of the members agreed er to transfer into that new scheme
now the trust deed and rules were asked for prior to their consent and the company made it clear that they would not be available until after the new scheme commenced on the first october nineteen ninety and indeed it was some eight days later on the ninth october at er trustee meeting that the company presented the trust deed and rules and it was resolved that the committee of management would er transfer all the close scheme members er into the new nineteen ninety scheme and er the same trustees appointed themselves er trustees of the nineteen ninety scheme and one hour later were the presentation of a draft deed UNK the british steel pension scheme and a draft interim trust deed establishing the british steel pension scheme in nineteen ninety and a draft trust deed and rules of the british steel pension scheme of nineteen ninety were UNK for noting and those very trustees that were on the first meeting agreed to transfer the assets to the new scheme set as trustees of the new scheme one hour later accepted the assets and er without er seeking either legal or actuarial advice and in this case er UNK were advisors to the company to the old scheme trustees and to the new scheme trustees
the difference though between you and imperial tobacco was that the trustees went into the courts didn't they
yes
UNK
the reason they went into court though was that erm
i m p a c which was formed to protect the pensioners had threatened an UNK if they did not go to court
so er listening to the gentleman on the left er UNK of nineteen ninety high court case
yes
so you were saying who were threatening an UNK if you didn't go into court
we engaged a solicitor to look into the matter and he became convinced that there was i won't say a UNK that there was a reason why this should not be done and er requested the committee of management to court for advice
this was done in the name of one of our pensioners
and stated that if they did not do so we would an UNK to stop the proposals going through
the committee of management took the advice and went to the high court and as a result the proposal was stopped
jimmy
yes mr chairman it seems to me regarding that you could drive a double UNK bus through the legislation and
UNK has not looked at it satisfactorily as far as i'm concerned and as far as many of the scheme members are concerned i mean he has concluded that the employers are still entitled to er do what they like with the surplus the only thing that he recommends that they do it with the approval of the regulator himself but he the other thing that the
UNK has reported and concluded that as long as they get their hundred per cent minimum requirement they can still go on their contribution holidays and many and my scheme members feel that this is just a it's a UNK as far as they're concerned and scheme members don't do not benefit from the surplus and they would like to have seen or preferred to have seen
UNK making a change for the benefit of the scheme members paying into a scheme rather than employers going away in a contribution holiday
now is there any other er pension funds that do likewise or have any other experiences as far as surpluses are concerned
i find issue with one point in the good report when he mentioned that a surplus is a UNK surplus it cannot UNK until the fund actual close down
if it is in fact a UNK surplus then why is the employer allowed to take money out of that UNK surplus he's taking real money out of from a UNK surplus it should not be allowed
told you didn't he that the surplus the only way one would know there was a surplus there was when the fund was closed when every pensioner had been paid money left
but in view of the fact that different actuaries can come to different answers and professor good quotes one where a difference of half per cent gives rise to a difference of a hundred and sixty seven million
how does one know and i accept professor UNK point what the exact amount of that surplus is
there may be in fact a deficit and yet we still allow the employer to take money out
now if we're saying you cannot ascertain this surplus then why is the employer allowed to take money out
right
b t
would you like to respond to UNK question
well we were disappointed in the good report because er they did say it was one of the major issues and yet they said that they didn't think any sweep in changes are needed which rather erm UNK the earlier part of our report we would have thought there were erm changes needed
a group of our here is largely actuarial surpluses and one doesn't really know whether there's a surplus things keep changes
the actuaries go to the employer to find out what their plans are
british steel how you go that answers a really good way of putting it
thank you very much
well british steel adopted a somewhat more UNK er they make a strong point of the fact that no money has ever been removed from the scheme despite the presence of a six hundred surplus
what they did is took half and used it to reduce their contributions and it was a large reduction it was a reduction from twelve to currently five per cent
er okay different words to describe the same and indeed they didn't take out of any fund but they achieved the same end result
jimmy
well if this is the case then you don't see that any recommendations in UNK would stop that kind of thing happening and if you don't see that what recommendations would you make to the committee that UNK should put any report that would stop that kind of thing happening
well the fear of boring you because i've said it before i think that either a trustee made up of an equal balance of members from the various interested groups which is very difficult to achieve in practice and UNK independent trustees certainly in our case we believe would have stopped it happening because the movements in the direction it went was clear now that we have the information in front of us to the trustees it was quite clear what was gonna happen and nothing was done about it
now we didn't have a voice remember we were never even informed before or until two years later after the event that it had happened
there are still british steel pensioners from the old scheme who genuinely do not know that there exists a new scheme
do you not believe that with this recommendation where
UNK has said that the regulator has got to give his approval that would stop that
the problem there i would suggest is the timescale between the things happening and it getting to the regulator and being UNK
in the present
didn't understand the two years i mean he would have told the regulator
yes
erm whereas if there were independent trustees responsible to the regulator and they were properly trained they would i suggest be able to smell out very quickly any UNK and would have straight to the regulator if only to call a stop for someone to have a look at it
nothing recommended with UNK in that particular cause is of any good
i don't think so
have erm imperial
belief is that er if you get the trustee balance right that's the first place where the decision ought to be made but there should be a fall back position which good has given which they the trustees could go to the regulator in the case of er not being able to solve things but are feeling very much on surpluses that the money is there first of all to pay pensions and until pensions are paid up to inland revenue levels whatever they are then no money should go back to the company
the question of taking pension holidays in between out of surplus is a sort of mid UNK position but er very definitely we feel strongly that money should not go to the company
we have suffered from the same thing as the other two er UNK have said today of money being used from our surplus to provide for redundancy and erm i it's been UNK by money being available from the people who are made redundant going to the company and swelling their balance sheets while all the cost side of it comes out of the pension fund and that has caused a lot of ill feeling particularly from the older pensioners who have seen years of inflation when their pensions were not made up to the same extent
in the old days when there was a possibility of erm ad hoc payments made er that sort of thing was taken of since the UNK of the company that hasn't happened to the same extent so there's a very strong feeling with the older pay er pensioners that they paid money into a pension scheme which now shows a surplus but other people are UNK from it
we need we've got lot's more questions to ask you
peter
erm mrs UNK you mentioned briefly earlier the role of the regulator
how do you see the regulator doing his job with a hundred and twenty eight thousand schemes to monitor
great difficulty
erm er well we welcome the erm e er the proposal that there should be a regulator
somebody er to whom the erm er matters could be referred er whom er could remove trustees er who are er not acting in er the best interests er of the fund erm to whom er i understand that the erm beneficiaries could er appeal if they felt that their fund was being erm used i in the wrong way which is something that we haven't got at the moment erm i mean just going very briefly back to the question that you asked erm about this how would you stop what's happen happening is by having we would have thought a pensioner trustee because even the question has been asked how did it get through the union trustees and the answer is that most of them are employed and they are looking over their shoulder because jobs are going and redundancies are being made
you've got a pensioner employee er a pensioner trustee on there and they're not looking over their shoulder for their job they are going to do the job of a trustee and watch the funds and they would then be able to go to the regulator if they saw something that was UNK
whereas somebody who is employed by the firm might be very worried about doing because they're more bothered about keeping their job
so th the case you're putting that the that the pensioner trustee er ship is more powerful than you originally put cos until now you've been put it in grounds of i the trust should be UNK representative of it
yeah
now you're saying erm rather well that in fact that person or persons could be more independent
yes
because they're actually not worried about being sacked
yes
either erm because redundancies are coming up or imperial trustees down they were just got UNK of as a way of moving them off the trust
yeah very good
in our case the unions approved our proposals of the company they raised no objections it was only the who raised objections the employees didn't and in the high court case we've just said how can an employee be independent when he depends upon his employer for his future work
so really what you're saying is that if we're looking at trip wires to stop things happening there's a powerful a really powerful case for a pensioner trustee looking for whistle UNK
yes
there's also a powerful case for having pensioner trustees there's far less chance of erm people UNK their arm although they could have the character
and that's where UNK come in
but that's a problem we all face
and we're also saying that if you have a new pensions act the work of the regulator would be much easier
why
he won't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time
probably are aware of in any event is that there is a facility for sandwiches laid on and i think you've all been told about it
er if you want to take er use of that facility then if you haven't done so you'd better do so fairly quickly
now i today we are going to look at er i five and i twelve which deal with employment land allocations
office space and services
the matters for discussion are s spelt out but just so that you're under no UNK to what we are aiming to talk about first issue first matter is the proposed provision and distribution of employment land for district councils and greater york the reason bearing in mind the need to provide sufficient land for employment in appropriate locations and the second matter is what effect if any will the proposed scale on provision have on adjoining areas in west yorkshire
but we'll start quite UNK with the first matter
i would ask mr williamson i presume you you're leading for the county council today to er take us through i five and i twelve
mr williamson
thank you chair
could i just say before i start i apologize in advance while i'm on the air if there are any UNK s UNK and little bit of a cold don't want to UNK anybody while er the volume was up
gentlemen er ken williamson north yorkshire county council
in establishing its parameters for employment land provision of county in its eight constituent districts the county council's intention has been to sustain and improve the economic UNK of the county by ensuring that continuous supply and a wide choice of sites can be made available
the aim has been to ensure as far as possible employment opportunities are not lost or unduly constrained simply because there is a shortage of suitable sites
such an approach is in the county council's view entirely consistent with government policy
as set out in planning policy guidance notes particularly in p gs four and twelve
UNK employment land requirements over a period of fifteen years is of course a difficult exercise at any time
the current exercise has been no exception and the task has not been made any easier by the current level of economic uncertainty and its implications for the future size and structure of employment and unemployment at the end of the plan period
in the circumstances the county council has sought to provide district councils with as much flexibility as possible in allocating sufficient land and to ensure that local plan preparation is not unduly constrained by an UNK low
UNK these proposals the county council's avoided placing undue UNK on a purely technical approach to UNK future land requirements
such an approach is considered to be increasingly UNK and subject to significant variations depending upon the assumptions made
the county council's has op has opted instead to base its proposals on a wider ranging assessment which while not UNK economic activity based projections gives greater weight to levels and rates of land take up as well as knowledge of the structure and strengths and weaknesses of the local economy
the county council believes this approach represents the most appropriate way forward in assessing long term employment land requirements
it provides district councils with a generous allocation but not so generous in the county council's view as to prejudice the UNK the county's interests and by UNK land which is unlikely to be taken up or by promoting without due regard to the consequences for housing and services
nor does the county council believe that it will have any UNK effect on the objectives of the adjoining authority in west yorkshire
has the full support of six of the eight north yorkshire district councils
five districts craven hambleton ryedale scarborough and york the approach is sections of the local community including significantly the industrial and commercial organizations in these areas
certainly representations have been made er which express any disagreement with the proposals in those areas
in richmondshire there are differences between the county council and the district council on the appropriate scale of employment provision UNK to about ten hectares
in harrogate district two opposing views have been expressed harrogate civic society seeking a reduction in the allocation by at least we think of er something in the order of ten hectares david lock and associates expressing the view that at least a hundred a hundred plus a hectares should be allocated
the county council does not however believe there is a UNK case for moving towards any of the different positions sought by these objectors
as far as the greater york area is concerned objections have been lodged by leeds city council and by UNK evans on behalf of a group of parish councils in selby district adjoining york
both consider the proposed scale of allocations to be excessive
the county council not UNK er does not agree with either submission
the allocation to greater york has in fact been derived by extensive joint working between the county council and the five greater york districts
the greater york authorities are satisfied that a hundred and forty five hectares represents an appropriate overall land allocation for the area in the context of its sub regional importance as an employment centre a need for greater flexibility in terms of providing land for new industrial and commercial uses the UNK requirements of existing firms the amount of land already committed and the opportunities for employment related development identified through the greater york study
in respect of the proposals for selby district the county council recognizes that the district has a particularly narrow economic base
it is very heavily dependent on jobs in the primary sectors agriculture coal mining and power generation all of which are currently UNK significant and extensive structural changes and UNK
this has undoubtedly experienced si significant rise in unemployment
nevertheless the county council believes it has gone as far as its possibly can to recognize and respond to the UNK problems and that it cannot justify moving any closer in reducing the gap between the recommended allocation of a hundred and thirty two hectares and the two hundred to two hundred and fifty hectares which are requested the district council
other objectors to the county council's proposals namely leeds council UNK evans and j c cunnane believe that they already represent a bridge and indeed several bridges too far
at this UNK chairman er it is i think worth UNK that the county council is progressing a further selective alteration to the structure plan not a fundamental review of the strategic approach or indeed the policies which give effect to it
i think it's necessary to stress this since a number of representations have referred specifically to the constraints which the locational strategy embodied in policy i five on the ability to deliver the proposed structure plan on employment land allocation
it shows to some extent the city was tied up with the erm issue of whether or not the structure plan should include a major exception to or indeed a strategic exception to policy
this of course is er scheduled to be discussed in the context of policy two erm the proposed open countryside policy tomorrow
it is however i think relevant to the debate on policies i five and i twelve to the extent that the county council adjustments to the wording of policy i five which would provide for the UNK strategy and its emphasis on directing development to locations in and adjacent to main urban areas main towns and small towns to be modified so as to pe permit major employment allocations to be made elsewhere and indeed on a scale which effectively improved UNK strategy
so to conclude these opening remarks the county council believes the level of employment land provision it proposes is necessary to meet the existing and projected employment needs
and to ensure the local economy is not constrained by a lack of land for employment purposes
whilst it is accepted that the total provision for the county erm five hundred and sixteen hectares about twenty five he per cent above the approved plan provision the county council considers this is justified on the basis that it provides the most generous level which can be justified on the information which is available and at a time when changes in the distribution of business use are to say at the least UNK
the county council therefore chairman recommends its employment land proposal to the panel
can i say chairman that erm my colleague erm mr potter i is our technical resident technical expert and er i'm sure he'll be happy to er to take on board any of the particular queries on the methodology that's been adopted
mr williamson were you proposing to briefly outline the methodology or w shall we take it as read
well er i wasn't chairman er mr potter i think is
yes
quite prepared to do that erm
to be raised in by various participants during the course of the discussion
the other point i have is n y ten can you tell me what erm we make of that one
i presume everybody's got this n y ten
yes
the er
introduce yourself
sorry er david potter north yorkshire county council
the original calculations which are outlined in er n y six are based on assumptions which were available at the time which were based on the eighty one census essentially those calculations form the basis of the consultation plan and the deposit plan
at the time the committee considered representations of the deposit plan we had available to us revised projections based on the ninety one census also information available from the ninety nine planning census of employment and based on a number of er representations made to me formally and informally i revised the assumptions to er incorporate ninety one census data and to in fact stretch the assumptions er in terms of their general
the indications of that er in terms of the figures affect only one district significantly selby
mhm
and so that the charts you have in front of you represent the justification of all the changes to UNK figures
erm if i can add at this time there is in fact an error on the final table on that er
table
table nine
table nine
where the greater york splits is incorrect
yes
it w the purpose of table nine is to try and determine the rest of district allocation
that rest of district UNK correct
the greater york element unfortunately is not
the formula in table eight was not carried forward into table nine
i have a revised version which will cancel
well can you give us the figures now
certainly
information
is that the only correction to be made to table nine
that is the only correction i wish to submit to table nine yes
yes
then i think er it may come up later mr cunnane has identified er an error in the selby figure erm but i don't wish to change that because that was the figure that was considered as one
can you tell us what the UNK would be
the UNK
it was correct
i understand
yeah
that this
yes
yes
yes
right bear with me a moment
the terms of the table nine you have before you er as far as harrogate is concerned instead of one point zero three it should be two point one seven
the ryedale figure should be amended from twelve point zero four to sixteen point three two
the selby figure should be amended from thirteen point three to fourteen point two six and the york figure from sixty one point six to ninety six point eight and the greater york figure from eighty seven point three to one two seven point six two
changes on the other t table which has er worked out at thirty four per hectare
yes
is amended from one point three for harrogate to two point seven four
from fifteen point two three to twenty point six three
that's for ryedale
sorry yes for ryedale
could you repeat the figure again
from ryedale it's from fifteen point two three to twenty point six three
from selby from fifteen point eight six to sixteen point nine one
and from york it's from seventy seven point nine one to a hundred and twenty two point five three
one two point nine three
sorry a hundred sorry a hundred and sixty one point from york it's from seventy seven point nine one to a hundred and twenty two point five three
fine
and from greater york it's from a hundred and ten point four one to a hundred and sixty one point four one
they don't affect the policies because the
split was never carried forward into the policy we simply
adopted the greater york study findings
can you tell
very briefly please why the ryedale figures don't change in the same as and the selby figures don't change in the same sort of way as the figures for other districts
erm clarify
for example in the first column greater york figure is more or less doubled
yeah
harrogate figure has more or less doubled selby is slightly increased ryedale is slightly increased
it's to do with the way the er the totals are calculated in table eight erm the split is divided in totals of the proportion of greater york and the rest of the district
in different UNK
do you just want to touch on i twelve as well mr williamson before we in a general discussion
thank you chairman er ken williamson county council
erm i think er we are er as happy with i twelve provisions having
in that policy as we are with i five
erm again i think the general feeling is that taken together
can you move the microphone
thank you nice to hear what he says thank you th that would help
i think you need to
yeah
thank you chairman i think er as far as i UNK concerned the county council's er reasonably happy with that er policy as it stands and i think most people erm not all but certainly the majority of people who er commented on that commented in a sort of an UNK way erm again the provisions of the policy as they are hopefully UNK will er promote the same sort of flexibility and UNK that erm policy i five
do you regard provision in accord with point one as being part of the provision provided for n i five
no chairman we don't
so it is addition
it will be a separate er wh whatever
i mean the policy as proposed er doesn't have any particular figures er specific parameters in it
they are
no i appreciate that but
they are additional to the provisions of i five
is that the interpretation that district councils have put upon i five i twelve i wonder
i can't hear a knock
who's going to speak for the districts
mr curtis
david curtis york city council
yes the districts have been working on the basis that i twelve is an additional provision to i five
thank you
thank you
thank you for that mr williamson
well ladies gentlemen the floor is yours
who would like to start
mr curtis are you
yes thank you
you left your plug out
my mistake sir
david curtis york city council
should i make a speech
very briefly i would just like to make a statement that er clearly as you'll see from our representations er on the on the plan submission the city council does support the county council's er approach to employment land provision both for the city of york and for greater york
particularly we do accept the calculations that the county have used they way in which they've used both economic activity projections and also land take
and also we think they sensibly looked at the actual provision of sites in areas which have proved popular for employment and which do not compromise environmental objectives
it's very important to recognize that york although a historic city as i mentioned er in the previous discussion erm is a er is an industrial city with a significant number of employment problems in particular in the rail engineering industry where we see a rapid er UNK of er what was brown which is now a b clearly continuing problems in the rail industry with the er problems most certainly caused by privatization and also major job reductions in er firms such as UNK and UNK in the UNK industry
the work that we've done on er the economy of the city based on economic analysis which has been submitted as part of my findings erm shows quite clearly a continued shift away from manufacturing towards service employment and a continuing need to promote new planned opportunities in locations well suited to the needs of the market
our estimate is that the city itself needs something in the order of five thousand jobs over the period of the structure plan to er really just to stay still to run to run to stand still
therefore the analysis that we've done which is an economic analysis actually supports the level of er calculation the county council have produced for land requirements for the city
unfortunately as we saw earlier with the housing discussions we are very much a pint pot as the analogy was used and that a UNK just can't be fitted into it
therefore we accept that the actual provision within the city er will have to be considerably less than the calculated requirement for the city
the only issue that i think we have some er difficulty with in the policy as it stands at the moment is the uncertainty that arises between the figure provided in policy i five of forty six hectares for the city and actually our agreed calculation which i think the county council accept that site availability in the city is limited to something in the order of thirty three hectares if we exclude er one site which is subject to a dispute between parties er in relation to the greenbelt
but it is included in the deposit plan of the greenbelt by the county council that's greenbelt land so i think bearing in mind what the panel said the other day i can accept this discussion that for the time being we assume that is in the greenbelt
and if we exclude that site the maximum capacity of the city is in the order of thirty three hectares
clearly the policy does allow for additional provision to be made outside the city in the remainder of greater york and that is the basis upon which the city council has accepted the a hundred and forty five hectare figure for greater york
and as you will see from the county council evidence the er sites for them have actually been agreed during the greater york study
so the only point on i five that i would er ask for clarification on really is that the policy be amended to clarify that the actual provision in the city be UNK be thirty three hectares
as i've indicated that is the physical capacity as far as we're concerned
turning quickly into i twelve
erm we agree entirely with the county council's proposal to delete erm job targets or targets from the policy
this does s seem to be in line with practice nationally at the present time
we will be making provision within our local plan for a number of erm office sites office sites in and around the city centre we have identified those sites erm i don't wish to go into those but if the panel wish to further information on those i could
but basically they will be something in the order of eighty thousand square metres worth of commercial sites in and around the city centre on sites which we have agreed are suitable for office use
they tend to be mainly on sites being recycled from existing industrial activities er which are no longer appropriate in the city centre things like motor traders and that kind of ac activity
so conclude briefly there in that the city council does support the broad thrust of the county's two policies here but we would ask for clarification on i five on the actual level of provision we should be providing on our local plan
thank you mr curtis
now just to clarify in my mind about here i'm looking at the summary of your submission you actually refer to the fact that sixty three hectares are required to meet the needs of the city whereas i take it you say this morning that you're happy with the forty six er but in reality you can only get thirty three ac thirty three hectares within the city
now which figure are we to talk about
is it forty six s or sixty three
david curtis york city
ye yes in fact obviously with the revised information mr potter has the sixty three seems to have changed anyway now
but erm the forty six is an artificial figure it represents neither the capacity of the city nor the calculated needs so i would not wish to er have this figure of forty six in our york plan because it doesn't actually relate to either
the calculated need figure being what
the calculated need figure as submitted by the county council was sixty three hectares
yes
which i was saying i was happy to accept
i note that the approved structure plan contains a similar sort of approach to york i e its need is greater than its capacity and the policy in the approved plan recognizes that some of the provision will not be in york itself
has that formed a satisfactory basis for planning
mr curtis
david curtis york city council
it is difficult to actually say that it has formed a satisfactory basis because in effect the amount of land that has come forward in the city has been below the figure that was allocated in the original structure plan
you'll see from the tables submitted by mr potter on past land take that we've actually provided less than the twenty six hectares even that's because the opportunities did not arise
clearly as we discussed earlier in the week erm the opportunities in the city will be on recycled land
the reason why we're having to go to a higher figure now is there are two major areas of land er one is the land behind the railway station the british rail land and the other is the land at a location called st nicholas field a former household waste site both of which we are taking steps to bring forward for development
therefore we believe that during the plan period those sites are likely to come forward and make a improved contribution to meeting our share of the greater york employment needs
i would have to say that erm in broad terms that the existing policy has been acceptable erm in er terms of a planning basis for the city
there is a si a significant difference between the two policies though in that the wording of the revised policy is much more specific about saying part of our need will be found elsewhere whereas i five as in the approved structure plan merely makes reference to the fact that all of our requirement will be found in greater york
you may find that just a subtle difference but i think that in terms of the way erm make allocation in our local plan that it does cause some confusion
yes
erm my reference was in part to the secretary of state's notice of approval of the last alteration of the structure plan where he said he accepted that some of the provision york provision would have to made outside the UNK city boundaries
i'm still left wondering whether this sort of statement in policy is in accord with the advice now contained
in p g twelve about the guidance the structure plan should provide to a local planner and put my cards on the table wonder whether it wouldn't actually be more to say if york can only provide thirty three hectares that should be the provision first in york
so as to remove the uncertainty about erm what in effect is a sort of black box floating around perhaps attached to a hot air balloon somewhere over york
david curtis york city council
erm yes well i think that's a perfectly sensible way forward
i'm perfectly happy to accept a figure for york of thirty three hectares
clearly reference can be made in the to the fact that is not all of UNK requirements but the balance is being found elsewhere within greater york and i would be perfectly happy with that
i wonder if mr UNK has a view
les UNK d o e
i'm afraid you've stolen all my UNK erm you've said everything that i wanted to say
erm
we both read p gs
i am aware that the secretary for the erm er secretary of state's approval letter to the area alteration does make reference to erm
an element of UNK provision erm being found outside the UNK boundaries
that was the best at least i understand that was the best the secretary of state could do at the time
erm matters have moved on from than then in terms of the er additional p g guidance which i think makes it quite clear as you've already s said that erm we should be as UNK as possible in our allocations and levels for provision for employment development
erm so that it would be in our view desirable that the level of provision for york was that which was realistic to er to accommodate in this case it appears to be thirty three hectares and that the er the a additional element should be located in or between the other districts in the greater york area
erm the this c i p and the panel's consideration en enables them to actually reach a view on that and hopefully come forward with recommendations
if does perhaps i should ask does the county council accept that a t more UNK position would be a logical conclusion
mr chairman ken williamson county council
erm i think if we could get there obviously our aim er would be to provide er as clearer level of guidance in the policy possible to do
erm it's interesting mr UNK er when he said it was the best the secretary of state could do last time round erm i wonder why er if he couldn't do it then it would be really possible er in any way to do it now
erm we have available erm a distribution obviously which is based on sites er and one could look at that er as a as a way forward erm
do you contest what mr curtis is saying
about the capacity of york city to accommodate additional employment land
no chairman i don't think we do
erm we're quite happy with what mr curtis says about that er we acknowledge that er while the need will be er probably much greater than the it's a physical fact of life in york that there isn't a great deal of er available land
and it would have to be found er if we were to move to the er position that mr curtis has said about the total need it would have to be found somewhere else
thank you
that leaves us then with or would leave us with a substantial provision in greater york
the greater york figure doesn't i think change as a consequence of what mr curtis has said
but we're looking for something well in excess of a hundred hectares outside the city boundaries and essentially in the greenbelt
is my conclusion correct
not correct
erm we are looking and we have found in a sense erm land which er is available erm to meet the provisions the a hundred and forty five hectares that the greater york study suggested
erm those sites are not actually er affected by greenbelt UNK
they are inset in the greenbelt
they are within the yes within the inner boundary of the greenbelt
between the york city boundary and the inner boundary of the greenbelt
the implication of what you're saying is that these hundred hectares plus can be found between the york city boundary and the inner boundary of the greenbelt
substantially that that's correct
erm there's also of course the issue of the within the UNK wherever that would be that would be er if it's accepted it would be outside greater york so there would be an effect in a sense on the erm the greater york figure in the policy of a hundred and forty five hectares would be minus whatever was allocated to the UNK
is it a sensible planning strategy to take all this land between the city boundary and the inner boundary of the greenbelt in what is the current structure plan period i wonder
where would you go after two thousand and six
well i think we will be er in a sense looking erm you know at the options that are available and all the options that are available after two thousand six er we haven't looked at those in gr in any great detail what the options were at that time
but those options will be rather constrained will they not erm
have you
a greenbelt which is intended to be permanent a UNK a city which has
limited capacity
for additional land as opposed to recycling the existing land
well er
will your proposed take up of this the white land between the city boundary and the inner boundary of the greenbelt in fact take the whole lot or is there some reserve
erm chairman there isn't er reserve available what we will be faced with is looking at erm for post two thousand and six all options bar essential development around the urban area
true
if the greenbelt is to mean anything
well there would be options other than the ability to make further provision around the UNK of the city between the urban area and the greenbelt
essentially aren't you saying that post two thousand and six the options will be two
either to find additional land by recycling it in york or beyond the greenbelt
that's correct chairman i think erm we will be looking obviously to see what the prospects were within er the urban area and er sites do and surprisingly do continue to arrive and come up and we some other uses erm they would make some contribution obviously erm the other options would as you say be to look beyond the greenbelt at the opportunities that are available there
can we just clarify one point
erm the provision in policy i five does not include recycling land in existing
industrial or commercial or business use
it is effectively in planning terms a change of use from whatever to industry or business that i find is providing for
yes chairman the main provisions of i five are to make new land provisions
i think er the circumstances of greater york are so complex and difficult administration that erm the additional erm possibilities that in a sense would be making a contribution
now the point
but what i
i was trying to clarify they don't make a contribution to the i five provision
they make a contribution to employment by virtue of an increase in employment density or not depending on whether that increase actually takes place but they do not contribute to the i five provision by virtue of not being a change of use
yes i understand that point
so effectively i five is a new land for employment uses
yes
can i just confirm with mr curtis that when he was talking about the thirty three hectares he was talking about thirty three hectares in terms of in terms of a change of use
from whatever be it agriculture
david curtis york
housing to industry
david curtis york city council
i would answer that we are talking about a change of use but i have to add the reminder that the largest area inside the city is currently british rail land
it's not in industrial use if one takes the definition that it's railway land
yes
i appreciate that
well it's certainly not in industrial use at the moment is it
yes
can i just clarify one other point with the county council and for the benefit of those who've not been here for the last however many days
we were talking about the new settlement
to clarify that we established yesterday that the new settlement will not necessarily be within the greater york area as it is defined on the plan on the board
the greater york area UNK with that black circle roughly er on that on that map and as you will see the greater york area also UNK virtually with the whole of the greenbelt
apart from the city of york and any other inset within it
perhaps i should also say that the panel has not made up it's mind yet about whether there should or should not be a new settlement of course
we also talked about the new settlement being self contained and integrated but came i think to a consensus around the table that the level of employment provision in the new settlement should be related to the level of employment supply in the new settlement as opposed to a level of employment which would satisfy employment needs
in inverted commas for the greater york area
in other words it's not an employment location it is primarily a residential new settlement development which has some employment in it to satisfy employment needs of those who live there
professor lock is now looking very confused
my question was simply at the moment professor lock er am i clear are you clear about that
you're very clear in what you're saying
good point that yeah
but erm sorry the reason i'm raising my UNK is that the people who would come to live in the new settlement if it was to happen are people who would otherwise have to live somewhere else in the county
yes indeed
and so it seems to me that the erm really from the county's point of view er to their advantage as it were the employment land requirement stays the same
what you're just talking about is different patterns of its distribution that may occur
mm right
has is that is that fair too
thank you
yes it is
on that basis mr williamson and on the basis that you propose and acknowledge others do not accept that this new settlement should at least in this plan period be for about fourteen hundred dwellings what level of employment land provision can be taken out of the greater york figure and assumed to be in the new settlement
can i ask mr potter
er david potter north yorkshire county council
can you just s use the microphone and speak up mr potter please
people at the back can't hear
david potter north yorkshire county council
er the distribution within greater york is based essentially on the greater york study which identified the number of sites in and around greater york and allocated those to the appropriate districts
there is a residue of UNK land of some thirteen hectares based on our revised assessment based on nineteen ninety one
erm that is considered to be er an element which make a contribution towards the new settlement
was that one three or three zero
one three
one three
thank you
mr curtis
sorry mr curtis before you come in can i just come back to you er i just want to get this clear
erm in realistic terms you can accommodate thirty three hectares of industrial land in the city of york
now does your er assessed requirement or your assessment of needs still remain at sixty three hectares and if it does if it does is that all taken care off within the one hundred and forty five hectares for the greater york figure
or are we looking at possibly a larger figure now for greater york
david curtis york city council
no sir i do accept first of all that the capacity of the city should remain at thirty three
right
i accept that the fall within the hundred and forty five hectares
yeah
okay thank you
sir
what i would like to just er point out to the panel in terms of the earlier discussion the senior inspector was having about the sites around greater york is that virtually without exception well the two exceptions being the two hospital sites i think all the other sites are actually our planning commitments so erm your comment about erm the UNK of the greenbelt as it were that virtually all those sites are actually committed in one form or another the only two sites which are not er committed really are the UNK and clifton hospital sites which are both inset within the greenbelt well one is inset and one is subject to the normal p g two er requirements for UNK of hospitals
these sites are inside the city boundary or not
no they are they lie they lie within the urban settlement of york but outside our boundary
thank you
thank you
miss UNK
UNK evans
it's our view chairman that the figure of a hundred and forty five hectares for the greater york area is too high erm the basis for that is the government guidance p g twelve paragraph five point one three which says that the structure plan should provide a strategic framework for local plans development control and it should also indicate broad areas of restraint on development
within greater york the general philosophy embodied in both the greater york study and the structure plan has been one of restraint
erm the county council's calculations identify the industrial b one land requirements to be on an economic activity base requirement a hundred and two hectares and on a land take basis a hundred and thirteen hectares yet they're allocating a hundred and forty five hectares in the structure plan
given the policy of restraint we believe that they should provide enough land to meet requirements they shouldn't base their figure on past overtake
so therefore our contention that the figure should be reduced to a hundred and two hectares
if they don't reduce that figure we feel that the UNK will lead to green field sites being used where they shouldn't be
it also erm quite wrongly UNK justification for a new settlement proposal because as they're saying there's a shortfall in allocations
bearing in mind the advice in p g four in particular about providing a range and a choice of employment opportunities the fact that the last decade this part of the country's probably seen two UNK and the need for flexibility
mhm
do you think your recommended a hundred and two hectares would cater for all those things
well yes i do
there is a range of sites there's a list of the different sites in the greater york study erm i've looked at most of those sites and they there is a big range of sites both in size and location
erm that period has also had a period of growth within it and i feel that's a reasonable basis to go forward on
do you care to comment mr williamson
thank you chairman
er ken williamson county council
erm UNK to the extent chairman and i think erm we have established er we were happy that the level of development er rightly or wrongly as a as a commitment is already in excess of the hundred and two hectares being spoken about
i'd also just comment briefly on erm th the comments being made about restraint
er it's never been the county council's er objective or intention to UNK what are the genuine er employment needs of its local residents erm and we feel that this level of allocation is suited to the needs of the residents
after two thousand and six
mr girt
dave girt leeds city
i wonder if i could bring mr williamson back to the basic methodology of calculation of the overall requirement share
it seems to me two of the elements are lend themselves to some sort of UNK assessment an and the county's gone through at
mr UNK pointed to other factors which have been taken into account the local requirements as a as a advised to him by the district councils but he hasn't mentioned the secretary of state's advice in r p g two that north yorkshire should take account of the strategic guidance for west yorkshire in that calculation
i wonder if he could describe to us what influence that has been brought to bear on the overall calculation
i think it might be helpful mr girt if you could be a little more explicit about what in particular
yes
you're getting at
well if i refer you dave girt leeds city if i refer you madam to the first paragraph of r p g 2 which is strategic planning guidance for west yorkshire
you have the benefit of us both i think up here can you t
well per could i read the sentence which
thank you
i'm to quote then
it says the guidance has some implications for adjoining areas and neighbouring county and metropolitan district councils are asked to have to regard to it when reviewing and altering their statutory development plans
what do you interpret those implications as being
well i i'm having some difficulty in keeping my remarks addressed to question a and not drifting into question b because obviously leeds city council and perhaps speaking for the rest of west UNK concerned about regeneration effects
is that as far as you can take us on your interpretation of what those implications are
i don't want to l dave girt leeds city i don't want to make a meal of it i mean the theme of r p g two is about UNK
yeah
yeah
west yorkshire i it's the central core of that strategy
right but isn't
s
isn't there a risk that if we don't keep a reasonable balance between employment and employment demand and employment supply in north yorkshire we shall finish up for different reasons with a need to UNK the economy of yorkshire north yorkshire
dave girt leeds city
yes i think leeds would be very happy to accept arguments erm based in part on the arithmetic in part on the needs of the area
all i'm saying is what account has been taken of that other UNK which is the strategic guidance for west yorkshire
mr williamson didn't mention it in his description of the way he'd arrived the county council had arrived at their five hundred and odd hectares and er so far as west UNK aware it's been ignored or so f as far as we're aware so far it's been ignored
now we're not arguing that the calculation should go beyond past land take up and er counting the heads of those who would be employed we w we would follow a similar process and we recognize that there are needs beyond that
but you've argued previously in this hall that north yorkshire should provide for residential development at a level which would cater for a continuation of the past levels of migration
mm
in the interests not least of great of the leeds metropolitan area
i'm still having a bit of difficulty UNK those what you're saying with those sorts of lines put to us previously
dave girt leeds city
let me just clarify the line i've been arguing previously and with bradford
we both argued that the levels of er housing development in craven harrogate and to a lesser extent perhaps UNK hambleton should not be constrained so as to reduce erm the steady UNK if i can describe it as that of migration from the west yorkshire conurbation to those areas in perhaps er l looking at the different proposal for the new settlement which might be located in the leeds york corridor
we've argued that would stimulate migration as opposed simply to accommodate past trends so we've argued that but the problem for west yorkshire well for leeds in particular is that the brown field sites we have the regeneration that we need is not of sites which would readily accommodate housing they're not sites which lend themselves as nice places to live
they're almost always surrounded by existing long term industry they're not the sorts of places we want leeds residents to have to live in the future
and it's on the economic front that regeneration has the highest priority in leeds and not on the housing front as i as i've previously described
for housing purposes we've taken large UNK out of our greenbelt UNK that in terms of regeneration we don't have regeneration housing sites
if you were county planning officer for north yorkshire as well as for leeds how would you want the north yorkshire structure plan changed
well i'd like dave girt leeds city i'd like s some recognition of west UNK problems to be evident in er the deliberations which er at the moment it's absent it may it may have been taken into account but it's absent in the UNK and i i'd also like some erm indication that competing development would not be UNK on the boundaries of leeds that the scales of er the distribution of the employment land seems to be to be biased towards those districts which border leeds
sorry to press this but would you regard the provision of thirty three or forty six hectares in york and a hundred and five hectares in greater york as being UNK to your interests in leeds
i'd dave girt leeds city i'd be er pleased to hear from mr williamson that the hundred and forty five hectares for greater york is actually to be contained within the york greenbelt i think leeds has misunderstood that point perhaps UNK by the way each one was worded and we've in previous days clarified that point so
right
my understanding is that with the exception of the thirteen hectares which
yes
mm
er mr williamson has indicated would be the
the right sort of order of UNK of allocation to the new settlement the remainder of the hundred and forty five hectares would be within that ring on that plan
are you happy
yes i a i think dave girt leeds city
i think erm previously we misunderstood that point we thought the hundred and forty five hectares was UNK in the same area of search for the settlement and
no
i'm pleased that that's been clarified and er we understand that better now
well that's not our understanding anyway you know that it's UNK
i mean
right
yes we're clear
right
i i'm still a little bit puzzled about the thirteen hectares is that UNK depending on where the settlement is placed if it's placed within greater york
the settlement er in all probability as we established yesterday morning could not go within those few fields which are in the greater york area and not in the greenbelt
mm
mm
there are two small patches to the north of the city and looking at the plan again this morning there's one small patch
mm
to the south
we have certainly not confined the area of search for the new settlement
to that
to those areas
as you know if you heard the discussion yesterday which i believe you did in accord with the county council's criterion that it the new settlement should be within ten miles we've UNK the area of search to that ten mile radius
dave girt leeds city
th thank you for that madam i understand that better now
still i think there are concerns for leeds about the scale of employment land proposed in selby for example which seems to us significantly more than could be supported by the arithmetic calculation plus some kind of a sensible allowance it seems to f to be UNK generous
yeah
er obviously mr girt
i think yes i think we've
we've concentrated on york and greater york for the moment
mm
erm
we shall move the scene elsewhere
you'll get your chance again no doubt
mr cunnane
is it about york
is it about york or tadcaster
n neither
selby
and it's a lot i have a lot to say so it might be better to wait
until after the break i don't know
it's up to you
you want to shift the scene now to selby district
erm
is well is there anything the other districts want to say
yeah
about greater york
mr smith
ian smith ryedale district
it's erm coming back to a point which mr curtis made about the amount of land identified in the greater york study area which is allocated but doesn't have a planning permission
erm within ryedale we've got thirty odd hectares of land which we've allocated for development in the period up to two thousand and six
in the greater york area
in the greater york area which doesn't have a current planning permission and that's not including a redundant hospital site of another ten hectares
so you re you regard that as providing some flexibility
well in er in terms of ryedale yes
and as i say there i there is land there which is er aimed to provide a range of sites up until the end of the structure plan period within that part of the greater york area
thank you
michael jewitt hambleton district council
erm as we're on greater york i feel i ought to say something having a s small part of the greater york area within hambleton
erm we don't expect to be making any meaningful contribution towards erm employment provision around greater york i'd refer you to er statements we made erm on erm the p on policy h one
erm only three settlements in the area very small and it's unlikely that they're gonna meet an make any meaningful contribution to employment needs in greater york
thank you
mr allenby i know you've made a submission but can we just clarify what provision is being made in harrogate district which can be seen quite rightly as forming pa a contribution towards the greater york
thank you chairman yes
the total provision for harrogate district is ninety hectares of which thirty hectares is allocated to greater york and we support that allocation because it properly reflects the provision of a site which is already committed for industrial development
so it's a single site of thirty hectares which is committed by way of planning permission
mr heselton
er terry heselton selby district
er just for the record chairman to confirm that selby district has no argument with the county council on the greater york
how much can you provide in the greater york area
there's i think it's approximately twenty six hectares identified erm most of which is committed in one way or another
and that figure also UNK with the estimated requirement figure that we've come up with independently for the greater york area within selby district anyway
and that if my arithmetic is correct which it often isn't takes us to
hundred and nineteen
hundred and nineteen
hectares in greater york
that will
i'll just repeat that
thirty hectares for ryedale thirty for harrogate twenty six selby and thirty three york city
mr potter
david potter david potter north yorkshire county council
erm we have been monitoring land availability since about nineteen eighty nine nineteen ninety and our records for ryedale show that there are approximately fifty hectares available
some small sites within existing industrial areas are still available
some small sites within existing industrial areas at clifton and at er UNK particularly are available and UNK
well if they're within existing industrial areas then they're not included in the i five provision are they
they are vacant sites serviced and ready for development
they must make a contribution
never been developed
they've never been developed
they're vacant land
they're the residue of partially developed sites
right
i understand thank you
mr smith
yeah i just er want to UNK that
the figure i gave was on erm sites which were allocated
allocated
but had no planning permission that wasn't including er i think twenty three hectares we've calculated which have erm outstanding planning UNK
so adding this extra twenty hectares identified within ryedale that takes us to a hundred and thirty nine hectares for greater york
yeah
i think it might be useful to break there so we can have coffee
UNK at eleven thirty then we'll i think we unless somebody else wants to raise points on greater york mr curtis
david curtis york city council
sir i would just i think it would help the panel if you will refer to table seventeen of erm n y six which actually sets out these sites
right
erm will help you obviously totalling all the UNK up
thank you
so UNK at eleven thirty please
and let's turn our attention to selby
mr cunnane you indicated you wish to speak on that
yes
yes please chairman erm j cunnane j c cunnane associates
erm i have a number of points to make but what i intend to do is to er very briefly outline them and then see where we go from there if that's acceptable
er i would like to say at the outset that erm we support the deposit version of the er the deposit version allocations of the alteration
we think they are about right they would provide for an appropriate level of development
erm i should also say that for the for the record that erm we accept the greater york figures and regard them as also acceptable
er turning now to er land allocation with particular reference to selby
erm it is our position that we would support and regard as the best approach one based on past land take up
erm and there is an important planning principle which er i would like to draw attention to in this in the approach that we adopt and where we differ from selby
the selby approach seems to me to be er look at the land that is allocated which amounts to approximately a hundred hectares in the district and discount a great deal of it because it's constrained in some way or another and i'll come back to those constraints later
but i simply want to make the point of planning principle that you don't as a matter of approach walk away from constrained sites and say ah well we don't like that because there's some constraint we'll go and we'll UNK an another piece of land somewhere else and er that'll come forward more easily
if you adopt that approach it is inevitable that there's going to result UNK and UNK of land
and that approach er to in er in that sense is totally unacceptable
however it is the approach that selby appeared to adopt
turning now to the question of allocating land on the basis of need
it is appears to be accepted in principle by selby in paragraph two point eight of their submission that they do actually accept this approach
however they say that it i b it is unacceptable because it er pays insufficient regard to loss of jobs and the future role of manufacturing and service industry
as i understand the way need has been calculated and the county will correct me if i'm wrong on this er the method does actually take account of unemployment and it sets an UNK employment level of three percent as a goal
and erm for that reason er i wouldn't accept that the that approach is er inappropriate on that basis
the second point i would make on the criticism that selby make of the need erm assessment is they say that it doesn't erm take adequate UNK of manufacturing and service employment
as i understand the allocations they don't seek to differentiate between different types of employment within the business use class erm and for that reason equally i would regard that submission that it's an unacceptable approach as UNK
er mr potter this morning very fairly said to this erm t to the panel that if you do his need assessment which i if you got to the exercise and stretch every parameter to its very limits be as generous as you can on every possible criterion you can get to an allocation for selby of a hundred and twenty two hectares
selby are looking for an allocation of twice that and if you a if you accept that the county are correct and i can see no reason to erm to vary from that in fact our submissions er set out very clearly why we think every parameter is stretched to its limits i if you st i if you accept that then at the very least i think its UNK upon selby to put forward a UNK argument for doubling that figure
the reason for that is that it is we are operating in a in an environment of planning policy restraint
we are not a west yorkshire or a south yorkshire er UNK in a in a west yorkshire or a south yorkshire policy regime
and for that reason need local need should be UNK for unemployment sh obviously should be UNK for but a growth strategy which seeks to double the allocation without any justification is inevitably going to lead to one of two things it is going to draw in economic activity from outside and it is likely that will be from areas of regeneration or it will lead to commuting
either of those two approaches are unacceptable in principle in policy terms
however turning to UNK demand led approach which i would call it and i think that is erm how they themselves in fact describe it they have set a level of two hundred and two hundred to two hundred a fifty hectares based on demand and as i understand it there is no assessment of job need or job demand to back that requirement
there is no UNK taken of the advice in p g twelve paragraph five point four which says that it is right to have a flexible approach er with a range of sites available to business to be provided in plans and authorities will want to ensure that in allocating sites there is a reasonable expectation of development proceeding
well i would have thought that if there was to be some assessment of a reasonable expectation of development proceeding then there ought to be some assessment of demand and i haven't seen that yet
it is suggested also in UNK submissions that demand has been frustrated in their paragraphs three point two one to three point two five but again no evidence has been submitted of that i have seen
selby enjoy partially part of their area enjoys assisted area status part of it enjoys objective two status it is an area where land is cheap it is an area where there is a UNK supply of labour and yet the past allocation in the structure plan has not been taken up
the submission that selby make on the basis of constraints of which i've referred to earlier
are you
to my mind they're no different to the constraints that one would experience in any other planning area
erm i'm not sure whether it would be appropriate for me to go through the table now and look at the constraints or whether it might be better to leave that until after i've finished my overall remarks
yes okay
er my next point is that it has t this panel has to consider the implications of the selby go for growth approach which i would call it and i don't think selby differ from that i think selby are embarked on a policy of growth that the implications of that policy have to be con taken into consideration in relation to housing in particular erm and it is apparent that if the allocation is doubled then there is UNK going to be a housing implication arising from that and whether that would fit in with policies h one and h two
UNK yes i think that deals with erm my main points other than to say t to repeat er very briefly because mr curtis made the point already that there is an implication er for this in this growth strategy for er effect on regeneration in west yorkshire in particular
er now i do have as i say some detailed points on constraints and things but perhaps i'll leave those for the moment
mr cunnane i think it may be helpful bearing in mind that you do not support the proposed level for housing provision in selby to try to as UNK that element from our discussion
to what extent if you accept the county council's proposed housing provision for selby and i appreciate that's hypothetical but i er i think it would help me to get this element isolated from our discussion otherwise we may go round in ever decreasing circles
what level of employment land provision would you support in selby
i would assume that the county council's assessment of need at a hundred and twenty two hectares does take UNK of the s the anticipated growth in housing
and i'll obviously be corrected on that if i'm er i'm getting an UNK nod from mr potter
so erm on the basis on the assumption on the assumption that you've put to me then i would be prepared to accept that a hundred and twenty two hectares would be a reasonable level
thank you
thank you that's helpful
mr heselton
well i wondered er terry heselton selby district
i wondered if it would er be appropriate for me to respond at this UNK
yes
as er set out in my written submission selby district clearly doesn't support either of the er alternative methods of calculating em employment land
i'll deal with them both first
in respect of past land take
i feel this is completely unrealistic because basically er demand has been UNK by existing land UNK
in a UNK the approved structure plan seriously UNK the employment needs of the district and it allocated only forty six hectare for a fifteen year period
what this means in essence when you look at the geography of the district is that it UNK severe restrictions on where you can distribute reasonable sized employment allocations around the district
and the other thing you have to bear in mind is that at the time the original structure plan was drawn up they weren't talking about the er the structural employment problems that we are at the moment
in fact i think it's true to say that when the forty six hectare figure wa was agreed it was known that the coal field was coming and er i think time has shown hasn't brought anything like the number of jobs or economic
right
now when i spoke to mrs on the telephone last night she told me about the work you've been doing on and i have looked at it and i'm going to go over it again with you this afternoon because she thought it was very good work
and she's marked it and i'm going to give it back to you and talk to you about it
i was very pleased to see that a lot of you have tried to do your join up handwriting after a bit of practice we'd had and it had come out really nicely well done
UNK your work was on the top and i thought goodness that can't be UNK writing
it was very nice wasn't it
so good girl
and some of the others i still have to look at
so i want to look at them at dinner time and share them with you this afternoon
but because mrs did that work with you yesterday you did not do your history work so i'm going to talk to you a bit and ask you some questions about the tiny bit we talked about to do with roman britain and how the romans UNK britain two thousand years ago
so sorry just a moment
if you could pop into five a yes i would prefer to see UNK doing do you know what i mean
just sit down and sit still for a minute because you'll be standing for a long time playing the recorder as well if you want if you want to go to the toilet just take yourself all right
seems to be something else going on
let's go back to the invasion of britain two thousand years ago
but it was less than two thousand years ago in actual fact that the first UNK into great britain wasn't it
can you remember how we talked about the romans having a very strong army and how they captured land around rome around it's lake and before long they'd captured land all around the UNK sea and they formed that into what we call the roman empire
and UNK stood in france in because he was in the place he captured in france and he could see britain across the water and he wondered what the land was like over there
and he came over with
er let's see if you can remember the year that was
it was after jesus was born so we call that b c no sorry it wasn't after it was before jesus was born we call it b c before christ
it was about two thousand years ago and it was how many years before christ
UNK perhaps you could like would like to think if you want us to listen to your playing this afternoon i would like you to listen to what i have to say this morning please
can you tell us
can you tell us
on the top of this sheet it told you
kieran
fifty five
good it was fifty five b c
fifty five years before jesus was born
and you know we've had bible stories just before christmas we know about the romans being there in erm UNK and rome and all around that area at that time
because when jesus was born the roman soldiers were there and the kind at that time UNK ordered that all babies were killed and the romans went out to do that didn't they
all babies born
you tell us kieran sorry
he killed the and heard that jesus was born and he would be made king so he sent his men to go out and find every baby that was under two or three years old and kill them
can you speak up when you're telling us
and erm joseph and mary they went to egypt or somewhere yeah egypt and when they went erm and i think the angels called them to go cos they came to egypt as well and then they went to
going to bethlehem to get taxed didn't they
so we do know and we do remember reading about bi er romans in the bible at that time
yes UNK
can i go the toilet
if you're very quick because you might miss out on what we're going to talk about
was there anybody in here who plays a recorder and has some knowledge already of music and would be interested trying for the UNK
i mean not just trying but if you if you get chosen to play the UNK it means practising and practising and staying with it so that you become a good UNK player
i think i'll do that for you mr
shh
excuse me
okay put your hands down again
shh
UNK we were just talking i've UNK this talk on the romans
talk about or mr has er to ask about anybody interested in UNK playing
and i know you enjoy playing music
er put your hands down for the moment
i'll i promised mr a list but i've had a very busy week and haven't done him a list this week and i have promised and i've broken a promise
so i'm going to promise and you've got to remind me about this promise that the next tuesday that's when you're or even wednesday but if i give it you tuesday we can be organized for wednesday can't we
the next tuesday i'll give him a list of people who are interested and that means asking at home as well
because it's no good saying you're interested and then going to ask your mother or father if you could talk a UNK home and they said no i don't want you practising at home i don't like the sound of it or whatever
but sometimes mum and UNK don't like you practising so you need you need to ask and if you are chosen you need to commit yourself
that means turn up to all the practices and stick with it and join the orchestra and play in concerts as you get better all right
so it is a commitment it's not just for oh i'd like to have a go
if you want to have a go i could bring my UNK in and you can have a go at my UNK any time
that's a different thing isn't it
having a go and sticking with it
you may like you may have a try and find that you don't particularly en er like it after all
but if i give some names to mr next week i think yes well i've got them at the music later today so i can ask them then
okay then sorry i hadn't
right
yes
let's stop talking sorry about the interruptions
so fifty five years before jesus was born the romans were already he was born i think but they had not come as far as britain
who was the who was the UNK at the time who decided to send soldiers and the army to britain
jennifer
was it UNK
it was
it was UNK he was a very famous roman UNK and a famous english writer called UNK wrote a story about UNK
right he sent only a very small army and when they arrived on the UNK
let's talk about first of all the boat that they went in
how did they get across the water
wasn't
you don't think it was
what do you think kieran
erm they went on a ship that looked a little bit like dry UNK
yes
they had rows on the bottom all the and some of the men on the top
right a UNK a greek UNK had three layers didn't it
and i do believe that the roman boats had two
they had the deck on the top where all the roman soldiers stood in their uniform i say their uniform i mean their UNK don't i
er and all their fighting gear and we're going to have a look at a roman UNK
that was their name a UNK because they belonged to a UNK of erm the roman army
er and we'll have a look at all the things that they carried and erm fought with later on
but they had all their equipment with them and they just stood on the deck and underneath below deck were the people who UNK the boats over
who were they
yes
the UNK
the UNK yes they had UNK to row
and when they arrived great britain or britain as it was called then and the people living there were UNK
also UNK
and when they arrived some of the UNK were standing on the shore and they were very fierce bright red hair some of them had and UNK
i think a lot of these roman people had never seen red hair before people who looked quite so fierce
and even though they were supposed to be the biggest and UNK army in the world they were frightened to get off the so what who was the first person who stepped on land
see if you can remember because we did we did talk to you a very short time about this on monday
now let's have somebody else different because i know there's been listening hard obviously
katrina
yes that that's right it had a special name
the person who held the
well what was he called
standard UNK
do you remember he was called the standard UNK
see if i can find you a picture of a of a i've got a picture of a roman UNK here but not the standard UNK
standard UNK like a pole it was a pole they held that's what the roman soldiers look like look the roman UNK and the standard UNK had a pole with UNK on it
and he stepped forward first
now once he'd stepped forward on to the on to the shore what happened
they what's the word you want
stepped on
they followed didn't they
they followed
UNK
his UNK fell out
do you need to wash your mouth out adam
yes
go on then quickly
we're having a lose a tooth week i think
erm right so it was it was supposed to be a disgrace to lose your standard in your UNK in the roman army
so there was way they were going to let the standard UNK go on his own and face all these fierce fighters
they had to go and give him some support and they put up quite a good fight
they didn't have enough people with them they didn't have a big enough army
so they decided to UNK
what does UNK mean
what does UNK mean
do you do you know UNK
does it mean go back
go back that's right good
so they got back on their boats and they went back
they went back to france which was already part of the roman empire
perhaps back to rome where they'd come from to see their families
can we have dental inspection please
yes
is it is it absolutely necessary
mrs has already asked for her class to be after one and we've only got the two classes to do
erm right erm jennifer
i tell you what we could do cos mr might have to stay
jennifer could you ask mr if he could just pop in and see me a minute
you can turn the tape off and we can carry on this
oh wait a minute
she seems to be
oh erm
you can carry on this afternoon
you've got me first two lessons after dinner haven't you
so that would be all right i think
let me just have a word with
i was going to say can we take them in small groups
is that any help
not really cos it's a sort of discussion with the whole class so i need the sort of feed back
oh
okay
have all the other classes been looked at
yes
they have to go for a dental inspection
that's all
and we're the only ones that haven't been
we do have a double lesson after dinner which we could continue this
that's perfectly okay
if that's all right with you
yes
okay
right then could you g you want all of them
we want the girls first in registration order or UNK order
well i'll tell you what we'll do then because we don't want to sit here just a moment before you go don't start talking
i would like the boys to go and get out their topic folders and colour the map that shows all the things that the romans are hoping to find in great britain
that's a simple task you can do while the girls are at the dentist
and when the girls come back they can do that while you go to the dentist
and girls i don't know whether you know your order in the registers
if you can work it out and stand at the door and i'll get the register to check
all right sit please
i've checked your books and i have to say that i'm very pleased
worked very well most of you erm rachael you weren't here last week were you
what five s this is five s five you were over there
er
oh well it doesn't matter
we've got
yeah
i'll explain later
so this is five s
yes
right
mrs
okay
right if i can give ken those to give out
erm and while UNK giving them out let's try and remind ourselves what we talked about last week
the rule is i ask and you put your hand up
what did we talk about last week
chris
the universe
the universe
what is the universe
louise
er the universe is er planets
is it
is that all it is
no hand up
jennifer
the universe is everything
everything absolutely everything
how big is the universe
UNK
no one knows
nobody knows
what's that word who was that put that word up that was it you UNK
er what was that word you used last week
UNK
UNK
the universe is infinite we don't know
when we look out of the window at night what do we see
UNK
stars
stars
what are those stars
UNK
UNK
not all of them most of them are
some of them are
alan
planets
planets
how many stars are there
come on everybody's hand should be up how many stars are there
it's that word again isn't it
UNK
we can't count them because if we could count all the ones that we could see there's still plenty beyond those
what's the nearest star to us
what's the nearest one
louise
is it the sun
the sun
the sun
our sun
well why can't we see stars during the day
if we look out at the sky why can't we see stars during the day
steven
it's too light
it's too light and where's that light coming from
the sun
the sun
our star is too bright for us to see stars from further away
do you know why we can see them at night and not at day time
why is the sun bright during the day time
does it switch off at night
that's what we've got to go on to
i'm just wondering how much you know already
kieran
the earth turn round
the earth turns round so we're in a shadow
host stars will have what going round them
the moon
not the moon no
UNK
try
you're doing really well
planets
planets
how many planets has our sun got that we know about because there might be some we don't know
lee
nine
nine
nine that we know about
which one are we
what's the name of our planet
katrina
earth
earth
how where do we come in the order of nine
are we UNK away nearest in the middle
third
third
and you wouldn't remember just how far away we are would you
you come on
one hundred and fifty million kilometres
a hundred and fifty million kilo kilometres
i think you deserve a house point there
what house are you in
oh go on then
hundred and fifty million kilometres from the sun
and what does the sun do for us
er gives us energy
gives us energy
what sort of energy
sun light and
light
katrina
warmth
and warmth and without those we can't live
light and warmth
without the light plants couldn't live and without plants we couldn't live
do you think we could live on another of the planets then
what's the one nearest the sun can anyone remember
UNK
mercury
mercury
what would it mean being nearer the sun
what would it mean about that planet compared with earth
we wouldn't be able to live
why
it would be too hot
oh lovely and warm a nice sun tan
no
er it's what are you saying
i mean are we talking it's a lot UNK too hot
what would happen to us
we could die
we
all right so we can't go that way it's too hot
what's the next one to mercury
UNK
UNK
UNK
that's about the same size as earth you know
UNK very small but UNK is roughly like us
how about that one then
could we live on UNK
do you think
no
no why not
because we're in the exact spot where we've got enough warmth and
exactly
that's a good point
we're here because we're suited to being here
if we sh wanted other conditions we'd live on a different planet or we would have developed on a different plant
we have to be exactly where we are
UNK just the right place
let's just see how smart you really are then
you've done mercury which is nearest before
you've done UNK what comes next
er there are some hands that aren't up
come on what comes next what's number three
number three in charts for the last million years michael
mars
you've missed one out
oh sit down
you're life doesn't depend on being asked to answer this question because you know the answer
oh i'm going to ask somebody who hasn't got their hand up
UNK
earth
earth exactly
right mercury what comes next i've forgotten
erm mars
steven
UNK
UNK
this is
come on jenny
earth
earth
now michael
mars
mars and we don't know any UNK do we
yes
er d'ya mind i'm the teacher
if i say you don't know you don't know
you don't know lee
you don't know what comes next you don't
what is it
UNK
is it
yeah
we wrote it down in our book last week
all right
erm what comes after UNK then
look at them all looking through their books for goodness sake
lee
UNK
UNK
what comes after UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
that's fairly straight forward then
yes mr
yes mr
kieran says we're on earth we belong here this is the perfect place for us
jennifer how far are we from the sun
one hundred and fifty million UNK
UNK
UNK kilometres
yes and i'm gonna give you this sheet which it's to save time for drawing it
this is where you now need to concentrate
what we've done so far is dead easy
because it's not as simple as it looks on this sheet
what's at the centre of our universe
not our universe our UNK system sorry
kieran
the sun
the sun
our sun our star
is there somebody sit there going
think does it
no
no it doesn't
what does the sun do
gives us light and
it does but that's because it's like a huge UNK bomb flowing hydrogen all the time
it moves around in space it's moving all the time
all those stars are moving
not quickly as far as we can see
don't get upset you're not going to disappear one night
all right concentrate
the sun is moving it's also turning spinning like a ball spinning on your finger
what are the planets doing
UNK
they are spin not all of them
not all of them
now that's a little thing you might want to check if you've got an UNK at home
some of them don't UNK don't spin in their axis
earth does
what else are they doing apart from those that spin
yes
moving
moving
and they're moving around the sun
what do we call the path that they follow
when something's going round something else do you know the word
oh no
try it
UNK
no that's to do with the sun
that's what we talked about last time yes
but if you know it
what about space craft
space craft goes up and when it gets to a certain height above the earth it just goes round and round and round
what do we say it's doing what is it in
come on star trek when he parks his star ship what does he say
we're in
space
well yes you're in space
pardon
well hardly ever our watch
orbit
orbit
they're in orbit
orbit means you go round and round and round and round and round
because you're held there by all these planets and stars pulling at you
and that's what holds these planets
the sun has its own gravity
do you remember me mentioning that
and it's trying to pull the planets in lee but other stars are pulling them and stopping them falling into the sun
all different distances away from the sun and there's UNK a hundred and fifty million millimetres
all going round in what's the word again
orbit
orbit
in fact this a this isn't quite accurate
because the orbit isn't round isn't a circle it's an UNK it's more like that
all right
and while you've got the planet UNK the sun there are things that orbit the plant
what d'ya call something that goes round and round a planet
think you've all seen them
at least one regularly
when you look at night you see
lee
stars
but they're not ones that are UNK the planet
katrina
moon
moon
moon orbit the planet
here it tells you how many UNK each UNK got
earth has one you know that
UNK which is a huge planet if you look carefully here this is a this is to scale this shows you the size of the planet
so this size of UNK compared with earth
you see there's UNK which is about the same size UNK a small one UNK is huge UNK they're big ones and UNK another one about the same size as earth
so that's not quite accurate either
this is just to give you the order and the distance
and UNK has twelve UNK
some of the UNK of UNK are enormous
these are all UNK as UNK the sun
right
would you give one of those out
we won't do anything with it yet
we need now to open our books
rule off from where you were before i want you to get some information down about our UNK system
more or less what we've just talked about
because it's still only the second week with me i think get the information down and we'll do what we did last week
do you remember what we did last week
we did it all together
and by the way i'm very pleased to see that some of you actually wrote it completely in your own words didn't you
either that or i can't read your writing properly
that's very good
as you get the facts right
we finished off with giving a list of the planets haven't we
we've talked about the sun a little bit we just have done
we started to talk about the UNK system
how far have we got on the UNK system UNK
naming the planets
mm
we need to do a bit about the sun spinning and moving through space don't we
we've not got that down have we
so put today's date
what happened to the one that you had did you give it back in
have you got a ruler
so can somebody give me a sentence that explains what we talked about the sun isn't staying still it's all right kieran
the UNK in the middle of the UNK that
well it's you can't say in the middle of the UNK it's only in the middle of the UNK as we look at it
er let's be absolutely scientific
erm all we need to say is the sun isn't still what can we say
go on louise
is it moving
the sun moves through space yes
and while it's moving through space what is it doing what did we say
steven
is erm it UNK
UNK good
what shall we say UNK or UNK
i think UNK is best
quick the sun
so what did we say
louise said you said that you said
it's moving
the sun moves through space and steven we decided on UNK
UNK
just to make sure that erm just to make sure that we don't think it's just spinning wherever it feels like spinning it's spinning on its axis isn't it
d'ya know what the axis is
erm imaginary line that goes down through the middle of a ball yes through there UNK
no apostrophe on its
no this is an apostrophe free zone for now
next er thing we need to describe is that planets move round the sun don't we
how can we say that
go on then
the planets all nine planets all move round
well let's not say all nine planets for all we know they'll discover a new one tomorrow
have to say the planets and don't forget we've got to think about other UNK systems as well so we're not let's not limit us to the number the planets why not
yes
go on
the planets orbit around the sun
everybody happy with the word orbit
do you understand that
kieran suggest we say instead of saying the planets move round in orbit we should say the planets orbit the sun
yes
suits me
saves UNK
it's essential that we understand this UNK bit because that makes it makes the seasons which we're going to go on to do
but i'm sure you know all about them anyway
right
what else did we talk about and we need to know we haven't got down yet
we talked about the sun moving we've got that UNK planets orbit the sun
what else might there be out there in space
think about what you've seen
UNK got twelve sun UNK
twelve UNK
the UNK that's what we need
need something else first
said the sun UNK do all the planets spin
er no
no
can we check that
i'm thinking of one in particular that wants checking
there's one that's very hot one side and extremely cold the other
so some of the planets spin
is there anybody that can look into that for us for next week
oh UNK not here is he
then we've got UNK point about UNK
the UNK orbit what
erm the planets
the planet
do all the planets have UNK
no
no
so that's some planets haven't why not
that's a surprise jeremy
some planets have UNK
and that's on that sheet that you've got
there are quite a lot of other bits and UNK floating about UNK little bits of UNK flying all over the place
now can we think of a famous thing that sometimes appears in space
UNK
UNK which is er a big lump of rock that flies around in its own orbit
it's not part of our UNK system it just is it every UNK how many years is it every seventy six or something
it's not that long with UNK because you don't see it very well sometimes
i think it's
i can't remember that's something else you need to check
erm it's quite regular i know but some years you just can't see it very well
erm and there are loads of other ones some only come every few hundred years
and they just travel through the UNK on a huge orbit yes
is the thing what happens in america where
mud
like something to do with mud like comes from america
what to do with space
yes
you're not thinking of er like er a UNK are you
yeah
a UNK yes i know what he means now
a UNK is something rock floating through space
when it comes into our atmosphere it's called a UNK and most of them burn off as they come through the atmosphere
some of them and yet you get huge damage
like there's all
that's it everything knocked down and
and everyone there's like dead deep and deep
UNK er UNK
UNK
everyone UNK
yes all right let's not worry about that
okay
let's go on to talk about i assume you know this
i shall talk through it and if you can get something written i'll leave you to do a diagram and you may want to UNK this into your book UNK easier than UNK this
glue your pages together then
erm if you wanted to get time to look at the chart to colour the planets the right colour that's up to you
day and night
what do you mean by day and night
is it what happens
it usually does yes
can you explain what is happening
how long is there of day and night
twenty four hours
yes it's actually a day what we call a day
twenty four hours
what happens in that twenty four hour period
switches from day to night
why twenty four hours what's happening in twenty four hours UNK
sit there looking puzzled
have to
you either know this or you don't and when you hear what the answer is you're think oh yes
there's the sun going down
the sun doesn't go er he think about what you're saying explain it exactly
we turn round
we do
yes so we orbit
you turn round every once every twenty four hour
what do you mean by we
earth
the planet turns round once every twenty four hours
and when you talk about earth as a planet it has a what at the beginning of the name because it's a proper noun
always now it doesn't mean to say every twenty four hours it has to quickly spin round
it takes it twenty four hours to turn round
part of the time our side our half of the sphere is facing the sun
and the rest of the time when we're facing away from hello mrs lawrence
hello how are you
can i borrow some books
books
and some
those blue ones that are down there on your
oh yes of course
of course yes feel free
thank you
oh thank you
i knew they were there
yes of course you did
when we are facing away from the sun what
when we are facing away from the sun
it becomes night
well it's science think what's it exactly what you're saying
once it becomes night what happens what happens when it's night
go on
the sun goes to the other side
the sun doesn't move
erm it doesn't erm
come on kieran it's got to be exact
the moon
no not necessarily
er kieran i want some action please
can i borrow this
is it er when you don't
we've got more anyway
when you don't the sun it's in like a
what's the word
a black shadow
brilliant that's fine
when we're facing away from the sun you are in
all together one two three
shadow
and kieran we call that shadow
night
night
well try and explain it
who's nearly finished writing off
katrina and kieran out here please
right have you here katrina
katrina is the sun right
stand forward a bit otherwise i'm in the way
it's all gone dark there's an enormous teacher in between and the sun
kieran is the earth
kieran is facing sorry back now
kieran is facing the sun
kieran is in light right
now turn slowly still day time for kieran still day time still day time now what's happened
afternoon
what's happened
stand still now kieran
steven
it's going round so it's turning to night
he's in night this side of him is in day
keep turning
keep turning
long night
UNK kieran daytime
all right don't build your parcel
now of course all the time
ah
ooh what you and me one of these days one of us is going to crack up
it's not going to be is it jennifer
of course all the time UNK spinning round as well
but it doesn't matter as far as we're concerned because one side of katrina is just as bright as the other side
yes
all right
at the same time kieran is moving as he's spinning he's moving round
now if we had we could do this with all nine planets
all right
you've passed the UNK
we need to do a diagram for that
does everybody understand that
say so if you don't
because it starts to get a bit more complicated now
right thank you two sit down
and how might we draw that
right
we need a planet first
no they're third
no that third actually
is that UNK
look at it
i just drew those on purpose because you small children don't understand
you always said you always said mark but you do don't you
because it's not scientific you don't want that on there do you
well it looks like an UNK gone through it so i don't think it would work
all right let him do it
all right all right i can take UNK i can take criticism
i won't get upset
doesn't matter
all right don't criticize me for this not being an accurate map
i haven't got time to draw the world out properly
that for you information is sea
er shh we'll do it with cos there's more sea over there and i'm going to have to draw some plans
now there's a bit of america whoops
this is a nasty UNK on the west coast of america east coast of america
right bit of land in the middle doesn't really matter
could be any planet right
and the sun
yes it's not scientific
shh
it's not scientific but i felt like it
that's the sun
the sun rays are shooting off into space you know that light travels in straight lines yes
take my words for it
here i'll have to draw that line on again anyway is daylight
it's important to understand that the earth is actually UNK slightly
right
that's all right with you
oh fine
let's right
that shh waste of time
the UNK shining katrina it's shining
the light is travelling at it's hitting the earth
is it in day or night
day
day
why day or night
night
just a minute this is a frightening new concept
is that part in UNK or not
yes
z day or night
UNK
day
day
a is it day or night
luke
night
it's night because it's UNK
it's on the UNK side
right
have you all finished that board
yes
now we said that the earth UNK once in how many hours
twenty four
twenty four
so in twenty four hours it will be exactly as it is now having gone all the way round yes
can anybody tell me how long it will be until a is on this side and is on that side
no
it will be exactly the same place it will have gone all the way round right
lewis
it will be twelve hours
twelve hours good lad house point
oh you're in sherwood aren't you
yeah
what a good idea
erm in twelve hours it will be half way round so the position will be reversed
i feel a diagram coming on
oh my class makes a UNK when i say that
right
diagram
the UNK still the same way
if it's UNK round like you want me to draw
it's like it's like one of those old films isn't it
twelve hours later
is that the north pole and the south pole sticking out of the earth
you counting on surviving this lesson
kieran a word of advice
just because i'm UNK doesn't mean to say i'm
any more from you madam and you're out here drawing x y z
right concentrate now
shh
nearly had yellow sea then
there's the water again
there's a bit of land
right
now where will a be
someone come and point to it
on the other side of the UNK
direct me
straight line down
down
this way
which way
towards you or me
this way up a bit across a bit this way down that's it
here a
good
shh
x y z
UNK direct me
quietly
help me here this way or that way right or left
louise
left
right
down
down
there
x y z
right
the UNK still over here
honestly think it's UNK it's face is on the other side
it looks like it
shh
now is a in daylight or night UNK
day
day
what about x y and z
night
night
i want you to do a diagram like this
mm
and then we've got twelve hours later half a day turned round half way
right can i ask you to pay attention to a couple of things when you do this diagram
firstly i'm sure we've got the earth on a UNK
won't particularly matter with what we're doing now but it will do when we go on to seasons
very important that the pole is pointing top and bottom
you don't have to do it perfectly round because the earth isn't perfectly round
you don't have to draw the continent and UNK exactly as they are because it's a diagram
what you do have to be is neat your labelling is in pen your drawing is in
pencil
pencil
you have about twenty minutes listen to do this in your own way
i should get how many of you are there today
twenty four
only jenny away
UNK
oh UNK away and paul yes
i should get twenty two different diagrams
when you've done that i want you to look at this
if you want to colour the planets don't all go and stand round that picture go and have a look come back and colour them
you need UNK there are some UNK in there cupboard
if you were away last week can you please leave space to catch up with the writing which you will do in your own time
all right
does anybody have a problem with what they've got to do before we start put your hand up if you don't know what to do
luke a problem
i hope you're not talking to me like that
please may i borrow a rubber sir
already
why don't you ask for a rubber when you make a mistake
you haven't made a mistake yet
you'll be writing in pen though
you haven't been told to start yet see you in a minute all right
yes
everyone know what to do
yes sir
i don't mind you talking to the person next to you but keep the noise down please
i want this work this week to be as good if not better than the work you did for me last week
which i'm very pleased with very impressed
yes james
yes they're erm don't forget your title the title for your diagrams as well day and night the same title will do in pen UNK
come on then luke
you want a rubber don't you
can i just erm carry on working but just look this way a minute please
have you seen have you seen this
beautiful work
well done
i've not graded your work i will give you a bs and cs next time
yes keep working while i just explain that if you've not had it before
erm luke put your hand up and wait to be asked to speak please
yes luke
yes you have to explain what's happening
if you want to do some writing with it to explain earth UNK half way in twelve hours that's up to you
yes
yes we've just said
when you draw can you put that up
of course you can
yes
there's a tin full of counters you can use
interview with patrick
good erm patrick you've got all the information did you
yes i did
what did you think of the brochure
it's very comprehensive actually
nice quality erm that's
great thanks very much
erm while i'm having a look through this er patrick erm over there on the table we have a selection of the product er
right
printed product that we market across the six companies
mhm
erm they won't all have been mentioned in the brochure because we've introduced one or two in the last erm year or so
while you're looking through that er i mean i mean i'm gonna ask some questions but there's a chance to have a look through oh spent a bit of time er in the sunshine aye
yes just a bit
oh well most of it was UNK actually
in terms of er marketing you say you've got UNK and marketing here but you didn't actually to the selling then
well i did selling side of it but er what UNK tend to do is they get a marketing company in to sell a particular resort and
oh right okay
then once the UNK sold the marketing company will go to another resort
okay
it's from there
you didn't seem to have very much luck with these last two did you
no
erm unfortunately they didn't live up to the expectations
i mean er take the
yeah
er depending on how today's discussions go we'll need a couple of erm references on er
yes i
we say professional people but erm we're talking about people who er are in a profession
it's er we solicitors accountants well we that just gives you some feel for it
right
er
i could have put my doctor down but he's down in london so i'm in the process of changing doctors again
oh are you right
did you live down there at one time
i lived down there for about five years
yeah right
now you spoke to my colleague er john patrick erm and he would i hope have mentioned how important it is to have a car
yes er
you can't do this job without a car
basically
erm at the moment okay i've sold my last car recently erm i am looking for another
at the moment i got access to two cars
my mother and my sister so it's not a problem in the short term
er but obviously i would need my own transport
yeah er and er i'll be quite frank with you erm until i start talking to you in your background wouldn't come anywhere near what we want
and i'm surprised erm there is no what i would quote traditional sales er experience
i don't count retail as sales experience i have to say
okay yeah
i mean i understand
no i would but i would have told you that on the phone
yeah
i understand why you would say that
and i really can't count your UNK marketing that's only for four months this year
so erm excuse me
turn this off a minute
so there are there are a number of camps here i think that we have to get out the way before er
okay
well what i would say on the retail side of it okay admittedly it's not field sales it's not cold calling
mm
er people come to the store to buy a kitchen or a bedroom
but it's not the same type of sale as shoe salesman in a
i would go on with that
i will i will definitely give you that
you know so there is not only is the product design here it's er selling the kitchen but actually closing a sale when there's other various options on the market
you know there's there was texas b and q er UNK kitchens that type of thing
plus the er kitchens direct and people like that
that's right
certainly
face to face that's the difference
er face to face sales erm you know from john's conversation with you what we do
mm
that we close everything on the on the phone
right
there's no face to face in terms of selling
okay so there's no appointments
no
set up you know
the one thing about advertising er patrick is that we tell them everything on the phone
you er when it comes to erm er whatever you are selling in UNK what i call traditional and retail sales so that retail sales sometimes have a price tag up there
yes
er you can usually you still have to work out and measure what er what the kitchen needs or the bathroom needs
yes
or whatever
UNK er double glazing all of those you can see you can legitimately sell the appointment on the phone
mhm
in advertising you tell them everything on the phone
right
because you can tell them the price the size what
yes
we're going in
and in fact if you don't do that and you get face to face like this with me and say well oh wait a minute you didn't tell me that on the phone last er or otherwise i wouldn't have bothered to see you
so there's lots of reasons to blow you out
that's the difference
however erm you know you came back about the retail aspect of course and most of our traditional sales people have never had telephone experience in that sense
yes aha
so erm in effect your selling starts er well we won't count anything before that in er in nineteen eight six
mm
i will discount those UNK marketing there's four months in that erm with two companies wouldn't count in terms of what i would call overall experience
okay
i mean it was invaluable in some sense but erm
it was experience especially for the reasons
yes
okay let's go back to what you say here
why do you think you can make a success of a self employed direct sales job selling advertising
i don't think i can i know i can
if i can tell you that some of the erm what i would call direct sales people have said they think they can sell advertising and are now in another direction or still resting
mhm yes
what makes you think you can do that
as er you've not even come close to being involved in anything like it
well that's true
erm but it comes down to basically believing in well
mm
several areas
i mean first of all i would need to believe in the company the product and that the quality is UNK
did you did you spot anything
yes
in the brochure
erm well i mean there's you've definitely a professional approach
er you're large company er over quite a probably quite a large market
in our own field you could say so
yeah
you compare it with other
okay
organizations of course twenty million pound turnover or twenty million pound company doesn't sound very much but it certainly is in its er
that's right even from
in advertising
even from er the quality of the brochure i mean you can see you know i mean that's quite high level
mm
er quality
er on that on those terms
now to sell that over the phone when you haven't got the brochures and to do is a difficult side of it
but given i believe in the product and i believe in myself
mhm
it's a it's a UNK of that belief
erm okay it's a cold call if you like er terms so i mean there's no get out for me
there's a bridges are burnt if you like
yeah
erm so in that end i've got to believe in myself or i won't sell it
yes you're right
and i'll tell you right now that unless you listen to the people that have been doing it for twenty years in other words you don't make appointments to go and see people to talk about
yeah
advertising because a lot of sales people join us and they won't listen to that they think they know better
mm
and they fall flat on their face in the first week or so
erm we will chase our tails
yep
so it's very important to get er over that
erm i still have to come back in some ways patrick to er this no car situation
er
right
i will i would say that if you had been speaking to me on the phone and this is not a criticism of john it's just a an observation you wouldn't be here
because the one thing i do establish i tell people come and talk to me when you've got a car
right
because we've had we've spent an awful lot of erm money and time in taking people into the system who say they will have a car when
yes
they come down for the course and they don't have one
mhm
erm and anybody who tells me that they're gonna get one and arrives by train at the course whatever their excuse i would be suspicious
let me just explain where er what the erm options we have here today
erm what the purpose of these discussion are
john would have heard enough of you on the phone to be convinced that it was a erm right for you to have a chat with could
right
have been him if it had been in the south with me
erm he will not have asked that time honoured question do you have a car otherwise he knows what er
sure
the difference would be
erm but the point about today's UNK discussions i don't call them interviews because er it's a self employed situation
now you're thirty three
yes
erm that's another thing that would may have persuaded me not to talk you into er self employed except you were already experiencing that i guess were you in UNK
yes basically when you are self employed
you didn't you didn't have a basic
no it was commission only
er salary
but up to that time up to last year you were
in a fairly secure job with erm you know
yeah what er excuse me
what makes you think that you will settle down at your age in self employed
i think ultimately er you want to make any money in the world you've got to be erm also er it's all very well saying right you've got the security of a basic wage and all the rest
yeah
of it er but i'd rather be UNK on my own merits on my own worth er be willing to take a few risks in life erm and know that i've got the rewards at the end of it for making a success
then i'm inclined to go for myself
er well on a this kind of level i mean
yes sure
not look at go for the customers and the deals i think and all that the backup
but ultimately if i don't go out there a do it no one else is gonna do it for me
it's not handed on a plate or anything
sure
er but i've got the potential to make a lot more money as a self employed person
okay well if you don't mind my i have to er because it does affect whether you're gonna be able to erm sometimes earn the right money
erm your UNK status is divorced
mhm yes
you have your UNK there to look after you're going self employed you're gonna have to really make sure you've got enough money i guess
okay that er
now i'm not going into er your that personal side of it but you understand how important that is for
sure
er to make sure that we're giving you the right platform to earn money to keep all of your er aspects going
oh that's fine
erm that can make you of course more hungry
yes that's what i was gonna say
would i be right
yeah
i mean obviously er there's a drive that's an extra motivation
i've got to make that money for my kids
yeah
er i think any married person has got to be in the same situation and so
sure
okay
more so if you er if you're looking at
yeah
looking at doing this again by the way
yes
okay patrick
erm three things we're gonna decide today whether you and i think that is gonna be the right platform for you
okay
with the reservations that i have erm i'm gonna have at the back of my mind all the time
er and the other thing of course would be the er very important aspect of er whether i think you can come over on the telephone right
right okay
although john really should have established that already so it UNK be
er once we decide whether that is the right situation for you or this is the right situation for you erm we then look at the options we have in which company that patrick might feel most comfortable with
and the final aspects is when
right
er obviously you're immediately er available
yes that's right
so that doesn't present too much of a problem
erm two things i have to protect here today
is your self esteem and self confidence
mhm
in other words not putting you into an area i think you might fail UNK at
sorry not fail not success at which is a
okay yeah
i don't like that other word
erm and er secondly i have two thousand pounds worth of company's money
because that's what it costs to take a person on do the training me coming here er interviewing
yes
and also er setting up the first assignment for you
so there's a chunk of money
two things there
more importantly for you is that would i be taking a hell of a chance in putting patrick into selling advertising when the background there is not necessarily there erm tell me why i should
okay well i mean there are UNK various people that enter sales as you know they've probably been a UNK or something and gone into it
i'm not one of those
i do feel that i was introduced into it perhaps gradually erm on a on the retail side er but sales is gonna be my career with
erm so ultimately i mean i've got to decide which company is best suited for the area that i want to go in
now advertising strikes me as an area that i feel i can put make some input into
erm and without s sounding too UNK about it i mean there are i can see this as being a sort of mission if you like
er for instance look at the UNK leaflets the brochure goes on about er how much the money has been saved for the health council and all the rest of it
it's worthwhile it's not just erm like i don't know if i can give you an example erm
can i stop you is that your normal voice
is that my normal voice
yes
if it is you haven't got a chance in hell
i'm a bit UNK
mm
yeah
i hope you don't i can understand
yes sure
it is so vital to us that if that is your normal voice you haven't got a cat in UNK chance of doing it
okay it's not my telephone voice
it had not be
it's probably my interview voice
that's what it is
it had better not be it had better not yeah well you see how important that i it on the basis of your voice now you might as well walk out the door
i i'm as i'm as up front as that
okay
so
yep absolutely yeah
you know what i mean
it's very important
but once again john would have heard i hope something different on the phone
but if i don't hear the same sort of thing i don't want any more problems put in our way to make that decision
yes
about whether for you
sorry to break in i wanted i wanted to make
yeah exactly
sure that you could up your voice a bit okay
okay right
that's not for the tape that's for
no yes
that's right i mean er that is important
erm okay interviews tend to be an artificial sort of environment
this is discussions
erm yeah as you say it's discussions
erm
i'm still going to be tough though
absolutely erm right
i've put you off your stroke but that was not
no that's right
that was not intended to see if you could survive that although that does happen
that happens on the phone anyway
i just wanted to make su certain i wasn't hearing your normal voice
yes
erm i have been a bit UNK lately but that's neither here nor there
erm
don't we all get that
okay er it's selling an idea erm without any visual aids so obviously the voice is gonna be the most important part of it
erm but picking up on that erm for instance i mean er first UNK are the most important
erm what i would do is go into a situation i'd still dress as UNK you know and all the rest of it
we're very much a business suite company yeah
yes
you would have to be
cos you feel good about yourself
you feel more confident in dealing with that even if it over the phone anyway
now erm that might come in come into the car
i know the car's essential but for instance if you're going to an estate agent you're not running round using the car in company time
in the short term i think that's an area i can get over that until i get a car which
how can you get over that
how do you mean
erm well let's say for example i was in posted in for
yes
four weeks or whatever
erm in that case i would need to get accommodation over here or UNK from
you will still need a car
i'd still need a car
absolutely
yep
you cannot do one single bit of this job you cannot come by train to do it because what you may not dash around we hope you don't because if you follow our advice
mhm
you make appointment er you make appointments only to sign
yes
the contract
yes
but you may still have to go ten miles
to sign the contract
to sign the contract
sure
one way
so don't even think
there's no short term answer to this except a car from day one
right
all right
so there's no there's no way round that
all right
i may have to send you a hundred miles to aberdeen
that's true
erm okay well in that case er what sort of time scale are we working to i mean how soon do you need somebody here
oh i as far as we're concerned er the when bit is if you were are available er now we could even put you on this thursday
if we were talking medical practices
right
but we're not
we could put you on next week
okay
right so
it it's that quick
and some people say okay can i start tomorrow
but you know we couldn't get the we couldn't get the paperwork done that quickly
so yeah we're talking we're talking in terms of starting we're talking about next week or the week after
people who go out of that door have committed themselves to a date
yes i understand
now if you said to me er i wou to be able to get myself fixed up with a car then i need two weeks and that suits us anyway you know if you wanted to start next week and everything went right fine
but the week after is
i think i'd be looking at two to three weeks
all right fine
yeah
my er my the convincing i have to do in myself and you have to do it for me is whether this is the right platform for you
you're gonna go into sales anyway you said that
yes that's right
erm say we'd agreed that you know you come and you come and have a go er not have a go we would like to think people stick with us because we've got plenty for
right yes
people to do
erm here's a launch pad er for patrick to earn substantial money there are five companies there ignoring the er area health authority er arena because we haven't got that up here er which company do you think or which environment do you think you'd be most comfortable in
right well erm
estate agents medical practices schools golf clubs
and there
i think
are two there are two companies within the estates
i think the estate agents erm probably is the most likely
erm i do play golf i mean that's neither here nor there
i think the estate agents simply i do know a bit about the housing market erm
where from
mainly from my m f i experience as a retail salesman i mean i dealt with contractors erm that for instance you know did up did up complete UNK bought loads of kitchens and bedrooms and that type of thing let er letting companies
mhm
doing up and things like that
er
you've mentioned estate agents
yes erm
i will tell you right now that i don't think you would make it in estate agents
okay
why
and that's why erm on the basis that the estate agent er companies are very specific about sales background
right
all right
because of the experience they've had over twenty years
we've had those for twenty years
however on the medical practice side okay they feel that may be somebody with you background might suit there better
in fact i can only suggest that's the only area i can put you in
the medical side
yeah
mhm
now you er it was interesting to hear what your choice is but now i'm gonna have to step in and say yeah
okay
yeah in effect i can't give you any choice because i know that the medical practice erm are very much more erm not laid back that's the wrong term because erm they have a lot more opportunity for you to succeed
because of the environment
right i can see that the estate agents have or the estate agents are more sales orientated anyway that's people
well estate agents have never sold a house in their lives they move paper
sure
the UNK of the house usually does the selling
that's yeah
sorry i've sold seven houses i'm a bit UNK against estate agents
cost i've done all the selling and not them
er however i can i really am talking about one area here
okay
and that's the medical side
so if we're if we get if we get past that erm er that point of am i going to take a UNK
and i would if i'm gonna use that term because i think i would be taking a UNK with you
but i think it would be an opportunity
right
erm can i ask you what other opportunities you are looking at anyway
erm what with other companies
yes i would expect you to be looking for a salary and wherever
that's right
er okay i mean we can talk on target earnings of twenty five i've put twenty thousand there but that's probably
yeah fine
a bit low now
erm i have had a couple of interviews with a couple of other companies er
what type
advertising as well funnily enough but er this isn't there's one that er a couple of days ago marketing which is a UNK ex company
mhm
er but that's on advertising notice boards and social clubs that type of advertising
right okay
er
what's with advertising
what's with advert erm
well yeah i mean
well
it has to be the most difficult sell in the world selling a piece of blank space
i don't know i mean er i thought UNK was perhaps the most difficult area
yeah you've got something to show
you've got something to show haven't you
but er you're dealing with a person with pot er prospects that are
i mean i'm a i'm a very i'm an owner so i'm
yeah
i'm very pro UNK
yeah
erm so i'm an owner which is why
i'm the best salesman one UNK could've got
that's right because er you refer to it
er yeah i'm mean in that sort of environment you're dealing with people that don't want to be there know this UNK thing
they've all these people in UNK or whatever is you know it's a rip off it's a con all the rest of it
er and
which of course is what advertisers would tell you as well
well yes they will do
i mean it it's
but not such a rip off
fair enough saying you know the grass is UNK somewhere else but i don't believe that necessarily
erm advertising is something that people need to do in order to succeed
you can contributed to their success
but they would tell you all the time that oh i don't need to advertise
okay
doing very well thank you
oh they might do that but then er if you can be selective in other words i mean if they've got competition and the UNK advertising they've got to come to terms with that
you know and er equal if not better it
right okay
let's get let's get the hurdle
patrick i'm gonna take a UNK with you all right so we can save it
but the only place i'm gonna put you in that's because i think your style and personality will fit there
it might well do in schools as well
right
okay
although you're not we don't ask for education but your UNK not exactly in academic area
well erm i did a degree diploma and that which is now a degree erm at
hello
could you offer her a cup of tea and say that i'll be er about fifteen minutes or so
thank you bye
i mean UNK i'm studying with the open university at the moment on a maths course
okay
no well we don't ask for education so it's not important
sure yeah that's right
but some times when i when people tell me that they've been in a certain environment
you see once again it's the environment we want to make people if i'm gonna ask you to succeed and back up my judgement
okay
i don't want it to be UNK i want i want to make sure that somebody whose gonna be in that environment will settle down
so i want to talk about medical practices er
right
and if we can get that out of the way
there are two things that we have to look at i need two references
okay
okay and do need to be UNK about the car
and quite honestly you need it when you come on the course
mm
if you drive down to the course that needs to be your transport when you get your first assignment
right
if there's any hint that you do not have your own car then i will play you out as well as the company
and the course is the final decision point
i may put on my notes that this guy may not have the background but there is something else i've seen or we've heard on the phone
right
but in the end they will test you out
so
and they will then they will say not going to do this
mhm
you'll still have to convince them all right
well
let's get that out the way shall we patrick
okay
i'm going to sh er there's a pack that i am going to let you take away okay
and this gives you an outline of what we do
when er i john i hope will have told you on the phone that you have no responsibility for setting the assignments
no that's right yeah
okay
er we have a marketing group that goes around the country doing that and when they er sign the surgery up to do the er for us to do the product or UNK print the product they leave a sheet that looks something like this
okay
and they are asked to provide us with a list of businesses which they are happy for us to approach
now if they've got any sense of course they will put down businesses which they already have lots of dealings with
mm
others in the area that they know might be interested in having the pre er prestige er prestige being in the booklet
right okay
cos the doctors er still have that sort of element of UNK for people to be associated with
a local community aspect
yes
now that list is provided with you on the day first day of your assignment
when you arrive at your assignment there will be an envelope full of bits and pieces right
they include that list
now that could be six to nine months old all right
since we signed that surgery up
right
the most important thing you do with that is not to rush to the telephone and say UNK i'm gonna get deals out of this
it's to sit down with the practice manager and say right tell me about these businesses
what information can i UNK from you about these businesses that will help me erm produce the goods
so it's very important to UNK what we call re qualify that list
right
but that's provided for you and it is erm it you know certainly the assignments i did on the medical practice they were it was very valuable
but you do have to still sit down and get that information
right
now in that envelope there will be lots of other bits of information
i'm not going to explain all that because i haven't got samples of it here
but it certainly would be explained on the training course
okay
this is an example of what's what is included
and this is er the sort of thing that er you'll hand over to the medical practice to er at least remind them what you're doing there
and there are other bits and pieces like notices for their board and their surgery advising patients about the booklets
okay
now by law they must provide something like this booklet
okay so that's
that's fixed but some of them started off with a fo a double sided piece of paper which is thrown away with the rest of the UNK that people keep in their houses
but these are reference books that are not thrown away and that's what makes the advertisers the benefits to the advertisers that much more important
okay
let me just give you an idea just that's something else we do let me give you some idea of that's a couple of examples very attractive books
mhm
and there are three two or three sizes of ads that er i'm going to show you er go through with you in a minute
but first of all let me explain how we come to agree the number of booklets on the and the individual financial target per assignment
right
