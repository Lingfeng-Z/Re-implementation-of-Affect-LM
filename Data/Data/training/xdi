i think somebody brought that in from er he he'd gone along when i was up here a few weeks back
mhm
so i kept it
so there's er quite a varied erm sales background here maggie
mm yes
yes
stationery er universal supplies
i was at universal twice
is that the big company
yes
that's the that's the one that prints the catalogue and then UNK it
i'm sure i've i said to you on the phone i think
yes
cos i made a note universal
yes it is and they have you know most of their own UNK which is where they make their money obviously
mm
UNK now there's a there there's erm a market place that's advertising all the time
was
yes
this was this done by you know the subscription each week or each month
i didn't work on that side actually rod
i worked on business to business
oh okay fine
is there still
and i and i
er oh to the corporate market
yeah
i used to go to all the erm exhibitions UNK and UNK and all of those
erm and then it was my job to chase up all the leads afterwards
right
good fun
yes
yes
doing the exhibitions yes
yes
i had some sore feet
hard work
yeah i know
but er everybody thinks oh you're going away stay in a nice hotel
i used to run a training course on how to run exhibitions and one of the things that female were always surprised about i said don't where high UNK on the exhibition stand
yes
you still see them doing it
yes
oh it's not worth it is it
my feet are hurt change your shoes dear
UNK have changed somewhat now
yeah that's right
haven't they
that's er that's we are i think we are subject to fashion all the time
so the lads have er flown the UNK have they
no
the thirty year old is still at home
really
can't get rid of him
can't get rid of him
and he's been working erm in the shop
we've just closed a UNK actually
oh right that's right you had a UNK didn't you
erm yeah ken had one and he's managed to erm secure early release from erm the lease which was due to finish in july
er but since the UNK started trading on a sunday last year our sales just went down
and you're a grandmother too
yes yeah
and you UNK on him i guess
we do
he comes every weekend
does he
oh
he comes friday to sunday we keep him
oh can i go to grandma and granddad
it's a big problem at the moment
now what's this
nights at the pub network
yeah
or is that nights at the pub
UNK
and UNK
well it well it's really just it UNK in doesn't it
you just meet people erm you know
oh sure
erm and it's all to do with contacts because i'm still running my own business erm of
doing what
selling UNK
oh right
but this is
i didn't i didn't hear that
this is something though well they're all finished now at christmas
but this is
oh you that's right
something that ken would like to take over now
ken
my husband
because he's always been in er in food
mm
okay
erm and i'm you know i'm sure now it's
yeah it's one thing that er we have to UNK to people and usually i do it on the phone that if people have got businesses erm the way look at it there's such a commitment by this company to
i can imagine that
for the self employed even the self employed status
yes
erm we guarantee
er you can see the sort of backup er from the brochure
yes yeah
what sort of that we have
we not have to give we're obliged to give in terms of to keep the company going
yes yeah
erm and we are fully aware that some people have got other things
mm
quote
but it's when it UNK with the thing
they'd say
yes
well it's you know it's one
yes
or the other
yes
but if there're a lot of people have got evenings you know
mm
network marketing and things like that
mm
as long as
i think network marketing i think it i think that turns out to be jolly hard work because if you're not recruiting it's the recruitment part of it
oh yeah
that has to be
if you're not recruiting
yes i mean my wife and i have had a go at that
have you
we're still we're still there but erm it was the number of people you had to approach to get one into you
because i there's nothing wrong with it
UNK the government have cleared it and in fact have forecast that it's going to be the one
the yes
the marketing concept
yeah
certainly is in the state and japan
i was gonna say it's
sixty seven percent of business goes through network marketing
it's more commonly known
yeah
abroad isn't it
unfortunately it still has the UNK selling er
tag
attached
mm
that's right
and of course that's illegal
i've got no
yeah we looked at er n s a
we looked at
well that's who we're with
are you
yeah
oh right
i wonder if this is where er from then
who
my friend from er he lives at sheffield
right
i wonder if that's where he's heard of you then because he you know he introduced me to n s a
oh right
i went to some of the meetings and
yes
i did a couple of workshops
i don't ian name doesn't er
but er ian
doesn't ring a bell
no
no
but that's where i go
i started down there with UNK
right
at UNK
yeah
oh yes i mean there i've i wouldn't be without my er filter and my er
filter well i have one yes yeah
and the security products are very good too
yes
well i didn't see those because i didn't stay long enough
mm
right er i've got nothing wrong with it
but of course the recruitment aspect is really
mm
difficult and now of course we still retain our UNK but er we're not very active
erm okay
there's the background there i've met you for ten minutes
i've spoken to you on the phone
you can knock this one into a UNK hat maggie
could i
yes absolutely
i will tell you right now
well let me explain
two or three things that we need to decide here today and that's the purpose of these discussions
is a whether you and i think that this is er erm if you can forget what your friend told you about
yeah
i it did i mean i thought afterwards i shouldn't have said that to er john because he would be thinking oh here's negative nelly coming along
no that's all right
erm
erm
you know we've got people that erm
but i think if you put your thoughts on the table at least you all know where you're starting from
oh sure fine
don't you
erm in fact you notice i didn't even make a note on it
it just er i remember him saying something to me
oh you somebody said that they had a bad time with erm
because i was UNK i want i want i wanted to speak to rod and er i said no i when is con when is it convenient to ring back then cos he said he's got the phone UNK to his ear blah
yes
and erm well i am the same status and i am his colleague and all this you know i can help you
john gets very defensive okay
yeah
er nice guy but he's never been in recruitment
right
so he er but he had sold
in fact he er i understand he was a very good er advertising salesman
yes
they brought him inside to erm recruit without giving him any training at all and what i do has been gained over the last twenty years of recruitment
mm
so erm in fairness to him i think he was UNK into something he didn't have a hell in er hope in at that time of coping with
if somebody was interviewed by him and had a bad time i can tell you i had a bad time well to me it was a bad time when i with him and he saw he spoke with me
er when i was asked for my opinion afterwards erm er i said er well i quite honestly i wasn't er interviewed
i thought for thought for fifteen minutes i was er should i or should i not join the company
mhm
if you have that bad feeling well not join the company but
however that's
erm now the three two or three things that we're talking about today really is er and one we've just got over i think is that you and i er i'm absolutely certain you'd knock this into a UNK hat
i've had other people here that don't come anywhere near your background and your style and particularly your voice
which is so critical to us
mhm
erm the other thing is to for you and i decide er well once you tell me that you're happy er with what's happened so far
erm the other aspect is to decide where you feel that you er could be most comfortable environmentally
mhm
in other words in what environment will you feel comfortable with working in
mhm
now i have one of those erm it is a luxury because i have erm six companies where i want people in the north east
and to have a choice like that it means that anybody who comes in here is not in competition with everybody else
mhm
i can legitimately offer most people that came here today er i happen to have rejected a couple
erm because that's also what we don't do hide behind reject letters
mm
er regret letters
erm is er the other thing is when
mm
when we can start
we do have a fully UNK training course at head office
they vary only very slightly across all six companies but the most common thing is that we won't send people out
mhm
erm blind
mhm
okay
well that's not good for either is it
no
i can't i can't sell unless i'm happy with the product
er unless i believe in it myself i can't erm
well er this company has er survived for twenty years
it has it can't stop growing
mm
erm we own all the property at head office
there's no mortgage
mhm
we just bought a printing
brilliant
yes i know
in fact if you did a UNK and UNK
that's lovely isn't it
on us it would count in effect we're cash rich
yes yeah
the UNK so simple and the country's UNK with people who thought they could do it as well as us
mm
i noticed all the nice UNK as well
i was thinking i would
as in fact i had a go at that i had a go at i had a go at them about another UNK er another photograph
they've obviously lined up er all the best possible cars in the car park
i'm not sure is that the same photograph
have a look at this one
yes it is actually we use it on one of our other brochures but they've got all the er all the nice cars
and you see it when it generally er and also it's a perfect day
i haven't seen a perfect day like that over in blackpool yet
but in fact where it starts here to there's the old mill
right
right
these have been added on
mhm
it goes right the way you can see over there
it goes right the way back
now right at the back here further down is erm the building belongs to us all of this is own without a mortgage by us right at the end er is we we've UNK erm a section out to UNK
oh right yes
they're moving we so desperately need i think we've UNK and bought the lease er bought the remaining lease
we UNK it to them because we need that area
we're building new training schools we've already got a big one up on er in one of the er it's this end here
mhm
that's the whole of the training school
cos you
UNK
can see all the smokers gathering along there
sales meeting
when you have a sales meeting there's the whole all the sales people who smoke because it's a totally no smoking company
yes yeah
they have they by law they have to
i don't smoke i like that
by law they have to put somebody er put somewhere in there for people to smoke
but it's totally no smoking all the way through
mhm
and you see all the smokers lining up there
so that yes
in fact that shows the erm doesn't show
but they've been there for twenty years on that spot
and of course we are looking at other products all the time
i'm just investigating for the company er going onto radio
taking our ad that
ah
you see
so if people say to you well we're always seeing their ad
yes
you will because we're determined that ev you'll see our ad a lot
everybody will
excuse me
mhm
but it does give to some people that will demonstrate that we're always looking for people
yes
mhm
because we can't hold people
yes mhm
well the reverse is true
always looking for people because we need to add on
how do you feel maggie so far
are you are you erm
it sounds very interesting
mhm
okay
what about environment which one would you
what about environment
now which one would you choose
erm i don't know really
i don't know
erm i mean tell me in more depth how it works
right
erm you know from the
simply our consultants go on ask the full question sorry
how it works
yeah
i mean obviously you erm create the interest
right
now what we do erm and this takes an awful lot of workload from the sales consultant
mm mhm
we set up all the assignments
we have a separate marketing er executive group
right
that are travelling the u k right now on behalf of more than one of the companies
we have a marketing executive who signs up golf clubs
we have er two marketing execs three in fact that sign up schools medical practices and we have four i think to sign up estate agents
mm
all independently of each other going round to the well i say independently but they obviously get fed a lot of information from head office where we have a UNK operation
right
who do nothing else but phone businesses and organizations and surgeries and golf clubs and tell them about our products
right
they will have the same script almost and say this is a free of charge item all we need from you is this and this and if you're interested i'm gonna ask a marketing executive to come in and agree a contract with you
mm
in simple terms that's what they say
right mhm
marketing exec goes around signing up the contracts
mhm
right
there will be certain discussions which i'll go into in a minute at the at that stage which will determine what we're going to do for them
what we're going to do for them is certainly provide a free of charge product it's the numbers
right
and the when we're going to do it
yes
and the who's going to do it is not determined until a couple of days before either party knows
in other words if the estate agent or medical practice will get a phone call from us and say look we'd like to do your assignment is it convenient
they may say oh wow no we're just having something done at the surgery UNK
right
got a couple of new doctors coming in a new practice manager can you leave it for three months
okay so we put that back
another one UNK
right
and then we say who's available it's come up in north UNK erm who is available who is just finishing an assignment
oh maggie is erm fine where is she at the moment oh she's at UNK right well we'll give her a call at UNK and say this is where your new assignment is going to be
right okay
and that finishes on the friday or whichever day of the week and you start the next day
you can start the next day
if you decide you want a couple of days off to take your UNK shopping
or something like that er or your husband even with his cheque book then you just have to tell us
mm mhm
but if you have to tell us that you wanna week off we need some notice
because that might be right in the middle of an assignment and they
yes
do not like that
no
that's fair enough
no
so if you want one
so you've got to tie all your loose ends up haven't you
so all of this is all set up for you
right okay
so that's really you literally only have to listen to the phone call and turn up
mhm
all right
now most of the people who come to see us have never sold advertising have never wanted to
what we do is provide them all er all of them with er a training course an awareness which does include on some with some companies two days out in the field
either before or after the course
right
right
medical practices for instance two days beforehand before coming in for three days
right
fully UNK we pay all travelling and hotel bills
mhm
the reason i'm say ask people to erm give me some idea of where they feel i may have my own ideas where they feel depends on the information i UNK on people
that's why i like to get that out of the way
but in essence we are erm all of the sales er marketing execs are discussing the same thing with whichever organization
mhm
how many booklets how many postal wallets how many cards how many folders we're gonna print for them
right
that will depend on the information we get from them
mhm
we are er going to ask them to compile a list of businesses which they are happy for us to approach
mhm right
how are you doing your UNK at the tec
i've been provided with lists
and what typically are they
erm people erm the tec database actually
all right
and people who have responded to UNK that they've just sent out
where they're offering the free hours counselling and er and the two days yeah you know consultancy
and the investors okay yes all right
okay and what's the sort of reaction that you're getting from them
very good actually because it's free though isn't it
you can't really knock it can you
no
now that would be an ea that's er UNK in it's in it's pure sense in that you're offering something free are you interested
it's UNK form isn't it
it's soft
we have to UNK ourselves up for this
mm mhm
but if you've got the right attitude and right as i said on the notes right voice and the right er personality it it's just the same as having somebody face to face
we have the luxury of course of having to go face to face anyway
yes
because most UNK people don't even in advertising
mhm
they do it all through the fax
so after you you've erm do it would i then go out to see people is this what you're meaning
yeah
once you've go we what we don't do in advertising erm whatever your er your son may do himself is it your son in advertising
no
no
where did i get that from
don't know
he was in the UNK with us
oh sorry that was my last
my last
that's how you carry on
if i play my tape back i'll me say that again
erm no in terms of selling advertising we make sure that the prospective advertiser knows absolutely everything on the phone
mhm
we don't make appointments to go and see people to talk about advertising
only to talk about the contract and the copy
mhm
and to pick up a deposit cheque
right
if you if there are certain things that if you don't tell them on the phone including the price we tell we talk price
yeah there's the price it's size it's this product you know the reason we're phone you because you've been identified as by the estate agent or medical practice or school as being very suitable and they would very much like you to support this
right okay
and it will cost you this
it will cost you this per year for two years
mhm
and it will it will get to this number of people and this is how it will be used
now that's not face to face that is on the phone
that's right yes yeah mhm
and one of the things they do on the training course is to compile a script with you
mhm right
and i had a script but after a while you don't you set that aside and use your own style
mhm
i know
it's a good base to work on
yeah
they sometimes come across UNK don't they when you're trying to
yes that's right
trying to do your own thing and
yes and don't break in i've got to read my script
so that's
yes
in a UNK what we do
mhm
and quite honestly about it
it's not people only make this job difficult i believe erm if they don't listen to the people who's who have been doing these things for twenty years
mhm
and er i include myself in that by having been in sales and marketing for all those years i thought i could do anything
mm
but this is so different to what i'd been doing as it is for most people
mhm
well as to which discipline erm
i feel you can do this and i know you i think you know you can do this
i would think erm estate agents or schools
yeah i wouldn't put you in estate agents
wouldn't you
why
they've been going for twenty years and er there's er school is very much i would have put you straight into schools
would you
yes
oh well
i'm glad you if you if you'd
so i was half way there then wasn't i
have only mentioned estate agents i'd have i'd have been disappointed because
yes
you know now you've given me a let out
erm schools i think schools is just up your street mainly because erm and i'll tell you another why i think schools will benefit a lot of people going first of all it's a fairly new product so we're really in the launch up stage
mm
that actually benefits us here by the way
remember estate agents have been going for so long they say oh is that another folder
mhm
whereas you say i'm responding here for UNK park school or whatever you know that might not exist but
yes
erm er any school because estates state schools and independent schools
that's right
erm there's a certain prestige about erm going on to a school
as there is with all of those but not necessarily estate agents
yes
however the other aspect is that if you go to a medical practice you may have four or five doctors to help you out
if you go to an estate agent you may have two people to help you out
mhm
go to a golf club you may have just the golf secretary
go to a school you've got fifty to sixty teachers
mm
and i recommend to anybody who goes on the school i'm sure they do on the training course that the first opportunity i would have to address erm the con er the staff meeting you just say this is what i who i am this is why i'm here i've got a list of businesses which the school has provided with me already but i will i may erm if i bump into you in the corridor i may just say do you know anybody else
mhm
and they you know if you've got a bit of style and maturity about you that will go down well
mhm
let's talk about schools
mhm okay
that determines the pack i bring out you see
right
i may keep that that'll be helpful i'll send that back to the school er to the er incidentally would you like a cup of tea
i'm fine thanks rod actually no i'm fine thanks
would you mind if i ordered one cos i am
no not at all no
i missed lunch and everything
yes that coffee must be
when my wife UNK this she'll say
getting on with what you should be doing that can only see a few people doing that who are actually getting on with what they should have been doing while you are waiting
now you know that this UNK particularly difficult for me to be here on time
i come from one room to a from a long er way a way to another room
so i expect you to have the things out and
right let's get straight on
see if you can answer my question
UNK
so what did my question mean
what was i asking you kieran
what day is it is it today
what day is it today
good
and the answer is it's wednesday
what do you think my question means first of all richard
what date is it today
good boy well done you remembered that very well
what date is it today
now we've only done this one or two times
let me help you
we start off with the same two words every time
can anybody remember what those two words are
what do we begin with
kieran
the number what it is today
well we start we start we do put the number in but we start off with
now we have the number and today is the twelfth so we've got to think of number twelve
christopher
and now we simply have to think of the name of the french month
louise just put your pen down and join with this please
katrina
look at the board please i want all eyes on the board
let's try another date
who'd like to tell me when their birthday is
when's your birthday jo UNK
july
oh yeah what's the date
well just tell me in english first of all and then
july
we'll work it out
what july though
fifteenth the second the third
fifth
the fifth
all right so which two words are we going to start with
now all you have to do is think of number five for me cos you just say the number
and what's july in french
all right now before we do any more dates put your hands down and we'll have a few more birthday dates in a bit
but i need to practice with you counting up to thirty one
why do i need to practice that with you counting numbers up to thirty one
christopher
so you can tell date properly
that's right
because some months have got thirty one days in other months have got thirty days in and one month has only got twenty eight days in and twenty nine in a leap year
let's see who remembers this little UNK it's not a french UNK but it is a UNK that you may have heard before
thirty days UNK september april june and november all the rest have thirty one except for february alone which has twenty eight days clear and twenty nine in each leap year
so these are the months that only have thirty days september april june and november
those are days months with thirty days
so all the other months have thirty one
so put your hands up how many days has january this month
thirty one
now children am i right in thinking that when mrs came in and took some lessons with you when i was on a course that she taught you how to count up to thirty
no
you haven't been you haven't done that with mrs
right well that's something we need to do now
so we need to practice our numbers from twenty up to thirty one
so let's start and let's count UNK up to twenty to start with shall we
well i'm going to put twenty there where we've put the tens and i'm going to start shh
twenty one it's easy to remember
put your hand up if you can tell me number one in french
easy UNK
well twenty one french people say twenty and one twenty and one
now twenty two is so they don't say twenty and two it's only on the ones like twenty one thirty one forty one that you say twenty and one thirty and one
for the rest it's just like english numbers they say so hands up who can work out what twenty three will be
hands up don't call out please
richard
who'd like to tell me what twenty four will be
UNK
good girl
who can tell me what twenty five will be
lee
all right
i think more people are getting the idea of this now
who'd like to tell me what twenty six will be remember you're saying and then the num next number
UNK
come on nearly everybody ought to be able to work this one out now
UNK
that's lovely
can you all tell me together what twenty eight will be
so twenty nine will be
you've got it well done that's lovely
now thirty is a new number
thirty is
excuse me
so can anybody work out what thirty one will be
remember that is twenty and twenty one is thirty so what will thirty one be steven
good boy
who can put their hand up and tell me the next number
who can tell me thirty two
UNK
who can tell me the next number
i'm looking for somebody who hasn't had their hand up this lesson jennifer
i'll do it
well let's see if you can do this one then
right if you can do it join in put your hand up
who can tell me what thirty four will be adam
who'd like to tell me what thirty five will be
UNK can you do this one for me
what's the number five
have you forgotten that one
you help her with katrina
no that's who'd like to tell me thirty six
christopher
UNK
right
you can all do this next one together
now i have gone beyond thirty one because i just wanted to show you the way it goes and it's easy
there obviously aren't more than thirty one days in a month but we'll just practice then counting from twenty now and we'll stop at thirty nine
all right now that we can do numbers up to thirty one let's see if we can do a few more dates
turn your chairs round so you're looking at this board
hands up if you remember what two words we're going to begin our answer with
UNK would you like to bring your chair over
rachael can you see the board from where you're sitting
if you can't bring your chair over
UNK just bring your chair over
come round and see the board
what are the two words please louise
well look at this board look at my first two i've done here as an example
okay now let's have somebody else's birthday
katrina
twenty eighth of december
right let's see if we can work this out together
she said it's the twenty eighth and the month is december
so we think of number twenty eight first of all
UNK
and the month was december
who'd like to tell me that
steven
listen then repeat
jennifer i don't want to see the back your head any more
i know you're doing your french work sheet but turn round and put that down now
it's time to do this work
much better
who'd like to kieran tell me your birthday
well done kieran he had already worked his out good boy
can anybody else do that
can anybody else think of their birthday in french
UNK
well let's help UNK then
twenty ninth of december
right what's twenty nine children
hands up if you know twenty nine
michael
good boy
and it's the same month as that again
who's birthday was this
was that yours kieran
that's not far off now is it
it will be your birthday very soon
jennifer
ah is it the first of the month
right well good
i'm glad there's somebody's come up with that one because that's the only time that you say something a little bit different from the number itself
when it is the first day put your hands down while we're ex while i'm explaining this when you say when it's the first day of any month whether it's the first of february or the first of april or the first of december instead of say you say this word you say for the first of the month
and when you write it as a number it's the only time that you ever put any little letters next to it
the rest of the time you just put the normal number
but for the first of the month you have these two letters e r
all right against the number one
what does that word remind you of
does it remind you of excuse me does it remind you of a word in english at all
michael
UNK
yes it's like UNK isn't it like in football the UNK league which is the first the top league
or if somebody has a UNK it means it's the first time that they do something
because it's a word that we've borrowed from the french word
we've taken it from their language and we use it in ours now meaning first
richard
put your hands up tell me what date UNK birthday is
what date is UNK birthday
UNK
twenty ninth of july
the twenty ninth of july good

minutes of the meeting held on the seventeenth november
right er matters arising from the minutes
nothing on page one page two page three page four page five page six page seven
yeah page seven er i think that speaking from memory we did want that made clear that er was the recognition of the achievements of the UNK particularly in relation to the high standards of UNK in the park
that's right
i think it's important that should er be madam chairman
we also agreed that erm performance assessment reports in the future would be provided by the chair and finance after considering the recommendations of the chairman of the recreation ground committee and the clerk
don't these minutes
no
no i didn't query them
sorry
because but i just felt that er those particular aspects were important for future year because of the er discussions that took place
erm we are dealing with public funds and er and those that particular minute i think relate to detailed discussions that took place before approval was given
i wrote to both and the UNK and said that is was for a performance related bonus and er
yeah that's fine
an anything else from the minutes
can we go on to the minutes of the committee meeting of sixth december then
anything arising from them page one page two page three
right we we're not doing the minutes for the tenth of january because you've only just got the copies this evening so that's being erm we'll go through those at the next meeting
financial statement bills for payment
queries
has anyone got any queries about them
erm can i just mention then about the car park and the total cost of it now
okay
erm just to go over the payments for the car park which has come up actually under community industries and the plants the total being now for plants it was four hundred and forty four pounds er
and the UNK right UNK and plants and what was the other bit
and there was some wood for UNK
wood for UNK
erm and then the actual the labour charges from the er what are they called
community
community industries labour charges for car park were eight hundred and twenty two fifty but that's got to have the vat deducted from it
erm so it's a total of approximately one thousand
skip hire
skip hire
oh skip hire as four hundred pounds
that makes it a total of about one thousand five hundred
from that we have six hundred and fifty allowed for the car park from last year for paper bank money four hundred and five UNK money just come in
yes
from the paper bank and four hundred pounds worth of grant two hundred from the county council and two hundred from the district council so added up car park
mm
okay
yes
yes
i mean i think i think in UNK the erm this isn't intended as a criticism erm of past work but i do think we need to look at getting as much volunteer help in the town towards UNK environmental achievements as possible because one of our one of our claims is that we're cost effective and can UNK voluntary effort and if we erm put all of our work out to tender including relatively small works we're actually going to UNK that particular claim and we're gonna look as er cost UNK as the district council and the county council in their use of professional help all the time even though there may be people in the community who are prepared to help
i think we need to plan our projects so that we can UNK voluntary efforts as much as possible particularly in small projects er when they come up in future
i think that's an important part of our claim
erm we criticize the county council because it's always using professional work rather than voluntary help er because that's the way they choose to do it er if we continue this line
i think can i just say one thing we did actually h it wasn't community industry erm the people that did it i don't know
they trained that's the
to be honest because erm it's and that i won't say that there's a criticism of this particular project which i supported at the time but i think that in future we do need to plan our projects and there are people in the in the town that are prepared to work perhaps need a bit of organizing we need to think about how that might happen but we mustn't first reaction go to professional or UNK help
any more
erm it may be erm a good idea to use it as a erm as a first scheme perhaps to erm to try and er car park and if you look at that at the beginning and just keep it on a on a rolling programme then all that doesn't get so enormous er it doesn't get such a large task so maybe if er but it does need coordinating perhaps we should think about it
yes
right
any other comments on the financial statements
can you tell me what a planting of a quick is
when the men installed the new er fence on the nature reserve
mm
that so it doesn't look like a new fence we planted quick
and plants are they
yes quick plants
i'm sorry
right well
i haven't been to one of the meetings so i can't remember who the but how are all these contained within the budget all these costs and have they all been approved and agreed
what
the bills for payment
i haven't actually done the UNK backwards and forwards
i think so
is there anything that to comment on that
well er the bills during the month of december and early january erm hire of waste paper skip erm if you if query the reason we hired the chain UNK to save ourselves spending thousands of pounds on doing tree works
we've now got a trained erm chain saw operator working for us
that's saved us about nine hundred and forty pounds
the three hour the recreation chairman asked that we er standard bills for garage for petrol and centre for the standard items
er i'd like to mention the contribution to the market square refurbishment
erm jim asked me if we could pay up er as soon as the job had been done to help them with their cash flow situation district council
erm i i've allowed don to have a jacket as he was getting UNK
erm
out of interest madam chairman does that mean we've paid the total amount that we said that we would contribute
yes
so on the second stage of the refurbishment they're going to pay for the lot
yes
er the account of contribution towards cost of the installation of two new footpath lights this is on the footpath that runs between the school church street side and the minster
er there was a lady fell over about two months ago on that footpath just at the beginning of the winter and the cathedral council offered to pay for the installation of a light and what we did we contributed seventy seven pounds which is sixty including v a t to enable a second light to be installed because of the two steps on that footpath one at each end erm
did that i can't remember that coming to the council did that come to the council
no the chairman erm agreed that one out of committee
the reason for that is they wanted to go ahead and produce the two lights
erm what happened was the cathedral council one light in at a cost of four hundred and fifty pounds but they couldn't afford the second light so we got some money from erm the residents who contributed some money we got some money from the school and there was a shortfall of sixty six pounds thirty one pence for the total bill so the chairman er
er we do actually have money in the budget for the actual erm
so it may just
so it could actually come out of that couldn't it
there is
chairman there seem to be when i looked at it there seem to a number of headings here that i couldn't account for and i've asked the chair of the finance committee she couldn't account for them either and i think it's whilst i understand the reasons for going and i'm sure we would have approved them i think it's actually quite important that all these small sums wh when you add them up over this erm over this month and you look at them are quite large over the budget that we have already adopted and the things that we wanted to do and it concerns me that some of these things which are maybe very sensible actually reduce our effectiveness of doing things that the council's agreed that they are going to do this year and next year the seventy six pounds here the thirty pounds later on fifty four pounds for large UNK plants et UNK et UNK and a hundred and fifty pounds over the budget on the christmas lights
all of those extra sums if you total them up we're talking about quite a lot of money over the budget and that's why i'm getting concerned because there seems to be some between what the budget said we were going to do and what a chairman here and a chairman there has agreed and i i'd like to get it back onto position
yes i would agree with that but i wondered i think perhaps it should be the finance committee i mean cos i understood that most of these items are contained within the existing budget because i mean the individual committees do have the power to the monies within their own and i it has it i would agree with peter that if we have gone over and above the that the committee were working to but i understood that was not the case so i
would you like to comment on that
yes
there are a number of areas erm john expression was and yet it is possible to find the monies
the problem we had is because if in december when we put the christmas lights up for example to use that as prime example we put one erm UNK i think it's called on the tree it was absolutely pathetic
erm so the chairman erm agreed to this additional purchase
there was no meeting in erm
december
in december so it wasn't actually possible to sort out these queries
and i accept there are a number here of items i mean there's er another one that peter mentions which was the er large UNK plants to UNK the children from climbing the newly UNK fence at the nature reserve
the problem there was the children climbing the fence and with just having spent five hundred and eighty pounds putting a fence up spent another fifty four pounds although it's not in the budget i accept that er was er a necessary expenditure which i took a decision on straight away because i didn't want to see our five hundred pound fence being knocked down within a week of being put up
so i accept there are a number of items here which i discussed with the chairman and he agreed to
but i agree
any more comments on the financial statement and the bills for payment now
correspondence
right that's
two items
two items
one of the quotes a new mower from
having received three quotes from three different companies i wanted the company chosen to agree that they wouldn't exceed a certain price and they have confirmed that the mower we've chosen will not exceed eighteen thousand six hundred and sixty eight pounds and this is for everything this is the mower including the new cab erm and all the fittings that we wanted included on mower
right items UNK
actually agreeing to that quotation i wanted to be sure what the other figures were
that was done at a previous meeting it was
yes
i don't
you're not agreeing to it are you
no we are
are we
it's already been ordered
oh it's been ordered
there was a to madam chairman where we thought that erm three quotations should be retained
mm
erm i can't recall erm any quotations having been put for approval but neither can i find anything
no
the last council meeting erm so i'm a bit confused as to where we discussed it
we'll find while he's just finding that look there's just one more item that's erm a christmas card from so i'll pass that round so you can have a while we're just trying to find
perhaps it was the october meeting i can't remember
no
i don't think it was
but i don't know
madam chairman i recall giving three quotes twenty one thousand something nineteen thousand
something and eighteen
oh well
to confirm that i i've heard it somewhere i mean
i'm sure it was one of the meetings
it was
mm
but wh well what are you looking for now to see if we actually made a decision on it
yes
no i asked you for formally for permission to go ahead and go ahead with the
i've looked er erm
i think it was when we actually settled the erm the budget er for the various
you know if everybody's happy that we've accepted the lowest quote then fine
right that was just a letter for reference anyway
yeah
wasn't it
ca can you repeat that figure again please
yes sixteen sorry eighteen thousand six hundred and sixty eight pounds
thank you
plus v a t
plus v a t
right move onto UNK oh no sorry UNK reports
does anyone have any reports on any of the committees
just as a matter of interest i was gonna bring up onto the er planning minutes for the tenth of january but as i wasn't allowed er the i had a phone call from the electricity board following the erm discussions that we had about the power supply on road they'd received a follow up enquiry from the press if you recall we expressed concern that we thought that secured following the harsh winter three years ago
sorry just what item is this under is it are you
it's UNK reports
i'm representing you as the consultative
the reason i'm bringing this up is that the gentleman in question wants to come to the parish council and put on a short video of the electricity board's er activities in this area
he's aware of concern expressed by parish council and he's going to see them and he will be very happy to come and er speak to us and answer any questions that we wish him to so i advised him to contact the clerk to make arrangements
i thought this would sort of save steve having to write a letter as he'd been er instructed to do
i didn't know where else to get it in
erm mr
er yes chairman
the i'm your representative for the minster governors and i'll be UNK out later on this evening if i may of the installation of the new UNK that will be seven minutes time so if you'll excuse me
alright
appointments which
so perhaps we might need to do might want to until i return which i shouldn't think will take too long
so you won't be very long then
no
right
er christine
having said nothing about the er the charity erm the meeting on erm the meetings four times a year and we're quite but there are some available for erm people erm and particularly to erm we agreed a list of people who wished to give them christmas gifts cash but i'm sure they would help and erm the names of people who might need help er are always welcome so if i could just erm ask people to let me know if they know of anyone financial help
thank you erm anyone else
well i don't know what this comes under but last or er last saturday week i had several complaints about the old market square you know where er and shop is
it was an absolute disgrace it really was a disgrace and so as we'd been informed by somebody at now don't ask me who cos i don't know but from one of the public meetings we held er they said you can phone up any time and you y the rubbish would be collected
so i took them at their word and phoned them up
well the man nearly went through the roof and er this was a saturday morning of course he didn't come and in the meantime i had another UNK re complaint about the path outside the w i hall again which was a disgrace not one person but several people
and erm and then on the sunday morning it was the local UNK erm who were taking down the christmas trees and things they had to clear up they didn't have to but they did clear up the mess it was a disgrace
when the man came from i wouldn't know but i just felt as a op UNK parish councillor that i should make my voice heard on behalf of all the people that complain to me
right
that's all
right
i mean perhaps saturday morning isn't the right time to phone but it was
probably erm the clerk could perhaps deal with that then
mm
if they do query it cos i mean erm it really was a disgrace and i i'm pretty UNK
i think madam chairman you'll find that there's in the administration that er an officer he's left and i think replaced
that's probably why she got the response she did
mm
thank you we can follow up that up anyway erm
only because so many people complain i mean i just had to do something
i did phone the hot line earlier in the week er because the bin outside school hadn't been UNK for since before christmas er cos i put a UNK cap in there myself
which was in the middle of the road but i phoned them and to be fair to them they responded very UNK very UNK and dealt with it straight away so erm
mm
apart from the fact by the UNK they did respond immediately
i i've only got one report that i went to erm a meeting of the youth club erm in december i think it was we just had sort of general discussions nothing really to report erm back on that
we discussed erm other places for people to meet et UNK has actually been closed down some problem with the isn't it erm but they can't use it for the public so erm that was it was just left that we'll have another meeting in march and looking around for alternative places to meet but that's all to report on that
erm can i suggest then that we questions from the public
anyone oh one member of the public here did you want to
no
right then
we can't do item eight because peter
is going to talk about it and he's gone
could we defer it erm and do the other items first
is that okay number eight at the end
now we can do the reports on the car park
er roger could you do that one please
er yes
w we have looked into er the question of car parking in southwell and the possibility of charging for long term parking
erm the views of the er of the UNK are that this does appear to be er perhaps a practical solution er and at the moment er we are looking to erm make some of the spaces certainly in the church street car park erm short term i e two hours certainly so the people who are who are making shopping visits or visits to the banks et UNK would get the lower car park and the people who are staying for a longer time would be at the top
er in relation to king street er car park there are there are UNK in relation to er the usage of the car parking spaces erm and the health centre and on street car parking erm and we are going to do er further work in surveying the usage of those spaces and how we could perhaps better allocate them to ensure that there are erm spaces available for people who need to get to the surgery and the UNK will be reporting back to the council
erm the cost of capital costs of signing er will also be looked at and then a further report from the UNK to the council
does anyone have any comments
could i ask through you chair er how this system is going to be UNK
that is the problem erm in so far as initially er we felt that it that the onus would be on the individual i e if it's a short term stay car park they would not use it
erm and one would have to see the effectiveness of that
what one doesn't want to do er is by having to police the situation cause a charge to be erm brought up against the council
erm so it's a question of how one can best do it but initially it would be er the onus would go on the individual to use the spaces not designated as short stay
i think the UNK thing about the parking in the town is the way that some of the disabled slots at the surgery are taken by the cars of people who are perfectly able to walk from the car park and i think the great problem we're going to have is we're going to rely on the public UNK of our fellow UNK and there does seem to be a fair group of people who are extremely selfish when it comes to come to parking
well shall i tell you that a certain member of the er medical staff you know they've got UNK where the staff can put their cars in a certain place and one member of the staff came out and said please remove your car it's in the staff parking part the person said yes i even had to move the UNK
well i mean how do you win
i'm not sure
i think we have quite a task of public education
i don't know what happened but i think
the problem in the UNK surgery i mean you've got people taking ill sick children round there with high temperatures and they do tend want to park close to the surgery er and if they see a space they will obviously use it
i think it's a difficult situation i mean i know in er in nottingham now if the car parks are full you actually get directed by the attendant to use a disabled space
erm so it does mean that as parking becomes more and more UNK it the subject does become more and more UNK
but i agree with stuart i think what we've got be careful is that if we're gonna introduce something it is actually erm capable of being enforced and it's very difficult to see us an UNK agent
if i recall er when that er the king street car park was given to the town by the UNK we did want entrance er at the top end of the car park for the people who UNK which saved a lot of people coming round that dangerous corner where you know we've had one fatal accident there and i just wondered whether we should take this under the umbrella while er we're actually discussing it
well that's interesting because yes we have we have discussed that and i don't know whether the er the clerk wants to comment further but i think that is absolutely right and if that could be taken further it would be of very positive benefit to you know the car parking problem for those people who want to shop on king street and have difficulties in find a car parking space
the district council actually commented to me that they'd like to see that entrance opened where that er derelict building is at the top end of church street car park which would be an ideal entrance
we did nearly get it through once didn't we years ago
no
i can't remember what UNK i think the person or something i can't remember details but we nearly had an entrance at that end of the car park which in my opinion was you know a lot of the people
there is an entrance at the moment
the top of the top of church street car park through
top of church street car park
to king street
well how
there needs to be an entrance there then
no
for UNK you're suggesting not
UNK
oh yes oh yes UNK
oh yes sorry
well can i say that er we'll take that on board rather more positively
mm
er at the UNK and report back
and can the clerk look into the details when this i think
yes
you know there should be some document somewhere
erm i'd hate it to er we get charging away and
we aren't intending to charge
no well income from that
no we're not no we're not er
anyone else anything to add on that
no
purchase of play equipment for gardens playing field and the recreation ground
we have actually erm got a number of leaflets and brochures on play equipment but erm as was mentioned at the last meeting i was going to get together with david and the clerk to discuss future plans for play equipment but we haven't actually had a meeting yet cos we're still getting information from various reps and playground equipment companies and erm we'll leave that item for now
erm item sorry
wh while you're on that madam chairman i've had two persons er contact me as regarding you know playing field and er it's a no go for dogs isn't it and th and we therefore the people have mentioned they had to go down the side of the playing field onto the onto the old and er have we an obligation to er to UNK not UNK it but er make it it's a very steep bank a very steep old ladies daren't go down and they know they're breaking the law by taking the dog in the in the er recreation ground and i just wondered whether we had an obligation to er
those people with dogs in that sort of situation are very welcome to walk through the playing field and then out the other side and away i wouldn't stop them going over from that entrance to the to the top entrance
well
and er i was just wondering we ought to do something i mean these poor old UNK have UNK to what we have said and facilities for them to get down onto to the er the
i would accept that bank is very steep
yes it is it is very steep
erm it's not a very
UNK you know terrible the poor old UNK daren't go
they're tongue in cheek going across the recreation ground thinking that we're going to UNK on them because they're not allowed in there
so you know it's a for them
i would say i think that's a very good point chairman now can we ask perhaps either our UNK or whatever to look at it to see if something to make it safer for these people to er get access to
i was going to suggest something similar but erm can we say is it public footpath er
yes well it
sort of track are contacting the people who done a very good job on the on the public footpath erm and that was actually going through our land and they done some steps with erm you know erm wooden erm supports in them er maybe in conjunction with was it
was it the UNK
er the UNK they
the UNK did it the newark UNK they did they did the one at the bottom of lane
now this is the one on road
oh
if you could find out who did that and
was it and possibly give us some help but erm
can i just make one point er all the footpaths need rain so it might just be
but conditions at the moment are just very bad i think generally anyway
mm
any more on that subject of the erm playground no
shall we put in item eight now as peter is back
back to item eight then
if you'd er allow me to go back to item seven briefly
erm this news is until twelve noon please tomorrow
er the UNK the governors have just made an appointment of erm to the UNK of who's the current deputy head senior deputy at he'll be taking up his appointment er at easter
did you say not UNK
mm
i apologize
erm find some empty chairs
we still haven't got a name for this er facility been dragging on for some time
mm
we er actually do need to decide what the name ought to be
er we have got one suggestion here from UNK and that's sports park anyone else
what about the er centenary sports ground
well that would certainly be my favourite we we'll be coming up to our hundredth anniversary aren't we fairly soon
erm really this has been to a large extent i think a parish council initiative and i'm sure all the members of this council are enthusiastic supporters of UNK democracy in the role of parish councils
a few years er beyond er our why not celebrate our own centenary
high profile
i think centenary park has quite a ring to it
no centenary park not centenary sports ground then
that's a bit of a UNK
centenary park
do was there any other suggestions
cos we ought to decide tonight
because it's been going on a long time
centenary a centenary in our parish last year wasn't it
the UNK this year
eighteen ninety four the local government act
it had a UNK passage through parliament
it created parish councils
it's an ideal name
does anyone have any suggest any more suggestions
yes madam chairman
er centenary seems and i know we are round this table
and i was thinking of the UNK who actually offered this er
facility for us to take it up and er i would like to see may be er some something incorporated there was one suggestion of a UNK park or something of that nature wasn't there in those suggestions we had have we still got that one could you could you just er inform me what it really said
erm i don't know we didn't er did we formally
if we decide on the first then we can decide whether it's a park or a sports ground or what shall we do
shall we shall we put them to the vote how shall we do this
well i i'm i think that er i'm less worried about UNK it cos i think it actually quite important to date it like the war memorial ground and actually fairly closely although it's not actually dated to the end of the war i mean it was nineteen fifty two when it was established
but it ties it in to a date and i think in a similar way erm centenary which is the only thing we're going to do UNK i think that it could be the only thing we do to celebrate our hundred years of existence apart from a small exhibition in
can i make one more suggestion one to combine two of these to call it southwell centenary park would that make it any better
well it's just another idea
there were comments last time about trying to give it a name so people realized where it was
that it was in
or you could call it brinkley centenary
but is it just the centenary of the parish council that's why i thought of the southwell bit but what do y what about that
can i ask madam chairman is it is it for anything else except football
i don't know
well facilities for anything else other than football
i think the answer is yes
mm
but it's football initially cos they've shown an interest and i think that the pitch is there for anybody
and the summer uses
given our UNK years john UNK
well what shall i read what we've got so far then
excuse me do won't the UNK asked at one stage
yes
didn't they come up with anything
nothing
i phoned them last week and said you know have you got any suggestions and they said they'd come back to me and they haven't
they're too busy on the national curriculum
the i mean there's not a huge choice here is there we've got two or three words you've got southwell sports park centenary park UNK park brinkley park erm what do you think shall we have a vote on it how shall we do this
can i propose that we vote either to go for southwell centenary cos i think they are the UNK either or and then we also have another vote for UNK or brinkley and then we have a vote between the winners of either of those two
because then that gives us a chance of voting for a for a third option
is this is this matter madam chairman
is this matter urgent or important or is it urgent and important
well i think that it's gone on a long time and it's not
it has
it's not that hard to decide a name i think we ought to
well i think that what you're in danger of coming up with is a camel
erm no seriously i think it really shouldn't take long you're quite right to sort this matter out but i think three people really should go away and come back with a suggestion or a couple of suggestions
yes
because you're going to get into a situation where you're taking amendments to the amendment and you well with great respect i think you would be better to duck out at this stage
but we did mention this at the last meeting didn't we
mm
mm
and we did put forward ideas then as well
well as i say i think three people would make a better of it and come back with their recommendations
let's ask who would like to vote on it now then
who thinks we should decide it now
chairman we have something on the agenda
we're going to name the sports ground i think we should stick to the agenda
we should name it
can i ask you a UNK erm it seems silly to me to call it anything other than by the name of the place where it is
i mean it seems stupid to call it UNK
brinkley everybody knows where brinkley is
or if they ask for brinkley people can be guided there
it's er sort of like calling a place in UNK
i think the fact is that er we are in a situation where up and down the country parish councils have been er doing things and organizing events and er providing facilities to mark one hundred years of er of parish local services
and this particular project a lot of hard work has gone into it by members of the parish council and er i think it's perfectly appropriate and the ground was bought it wasn't UNK er it's come of the er erm the funds that parish council receives from er residents and i think that it's perfectly appropriate that it should mark one hundred years of parish local government
we have the county council and the district councils telling us what a good job they do at the present time spending a lot of money in doing it we have provided this largely out of our own efforts we've got grants from er other bodies i think it's something that we should properly erm UNK as an initiative of this parish council to celebrate one hundred years of parish government and i would propose centenary field
centenary field
the reason i stated that is there's plenty of football grounds that are known as fields
erm a park tends to give the impression of being like a memorial park erm equally it's not just earmarked for football which is it could be er seen as just that the idea was that it would provide facilities for all types of sports and interests throughout the er throughout the area particularly er girls i know girls play football but there's a lot of interest in er sport particularly hockey and i personally wouldn't like to see it just dominated by football
erm so the term field i think is perfectly acceptable to mean all things to all people
erm
a ground
well
southwell i mean centenary sports ground
well le shall we take a vote on the first word and then decide whether it's a park a sports field or a sports park or whatever
chairman before we do that could i just make an observation on
yes
what er councillor said
i think er he has a very valid point but i think whatever we call it doesn't include the location
the UNK going to be UNK
mm
so if we call it centenary sports ground the next thing that will be added to it is brinkley the centenary sports ground brinkley which is fine
and i think erm that the issue of location is going to be resolved anyway whether we add it to the name or not
yes quite right
i mean clubs that are arranging UNK will be responsible for telling they'll know where it is and they'll be responsible for telling people who are coming there where it is
we don't need to go into
address i used to play for UNK cricket club half the clubs used to go to UNK in lincolnshire before they found us
if we eliminate the name of the place as being the first word we're down to centenary or UNK then
you wouldn't
no
well can somebody suggest on this thing cos i'm so confused now
well could we have centenary title
right yes
i will hold with that
right who thinks that the word centenary should be in the title then
okay
seven
do again
no
well you should really
centenary being in the title
so UNK got to be in the title then yes
next word is it going to be a sports park a field
or a sports ground
weren't you going to ask weren't you going to suggest that three people choose this
what about centenary field brinkley then
well we know it's at brinkley don't we
but that will be added we don't need to discuss that
right the next word then should it be field or a sports park
or sports
or sports ground
ground right then
doesn't it continue erm UNK down the field now we've got the ball rolling could i propose sports ground
right
and i'll second that
now who who's in favour of sports ground then being the next word
right and who's against that
so we now have centenary sports ground then
but why is it necessary to why isn't the centenary sports ground and it's at road
you know why is brinkley so important
brinkley is where it is
is it brinkley
do we have to
go down the road it's got brinkley up
you've got to have a correct address david
centenary sports ground on the notice board you know that it's brinkley
oh yes
you've got a road sign
thank you gentlemen
erm
mr carry on
voted on centenary sports ground
yeah
well the
centenary sports ground
no we don't need to vote on it any more
erm if you recall in our UNK erm in our discussions when i presented the last the last minutes of the er s the UNK which has purchased the ground we agreed to erm co er co work with two other two of the clubs sports clubs to establish a management committee which we would then hope would take over management of the ground from the parish council
at the moment centenary sports ground is owned and managed entirely by the parish council on the parish council rates and as you know it's been planted and it's coming up well
we need to move this into the next stage which is to get it managed for a sports field sports ground properly
and the management committee will do that
the two clubs are i think are in the process of UNK er members and have asked us to put forward two parish councillors to be their UNK
so we're looking for two additional representatives on this parish council to be our UNK on the management committee and the management committee will present us with proposals to buy the ground in due course
could i erm nominate erm roger
would you like to
i i'm happy to serve as long as it isn't you know i mean i can't give a lot of time because er my time's so committed
UNK anyone else who wants
how about you david
no i'm s no i'm sorry i couldn't er
david i'd like to propose but as you proposed him
i'm quite happy to do it
perhaps
alright do we do we need to vote on that
before you move on madam chairman may i make a suggestion general approval presumably we will be UNK a notice board er at the ground er and i would think it would be appropriate having selected the name that we make er erm some statement on the notice board saying the facility was originally provided by southwell parish council
similar to erm the UNK that is er up at with the help they've had from er interested er people there
i think that the parish council's involvement should be by reference on the board
i think chairman within our within our original budgets erm we're still awaiting
the provision of electricity and water to the site but within the original budget and with the estimates and quotations we've had there will be some money available for the UNK of a small sign so perhaps er i propose that we do that within the budget that we've already established for the purchase of the ground wh which is within budget at the moment so if there's any spare after the provision of electricity and water to the site suggested
but i think that er this er centenary sports ground gonna be large enough for the public to see and this and wants to be on a smaller metal er edition that's there for er ever and a day
right
you see my point it's not a like a m and s or railway sign one small sign you know at the bottom or wherever
yes
in an appropriate position
this glorious name and just
i mean i'm not don't get me wrong i'm not one of these formal you know UNK to everything but the idea of this is that we go we get it off the ground and then the management committee take over and run it will hopefully have two parish representatives won't be UNK by being you know constantly UNK and UNK by people saying this is your ground
erm but i just thought that it is appropriate in the circumstances because we have basically provided this facility that there should be erm
on the part of the public that this was a facility provided by the parish council it's not just a sports club facility as will develop over the years which is what we intended but it doesn't belong to those clubs facility was originally provided by us
is that it then
it is
oh i'm sorry
i have one other can i reserve one matter to the end of the meeting because i wish to make a proposal which er would be erm i think ought to be taken erm in closed session because of the nature and confidentiality of the business and personal interests so perhaps i can propose the closure of the meeting to the press and public at the end of the meeting and defer the final item an item relating to this matter at that time
item eleven then
i think all they want to do is kn is the existing one needs pulling down am i right
and then they want to build a new one where the old one is at the moment
right
they've actually drawn a very detailed plan for it shows us where the war memorial recreation ground
where it was
and yes where it is er and it says please find UNK plan for mower store present wooden hut is inadequate for our requirements
erm they're going to pay for everything they're going to build it they're going to submit planning application they're gonna do everything
so all they're asking really as you're the landlords do you have any objection to them building a new er mower store
how big is it
how big is it chairman in relation to the existing shed
be the same size
it'll be slightly larger
when you say slightly larger will it be more visible or i mean the present one is partially hidden in actual fact
the measurements are eight foot by nine foot
it's on the same site and everything to be honest i've never measured the old one
green felt covered concrete roof red bricks to er local authority local authority
erm doesn't given any more details than that but it's red brick to local authority approval so they're going to submit it to them for them to agree that it fits in
i think one of the problems is they had a break in and had quite a lot of gear stolen and that's why they want a concrete roof so they can't er get in through the roof
i can understand that
it'll come up again at the planning meeting anyway
this is just asking us for permission for them to apply for planning permission
right we'll move on now to item twelve southwell tennis club permission for UNK
i believe we've had a letter
asking if we will contribute towards UNK is that it
what they're actually asking for is that whether we would be able to help them by arranging for a loan on their behalf they would service the debt at this time so i might suggest chairman that we revert it to the finance committee for
yes can we put that to the finance committee
as a matter of urgency i think chairman be because if we're going to apply we need to apply for the first of april
credit approvals now get taken up so quickly because the government doesn't let much money borrow erm much money to be borrowed parish councils unfortunately so we need to do it fairly urgently if we're going to get it on the list i think the list is already about ten parish councils long
when is the next finance
we were hoping to erm organize arrange one quite soon
so this
right okay then
erm maintenance of rights of ways in southwell item thirteen
it's just a letter from the county council about footpaths erm shall we
this department has been running an experimental scheme called project
this project was set up by the county council and countryside commission to experiment with new approaches to path maintenance
due to the pilot nature of the scheme it is only operating in a few selected areas initially which is why your parish has not been contacted
this project has already demonstrated the positive benefits of working with both parish councils and the farming community
the work is due to finish in may nineteen ninety four and the results assessed
after this time the rights of way team have every intention of working more closely with parishes and farmers throughout the county am i right in saying that people talk to us about this
i think it's do with us taking over the foot the footpaths isn't it
can you say more on that
what will basically happen is we would organize the clearance of footpaths within southwell boundary and so they would give us an amount of money each year and then we would er take on we would nominate which footpaths are to be cleared we have got far more ideas than they have in nottingham need attention
but they were quite happy to come along and discuss it with the parish council erm and
am i right in saying women's institute don't they go round and checking up on sorry erm footpaths
and what happens about re repairing of UNK and all that sort of business
a at the moment what happens is individual people report back to the clerk
mm
the county council's responsible for footpaths
i know they refer to don't they
UNK
mm
i think they're erm
but house er erm what is that that's the footpath people isn't it they always come and repair things if they're told at least they sh but obviously they have to work in UNK with the farmers er concerned
controlled by the county council
mm
erm and they've got the responsibility of all the footpaths in the area
i think what they're trying to say is if it was more UNK it would be easier
yes but they've still got to keep in touch with the farmer concerned or farmers
yes
they can't just say we're going to repair the footpath
then it will be the parish council instead of the county council
but you've still got to liaise with the farmer or something
yes
but i would do it rather than
oh i see yes
mm
a splendid initiative and it's similar to the way in which the district council is now UNK responsibility for public toilets and i'm delighted that local government reorganization has been given a bit of UNK that districts and county councils to get their acts together
i'd actually go a bit further and say yes we'd like to do this can we also look after road maintenance as well because the road maintenance is sent out to contractors are so busy they can't actually do half this work they've got a list as long as your arm so pit UNK in the pavements as well as some of the motorways aren't being done because the UNK been placed but they've placed it with the wrong people
we know where the problems are we can actually solve those problems and i think that's where parish council actually far closer in touch with the people because we're on the ground and there are fifteen of us
in the village and one of you know that's than the county council which is over the river in house
but i think i'd actually like to support that idea i think we ought to er write back to them and say it's a splendid idea erm let's have more of it and thank you to the local government commission for s er seeing to this after a hundred years
don't we want write and in fact get him to come to the next meeting then
yes
madam chairman er just as it happens er i've been in conversation with mr assistant
and ha and southwell parish is a very big parish and i think i'm right is saying there are sixty seven footpaths in southwell sorry
more than that
and i don't want to i don't want to get involved with a lot of money that we'd have to UNK for UNK until we've gone into it thoroughly
mm
because at the moment er i mean they spend a lot of money on various footpaths that i know of which are a tremendous er price so let's be a bit cautious you know because er
i don't want to be UNK with a great bill just for footpaths
i think you we can ask him all these questions then can't we
will you let us know please when and maybe some of the footpath people local footpath secretary or chairman
when shall i get him to come to one our meetings
yes perhaps you'll let me know
alright now there's one
item on the agenda right at the end late edition which is the UNK on control of dogs which i think is something we discussed years ago
but i can hardly remember what we decided but it seems that we've now got to
that we did agree that we would we would we would go along with so erm
ninety two
yeah the minutes of the meeting of the nineteenth of february nineteen ninety two that's an awful long time ago erm and it is proposed to bring into force byelaws for district and parish council owned land upon or as soon as possible after the first of april nineteen ninety two
the byelaws as proposed would be for a dog ban at the UNK play area of the war memorial recreation ground and for the memorial recreation ground excluding the tennis courts and bowling green the play area at gardens
it was agreed that the byelaws for dog ban at the UNK play area be endorsed and clarification be sought for the possibility of dog ban in other areas which is included in the document
there's quite a lot of information in on this proposal
right so what you're asking to do is to sign it and send it back
agreeing that we should and send it back
mm
mm
who's this letter from then
county council
district
erm district
because i mean they're being e i've lived here twenty three years this comes up every three or four years this dog business
i mean i've written UNK letters and nothing's been done
i apologize for the urgency on this but to get it through to the department of the environment it has to be lodged at the beginning of february and then up to then by march
what are they going to do about it
this is because the department of the environment lost the paperwork for a year erm because apparently the home office are un incapable of reading documents unless they're in order and they take them in order and it takes them a year to read them
and i i've got a letter from the department of the environment and the home office saying that er and th and because of that it's taking them this long to actually get these byelaws UNK
there's no apology or anything they just that's the statement
i think UNK what UNK by the district council law
that needed the consent of the is it the d o e or
yes secretary of state
and that has been a long time coming but it now appears to be
it's been twenty three years since i
could i enquire madam chairman er is the same areas on that specific document the same one as we agreed in nineteen ninety two
mm i think so
if they are fair enough
yes
perhaps the clerk will check
check through but i think it's exactly the same as what we agreed
thank you
just before you close the meeting hold on
no well any way before we go onto that
right
can i just ask did the chairman respond to
the clerk and chairman
right could i ask
say all the right things and
thanks richard erm
a copy of the c v plus the form filled in where
okay
appropriate
obviously
that's
yeah
great
yeah saves a bit of writing and er and you'll always get a bit more detail on it can't you
yes
er while i'm having a look through this er richard er over there we have erm a selection of the product selection of the product which erm we discussed briefly on the phone
all right
so erm er if you wanna look through that i'm no doubt
there's a signature coming up is there erm certainly the average cost of an ad if you took the most expensive and the least expensive across all of those products would come out somewhere in the region of six hundred pounds
per ad
per ad
but what size ad
i suppose that depends on what it goes in
well once again if you look at the er if you look at the full page which costs nine hundred pound on a on a golf club score card and you look at the full page in the a five booklet
mhm
which will cost a thousand pound and there's only black and while
if you look at a full page when they happen they don't happen all that often on a schools portfolio which costs two thousand two hundred pounds you'll see there's already three different prices
yeah
er across three different products
because they're all different sizes and they're all erm
the UNK costs and set up costs and so on
right
so what we say is that if you took all of our products all our ads they would be somewhere in the region of six hundred pounds
now if you took a medical practice booklet they range from three hundred and ninety up to twelve hundred
so the least if fact i i'm fairly safe in saying that the least commission you can earn on an ad providing it's in our you know you're taking it from our price system not discounted it
mhm
would be somewhere in the region of a hundred and fifteen pounds
so you will go in you will never come out of a an advertiser with less commission than that
right
unless you have discounted it and you give two or three pounds away when you do that
right
but in the main we are looking for er somewhere in the region of er hundred and eighty pounds per deal and we're looking for one of those a day average
mhm
our top people earn top money because a they're not satisfied with one deal a day
mhm
er we say that a an assignment should take two to three weeks for instance
an assignment being one complete
one complete product yes
we're er i was asked a question earlier on today erm how many assignments will i be looking after in any one time and i just said one
and he only you start one finished it and then go onto another one
there's no overlap you have to complete one
well if you yeah
there are one or two instances where you can go back
if there's erm for instance i've had a situation where on a medical practice booklet because we er hand back a hundred pound for every full page that we gain in the medical practice booklet er it's an encouragement for if we're just a quarter of a half page short er for the practice to say you know we'll get for another hundred quid we'd all we need to do is make a couple of phone calls and threaten erm one or two of our patients
and that happened with me
i set up a solicitor two months after i'd finished the assignment
because they phone me up and said look we needed another half a page in this for us to get another hundred pound
i said yes
and they said well i've got a solicitor who's interested now
new pa new relation
oh i see the doctor right i'm with you now
the doctor did a bit erm arm UNK
the doctor the doctor's patient is a solicitor n whose obviously he can now advertise anyway
that's right they can now
that's made a lot of difference
i can imagine yeah
and so i went back two months after
in fact i'd come off the road
i was already doing this job and so i went back because there they were going there there's a solicitor going to earn me erm er somewhere in the region of a hundred and seventy pound commission
so i
mm
i went back
it wasn't very much to go back
so you can do that but in the main we try not to have any loose ends on er an assignment
but that's really in the hands of the individuals that er are selling the advertising
mm
erm er and it's the way that we do it that's made it made it very comfortable to go into something like most of the people that come to see us and work with us they've never sold never been involved in advertising let alone sold it because erm
i've been on the other end i've had people come sell it for to me
sure
and so have i
i mean if i look back over my career with american UNK where i've bought advertising it actually runs into millions of pounds
where i've been involved with the marketing groups to bring advertising
you see
well i've done i i've sold advertising i suppose but by UNK
that's it
what in your buying and selling guide
when i yeah when i was commercial manager for er one of the things that i was given the job to do was to sort out the company's buying
because when i joined them they had eight branches
right
and when we UNK company they had forty
but they had gone up to forty eight through acquisitions
er my biggest UNK was that the guy that employed me who was the eldest brother of the two that owned the company got killed in a bloody erm riding accident
oh right yeah
and his younger brother had always hated me because tom had always UNK down his throat why can't you sell and organize things like richard does
oh dear me
it's all very well when he's alive
it doesn't it's not good for building up relationships
no
so erm but of course we had er a buying and selling guide if you like
mm
now the selling guide er was an innovation to tom bring some all right carry on
hello all right i wonder if you could ask him if he'd like a coffee or tea and erm er just wait for me
thanks oh mike okay yeah
oh wonderful that's good news thanks very much good bye
and one of the things we set out to do was to bring some stability to the industry because everyone was trying to UNK prices up
all right
and to be honest the cheapest price doesn't necessarily win
no
er business anyway
so because we were the largest we took we in conjunction with people like UNK roof tiles and er
sure
the UNK
another my clients as well
we said look we'll bring out a price guide
mm
but we ain't gonna pay for it
oh no
so you guys
get it sponsored by the
yeah
you guys are gonna sponsor this but it will bring the trade buying price not the retail because that's there isn't there's no such thing in as a retail price for that sort of industry
erm up then you can turn round when the smaller people come and say are carving up the price you can turn round and say oh no they're not that's the price and that's the price
yeah right okay
and that you know so er but it's only well UNK
yes er i think we've all er sold something er in advertising er UNK related to selling er at some time or other in our careers
so let's er let's er get er the proceedings on a on a not formal UNK but laid out what we're trying to do today
erm i suppose you could say almost fifty percent of the erm er discussions took place on the phone
because if we er if we don't hear a bit in the background and we don't hear the style in the individual er on the phone then we won't invite them to come and have discussions with us
the reason for that is that we do all our selling on the phone
in
of course
that respect
er i emphasize that very quickly because a lot of people have been involved in all sorts of sales environments and market places erm still have their traditional habits
and that is you don't mention the price or anything else until the last possible minute
here we tell them absolutely everything on the phone
because if you leave anything to chance they'll blow you out when you get face to face
and you can chase your tail an awful lot
oh people are very wary of advertising
sure
selling so they wanna know exactly what they're letting themselves in for
so well no yeah is it worth seeing this guy
is the product you know even a description of the product that we're that they're going into er will be suffice on the telephone they don't have to see these er items if they're described in er in enough detail
er so i get that out of the way er fairly early on
but what we're trying to do today here richard is three er three things
first of all you and i have to agree that is the sort of company that er you could be involved with er and the other way around
er UNK and once that sort of i suppose the biggest UNK out of the way once that the other two become fairly simple
erm that is er we agree on which company we might feel er you're going to be UNK in environmentally terms
because whatever er product area you work in then you're doing the same thing as everybody else is
mm
er the UNK the pitch is slightly different because you're describing a different product and what the benefits are
but in essence we're selling advertising to all of those products
and we now have somewhere in the region of UNK about a hundred and seventy five to a hundred eighty sales consultants throughout the u k
all doing the same thing with all with the same earning potential
and the after that er second UNK made is when
and as far as we're concerned we're happy to er for people to start immediately they think they are available
and that's the sort of decision we make er here
i don't hide behind a regret letter
nobody walks out of there without me saying yes it's good for you and er here's a date erm you know for where the training course starts
okay
mhm
so erm first of all for we've had a cha chat for about ten minutes erm i have no problem in thinking you can do this job
because we do send people erm er sorry send we ask people to come on to a training course which we fully expense
mhm
which
so
is held where
at
right
whichever depending on which company you go in sometimes there are a couple of days out in the field plus three days in head office
some are just three days in head office and straight into assignments because they feel that er we have selected individuals for the right environment
er and but others just feel they want to do it that way other companies
but all have a fully UNK training course
some are held every other week and some are held every week depending on the size of the company
so er i have no problem with that
erm having er decided that let me ask you if you of what you've seen so far and i haven't gone into er whichever product er do you thing this is do you think you could erm get into the habit of selling advertising and earning fairly substantial commission
because in our field we're by far the biggest and the best in terms of support and finance
i'd have to ask one well i'd like to ask one question first
i feel
well ask
i can do
okay
like
where so far have you got to in not recruiting at this time but actually attempting to sell advertising in this particular area
and the reason i ask that obviously i don't want to go knocking on doors where somebody's already tried
oh
er without having prior knowledge of the fact that somebody's
we've
failed
yeah we've UNK er howard when he started this company gradually expanded from blackpool
he or i should say
er what he didn't do which is which is very sensible and what has failed for other companies is that he didn't decide this is a good idea i'll have somebody in newcastle and somebody in edinburgh and i'll have somebody in other words he gradually built the whole of the business out until he reached london by which time he he'd a hell of UNK er a lot of experience and knowledge about this thing's going
we've been selling in this area fairly consistently across estate agents
mhm
cos that's the only the only companies that we dealt with er up to four years ago
er and there're certain categories that'll always go into estate agents won't go in medical practices won't go on golf courses and won't go in schools
yeah
so they all have their own UNK of advertisers
some legitimately if they wanted to could gain business from going in all of them
there are UNK certain categories of business that we've built up over the year
a builder could go in all of those
possibly a solicitor now they're allowed to advertise
and a solicitor
erm er accountants can all legitimately go in all of those products
so there are certain categories we know
and this area is a gold mine for us
we got we've got i could have twenty five sales execs sitting er in the UNK and wear area put it that way on across those products and they wouldn't even bump into each other
because they all have if you like every location business location will have their own UNK who they're going to recommend that we approach
the golf course is very selective
i mean there's only five ads can go on er each of their products
fourteen ads in estates er same for schools about average of fourteen in medical practices
so we're only looking for fourteen businesses on each assignment
somewhere in that region
less on er less unless we split full pages and go into halves and that brings in the same sort of revenue thereabouts but just happens to spread
and
so to answer your question i would there's no problem
right
of how many people
and the second part to that then is
yes
in each of those categories how often does it get repeated
er the product is UNK every two years
right
so you go into the guy you sell it to him and then you've lost you've got for two years you can do nothing with that person
oh in fact you're not even you could never have to go back to that same place but depends on where what you're doing at the time that assignment comes up for UNK
if you're if you're available erm then UNK you would go into that er but no
the relationships you build up with our clients and the advertisers with the clients you're working in their own er their offices for three weeks so you get to know people
mhm
with the advertiser you meet him once never see him again
because literally you're only going in to get his contract his money and his copy and off you go
thanks very much i've just earned my commission
it's the relationship between the client and the advertiser which goes on for the next two years
yeah
when he says
but for the sales
bloody waste of time this was i didn't get any business out of it or er i did well out of this
no er well if he's got any sense i always tell the advertiser i said now the UNK i said you as the advertiser have got to keep worrying you may have to UNK them up
what am i gonna get out of this
but in essence what we're doing is putting your business card in front of somebody for two years
mm
but i'm not here to teach you how to do the pitch
the training course would certainly do that
right
erm i mean if you're if you feel that i don't i don't think you'd have any problem doing this it's your it's your it's the
no i just thought
where you come from as well
pardon
where you come from can sell just about anything in the home counties
if you're a home counties man you can sell anywhere in the country
oh i see yeah
if you get my if you get my drift
funnily enough we always say erm that within the structure of when i was a regional manager and there were four of us erm andrew who lives in manchester
mm
said richard he said i don't know how you do it in london he said if they ever asked me to come down here he said i would die
yeah
he said i would i would not be accepted
home counties people like me could go anywhere
mm
richard erm if i now got to the stage of saying if you had a choice cos i have a luxury here of six companies er most UNK just have one job for one company
mm
i've got number of jobs for a number of companies
so it's unusual and i get told off for giving you a choice but what do you think
i what i want to do is make if people going into selling advertising for the first time and most people are let's face it
mm
er it is important for me to get the environment right
now i i've got i've got two or three in my own mind but erm that could you know
at first glance i would probably decide i'd actually enjoy the golf club one but i'm sure it doesn't pay as much money
and i'm sure i wouldn't get as good a rewards out of that personally and satisfaction as i perhaps would i don't know
well there are three there are three organizations or companies there that i think you'd be er happier in especially going out for the first time and also er your style
mhm go on
well
let me
certainly golf clubs would be one of them
mhm
er schools and medical
i wouldn't put you in er around and even though you've had experience UNK enough in the UNK industry and we get a lot of UNK in UNK er how do you which would you have chosen
erm
UNK enough golf clubs actually you can earn more money
can you
yeah
it's probably a harder sell because it's four colour and it's nine hundred pound for a little space like that but they're doing quite well
but the schools
but is that because a new innovation you see
i mean i have
yeah we've had six months
you're breaking new ground
we are breaking new ground here
because they've always let's be fair they've always been around so somebody else has been doing them
UNK golf UNK is the is the largest er a sales consultant has just er finished er my club off
you know finished their done their card and he did that in about er four da er five days it was
the card
what from UNK or
no UNK you see UNK er UNK charge clubs for their cards as well as keeping the advertising money
oh i see
we keep the advertising money and the cards are free of charge
well
so
in fact all of that product there is free of charge
but i what i need is any anybody
so on there you've got er oh i wouldn't know what that adverts to do with
what's that one
oh the cards
but that was if i remember rightly that was a mock up
oh
if you take the real thing
i was going to say i
yes that's
where to buy a ball
those are nine hundred pound page per year for two years
nine hundred pounds per year
yep
and if you sign them up do we get the commission for the
for the first year only
for the for the first year
we don't get any paid anything in the second year
no
because all our production costs all our commissions come out of the first year
second year is actually where we make money
so you do an three hundred pounds
that's nine hundred
yeah
you'd get thirty percent
nine hundred and you would get thirty percent
so you can work out that for erm for that card which has got three full pages
then he was doing that's the planner he was doing the card at the same time erm anyway that's the there's the that's the but i need to make a decision
i'd quite i'd quite enjoy the golf club one
right
er i just wondered what UNK you've had golf clubs
oh we've only just started them
up here
yeah
so you'd be against UNK as the main competitor if they've got them already
oh yes we're knocking we're knocking UNK
because i would've thought most golf
we would concern
clubs have already got them
yes they have but they haven't got them for free
they've saved my club four and a half thousand pound a year
in the cost of their cards
yes
and they can soon put that somewhere else to er good use
and what area would i be restricted to
okay what i what i need before
all right okay
i go into any more detail are we fixed on the golf club area
you only go in one you see
but the other one i would've er suggested would've been the schools
i must admit i've never seen anything like that on schools
no but that's
but before
also new
be before we go into that though
mm
you would give the leads is that right as i read this
yes we s
you say you got to go to that golf club or you've got to go to that school
that's right
yeah you have no
because we've set up a deal with that school
yeah
for a brochure
our marketing our marketing er group has gone around to all the erm er the clients within that market place erm well not all of them at least they're gradually going round signing the contract to take the product
that's done already
we you just get a phone call from us that says here's your next assignment
we guarantee continuity of assignment
within which area would that be
how
well
large an area
well erm we pay thirty percent commission up to a hundred miles away from home
right
we pay thirty five percent if it's more than a hundred miles away from home
but the whole point of recruiting in a geographical area like this is we don't want we don't want to send people erm er miles away from their home if we can avoid it
mm
erm i
i just i just try to work out whether there must be a bigger concentration of schools in this area than golf clubs
but whether you'd manage to sign all schools i'm not so sure
oh we we've just sent out a six thousand UNK
six thou a UNK to six thousand schools in addition to the ones we've already got signed up
that would not be a problem
let me tell you do not have to worry about continuity of assignment
and all we say is that we pay extra commission if we send you away but it is against er against our principle and even er economics to send people that far away
right okay
i have to say the top earners of course ask for those further away
that's where they make their money
yes
or make their extra money
mm
two things that make a people a top UNK here of course is one of them one of them in addition to UNK is that they won't sit back and sign up one deal and be very satisfied in a day
mm
they will want to go on and do two or three
mm
they'll also have no UNK whatsoever in taking
well let's fair on the golf
the thirty five percent deals
on the golf club one if you've really got your finger out and you're known
oh
well enough you could you could do one in day
i'm a i i'm an er UNK you i didn't say a UNK because that meant i could play erm but i wouldn't put me on the golf clubs
you wouldn't
no
i could s i even though it might make me a lot of money because i know that if i got if i made a dozen phone calls and didn't get any deals i'd be out there wanting play the er i wouldn't trust myself
i wouldn't take no i wouldn't take the golf clubs with me
right okay
but i need to sorry i need to make
are we are we going for schools or colleges
now if the management at home heard me doing this of course er giving you a choice but i believe in it
and you eat the tape afterwards
erm you've put me on the spot i don't i don't i've really i've really got no preference on them
right well i let's i would go for schools if i were you
mm okay fair enough
i mean cos it makes a difference the pack i bring out
yes sure
that's why i'm putting you under pressure
right this is for you to take away
i'm going to ver the well the information i UNK now is in brief richard because they will certainly cover it in a lot more detail when you get to the er training
okay
let's get some samples er in front of you all right
i have to say once again that this once again sorry i told somebody else this is the most attractive product we do i believe
the schools are seem to be able to make them look attractive because of the photography and things like that
and they are used to get UNK on seats
since the parents choice charter came out it is it is essential for all school state opt out grant maintained independent to promote themselves
and that's why this has been so successful
every assignment has a certain amount of documentation attached to it
certainly when you arrive at the school they are committed by their contract to provide you with a desk office and telephone facilities for two to three week or the UNK of the assignment
but we agree that after three weeks we should be should have completed it
erm the advantage that schools has er have sorry over the other products is that if you went to a medical practice you may have four or five doctors to help you out
if you went to an estate agent you may if they're willing to er have one or two estate agent staff to help you out and if you went to a golf club you would be likely to have the pro or the secretary help you out
in a school you may have fifty to sixty teachers to help you out
and what i mean by help out is that one of the documents that we leave er when we sign them up to take the product is a list that so that looks something like this
and we ask them to bring together er list of the businesses which they are happy for us to approach on their behalf
mm
to support this folder
so all of those people there or most of them are likely to have been on a list that the school have recommended
they will form all sorts of categories too and the worst thing you can do in sa in er negotiating advertising er richard is to UNK anybody
oh i can
who might come in
be completely wrong
you'd be completely
i've done it myself i've said no that guy what would that guy want to go in there for
except that it was a butcher right
people moving in this was in the medical practice people moving in new er new er new first things you do is register with a doctor
mm
and the butcher was gaining a lot of business out of it
because they said ah fine i know where to go for my meat
and they are associated with the with the doctor
so i UNK
we did that with the with the chemist
we phoned the chemist to find where the nearest and best doctor was when we moved to preston
there you go you see
and that chemist er would've recommended probably
the one that gets his scripts
absolutely right
okay so this list will be waiting for you when you arrive at the assignment
the important thing about that richard is you still have to sit down and talk to them about these businesses
get as much information as to why they have been put on that list
because you'll use that when you
contact
yes
so don't ex just don't go straight into that list
no
okay
other documentation you receive and certainly is this one and you can't do your job without that and that's a blank of the layout
okay
so that as you sell the slots first of all you want you want to be able to point out where which the slot is when you've er finally sign the contract
you also need to cross off as you sell them
mhm
once again they will tell you precisely what you've gotta do on the er training course
but let me show you er just while we've got that open how prices relate to those slots
and also have got an example here of what the earnings are
every assignment on schools has a basic target of five thousand pounds all right
and that's what you have to have up in your mind
it also relates to once you know that you've reached that five thousand pound that you've got your thirty percent commission on all sales
over five thousand pound we pay you another fifteen percent
there's a small one before that but i would concentrate on fifteen percent
mhm
all commission er bonuses are paid at proof stage and i'll explain why in a minute
if you just look at some the er numbers here
one po er positions one to four are nearly five hun well say five hundred pound each
they're premium slots
okay
and then we have two other erm pricing erm areas for those slots there
okay i'll let you study this when you when you've gone all right
mhm
now some of the schools have asked for this UNK this by the way is belongs to the school
some schools have asked for that to be kept for the sch er you know for them as well
if they take up that space you must offer up the back page
that's which is traditionally theirs
yep
in fact i think i not sure whether it's this one
that's an example
and also the school got that company for us
but that's a two thousand two hundred page
the commission on that is a third
you can work that out for yourself
mhm
you can't do the job without that
no
you get one of those for every assignment
okay
er a quick example down here
if you sold the whole of that product at non discounted prices that's the revenue
and with schools it's very achievable
that is the earning in your two to three week period
mhm
so if you took a six week period then you're looking at somewhere around four and a half thousand pounds worth of income
very achievable
i UNK just now about the extra five percent
i've put that in bold down there so that people understand that
right
and of course that's UNK makes that UNK up that makes it even more
mhm
okay
that's for
yep okay
you to take away
we will pay all commissions the following week
all right
now we're one of the very few companies that will pay weekly commissions on a commission only basis
and the reason for that is that we ask you to do three things when you get in front of the advertiser having got his commitment
and i'll show you very quickly the documentation
all six companies have exactly the same contract
the only difference is and i hope you're not colour blind
yes
are you
are you really
yeah
oh dear
what UNK that to you
oh no that's green you're okay
i might have known
no it's just the different shades of green
you're the first person i've said that to who said come back to me and said yes
yeah i am actually
those are both white i can assure you
but it what i'm saying is that they're all shades of colour anyway
yes
but erm they they're erm colour coded
but i'll only have one anyway
that's right
so what whatever colour
i wanted to make sure that you see if er at some stage and people ask me this if we needed to transfer people
oh i see
between companies we don't have to UNK them on
no
the admin which does help
only on the pitch
well my problem only is when the blues run into UNK and the UNK run into UNK
oh when you get UNK that's what we call
erm i have been known to go out with one black UNK on and blue UNK on
oh have you really oh well
i think i think we've all done that at some time or other
certainly odd socks
erm so but i wanted to point out two or three things on this contract that if you don't tell them on the phone about them before you get round there they they'll use it
they'll frighten they use it
the system tells us they'll use you'll frighten them off
and this is these are the sorts of things
you must tell them that you want to pick up a thirty five percent of the first year's payment
whatever the payment is agreed
that is significant because that covers us for paying you commission
so we've already got that
mhm
so we've got that so you deserve to have it as soon as possible after banking it
er we need to tell them that we'll take the balance of the first year's payment through er on proof when we when they've got their proof on the desk we will take the next the balance of the first year's payment through a banker's order
banker's order they'll use if you haven't told them that we want a banker's order signed
if there are two UNK on the cheque you've gotta have two UNK on the er banker's order
so you have to make sure both sure tho both of those people are there
when you call
if you left this anywhere left it behind and came away it would be lost in the system you'd never see it again
no
and we take the second year's this is a sales pitch we take the second year's payment a year later
so if they say oh i can't afford that
then you say no it's a three stage payment in effect
mm
deposit first year second year a year later
so it would be a deposit balance of first year at proof stage and then erm
but obviously there's somebody at head office you will be going through that in much more detail
mhm
er one of the other things that we want of course
now that's two things contract and the cheque
the third thing we want to complete the deal is copy
now most people that come to see us have never been involved in designing or writing ads
we you don't er nobody has to worry about that
if they had wonderful
i mean i had so i it did help
we will take whatever copy they have in existence all ready where they've advertised somewhere else
if they want us to UNK it around we will do it
if they want us to design a brand new one we will do it at no extra cost
so the UNK is not a problem you have to get involved in
is not a problem
right
if they say we've got co i haven't got copy
what's that gonna cost me
nothing
i'll come round when we sign the deal after we've signed the deal i'll sit down with you for er fifteen minutes however long it takes to decide on the copy
then we will UNK it as long as we've got some detail
mhm
if you send all those er bits and pieces in at the end of the week we just ask you and you most people don't get this wrong
is the commission claim sheet
representative oh well there you go consultant number every assignment has a unique number
we list the advertisers put all this detail down which once again will be er will be gone through
er if people have registered for v a t there's a special v a t er sheet
because some of course are they reach the thirty six thousand UNK without any problem at all
i mentioned bonuses being paid at proof stage
every two months a list comes out to the sales consultants to say these assignments have been UNK
all you have to do is look for your own number er if you if you have hopefully you've kept a record of the assignments where you've earned bonus and you can claim it as soon as that number is published
a lot of people leave it in
can you can you just explain that bit again
okay
the bonus
right
bonus all er all your thirty percent is are paid as you declare it during the assignment week after
ah sorry yeah so the fif the five percent or the fifteen point seven and a half or whatever it is
fifteen percent fifteen percent you claim only at proof stage
because that's the next stage at which we get money
right okay
that's the way you do it
mhm
okay
that's a fairly average week for a lot of people
that was this is one of mine
er my last but one
er that's the sort of figure that we're we need to be looking at
right
okay
mhm
just to show you
er everything's colour coded
oh i see this is just for different names of the different in house companies
that's golf that's schools that's the one that you would use obviously
same thing just the headings change a bit okay
yes
that's all we ask you to do
the advertising the paperwork and that's how easy it is to make money
it's available to you
is that for you
sounds very interesting i must admit
mm
yeah well i obviously i would say this but er i think it's the best opportunity that people have for a career direction because we we've UNK a lot of people's careers in this aspect
and also we've i suppose re launched people's er especially in the older bracket
yes unfortunately
who erm are consistently being told they're too old for things
we have no problem with that at all
in fact the more mature the better as far as i'm concerned
i would trust er you much more than er erm a twenty five or thirty year old out there to get on and do the job
yeah
i think er with experience becomes the self motivating part is something that er
yes
becomes UNK i think
er there don't seem to be quite a lot of that any more
no
they've had it a bit too easy i think
absolutely
well the only thing that as far as i'm concerned erm er richard is when would you like to come on the training course
right
erm i have as i say one other if you like self employed business opportunity that i have been pursuing erm which erm i shall know after tuesday of next week
right
erm which also sounds very interesting
yes
what market is it in can i ask
yeah it's erm er consultancy in er business travel
is that a franchise or what
no you basically the company is pulled out of the ordinary high street travel business and set up a new concept in business travel
mm
therefore with no overheads
is this a new venture
it was been going for two years
mm
erm but they er have only done it on a UNK basis
erm you earn commission by taking clients who might spend say a hundred thousand pounds on business travel whether it be flights trains
yes
hotels whatever
and you sign them up or when i say sign them up they're er an account is opened
mhm
for them
right
and you can show them of between an eighteen and twenty four percent saving on their business travel
oh i've got a suspicion i'm getting
hello
yep
right
thank you
and erm obviously i've got a lot of contacts in the industry
erm
right
and it's something that i like the idea of
mm
but again like this one i need to get to know the a bit more of the ins and outs of it
i've had a preliminary meeting with them and they've asked me to go back because they're interested in me
okay
er and that's been fixed up to go to UNK in UNK next tuesday
right
i would like the opportunity of saying yes i am very interested
er but i would like to reserve making er a decision until after tuesday
now whether that's a problem to you i don't know
it would be a problem with certain people
i would say sorry in that case er you know i wouldn't you know
but with you i i'm happy to
it's not i'm not pursuing any other p a y e
cos i know i know which the safer bet is and that's all i'm going to say
sure
i will make er provisional with you
okay
so that you can come
i will go through all the bits and pieces here now and then it's all done
mhm
if you phone me up and say yes i want to come it's all done
well that's what i was going to say if we could make it that the training course came after next week and not next week then
no i'll tell you when the next course is for erm schools seventh the week UNK the seventh of february
in fact which is just right isn't it
yes
yes
yeah
okay
so i'm gonna go through right
and is that three or five days
i've done i'll just go
okay
through in a minute it's three days
yeah
date is the twenty sixth yes
yes
it is isn't it yes
okay on friday the seventh
this is on the assumption that everything is going ahead all right
friday the six fourth that would be won't it
yes
all right
prior to this you would have given us a phone call okay
mhm
but on friday the fourth erm i'd like you to er if ev the best thing is to read through this
okay
tells you all about where we do our erm oh er beg your pardon four day training of course i should've
four days
four beg your pardon
okay
yes that's the trouble with having six companies
they all have slightly different er variations
okay it's er this goes all into the detail
erm the UNK i'll tell you what i've got here the UNK hotel is where the course is held and you stay and the UNK is somewhere around here
there's a pier here which we've put on the new map erm and this is south UNK
okay
UNK somewhere around there if that helps you
we pick up there's the details there
if you read that we need you to phone into that lady and it's UNK
no
okay
i can you can't
i can't
not yet
you come over on the sunday evening because we do start prompt at eight thirty on the monday morning
okay
that's the hotel
right
okay
this is all for you to take away
if you please read that
i will
you phone me erm whatever your commitment is er to either us or the other people
mhm
and then if you follow that procedure i'd be grateful
okay
we'll pay your travel costs
right
to we'll pick up all your tab but er we'll pay this separately
mhm
just need you to sign
oh you want me to sign
yes just sign to say you know about that
there's a copy there for you
the other thing i've got to do is take a photograph
oh god is my hair okay i've been out in the wind you know
no it's all right
all i all i ask you to do is smile
we get some great UNK looking photographs
oh i i'm going to vet that
i shall raise that
he says
big problem
look at me like that for UNK
nothing else that needs to
could i go back to three environmental group please david er i've had er quite good news ford have agreed to er three diesel cars in their fleet for us to try
oh right
but they're going to be the smaller version they're going to be UNK and UNK i think people need encouraging to use them cos
well
they'll extend their fleet if we do give a demand
alright we don't people don't specify do they what car they want don don't you just provide it
usually they specify people like our roller
do they oh
yes and they tend to be larger cars
well it stops the top from UNK
yes
yes
get the UNK to tow it
right
we've certainly had UNK before er
oh yes quite frequently
anything else
alright
oh perhaps i should just report briefly that erm the erm changing over of erm some stage twos from my sub team to other sub teams became a necessary when UNK returned very shortly afterwards
so grateful thanks to those people for all offering
steve one thing that there was mention to that and i've got a some pass it on just for people to
erm
or leave it
a bit i think
er typing then which seems to be generally satisfactory although a bit of a hole in upon sub team one it was a
i think that was probably just one er one car load where there was a reporter in it which is unclear at the moment
come on john
oh i see it's just one file is it
mhm yes
for the twenty ninth oh good
erm right that gets us to the er performance analysis and er graphs
i was looking at er the first page the which brings together the sub team figures erm looks to me as though the completed work reflects the priority that we're giving to stage two work and i think we continue to UNK particularly remain anxious to clear out of the system as soon as possible all old stage two files and i propose to continue to UNK progress on those and with each a d as i see them
erm do you want to say anything about anyone else want to say anything about page one
alright
the second page which is UNK sub team
a fairly striking increase in june
i notice
erm which has certainly been UNK is likely to cause a few problems because in august are off and so on
however there's nothing we can do about that
it seems to have hit us more than anyone else for some reason
UNK doesn't think so i am an
richard do you want to say anything about yours
erm i was going to mention as rob has done the increase in new complaints which i think is somewhat welcome erm we're still taking a long time from the UNK over the last twelve months i think that's just reflecting being out some days over the ones you've been talking about er we're down on actual stage one UNK in the month erm we're not quite sure why that is mm it's just the way things have UNK out
no member of stage two's gone out in the last month
forty nine
right
UNK were average stage one time seems to be creeping up
that has something to do with erm UNK doesn't it
well not really because the erm the that UNK be nineteen weeks doesn't include er the
no that they
leeds post office one because they
they're all december
before hand
that the significance about that leeds thing is that there's a i don't know how many complaints there are in that multiple altogether
a hundred and fifty
a hundred and thirty five
a hundred and thirty five erm all of which did take
twenty eight weeks i think it was
yes so that until they drop out of the system erm a year from when that stage one decision was making the teams over the sub teams overall stage one times are likely to be erm considerably higher than they will be in the month immediately after that er multiple has dropped out
er but i think actually that the nineteen weeks er in june re is largely caused of er some clearing out of cupboards on the part of jill prior to her maternity leave
er UNK er do you want to say anything about your
the i mean it's only UNK but it feels to me as though the increase they experienced in june has continued into er july i know that's not what we're looking at but it feels that way erm
thing was we had an awful lot of complaints last july so it may not show an increase overall
also the june figure may reflect a erm er a catching up on may
i mean may seems to have been a light month
yes
although i guess it probably always is and er
did you check the UNK with chris
erm that's come into the graph later on
mm
but UNK erm june and july er erm and august are always fairly busy
before we leave erm seventeen fours erm sheet the there was a question i'd have i think it's probably addressed to graham rather than anything nothing personal about this er the actual state of equivalent in the month the third figure down in the last box
yep
erm why is it so much higher than the similar figure the same figure for my sub team when i had the same number of stage one decisions and one more stage two decision
that same mistake erm i
i did it in a hundred and twenty three the actual stage one equivalent in the month if
it's ninety that should be ninety one
UNK in ninety one
one seven six should be ninety one
no it shouldn't should be a hundred and twenty three
no it's
seventy sixty three
twelve times four for
sorry twelve times f
four UNK are forty eight for nineteen seventeen five
forty eight into UNK
i is that a mistake which i did i get them
doesn't work anywhere else does it
is that reflected in the
i haven't checked anything
cumulative figure then
erm i doubt it as that figure is erm based upon the figures from the erm
yeah
from the main sheet
it's not a it's i don't add the sheets up together to get to the er top sheet
no right
okay that's fine
yes
doesn't effect the front figure
no
no
oh well sorry about that er UNK
mm
yes my apologies for raising it
it's been nice knowing you
alright if we look at the look at the graphs on UNK complaints erm said it's to my mind it's interesting being about how the choice of scale is going to affect one's perception here
mm
yes
if you think about it's very difficult for looking at graph one than er than er looking at the more settled line on graph two which is actually the same thing if you UNK by that
yes it is yes
yes that's right
it is
er
you could do it even better if you want with a straight line if it's stretch the scales to infinity
erm so there's a there's a slight up turn erm in june by comparison with june last year
erm but because last july was very heavy er you're expecting graham that erm w we might well be showing a down turn again next month and that's what
i think we
the last graph
that's what
erm does is project us on erm
er erm july er june is erm according to UNK figures normally about erm twelve percent higher than the mean erm so if they'll take the mean at about at being about three hundred and fifty you know we're looking at a figure of somewhere just over four hundred for july as opposed to last july which was erm i think five er four hundred and ninety four complaints in the month so it's very unlikely that output figure will continue going up next month
yo your figures after ju july over to december in the third graph are all to put it UNK
they are they're UNK they're using the current mean of three hundred and fifty one erm and then UNK that according to the UNK er that's shown over the last five years
right
that i think gets us to the erm paper which i put down this morning erm based upon erm primarily based upon that last erm graph an and UNK best estimate of our likely out turn for this year because they erm in fact you're erm you're UNK that the erm the number of complaints we receive by the thirty first of march next year it'll be four two fo four two is your best UNK adjusted guess
and er erm based on three months and that's been a g could be UNK out but at the moment it seems to be
mhm
which would be slightly down on er the number that we got in last year erm the next factor erm is not as yet a fact but is almost a certainty that er all we will not succeed on the present basis in persuading d o e that we should have any increase in t to reflect er an increase in work and next year we're anticipating getting in effect a stand still budget
erm although i think we will say that would be dangerous thing to do and that we should continue to work upon the er the assumption that there erm er overall as a n a nine percent increase but that seems highly unlikely that will succeed erm what i've then done is take account of the various staffing changes that there have been during the year both short term and long term erm and you'll see that produces a figure actually available to us this year of twenty seven thousand five hundred and eighty eight UNK hours erm which is slightly less than we had last year er but erm almost not significantly so erm and it seemed to me therefore that if we weren't trying to reduce times er if we were saying that we would turn in times at the end of this year which were the same as the term times we turned in at the end of last year we could probably achieve that without any further recruitment
but of course we are trying to er to reduce times
erm now i can produce some UNK on the next few figures they this is the one in the third paragraph which says that two thousand eight hundred er took two eight nine one two er hours would be needed this year that is working on the commissions erm current estimate of six percent of complaints going to stage two erm the reality in york is that seven point five percent are going to stage two and if one took account of that reality and i'm bound to say that in UNK terms we don't but if one did take in reality that would push that figure for this year up to thirty thousand four hundred and forty nine
erm now bearing in mind that half the year has gone or will have gone by the time anybody arrived here erm it seemed to me that where i my analysis of that situation was that if we were going to achieve our target times erm then the theory would seem to be that we ought to make er two appointments now i e two appointments for half the year will be equivalent to one appointment for the year and that will produce the number of UNK hours which roughly that the formula says we need to knock off the required number of complaints in the required number of times
but then you come to the problem erm because for ninety four five erm the formula suggests that we would need less staff that might seem a bit odd but the reason is that if you do indeed bring your target times down then the amount of work which your passing over into the next year is er considerably less erm than the amount of work which you passed over into this year
mm
the formula assumes that at any er as of the first of april half the work has been done on all erm files then outstanding we've gone into this before where er we think that that's er a correct statistical way of erm dealing with things if therefore you cut the number of er files which are going in then erm er i take it if you're cutting the number of stage two files which are being passed over and that's the area where you're most fighting at er at time we hope and it has a very considerable impact on workload for next year
and so you'll see that working on the commissions six percent estimate er we only need according to this erm just under twenty five thousand hours
if you work on a seven point five figure then you get up to twenty seven thousand four hundred and twenty seven hours erm before next year erm that would leave us with a difficulty i think because if i were if we went ahead with the idea of recruiting two people now er we would need to get rid of four of them by oh four people all together erm by er the next financial year which clearly is not terribly sensible
but where i am is in something of a dilemma because if we don't recruit anybody now it seems to me unlikely that we will actually manage to reduce our times that would in UNK would mean we'd actually want more staff next year erm so i have set out a series of options
tails
i've got a flat sided coin
one does need to going round UNK up UNK up customers don't forget that
you're knocking on walls
well the problem about er two does include two does include going around UNK up customers but the difficulty with that is it seems to me that you'll need to UNK up the customers in year one and only get the money
mhm exactly
in year two because the er erm so where i am
yes but you're a two though i thought this to erm sort of even up the work between the three teams
your
rather than increasing the overall volume of
er that's five really i think well two or five
em i mean that's good at way i am i think that what we ought to do is to seek to erm suggest to the commission that york should take more of the UNK total workload i e to erm take some work from coventry and possibly also do a UNK transfer between london and coventry
yes if one bears in mind that UNK situation still seems to be relatively difficult doesn't it
erm it would seem sensible if we look across the whole commission to try and even things out
yes but it's the midlands team that
but i think that if you
has the greater workload at the moment
yes
very incoming
i mean i wasn't excluding working with them
but if
yes
speed of through cut and er
yes
in other problems
the other ideal which i haven't got round to doing would be to try and appoint somebody on a short term basis
erm clearly we've got enough op it would seem that if we could recruit somebody for the rest of this year and er which would help us get our times down if in if in fact we were able to recruit somebody who was instantly productive which is not all that likely
do we know what the erm the UNK rates have been over the last few years
small
very little ever occurs
less than one a year after
i that's a problem that in terms of could see whether our natural UNK in er would cope with it
actually
we're a long way off retiring yet UNK
until this last year
where er i mean we have had two UNK er
yes
this last year which
what you said a moment ago makes me wonder er about some of these calculations because it i take it assumes erm instant productivity
yes
yes
and y you can't calculate things any other way i suppose but in fact er n ne new UNK will not be instantly productive and therefore will
they tend to be
not in the vast measure reduce particular stage two UNK or times erm
i think they're more productive than we sometimes give credit for
we'll they you get an early burst
you particularly get a burst and then you get a then you get
that's right
a slow down or particularly
that's
but it's still very useful
well you get them up to stage one fairly quickly it's the stage two isn't it
because of the erm because of the erm of the total times involved inevitably the stage two's are going to be it's going to be in the second year that you're going to see reasonable output from them not in first year
what's the reality of supposing we took two on and supposing the number of complaints UNK or even fell and the target times came way down we're meeting everything
what are we really talking about when saying we would have to reduce the numbers of staff
are we really talking about redundancies
because if we are that clearly
but
conditions a great deal of what we do
i think you're only talking about redundancies if we can't erm take some short term work from elsewhere er as opposed to i mean i'm suggesting at the moment we take stock a longer time
yeah
transition erm clearly er it would be a nonsense if we were making people redundant here ing if er either london or coventry were struggling to cope with their
quite
er present work and so i mean you could say we'll take it er two or three hundred complaints from london and buy time i suppose erm to see if er work up here had picked up or natural UNK went or what ever erm if it didn't go up then i mean in the long term erm one couldn't envisage keeping on with more staff than what's thought to be a fairly UNK assessed formula anyway says we need
mm
i mean the formula er is not likely to be UNK the number of staff we're needing if anything it UNK it we think
right
there's about five UNK variables in all of this which is essentially
the immediate problem is we're going to be three members of staff down fairly shortly
well
for
you're not well by comparison with
two of two of them UNK for a period of six months
yes exactly for at least six months
by comparison with last year you will be ov overall this year by comparison with last year er you'll be about point six of a member of staff down
and how many t q UNK are we likely to have
two
and that's a day a week as far as i remember
mm
yes
so that's quite a lot if it's an investigator which of course it may not be
well almost certainly it will be i think
well
there also of course the hours that
it's the equivalent it's the equivalent of two fifths of an investigator
yeah
erm
but that is only a relatively short term thing again and that period will consist
no that's
three years
the long term
three years
three years
yes i suppose so
a lot can change in three years
yes that's true that's true
and will i've no doubt
i don't think anyone will go and UNK though on a lot changing in six months which is the immediate problem and you co
mm
quite
you would take it not want to take somebody on if we're actually going to make any body redundant next year
no absolutely not
other unless anybody that you have seen and wo take your fancy is available on a short term fixed term contract
i think only those who are unemployed are likely to be attracted by that and i'm not sure how many we've got
wasn't there some talk about UNK wanting to come back to work
i something UNK in front of my eyes that she was thinking of applying on part time for the complaint examiner but she didn't
i mean that is one area as the complaint examiner matter where we've got erm at the moment erm the first corpus twenty eight percent going out in twenty six five erm which takes the food up er a lot of those know will be going i imagine be going through investigators rather than
well they will be going through p as if everything goes
well yes
okay
goes to plan
erm
and the er formulas actually er reckon that we need erm three point seven complaint UNK at the moment
i think that shows something wrong with the formula
well except that work on the submission of twenty five percent going through the complaint examiner
mm
well certainly you know i think there is work looking at the files that go through me there is work for a second complaint examiner because a lot of the files from investigators are actually fairly straightforward now
yeah
mm i know UNK not dealing with them so you know i'm sure that there would be enough work for a complaint examiner but whether that would then mean investigators were light is really
well there is there is an argument that says if p as do the twenty six five work or the bulk of it that sarah might be a one team complaint examiner
mm
one
for a sub team
sorry for a sub team complaint examiner
right
i mean she is capable of getting through some fairly extraordinary amounts of work
she does get through quite a lot that's true
yeah i
there's a problem also
i UNK problems with that there's no there's a fair amount of travel involved isn't there
mm
and
yes
you know if she's covering a whole area
i suspect the amount of travel might be capable of being reduced
well it might be but i mean if we carry on our present system then i would have thought there was too much travel for one person to be covering the whole of the area on the way we're presently using sarah cos she does
cer
go and visit more often
certainly on the basis of the way we presently use her i'm not what wo
erm er erm people could extend her times if she did it like she used to do before because what she used to do is to say she would have a day in manchester in a months time
mm
or write you down as time scale you'd presumably talking about planning up to six weeks perhaps before she UNK around
never the less i mean there is a sheer volume there
yes
yes
however that's a i mean tha i think her she's always turned in twice the level that the formula assumes or at least twice
mm
that's right
the level that the formula assumes a complaints examiner will
that would still give us to complaint UNK because the formula is nearly four
what we certainly want to get away from is the present situation where two sub teams don't have a complaint examiner
that's right
yes
that's right
it is an UNK situation at the moment it does mean that some investigators are doing types of work which
they shouldn't really be doing
they ought not to be doing literally
mm
and for which we are paying too much
yes
mm
because ultimately what we're talking about is the cost
i was going to say UNK view is that is that UNK view
isn't it
yes
UNK view that there is enough work to er have another complaint examiner really means instead of exec investigators
yes
rather than as well as
mm
well it does really i mean if we it's a question of whether the budget will stand the staff isn't it it's not whether we er i mean in terms of redundancies it's whether we cou if we appointed people we could afford to keep them on whether or not there was work i mean we could have create work in some senses
if the d o e won't give us any more money which they won't do
so you might have a stand
well
still budget now you would have some decrease in costs because there would be less phone calls there would be less paper less trouble
yes well when i say stand still budget i mean a stand still on the basis of saying that there will be no increase in incoming work
erm
yeah
i think UNK into financial terms that actually means less money because
yes
because they will look at the formula won't they
well exactly but i mean
he probably sold it to them
e essentially i mean the problem is whether the money would stand the staffing
and next year it won't
well
on the
we are assuming it won't
yes
cos it does depend i mean if complaints
first of all
if complaints fly up obviously that's out the window but
well we still won't have the money
we don't think that'll happen
yes that's the problem
because this is the problem budgets are being prepared for august
if
right
if we lose out the argument that we should put in for some increase next year and we think it's going to be very difficult to sustain an argument
mm
then even if we get the increase in work we will not have the staff available to cope with it
no
unless we can divert money from other sources but that's erm well i mean that's the reality behind fifteen years of fairly steady growth and i mean looking at UNK out i think
so what would be the worst possible picture we could be faced with next year
erm we would have enough money to keep the present establishment going
no
no
not even enough to do that
that's the problem with it
the worst the worst possible scenario would be a need to reduce i think two UNK if we didn't make any appointments now a need to reduce er by up to two investigators should be also including one next year
mm
but i mean we're a long way from that and i don't want people to think that i'm from saying er redundancies are UNK er
no
but on the other hand appointing people in that light looks a bit odd
when do we know
other than other than on erm a one year fixed term contract
that would be feasible
how do we pay for that though
for what
in the worst case picture how would we pay for that
the one year fixed term contract would go six months into the next financial year
that's right
mm
wouldn't it anyway so it would be taking a bite out of that reduced cherry
yes
but i'd be prepared to risk that
right
if all i was talking about was twenty thousand pounds out of next year i e six months erm an investigator a member of UNK staff very roughly costs us forty thousand a year in salary and office costs
erm
i mean a fixed term contract for a year for a new in for an investigator first of all we've got to find someone who would do it secondly if that person wasn't frankly al already an investigator the investment in that person
oh were only talking about complaints examiner i think
or complaint examiner but even then the investment in that person if they come at the end of the year go i would say what a waste
yes but you
clear
you've got the option then if that if the work did increase and they were satisfactory
they'd fit in
you could offer them a permanent place
it could be in your contract
yes that's right
what you wouldn't have are redundancy costs because you make people redundant and it also costs money doesn't it
erm depends how long they've
well
been here but
yes but i mean there would be
quite a lot
i mean if we're talking about existing staff then it may not be enormous but there is an in there is a cost involved with it
but there but
financial as well as emotional and psychological
well that assumes the person might want to stay anyway but
well yes but
so it's a lot of risks and UNK in that isn't there
but they would we had UNK who was very good and who very rapidly was earning his keep and he didn't even stay here so you know if you make the right appointment it's always dodgy that you know
UNK must have been productive fairly
yes
quickly as well in her role
i think you're probably looking at three hundred complaints something like that
mm
in the first year
why
but a lot of those were UNK that maybe it maybe it's better to use experienced investigators and because they can do that work so much more quickly anyway i don't know i feel a bit uncomfortable with this one year contract
mm
unless it was somebody we have already used and that really boils down to one person in york and she's shown no signs of applying so
the last i heard UNK was going to become a teacher i mean i we are supposed to be trying to think about whether we can have a sh a panel that we of people that we can call on for the short term crisis appointments or whatever but
i thought historically that didn't work very well
well the add hoc panel of investigators didn't work terribly well but the they the idea of if there are a pool of ex employees in erm and in the main we're tending to think about er you you're talking about people who've left to have families i suspect erm if there is a pool of them that you can pull in maybe that would work slightly better
yeah
provided they've not been out of the job all that long i think cos things change don't they
yes i mean we're not in the position to do what some of the certainly i know some of the banks do which is to guarantee a job after five years let people have five years you know the maternity leave plus a guaranteed job at the end of another four when the kids start school on the UNK that you can call them in if you need them within that period for a bit of extra help
to maintain their involvement with the job
mm
but i mean that probably wouldn't appeal to the people we have presently seeking maternity leave
i imagine they would both want to come back anyway
this is an emergency
sorry don't you mean the two of them about to go
yes well they're the only two we could be thinking about
i mean they both firmly saying they're coming back on a full time basis
yes exactly
that's right
er for by the end of this calendar year
yes
so were they've already we've already got those in as committed people next year
the other fact i mean there's a lot of uncertain factors the other one is that as far as i'm aware we actually have quite a large number of people by comparison with the UNK actively applying for other jobs at the moment
only four to my knowledge i think
i know five
you think five
oh yes i think five
erm
is that er
yes but i mean
i mean these aren't the UNK i don't know what the norm is and this is the trouble
i
i'm certainly aware tha
it's more than we've had in recent years judging by the general
we've had a hell of a lot more people now than we had
ah
mm right
it's proportional isn't it
how
i er
i mean there's no certainty in that
no if people apply
any of them will actually
people apply for jobs
get something yes
yes
fairly regularly i think
yes
er some people
in two cases it's very much a specific one off application
mm
it isn't an indication that they're going to be applying for any other jobs that come up
that's true
it's also one where the chance of success must be fairly high
fairly high yes
mm
yes well
well
i don't know
i doubt it actually i think they it ought to be but i don't think erm the people appointing are likely to look outside the immediate UNK and
erm it would be unsafe i think to work on an assumption that what we're going to er one post becoming available through natural UNK per year and even that erm UNK i think
well where i currently am is saying that we should seek to UNK the UNK overall boundaries with a view to us taking on some extra work and that meanwhile we should UNK further recruitment
full stop
yes
no complaints examiner no investigator
yes
UNK in really and look at the figures for july and august
well yes i mean clearly they mean keep UNK
that's what you're saying
under review and er
you're saying UNK her not cancelling
but is the thing is budget led at this stage i mean isn't that are we really isn't the
well
isn't the actual setting of the budget the key rather than i mean if complaints shoot up but our budget is static then we just got to cope
yeah
but i mean that would apply if we appointed
yes
mm
yes it would
whether we appoint or not
we when do we know when what we're going to get next year from d o e
any time between october and february
great
requires real that's the reality i mean
indications start coming in
i mean the budget presented will no doubt include an increase we will put in a budget higher than this year's i imagine simply inflation and on costs we'll will mean an increase over this year's budget won't they
well erm
erm that that's certain and n a bit more at the end of the month
right
there may be an expectation that we should we should be UNK increase in and getting roughly the same amount of money but
just like that
i mean i take it that nobody wants to recruit un until unless they're certain they can keep
no absolutely not
the er the existing staff next year
mm
that's right
that that's an ea an easy question to answer
that's right
the question mark i've got is tha is that i certainly accept that it's the it's the question of the work being done at the appropriate level and the erm the fact that two sub teams are working without a complaint examiner and but i
i was going to say that i mean if we do that why don't we move to a position when i know it's not UNK yet the p as do the twenty six fives and we try and adapt sarah to do the whole s the whole of the four sub teams ma maybe the UNK has to come down a bit but at least we've got some sort of UNK of working throughout
yes
throughout the organization
mm yes
i think that may be something we have to look at if er if we're not in a position to recruit another complaints examiner
i don't see why it shouldn't work
i mean
mm
i think we're taking twenty six fives out
we have
well most of them
mm well
not necessarily all of the them but most of them that would leave the straight UNK and the clear no UNK maybe the investigators would be getting a few of the ones that otherwise ideally they shouldn't but
yes i can en envisage that somewhere perhaps a UNK a first step towards UNK what may be a runner would be taken by sarah at the moment but er which we would put an investigator straight from future for example
how many complaints would a would we be talking about then
i i'm anxious to avoid a situation of double handling of complaints if we can
no i wasn't i wasn't meaning that
no well except that it would it would happen to some extent i mean the key is whether you whether or not when a complaint comes in whether you can assess that it's likely to go to
mm
to a stage two report isn't it
or a stage two investigation
mm
if you can do that then er only the other on er all of the other ones can go to sarah
our past record on this isn't all that successful but then again
no it isn't because i think if you what you can do very easily is assess those that are a likely on UNK grounds to be rejected
that are
that's
likely to be rejected
likely to be rejected
mm
yes
that's a
oh yes
fairly easy
yes that's quite easy
you can also check er and this is a tiny percentage those that are likely to go to a report
the trouble is in the middle you've got a great gulf of lack of information and UNK in those
that's right that's right
i mean you get straight no i object to this planning extension looks fine and then you start UNK and all sorts of nasty things appear
mm
so i think we're UNK er unlikely to be able to predict that very well but certainly if we can get the UNK outs and the clear no UNK and those to sarah then i think we should do that across the four teams what we've got at the moment is quite UNK as well in other ways look at my
yes that's right
performance and my sub team of course they can clear more complaints than you're sub teams they're getting the UNK in
well they shouldn't do cos UNK got sarah
yes that's right
well UNK then sorry
well you've got
are you still recording that
yes
you on oh that's still that's the one two isn't it
there should be an evening out
yes
i mean
it should work itself out
yeah sorry i'm thinking of er
mm
you're looking at individuals
yeah i was forgetting that was that was calculated on the two
yes you're comparative performances as investigators will well even that shouldn't differ all that much because those that have got sarah available to them those are the teams who ought to be capable of concentrating more on their stage two work shouldn't they
mm
but the reality is of course that those that my investigators and UNK will be doing work that strictly speaking they shouldn't be and i think that's
well certainly they that work is being done more UNK there
yeah
than need be the case
yeah
do
well
we normally have many complaints from the job
we we've got one decision i think which we are making which is that we shouldn't at the moment make any recruitment until we've got confirmation that we can guarantee employment next year se secondly i think we're saying that the first appointment that we do want to make is of a complaint examiner and that if further investigators leave us then we wouldn't be seeking to replace them as investigators we'd be seeking to replace with the complaint examiner that
what to go to three complaint UNK
oh no
sorry
i'm saying the next appointment to be made is all by a complaint examiner what i shouldn't have thought we wanted to do at the moment more than one
right
mm
mm
erm
and if a if
although i mean there may be a er an argument in terms of lowest costing for reviewing generally how many investigators we do need and
yes
and that's a longer term thing
we're doing in the short term
we'll be saying is that the first appointment of UNK staff to be made is of a complaint examiner
mm
sorry i thought you were going onto say and the next one would also be
well i i'm not going to be in anything
no i'm the first i wouldn't want to go that far ahead either
i think what you're saying that if anybody else leaves then we might be in a position to make that appointment
mm
maybe
w if anybody else leaves you'd be in a position to make the complaint examiner appointment you're saying
well that we might be we'd need
yes
to look at it again wouldn't we but erm
okay
we'd need to look at it again wouldn't we
but erm
okay
we'd be more likely to be able to make it
right
can we just take check then there how that leaves us with our UNK recruitment program
you have produced have you three er potentially UNK complaint UNK
two
two
and a reserve with
so three
were there some doubts
yes
two definitely UNK one yes but with reservations
mhm
erm and they've been told that we might not be making any appointment at all
no
what they were told was that erm a number of a short list would be made up erm with the possibility of them having a second interview and they would be told one way or another whether or not they were getting a second interview because we weren't in a position to say whether we were or were not appointing
mm
right
so they will be expecting to hear either they've got a second interview or they haven't
well
the minute the note last time said a pool of UNK they will be told that a pool of possible UNK candidates will be contacted to attend for final interview once it's decided to go ahead with the new appointment so you could the thr the three or whatever it is that you are not putting forward that their that our interest in them has ceased
mhm
erm but are we committed to seeing the other three immediately or are we
mm
well the where did we
no we're not committed
say to them erm we've not we've decided at the moment or we've not as yet decided to go ahead with the appointment but when we do
mm
we will contact you
that that's what we could say that
we could we could say that yes
right
well that would deal with the complaint UNK so
that's
the investigators we're at what
they've got a long list and i assume that the non long listed candidates have been told
yes they will have done
yes
tha that's out
the long list have been told that erm notices were being made at and i think that's right isn't it
i'm un i don't know actually i'm not in contact with whose
i'm not entirely clear what was said but erm they were certainly given no commitment to an interview
yes they've been told that there's been a delay in the recruitment process and that they will be contacted further i think is what UNK
i think in due course
margaret said
mm
yes
good
and their are seven of them in the
six and one
well do we think it's worth at all it's worth while at all going compared with them
no i would have thought not given that were looking at
we're certainly not in a position to do so at the moment
we're looking at the most likely scenario being appointing nobody and if we do appoint somebody a complaint examiner it seems
mm
seems frankly a waste of time interviewing them
presumably we would only be in a position to be considering an investigator if both we had a erm a greater number of complaints from around the commission coming into york and i and further members of staff were to leave
yes well i
it would have to be a fair UNK of those two factors
what i had in mind is to get us to a point where if we decided that we do want to recruit somebody we can do that within er a much shorter time scale than our
yes
pattern
mm
er in other words if we decided erm come the end of this month that yes we're going to take in one or more extra counties from leicestershire we would be in a position immediately to erm UNK the er UNK the appointing panel for a complaint examiner wouldn't we
yeah
er now if we
we could
decided that we wanted a complaint examiner and an investigator which i admit is unlikely er we're much further along the a much longer lead time there
mm
well three or four weeks i suppose isn't it
yes we could if you wish actually cut back the complaint examiner time further because there is a clear very clear front runner who chris and i both believe is UNK so if it was a question of getting somebody in more quickly there is the option of not having the second interview as long as you're prepared to you know to UNK that to get somebody in quickly but that i mean that decision can be made at the time
of course there's a further UNK factor that if we do actually put the breaks on people may either lose interest or go
get other appointments
yes but that's a
but that's sort of
six months at the outside isn't it this works for
mm
in two weeks
is that what it is
why's that
well
i think is not the
it is although but that's er were thinking of changing that quite UNK
mm
in my UNK to actually go ahead with the with the interviewing round for your er how many did you say you
six
no sorry erm for the
women investigators
the investigator
for the investigator
six
about six plus one
i think six plus one i think that's right
and get those to the same stage as the complaints examiner
because then at least you might be able to write out a few more
yes
you could be quite openly
we are talking about with either of those groups making the appointment from that pool erm in fact any time between now and the beginning of the next financial year
mm
if they were still available and they may not be
you're front runner is isn't local and unemployed is he or she your complaints examiner
no
no
although presumably
sadly not
has to get
is there still private practices
no
just give a months notice
where
bristol
okay
i think we UNK
now i would do it slightly differently i mean i would say that we want you to we invite you to the next round of our recruitment thing but there i er have no decision has yet been taken as to how many if any appointments will actually be made
so that at the time people are invited to the er interview
yes
rather than
yes
at yes i think that's fair
yes i don't think that the this is UNK as you think though in getting that kind of letter i mean it seems er that the civil service er recruit on that basis every year and er there is no guarantee if you get through the various screening bits that you do actually end up with a job because that depends on vacancies coming up
well as long as people are told
well as long as people know that yes
i think the first priority is that people are clear as to what the score is
mm
re well reasonably clear so that they it it's fair to them
erm just to pull back a bit then i mean two things seem to i mean have we what is our view on you putting sarah in the middle if we don't recruit and two don't we need probably the four of us to look at current resources
yes
er future resources an and UNK our boundaries as well because i mean losing anne is not going to be that easy
quite and i have got a high proportion of staff and you ha you will have a low one would you
yes
say
i think we do need to make some adjustments in the light of that if we remain in our present staffing level
mm
from the first of september are you talking about
i would have to see i think
mr
from round about then cos i asked for the
after the summer period
well yes
i would have thought so
i think it would be for us to talk together the four of us for a start and er and bring proper proposals to future meetings wouldn't it
i think probably what we could do with is a some criteria as to what complaints are going to go to the complaint examiner if we've only got one of them
yes
that shouldn't be too difficult are we having
we
an l m next month
that's just what i was going to ask because it would be september wouldn't it
yes i think so because we don't usually have one in m august do we
that's right
the meeting on the thirtieth of july aren't we with er what's
yes
his name
er jack taylor
taylor
er after that people starting going on leave is anybody out away due in the first week in august
erm yes me
now normal er now i mean day would be the ninth of august wouldn't it
oh i'm a away the second of august
your due back on the ninth
and back on the ninth
as i recall it that we didn't have a week during august where everybody was here indeed we looked at diaries
no
no we didn't
mm
no we didn't
mm
no we didn't
i i'm likely er to be away the last two weeks in august and david's going to be away the last week in august and the first of september weren't you
is that right
no it's the one week which bridges the two erm months but er i will be that we would normally be meeting again on the thirteenth of september wouldn't we
yes
mhm
is that too late
or too early
no i couldn't accept
no
okay i'm getting to september
do we know exactly when anne is leaving
yes
tenth of september
well she's stopping work i think in late august isn't she
she'll have leave if she
she
she's got
sorry
some leave
i mean she's effectively not getting complaints as from now
oh right
so i've got to get rid of her staff
mm
h right shall we have a coffee cup for
good idea
oh
he's right about the will
but they haven't UNK
well they had one but that was er that was never changed from the time when we had complaint UNK before
cos an investigator that couldn't do stage twos
yes
in other words allocation was not
yes
there was no intelligent decision on allocation it was simply
yes that's right
allocate as an investigator
that's right it was UNK as a stage two
and then UNK again but i think that's daft
but there most recent one was over a sarah UNK and the they are now repeating that one as i understand it
oh good
yes
well a high priority that one so the they're recruiting two e two new sarah UNK ones
right erm budget e control
i don't think we've got to the early days made too many assumptions from this particularly as they are UNK er erm adjustment isn't terribly good
er we need to now have some to er cover the cost of proposed UNK to bring support staff together which i'll which we've got in hand and we'll also be UNK money i think from the salary budget to help with the cost of er the total quality training
erm the with reference to something that comes up later on the training budget looks a small figure as against what we're talking about later in the meeting
er that's because the er the training budget at the moment down for york is purely er the attendance of professional conferences
right
and everything else comes in the er personnel training in UNK of the personnel budget
oh right
can items for the management team executive committee i think i have three erm one is to say that the title of the total quality programme is going to be improvement through quality in which case that's the that's the phraseology which we should use from now on is it like it'll actually UNK to i q rather than t q
how effective
it's just one of those phrases
that's meaningless in reality
except that there's an implication there that there's well i suppose there is a need to improve isn't there really
yeah quality through improvement might be better
mm
er
never mind
secondly there's an item in the management team UNK conference minute which are due to be confirmed today the which i shall be UNK about work in the office out of office hours
mm
yes
erm and it is not my intention to implement that minute at the moment because i think it relates purely to a london situation
where are we at
sorry
the UNK legal UNK to establish efforts
no well there's a ne
it's the next isn't it over the
it's
page i think richard
was this because of the over accident
ah right
yes
and the logic of what's being said there is effectively to abandon the UNK scheme out of for working out of office hours
well wouldn't
erm i thought UNK scheme began at seven thirty and ended at seven thirty
yes but a that is saying
there are so beyond seven thirty though
oh yes
what does that minute say
it says until firm decision is taken the staff would not be allowed to work within office buildings out of UNK hours
out of UNK hours right
yes
so presumably for that would be seven thirty
oh right
to seven thirty
right
well there's no logic to that there because the lack of cover and er whatever applies the minute the last person leaves and that erm it lies that the concern is that if somebody who was in on the building in the building on their own has an accident
mm
nobody might discover it until the office opens on the next morning erm
but there's always going
it's that
to be a last person
mm
that's right
yes
yes that's right
rather than that's but you make sure it's ju
except if you call
could be a last person at six er clock
the last people who leave
this
so what about are UNK
four o'clock
who are on the staff and in theory work until quarter to eight
well it's exactly the same problem i think
except there's two of them and they're always to
not at the moment
not at the moment
i thought there was two
there should be two
i saw someone else floating around
there should be two
erm i mean it is a problem and er one that we're addressing but
mm
er at the moment i wasn't wanting to s change any anything that which is been happening up till now i mean if people do want to come in here at weekends or late i don't see any reason
mm
to stop them at the moment
i don't
so
carry the risk
is it is it that the insurance
were in there weren't they
yes but is the insurance not does it not cover people in the premises outside office time
no i don't think it's an insurance problem
no it isn't
it's a no it's a
it's a worry about people UNK themselves
yes
yes as you say i mean i think that's erm for the people themselves
yes
i thought it might be that there was a we weren't covered for the liability to pick people
quite
if something happened
or we face prosecution
i think there's a you face prosecution for failing to provide a safe system of work or something
i mean that could be the case at eight
i mean for instance there is no first UNK on duty as apparently well there's a suggestion that you need to have a first UNK on duty if you've got people in the building
good
erm and that's why i'm saying
mm
we don't have a first UNK on duty outside normal office hours not UNK hours and er if you're
letting that run the thing
no
mm
so it will
just forget tha about that and i will
it this afternoon
and people all over the place
yes
yes
yes they are
take your first UNK with you
you'll probably find the
that'll throw the budget into confusion won't it
the first UNK would also need an UNK officer
erm now the third thing was about the training program just to reiterate where we are on this that if a request is made for personal development training in the current year if you remember we if we identify training needs that we as management identify that people need in order to do there present job and then that takes absolute priority and we should get on and do those but we get a large number of requests where people erm are saying that they like to do things which they don't need to do but which they think will better UNK them and if they're if we're getting any new requests this year with an expectation that further expenditure will be sought in the next financial year that's ninety four five then that request will be refused in other words we ca we do not see our way to committing ourselves to any
mm
training expense next year er in that category
although we might be prepared outside our normal scheme to fund the current year's training for such people on the understanding that future funding will not be available so in other words if somebody comes along to you and says i'd like to do an m b a beginning this year now normally we would say yes we will contribute our half to that cost er and that would then be a high priority on our budget to provide continued support for the rest of that m b a course we're now saying that the answer is actually no because we cannot provide support next year we don't think er but if you never the less want to go ahead this year and then fund it yourself from then on then we have actually got money available which we can use this year
that make sense to people
yes
yes
it would have to be given what we've just been talking about
er
could i raise just the one minute of the tail conference david
the erm the nature of the erm the fourteenth of june the total quality minute the it seems to be referring to a document that sets out various phases of the er total quality programme
is it possible to get a copy of that
no
mm
short answer i mean it's the it's it UNK referring to a document which gordon had produced whi which has already been er amended erm which bit are you actually looking at
the item three
yes we
for the proposals in UNK memo were agreed
it seems to be referring to a document that sets out the whole total quality process as far as the commission is concerned
yes it sets it
erm no it doesn't it picks out various bits from er from a memo that gordon dealt with it doesn't set out the total UNK budget process
ah i see
mm
okay
erm
thank you
alright
you will simply need to wait until the thing is sufficiently settled that you can get the total package set out here and
mm
we're not quite sure what it is you are wanting that you are wha what specific query you've got
well i haven't it's just that people have said you know when the UNK available can we see it as soon as possible that was all i just wondered if that document was available
no
but i mean if it's not yet that's fine
a bit like asking what UNK like and being told you have to die first
well let's hope that that's a good analogy
yes i agree with that say that would
the heaven bit anyway
that would re that would er ease your recruitment problem
i would point out that the same applies to hell
right that takes us on to looking at er pink team minutes which we haven't got is that right
we haven't actually got the pink team minutes yet
but and green team that we have and
we're well worth spending a few hours over this i think
i think so yes and since my watch
can i minute that we thank the green team
what about the bit at the top of page two which says that still don't use them in york
this
at the UNK thinking seminar held in november
yes
i read that with great interest i'm not at all sure what it means
no ha UNK phoned me last week asking for the details of jobs we get fr er of who to erm who to contact for it that's all for that needs
i see she's UNK presumably referring to the march erm
yeah
and not the november one
mm
i have in fact si since seeing this sent her a copy of the paper i put to this meeting erm having seen that because i didn't know that she was waiting for it to the commentary with
no
but it's on it's way
seventeen i'd wondered about
erm
yes i was UNK by that one
i was going to ask to ask the assistant new commission policy
no it didn't er as far as i know
what is the policy
was it everything goes second apart from er
reports
reports
apart formal reports and
we even that is that we even had a party on UNK didn't we
which i suspect has UNK
then we should fax the home one page letters
yes
mm
if possible
yes i'm not i'm not sure that's still happens does it
do you know karen
i think so hmm
i expect i've got a tell from the files
it's cheaper to fax a one page letter than it is to post it
yes
so we are UNK our policy of
UNK one page letters rather than UNK them
i think that's worth the effort yes
and er
but certainly not UNK this first class post
and not intending to er send things by first class post
yes erm do we accept UNK letters as complaints
yes
cos i thought we did
why ever not
but i've only seen one or two can we think about photocopying them if it's that thin because by the time it gets to me sometimes it's not UNK
ah well it should you're probably talking about old ones rather than new ones because they use fax machine prints on plain paper rather than
i see
on UNK and shiny paper
right well i just looked at one where i was struggling that's why i mention it
i always love the idea of information UNK disappearing slowly
oh yes
relatively quickly i think
i just wondered whether we've actually met the requirements of the of the act
matches my mind
i presume it does but it could be argued couldn't it
no if a complaints made in writing it's good
possibly it is but it's not a na proper signature it's a UNK signature
should we not accept an original
oh got to have some bits of writing somewhere
the act doesn't refer to signatures does it
oh it does actually yes i have
okay anything else on the green team
i'm not bothered either way as long as i can read it
right
looking at looking at UNK minutes then page one
page two trying to pick up the bit at over the bottom of the door
hmm
your office appears UNK
yes i was
i mean we're not exactly trying to get people to drop in off the street are we
i er i er our office now appears in exactly the same way as the other two namely that you need to announce yourself and who you are before you get let in the door
yes
i was quite surprised that there was some sort of strength of feeling that the balance between providing security and the impression that we gave to visitors although it was acknowledged we didn't have a lot of visitors coming in there was a feeling
to us
that it had maybe UNK the wrong way
i think with the people who say that it should have clear instructions it's not immediately obvious which button you should press and maybe you maybe something which says visitors please press here or something like that
mr could please press over there
exactly
er
because i never know in london which button to press either the one at the top or the one at the bottom
i remember very con i remember very confusing
yes it is
i press them both and er
see what happens
UNK happen don't know what
i just hope the receptionist
it always
sees me arriving and
well she usually does she's incredibly
yes that's right
yes
good
yes that's right
they're nearly always open before i get there that er
can you do something about the
we will see what we can come up with that'll be weather proof we may just have to keep on going out er sticking labels
great
the bit about reception is writing the UNK name in the visitors book seems to be quite reasonable
i'm
i object on principal when i go to places saying write your name in the visitors book so why should you
yes it actually came up
what purpose does it serve
because one or two people have er relatives that come in at the end of the day to collect them or
right
you know give them a lift home and they felt that it was a bit UNK to be asked to write them name in the book every time and it i mean it seemed to be quite reasonable that we're
i'm less worried about being UNK to relatives that i am to er other people frankly
and also not all erm there was reference made to i can't remember which company it was but somebody you know who was th not particularly UNK had filled in the book
well i don't think it's i don't think it's terribly good actually to be able to be telling other people who has already been here erm
mm good
i am conscious that i have visited somebody a while ago and noticed the name of somebody e in the book in which rang very loud alarm bells in my mind
mm
as to what they were doing there and
mm
that therefore it would be better not to be doing that so perhaps we can change that okay
mhm
how though
by not having a visitors book
oh no jackie will ask for
yes
the name and just fill it in
but not get not get them to sign it
no
she'll write their name
she'll just write their name
dead simple
i was just thinking that maybe at the beginning of the day people could if she knows who is due she could actually write that in and when they came she could just tick that they'd arrived
well there is a of course the UNK coming in the
yes i noticed that
cos the fire officer asked for that
yes
mm
does the but we don't keep a list do we of whose of our own staff is in the building
no
no
yes jackie has the whereabouts now if she keeps she also keeps a list of the erm support staff but if they actually go out at lunch time that we don't know
mm of course
or at tea when they come in the morning or when they go home in the evening
mm
that's right i mean there's a grey area between
yes
eight and ten in the evening and four
mhm
to six
yes
at night we'd be very uncertain if there had been an alarm bells rang then
coventry have a book which they keep for fire purposes of signing themselves in and out
what would be easier would be a simple board with everybody's name and you just sort of erm put it across to in or out as you are coming up
except there's quite a lot of people back there
there's fifty of us to put on it
i know but never the less it's easier to
so you couldn't carry it outside when the fire alarm went off
i was going to say it's likely to be
well you could you could have it on a hook
i've all little things
UNK on
all the little things that er
yeah UNK wife
burned to death rescuing board
i can't see it seems to be one of those things that has no purpose
well only in case of accident or injury you see
yeah but i
well we do we do have another means don't we were by the fire officers on each floor or each area
in each section
will check through
well
the rooms in their area
if we're serious about that we need i think to review that very regularly because i moved offices and discovered i was still a fire officer for a part of the office i wasn't even part of
it needs to be kept up to date
or was more accurately a fire officer for a part of an office that i wasn't aware of so i mean i think
there should really be somewhere in the building a place which tells you who is in the building at what times
i don't know what question to i thought all were supported out with the assumption that they were going to be
no i'm a fire officer
i'm a fire officer
so am i
yeah i'm a fire officer
that's why you're UNK about this i thought that
we that would be alright for UNK
it would be better if they were support
yes
staff because er
yes but there wasn't any support in UNK area
but when we moved them
there will be
there will be
that's true yes
alright well maybe perhaps we could have a review of why our fire
yes
arrangements are anything else on page er three
UNK
page
could i just go back to er this health and safety erm it says here that there is a personal alarm on reception that's the receptionist
i could put another one on for any member of staff who wishes to take one to use at interviews
i thought that's what we said last time we were doing
no you said would i bring it up at this meeting
did i but you brought it up last meeting that erm people were going as supposed to be coming back with good ideas as to how to cope with interviews in other rooms but we said in last time that we were going to have a personal round bill
a bit like the UNK
yeah
you did a paper which said
yes
wherever an interview takes place people can take this personal alarm with them
yes
and should alert somebody nearby to listen for it did that
so it took out
all my investigators who want them have got personal alarms of their own
the ladies
yes
mm
well presumably the men as well
mm
if they want them too
all the ones who wanted them
yes
like this
just something
mm
indeed
bottom of page three
page four
it's only just occurred to me erm somebody mentioned that new members of staff and the support staff ever since but it needn't necessarily be arrive
and no one sort of knows
no one is aware of what's going on doesn't have a chance to meet them
is it possible when we get a new member of that not that they're brought round which i think must be UNK but that we are told and therefore we can drop in and say hello i'm so and so just to say hello
oh you mean in other teams
yes i mean i'd no idea who carol was i just UNK into her
it was in the minutes you should have read them
i did
i said i assume this be carol
just a small point but i think when people arrive that they perhaps feel isolated and that we're a little UNK
well we have got quite a lot of detail working package from within their own teams and within the support staff so you want that extended so that they can
nothing elaborate just a note perhaps to a d saying
mm
there is a new perhaps your staff could drop in and say hello some time during the week
i don't mind dropping in and saying hello we are getting to a size where er i think it's UNK slightly UNK i mean er i can see there was so might be useful to know there's a new member of staff here it's either then say there was somebody wandering around who are you and what are you doing here
mm
mm
yes i think
just a little note
yes i think that
okay
would be useful
so and so has started or will start alright
yes UNK
then
in the week before somebody comes then i think perhaps a note saying so and so's starting
okay
mhm
we haven't got anybody else's minutes to look at
no
the trainee plan which i think i can now re vote
if you want to say anything about that
tie me up
why was the lotus issue put into this mo this year's training plan when it was last year's money
i don't know
i'm not sure
it actually took place this year
did it
yes
no
it was in march wasn't it
no it took place in the end of march
did it
i thought it was the beginning of april
yeah
it did
i just
yes
wondered if there was anything significant about it
no
right
a bit
i just
taking off and being done that is
okay
can i just er clarify the UNK the very last item the er the UNK m b e erm i thought she was finishing new one
er well she she's not being supported by the commission for year one and in fact she won't be supported for year two either so the thing that i i'm i put it in as a potential budget
well
thing for next year but i mean she will be one of those caught by the thing saying we're not going to do it anyway
is the attendance at professional conferences something that's earmarked or is it just
that's the five hundred pounds that's in our budget as opposed to in the personnel budget
yes
there is
i mean that that's a er that's a
it it's an estimate so that it's there if anybody wants to say
yes that's to deal with the odd request in the course of year
yes right
right
c p d stands for continuous professional development it applies only to nick at the moment
mm
okay
the UNK skills one you put seven hundred and fifty d down d does that mean you had in mind that there might be three seminars in the course of the year
er
no i don't think it'd be don't think it meant that i thought we went to could be two we're going to have another one
i think we had
yes
in mind that we should have another one but er
yes
the previous one cost us i think two hundred pounds
erm well i think we had budgetary provision in five hundred for it and i think we've probably increased it er was it unchanged originally
it means we might have some money left over after
yes right okay
mine's more suited to that i think next time er once we've got somewhere out of the way and can
that's right
actually get these things done
i was going to say is there anything on the cards for local authority finance or is that still awaiting
erm
well how about a memo about it to somebody saying can they suggest a potential person you know
and we haven't had a reply back
alright consultation on twenty six five procedures
this is UNK response to the proposal
if anybody wants to comment on it or any i think perhaps just confirm the calculation about being roughly one a day that erm if you take the number of decisions that we made in the last twelve months twenty one point eight percent of which were erm decisions to be put out by twenty six five if we divide that by four divide it by fifty two and divide it by five you end up with point eight six per day er
is that right
quite sure why how somebody else says that the number of twenty six five UNK suggests that UNK will be dealing with more than one file each day well but that's what the arithmetic says
mm
and also would agree that team secretaries wouldn't be involved
yeah
yes
what on the basis that if the p a isn't there the areas are going to do it themselves
or pass it for another
yes
either that or if there was further weights redundant to an investigator
and there is certainly no plans for other complaints to go to p as
well erm
are there
stay with that a minute erm i mean i wouldn't have thought we were in a position to give an assurance that er erm that no other complaints which appear to be outside the local UNK restriction will be dealt with by support staff i mean i should think we're continuing looking continually looking for ways of dealing with complaints at the most efficient and effective way and if that
certainly given assurance there's no plans
well there are no immediate plans you could say
slightly UNK in fact we are saying there is a possibility that er
hang on a minute i just wan want to work out what happens if a complaint comes in against the gas board
well the a d would perhaps no i suppose it might not have reached me
no it wouldn't
no
sometimes they do
so
it's already been dealt with by support staff
by support staff and
mm yeah
yes joe
so i don't think you i should think partly we just cannot give an assurance that no other complaints will be dealt with by support staff really that we
no you can't er sorry i was taking that literally that we certainly not intending it this was this was very much directed at twenty six five
erm nor i think are there any proposals to change the grading or pay UNK to p as to reflect there work on these files er i'm not sure whether the assumption that this wouldn't be taken into account by the w r is sound because i think one of the principles that i recall was that he were meant to ensure that each of these job evaluation panels had somebody from each office so that an account could be taken of the different practices i mean i'm sure that i'm sure that each of the three offices in the er deal with things in a different way so that er what gets done by one person here is not necessarily done by people in coventry and york and that in fa in london and that also holds good in the other way i think
do we see any difficulty in er in what were in effect saying that the base says we have no objection to the proposed wording from either the extra duties recognized in outline above and they're not going to be
fine
right
is it at the bottom paragraph
yeah
mm
i'm just trying to see what extra duties are recognized as outlined above presumably yeah
well i don't have any problems with what you say
well on the para four job evaluation erm it seems to me that this is an item that can be fed into the would automatically be fed into the evaluation process
yeah
don't forget we're talking about changing people somebody's job description to include a can you
yes
right er next evening we settle the thirteenth of september then
mhm
outside the meeting can i just say i'm getting some of the new screening sheets through you know first but people don't seem to know what they're supposed to do with them and their in exactly the same position that they were before
discussions with richard
robert
robert sorry here you go
that'll come out on there you see and i'll get tell myself off
that's probably cos you know
we've gotta design UNK this cos everybody off
oh sorry apologize to the last guy he didn't
richard while i'm having oh
it's that again
that was a richard
cut
robert while i'm having a look
yeah edit that
while i'm having a look at this just a quick glance through erm there's the er range of products that we print design publish we don't sell them for our clients
erm if you'd like to have a quick glance through them
yep
just get your feel for it
yep
i'll have i'll have hopefully described them as much as i can over the erm over the phone but er and of course the brochure
did what did you UNK for the erm company brochure
very professional
mhm
er forward going
always looking to how can i put this upgrade things is it like you know
pardon
all these looking to upgrade things you know
er going forward
okay
oh sure
er you know and
yeah
four years ago the erm er two thirds of those products weren't in existence
yeah
erm the law has helped us
legislation helped us with the medical practice booklets
yeah
the law also helped us allowing a lot of professional companies to advertise which they couldn't
you know like accountants solicitors doctors UNK
none of those could advertise
so in so it's UNK the number of er prospective advertisers that we can approach
yeah
totally new this industry so
erm i have to say that most of the people that come to us have never been involved in advertising
yeah
one of the things i am obviously gonna have to look at is the what you've done in the last two or three years because traditionally erm we wouldn't ask van drivers to come along and see us
yeah well there's
but there's there had to have been
there's a good reason for that
yeah right
well i wouldn't
well i would well i'd feel
i'd feel more comfortable with people at least who have made an attempt to er to do something to earn a living
well i've never signed on the dole so
you're trying to avoid that
yeah
i haven't although a lot of people would say i was silly for not having done
because i probably lost out on a lot of money
well i well i tell a lie i tried it once
mhm
er in between sales
aha
jobs
er and i was told that i wasn't entitled to any money anyway because i was self employed and i only paid the stamp
yes well that's exactly what they said to me
and er you know i thought well
thoroughly annoyed me because i'd er every year when i'd paid my tax i'd pay my er national insurance and as far i'm concerned that should've entitled me
yeah
oh you can income support but it's not why should i be any different
i think it's something that they probably have to look at fairly seriously because er i think you do the government a lot of favours by going self employed
of course you do
you take self take the employment figures down for a start
yeah
er yeah i mean that that's never been discussed by anybody or know or
mm
anything or it's never published that if you go self employed
no er i have
er if you're out of work you're it takes small businesses of
erm and one of the things i could've done was to em er become a UNK employee of my own company which was a limited company but i paid myself as a consultant
yeah rather than a director
yeah
and nobody told me that
and you're supposed to know all about the bits of paper that they issue
it does UNK me
anyway that's got that's put the world to rights hasn't it
yeah
okay er robert
there you are i got it right for
yeah i'll confuse now call me paul
that's right yeah
thank you
erm well first of all er i'll come back to that
first of all the company is very serious about taking up references
yep
and they ask for four for a very good reason
at least they want to get a cross section
if may be one doesn't respond at least we've got a good er
yeah
and quite honestly if two give er a good references but i would i would have to address that once we decide
right
er what the outcome of this is going to be today
er now let's go back over oh first of all let me explain what the idea is hello
it is indeed
hi lynn
oh that's fine okay
yeah very kind of you call because some people don't
lynn than thanks very much
bye
yes we get a lot of people who don't turn up at least a phone call is er
right
must make a note of that
yes i wanted to erm outline what the you know the purpose of these discussions today er so that we can get to the point where we can get into er get into more detail
erm first of
er
did i speak to you originally
you did yeah
okay
so i would have heard enough on the phone er because i haven't got my original notes here i would have heard enough on the phone er robert to have suggested that it was a good idea to get face to face
so there's a lot of the discussions have taken place and also i would have briefed you a bit er
yeah
on what it was
self employed commission only
i would have said at forty one you know you er you're still probably young enough to get a UNK job but we decided that it might be worth er you trying this avenue
the brochure also would have outlined a number of other aspects in more detail than i could give you on the phone
and today really is er decision day that er first of all we'll get one of the UNK out of the way whether you and i think that this is a good
you think yeah
er way for you to be er earning some money
i know that a lot of money can be earned
i've experienced it myself and there are a plenty of top earners in our company who er arrive in a UNK and er and er things like that
so some big money earners
erm once that UNK out of the way if it is a hurdle er once we've agreed on that er the next decision we'll make is on er which company you and i think that you're more be comfortable the environment in which you er we operate
because we all do the same thing
a hundred and seventy five i think was the last count that we have around the u k all selling advertising
and the only difference between them er one group and another is may be the pitch is slightly different and the benefits
otherwise oh and the pricing is slightly different
yeah
otherwise it's er all the same
we're doing all the same
certainly the opportunities to earn all the same er are the same across all companies
all right opportunities
yep
erm so that you know it's a luxury that i have
i'm looking it's not one job for one person in one company today
it is i'm looking for five er may be for each of those companies so that's thirty people i could be looking for
i'm not but i you know could be
yeah could be
but i want somebody in every one of those companies
so there's not a problem
so you're not in competition with anybody else
right
erm and the other aspect of course is when
we do like people to give us a commitment on the spot on all of those three counts
er when we have a training course for all of these companies
there's no way we're going to send people out er to sell advertising er particularly as the majority of people have never done that before
yep
certainly it's not in your background and it's not in most people's i have to say
erm and er we don't hide behind reject letters
if i don't think you're suitable and if i don't think this is for you i'll say
you'll tell me yeah
straight up
i'll be up front with you
yep
erm i also want and because i
you'll say
well i'll give the commitment
if you say if you don't think this is for you you've got to tell me that
erm i don't go into big sales pitch you know to bring you into the company
what i will do is emphasize what we you know where you can go in terms of money wise
and the other thing is when
now accordingly to your application form here er you you've no problem you can start
yeah
all right
and i will give you that commitment as well
i'll say fine you want to start with us you want to start in this company here's your date for your course fully UNK
travel hotel bills everything
then out on to an assignment or with somebody in the field for a couple of days whichever company you go into
all right
so
yeah
that's if you like the big picture
i'm now going to put on the lights that's better i thought it was a bit dull in here
it was lovely and sunny when i first came in
you were nice when that light was on
aye
you were nice in the first light
yeah now i can actually see what you look like
okay well you really want to with us don't you
don't go UNK the UNK right
you gotta you'll get a UNK off the top of my head
okay robert bob
yep
erm your background here
that's have a look through this
first of all erm we'll you you've obviously been round the construction industry a bit
if i can interpret these
erm a UNK contractor for twelve years there right
yeah
that was is was that the doing the selling er you've got UNK foreman here but that was the doing of was it
that was the doing of yep
okay
erm that was for twelve years
and then you make what a lot of people would be er consider er a UNK leap
into sales
into sales from being what i would call an UNK and er i don't know what you would call yourself but somebody who does things erm er on a er manual stroke UNK type work over to sales
home security systems i have to say that home improvements is the most likely UNK er leap that people will take first time
yeah
and or UNK for one of the UNK companies whatever
explain why what was behind your leap into sales
at the time er well i've always through the UNK right you come up against site fore you know site foreman general foreman clerk of works and i i've always got on well with i can always talk to people
okay
er when the building trade or that company moved out the north east
i was with them in glasgow as well they were a national company and i came down here from glasgow
this is what
h
oh sorry oh the first one yeah
the first one yeah
okay
i came down here because they were running out of work in scotland initially
and er then mrs thatcher if you like and cut back council er subsidies and things happened and the work just ran out
right it was mostly skilled
and this was why the company pulled out of the it says out of the north are they still in existence or were they in
i don't know
no in eighty four they weren't going under they were
oh no they just pulled away
er i went back down south again
er as i say they were a u k company
were you sort of left UNK then or did
yes
you have something in er is this when you
that's when i went in with myself
okay
it was it was somebody i knew er in the club
so it was a contact
yeah
all right
er
who told you could sell probably
that's how i got into it that's for sure
yeah well he said er i don't see any reason why you couldn't you know
yes
i've always been a sort of i won't say outgoing personality let's say right
er
extrovert
yeah well
it's another posh word for it
yeah
i always take people at face value and talk to people
okay right
you know
er never had any fear of that
right
i look at a person and if you like me you like me
well that's let's face it
if you don't well you don't
let's face it that's half the battle
er
okay
so i got into that
erm
and in newcastle are a local company obviously
well again er they were u k based you know nationwide
nation nationally
yeah national company
er but i UNK to myself and near the end it was a sales manager that had a team of men under me and you know and things like that
and then all of a sudden in a span of about three month a lot of deals started er going by the UNK let's say right
you know guys were bringing in deals i was going out and selling
aha
cos you can't let one alone
no
as you probably know
and they were going in the next morning oh they'd phoned up they'd cancelled
er i've talked them back in but it's a house account so obviously there's no money in for me you see
oh that's what you mean by erm
right
UNK deal
okay
it was the UNK way i could have thought of put it
what happened was they were actually starting
you probably wanted to use stronger language though did you r er bob
yeah and that sort of UNK
you know but that's
what was happening was they were starting they were ready to start up their own company to hire managers
oh right
and so and we were bringing in deals and they were phoning the clients back and saying look yeah great alarm systems blah we have an alternative one cheaper
and they were fitting in their own until they got up and running
okay
so you know
well you lasted there for a couple of years
what do what do you feel you gained most from er from this er this first two years in sales
in sales
confidence in myself again
aha
you know just getting well cos as you know you don't know who you're gonna talk to
sure
you knock a door and the door opens and that's your first contact with the person
so of course these were by the title there home security these were all domestic were they you didn't deal with businesses
didn't do commercial
okay right
no
er it was all home security systems
er very high tech very expensive
that's another thing i found
the er infra red
the system wire free
yeah okay
was all UNK
yeah
er
totally wire free
well there was two wires
from the main
from the main box one to mains one to the outside
yeah okay well that's
signal box
system i've got yeah
yes one i've got as well
a good system
er and from then
you know again it was a professional company it start with we were doing in manchester for a week's training
this is
yeah
aha
er very professional course
very professional
for somebody that had never been in sales before you remember a lot from the course
ah that was that was yes that was really what i was going to er behind my question or included in my question is that what did you learn from that
yeah
