there's a dilemma of who's taking decisions about what and should the troops on the ground who may be involved could be involved in fighting following an air strike erm are not under a nato flag they're under a united nations flag so it is quite a complex situation and a very delicate one to handle
so there are international organizations
now charities we would group them together as n g os they're often called non UNK organizations
now we've heard charities any other examples of n g os
yes please
UNK
the union society
no
oh sorry
UNK
UNK yes that's a another branch of the united nations but it is it does operate you're quite right
any other
pressure groups
pressure groups yes for example
greenpeace
greenpeace very good
pressure groups greenpeace the anti apartheid movement amnesty international they do play important parts
any members of amnesty here
good
you see you're part of the international scene whether you realize it or not
so non UNK organizations
and then even within two of you mentioned the european commission now the commission is of course a part of what's UNK now known as the european union erm it's a particular branch but even within the broader framework parts can play an important role erm within international affairs and the commission has a particular role not just within the european union but of course in international affairs generally
the negotiations for the gatt agreement the general oh er what does gatt mean
general
very good
the general agreement on UNK and trade
it was negotiated on behalf of the european community as it then was by who led the negotiation
UNK absolutely right and he was representing the commission yes
yes and then of course you get business organizations the and much business is now internationally based we've we recognize this recently from the erm the purchase of rover by b m w erm but of course the big companies have operated for long across international boundaries whether it be oil companies like UNK or chemical companies like i c i erm or UNK you know one of the symbols that erm lets you know russia had been opened up to the international community was the erm presence of a UNK erm shop in moscow
anybody been to moscow
did you go to UNK
no well it is one of the UNK as you know but erm i'm sure you heard about it when you were there didn't you
yes
right erm well i hope i've covered most of the range of things that come
now let me push on a bit and erm i won't ask you to write this down but when we we've been talking about the state now what are the characteristics of the state
well first of all the state has geographical boundaries that is you enter a state whether it be UNK or the united states as i mentioned before by crossing a boundary
now the boundary may be a sea boundary it may be land boundary it may be an air boundary because the states claim a control over erm particular physical structures
the land boundaries are probably the easiest of all
when you cross the UNK you can in some places you can cross from france to germany it's a very clear one
erm sea boundaries are now a bit more complex because the law of the sea has been changing erm over recent decades
there is an i a concept of UNK water that is the water which UNK a particular state erm is controlled by that state and falls within the laws of that state
erm there used to be an agreed area of three miles then it went to twelve miles but that's now in question because of the different ways in which the sea has been developed
erm if you have if you envisage the sea this is the top i'm not a great artist as you can see but you things er here's my boat sailing on the top of the sea well there's laws related to that erm when does a boat for example enter UNK waters come within your law
there's also erm that's a fish swimming in the sea there's also a law related to fishing as i mentioned before
there's also erm attempts at regulation related to what lies on the sea bed because in some parts of the UNK there are valuable mineral deposits lying on the sea bed
who owns them
much of it is in the middle of the pacific you see which used to be a common area but the only people who could at the moment have the technology to tap those resources are the very advanced states so there is a dispute about the right to develop those or not
and then there is underneath the sea bed which has been very important for the united kingdom because of the great oil and gas resources which we found and if you had er more limited erm concepts of the
order
questions for the secretary of state for employment
UNK
number one madam speaker
madam speaker we estimate that british employers spend er approximately twenty thousand million pounds a year on training
the last recorded figure in nineteen eighty seven was eighteen thousand million pounds
miss UNK
thank you madam speaker
i thank my right honourable friend for that reply
would he agree with me that one of the major contributing factors to our rapid recovery from recession in advance of all the other european communities
hear
very good point
has been that british industry has continued to maintain its investment in training
hear
i agree with my honourable friend er one of the er satisfactory features of the c b i er survey last week one of the many was that eighty four percent of firms er in the u k intend to increase or maintain their spending on training and of course she's absolutely right they will be the firms that will benefit most from that investment in training as we continue through recovery into growth in the longer term
barry jones
but the right honourable gentleman will recollect that in aerospace in steel and in textiles there are now no large apprenticeship schools
when in his own UNK memory he may remember that there were
what action is he taking to specifically gain er activities that will ensure there will be apprenticeship schools
from him we have too many press releases and not enough action
hear
it would destroy jobs er all i would say to the honourable gentleman is that he will have noticed that the chancellor of the exchequer er used one of the announcements in his budget statement on the thirtieth of november last year er to announce that we shall be introducing a modern apprenticeship scheme
hear
which will be available for school UNK next year and that the chancellor has allocated in the department of employment budget for training credits and the new modern apprenticeship er over a billion pounds er which will be UNK to introduce those apprenticeships
what i very much hope is that industry will now respond by coming forward particularly this year with trail UNK apprenticeship schemes that will ensure that we have got the most relevant structures in place for those modern apprenticeships next year
oliver heal
would my right honourable friend care to pay tribute to the work of the training and enterprise councils in helping women particularly who want to get back into work by providing child care facilities er and would he also like to comment on the UNK scheme in UNK which he visited last week which is an example of partnership between the public sector the private sector the UNK er promoting this sort of work
i'm very grateful to my honourable friend
i do indeed pay tribute to over one thousand two hundred top business and community leaders who serve on our eighty two training and enterprise councils and who indeed is quite right in er UNK do a tremendous amount of work on equal opportunities
the child care initiative launched by my predecessor involving expenditure of over forty million pounds over the period is giving training and enterprise councils the opportunity to come forward with some very UNK and innovative schemes
one of those i saw in UNK was extremely impressive and is founded as my honourable friend says on positive partnership
tony UNK
madam speaker
what actually would shift the secretary of state from his mood of UNK
between nineteen ninety and nineteen ninety two over a million skilled workers were put out of work in this economy nearly half a million semi skilled workers lost their jobs
the number of people trained in industry dropped by three hundred thousand and the secretary of state tells the house that this is a success
this isn't the opposition talking the country down it's the government doing the country down
well i'm sorry that the opposition is continuing to talk the country down
we have in fact er had a very impressive record on UNK
we now in manufacturing where there's been a decline in employment since the nineteen sixties we now have four million workers in manufacturing producing more than seven million produced fifteen years ago
that's a tribute to the british work force and don't let the honourable gentleman forget that we now have one point four million more in work in the u k than we had ten years ago
let him start talking up our achievements rather than pointing to an agenda which his party has already signed up to which would destroy millions of jobs through statutory works councils statutory minimum wage and statutory compulsory working week
that's a recipe for disaster
james
question number two madam speaker
er madam speaker the united kingdom has sixty nine percent of its working age population in work and it is rising
germany has sixty five percent and it is falling and france sixty percent and now also falling
mr UNK
may i thank my honourable friend for that extremely helpful reply and for the encouraging figures which he has given to the house this afternoon
very encouraging
clearly it happens to er underline the fact that the united kingdom economy is in much better shape when compared to the economies of our principal european competitors
would er my honourable friend agree with me that one of the reasons why we've come out of the recession so well is the fact that we don't have a social contract and
hear
would he agree with me that the social contract the absence of a social contract certainly hasn't damaged er rates of take home pay
hear
er madam speaker i entirely agree i entirely agree with my ho honourable friend er the absence of the social chapter in britain accounts in part for our higher levels of employment and the reforms which we carried out in the eighties and the figures speak for themselves as do the er people who speak for industry for example when black and UNK announced their intention to bring their operations er fully into britain out of germany a company spokesman said anyone familiar with this sit situation in germany will grasp that because of costs it is become very difficult to do business there
if members opposite had their way it would be very difficult to do business here
bill UNK
would the minister answer a question on a matter of concern to businessmen in the county of UNK
after the tax increases in the budget of this year o on april which are in to be introduced in april the first
does the minister believe that they have implications for the economy of the united kingdom
does he think they will lead to further unemployment and does he think they'll have enough the effect of increasing unemployment in my part of the united kingdom
madam speaker i am sure that my right honourable friend the chancellor's proposals to er reduce the burden of national insurance contributions will have a very beneficial effect er on employment a and on businesses but er if members opposite and er the honourable gentleman er says what he thinks clearly if members opposite are arguing that higher public expenditure and higher taxation will have an impact on employment then he's absolutely right
that is why on this side we resist the proposals which come from members opposite to add to public expenditure every day of the week
UNK
would my right honourable friend sorry would honourable friend agree that the way you build jobs in an economy is through having successful businesses
businesses like chartered UNK where one of our honourable friends will be opening a new plant er shortly where they have won awards for quality for training and for exports national and regional during the last three years
that is the way that we build jobs surely not through bureaucratic regulations
er madam speaker i entirely agree with my honourable friend regulation and bureaucracy are the enemy of employment and that is why the prime minister has UNK that every government department is looking at regulations and bureaucracy to reduce the burden and that is why in the forthcoming european elections on this side of the house we'll be arguing for less bureaucracy and less regulation not more which UNK jobs
michael
madam speaker
madam speaker this is a job summit and i intend to talk about jobs
i'm very grateful to the minister for being brief though of course he passed on no information of any worth
the five hundred and forty three thousand less people in employment in britain than there was a year ago and four hundred and fifty one less in employment than in nineteen seventy nine
surely it's time to talk to the united states about how they succeed by having a minimum wage in most states and giving trade union rights to people that we deny the same firms employees in this country
when the honourable gentleman said i gave no information i said i intended to talk about jobs and in this country we believe we believe that er there are three things very important a at this forthcoming summit
first of all the importance of a stable economic framework
secondly the importance of a flexible labour market and thirdly the removal of barriers to enterprise
finally i'll just say this to him i agree that we have a great deal of things to learn from the united states not in the way he suggests but it is a fact that er over the economic cycle of o e c d between seventy nine and eighty nine er america the united states saw growth of twenty six percent which created eighteen and half million jobs in their free enterprise economy
the european community on the other hand also saw a growth of output of over twenty percent twenty three point seven percent but that gave rise not to eighteen million but to only six million additional jobs and i just say to the honourable gentleman the lesson for europe is to go further down the route that i have suggested of further deregulation and less bureaucracy and a stable economic framework than to go down the route that he is advocating in his short address and question to me
i believe the way ahead lies with more free enterprise
sir peter UNK
er would my would my right honourable friend confirm that in the united states there are no government training schemes of any kind
is it not extraordinary therefore that in the united states where there is the most rapid growth of technology and of productivity there are no government training schemes and does this not make a nonsense of the UNK repeated claim that government training schemes are the way forward
what i w what i will say to my honourable my right honourable friend is that er when i recently visited the united states i did find that the on which our training and enterprise councils have been based have provided a very valuable experience for us in learning the lessons that he had indicated of ensuring that the private sector is fully involved in decisions over training and i believe that the figure i gave to my honourable friend early today combined with over two billion that my department spends on training forms a very effective public private sector partnership
sir john UNK
will the secretary of state make clear to the summit that after fourteen years of this government we have seen unemployment treble to three million unemployed
that we have three million full time employer UNK replaced by three million part time and self employed with the worst trained and education labour force of any attending the summit
will he also ask the americans how as he claims they've created eighteen million jobs with a minimum wage provision and also make clear how much britain is paying in family credit support to maintain low paid UNK wages by the tax payer in this country
still the honourable gentleman talks down britain
i think he has to i think he has to think very seriously before he starts to UNK the achievements of this nation
for instance i have given one which is in the last ten years we have nearly one and half million more people in work than we had ten years ago
that is a signal achievement
if i also say to him that the lesson we learn from the united states is not to go down the route that he and his party have signed up to in signing up to a socialist manifesto for the european elections
he is proposing which is the last thing you would find the united states statutory works councils statutory minimum wage compulsory working week it's about time he dropped those proposals which would cost millions of jobs
alan UNK
at the summit will my right honourable friend enquire about the progress in the employment of disabled people and the advantages to the american economy in consequence of the americans with disabilities act
will he accept that in the united states of america the land of free enterprise it was concluded that voluntary arrangements would never sufficiently overcome discrimination against employment and will he respond positively to the view of the employers forum on disability and the law society as well as three hundred and eleven honourable members of this house who have signed e d m number two that the time has now come for legislation to ban discrimination against in er disabled people in respect of employment in this country
well i know my honourable friend feels very strongly on this subject
what i would hope that we could achieve in this country is more through erm opportunities for disabled people greater opportunities for disabled people to gain access into work and as my honourable friend knows we have put forward some proposals we're presently considering the position following the representations that have been made to us after the er new access to work scheme was announced and i hope to make an announcement on that aspect shortly
but i just say to my honourable friend i don't think er UNK er is the route with that we should follow
i believe we must give increasing opportunities to disabled people to get into work
mr derek
number five ma'am er madam speaker examples include the introduction of it new integrated regional offices and the creation of a single regeneration budget from april the first of this year
er mr UNK
grateful to the minister for that reply but would he not agree with me that where local authorities erm local chambers of commerce and trades councils er and his own department of employment are already working well together with good small initiatives to put upon them english estates UNK british coal enterprise er is in fact to do precisely what he does not advocate to make a UNK of bureaucracy and will he not undertake to evaluate these initiative to see if they really do work or whether they're just providing jobs for the boys
er madam speaker i agree with er the honourable gentleman that it's extremely important that the various agencies do play a part in working together to ensure effective action with minimum bureaucracy and i know that the honourable gentleman has been anxious to ensure that happens in his own constituency and his own area where he is dealing with the problems of high unemployment er and the fall out from the closures of pits in his area and if the honourable gentleman has any specific er measures which he would like us to look at then i'd be very happy to consider those
philip UNK
er but is my honourable aware that employment prospects in UNK valley were UNK by pit closures mainly in the nineteen seventies but that now the area but that now the area has some of the lowest unemployment in europe certainly lower than in germany and the reason is mainly due to the success of new manufacturing businesses
doesn't this doesn't this illustrate that the best way to create sustainable jobs in the long term is not UNK old industries but by allowing better conditions for enterprise better labour relations in themselves to attract new jobs to the area
hear
madam speaker i entirely agree with er my honourable friend
the way to secure future prosperity is by UNK change not UNK it and as my honourable friend er indicates by using our skills to best effect and UNK in a global market place were we to UNK the policies of members opposite in the european community we would shut the job the door to the jobs which will come from that inward investment because we have opted out of the social chapter we do indeed have the opportunity that comes from being if i may qui may quote er president UNK a pa a UNK for inward investment
mr kevin UNK
could i say to the minister and bring him back to the real world about regeneration
the government are about to announce er at UNK in UNK a three point seven five million pounds project which i a actually support er made by english estates that project is estimated to create a hundred and seventy five jobs
last year out of the two thousand nine hundred and thirty nine that were lost in the UNK borough from coal engineering and steel there were two hundred and sixty jobs lost at UNK steel plant in november
this year seventy five jobs lost at last week and there's four hundred job losses that are currently being UNK negotiated in united engineering UNK in sheffield and UNK
that regeneration project is a UNK on a UNK back into the jobs that have been lost in that area at the moment
when are we going to meet the needs of those areas for jobs and not have these things where we're getting less than twenty percent job replacement through g regeneration
well madam speaker we'll start making progress when members opposite realise that jobs come from companies being competitive from private enterprise being able to sell goods and services UNK and it is members opposite who believe that the state can provide employment on this of the house we believe that government agencies can assist the market to operate effectively and real jobs will come from free enterprise which members opposite stand against
madam speaker i wonder if the minister is aware that in the economically declining fishing port of UNK in south devon the second largest fishing port in the west country that the employment service agency want to build a new building on a prime site in the centre of UNK in order to put both the UNK office and the job creation office in the same building and they're prepared to pay over the odds with government money and push out private enterprise who want to build that site
isn't it a far better use of public money to create training and job creation rather than to buy a prime site with public money
er madam speaker i'm very much aware of the case that the my honourable friend has er mentioned because he has written to me er about it and i have looked into the circumstances er of it and i understand that the employment service have made no final decision on that particular site and i'd be happy to respond to my honourable friend er once i've had a chance to discuss it further with the chief executive of the employment service whose responsibility it is but if i could just say to my honourable friend the principle of integrating er the work of the job centre and the payment of benefits on one site is a good one which is for the convenience of er people who make use of the job centres er and er as er the honourable er gentleman the member for UNK is indicating from a UNK position was a recommendation which was supported by the public accounts er committee and i believe and i believe that it er makes sense to proceed on a value for money basis with this policy but i will certainly look at the particular example in my honourable UNK constituency with interest
kate
number seven
er there is of course er no such tech
however if the honourable member is referring to her own tech which is called south thames tech then the department's regional director is currently negotiating the level of resources for ninety four five with the tech and of course also with other london UNK
kate
yes thank you i'd like to thank the minister for her reply some of us in south london will still call it the site of east london tech no matter what the minister wants to call it
but could i say to the minister that she will be aware that the south thames tech actually is the first tech to get involved in kids club network and that one of the very useful things that has happened in my constituency is the setting up the first kids after school club in UNK
would the minister like to say like to welcome that initiative but also to ensure that the money which the south thames tech are going to be able to put into that will be able to continue and not only continue in that one but to allow the increase of this after school provision so that those many women in my constituency and who the many women in south london who are unemployed will have the opportunity to get back to work and get back to training with that very necessary provision for child care
hear
can i say first of all to the honourable lady that yes of course i welcome er the particular initiatives er and indeed i have visited it as i think she will know er and i'm very pleased to congratulate all those concerned in setting it up
we have of course made it clear that those UNK who were UNK er the out of school UNK initiative er will continue er to be funded er along with all other UNK from ninety four five and although of course i cannot UNK the UNK judgement and take a view on that particular scheme er i can say that funding will continue for UNK for that purpose
mr ian taylor
would my honourable friend er recognise that just up the river thames from er the south thames tech is the UNK tech which is doing and excellent job with local industry in re UNK particularly younger people and this partnership with industry not just dependent on what the government does but what industry itself does to try and help people get back into jobs with the new challenges that are coming from the difficulties that are presented by higher UNK needed particularly for school UNK and other and will he w would she welcome the UNK initiative
er yes i have pleasure indeed in UNK er in welcoming the er UNK initiative er and indeed similar initiatives er in other UNK up and down the country
i'm delighted to welcome er the various initiatives that result from partnerships between industry and government er and in particular the investors in people which encourages training and UNK er on a life long basis and i have pleasure in UNK that is not confined to the private sector and that today UNK became the first civil service er body to receive the full award of investors in people
mr david UNK
number eight
the prime minister and i had such a meeting on the twentieth of december
er mr UNK
but is the secretary of state aware that the campaign against the ban on union membership at g c h q remains as strong as ever and will continue until victory is secured
there was no justification for the ban in the first place and is the secretary of state not concerned that the international labour organisation has expressed much concern over the continuing ban and it may well be that in view of the fact that the government is not willing to compromise in any way the i l o may well decide to formally UNK and UNK the government
if that is the case you'll be the first ever case of a western government being so UNK
madam speaker there are a number of points in that supplementary question let me deal first of all with on g c h q we've done exactly what the i l o requested us to do we've had er discussions with the civil service unions to see if a solution could be found
no one ever imagined for a moment that it would be easy to find a solution which would satisfy both sides but as far as the government is concerned the dialogue remains open
i'm confident that we have nothing to fear from an examination of our industrial relations policies er at the i l o we believe we can demonstrate that these UNK er policies comply with all the i l o UNK that we have UNK
michael UNK
would my right honourable friend confirm that the former director of g c h q sir brian UNK stated that during the UNK of UNK law in UNK and during the soviet UNK invasion of UNK some ten thousand hours of cover were lost at g c h q and will he not confirm that is a perfectly good reason for the ban on external er interference by trade unions in the activities of g c h q and will he also assure the house that the existing trade UNK the staff association works perfectly well and there is no reason whatever for an external trade union to interfere in g c h UNK affairs
well i can i can confirm what my honourable friend says
namely that between nineteen seventy nine and nineteen eighty one ten thousand working days were lost at g c h q and we just cannot run the risk of anything like that ever happening again
so far as my honourable friend er is concerned he is right erm and we indeed suggested that the staff federation should be UNK to the council of civil service trade unions to enable staff who belong to the federation to gain access to the facilities available to unions UNK to the c s u sadly the civil service unions did not feel able to accept this proposal
anne
but isn't it er true according the reports in the financial times that the government at this moment is planning to withdraw britain from the i l o precisely because the i l o has UNK britain a UNK that is normally a UNK that is normally applied to countries like UNK and north korea
isn't it a fact that this government is becoming isolated not only in europe but throughout the world for its anti worker and its anti union policies
there is no truth that er ministers intend to withdraw from the i l o or to seek an opportunity to do so and despite t u c criticism as i said earlier we believe that our policies comply with all the i l o UNK which we've UNK and as my honourable friends have pointed out our overriding objective is to ensure the maintenance of continuous operations at g c h q which is vital to the protection of national security
however the prime minister has made it clear that the government is ready to discuss any further proposals that the UNK union may wish to put forward that are consistent with our overriding objective of UNK national security
graham
speak
would my right honourable friend not agree that because of their irresponsible behaviour in UNK g c h UNK vital work in the early nineteen eighties the trade unions only have themselves to blame for this ban
hear
i couldn't agree more with my honourable friend
it is very important indeed to ensure that the staff of g c h q are not subject to potential conflicts of interest and as i said earlier the prime minister and i listened for some considerable time to the s to er to the points put forward by the trade unions to see whether or not that overriding er national objective could be maintained but we were not convinced we were not convinced that erm the trade unions could overcome those potential conflicts of interest and it UNK ill the party opposite to try and put a different UNK on the fact that we in this country thanks to our legislation have put harmony in place of UNK and we are not prepared to allow the opposition to put that major achievement at risk
no number nine madam speaker
figures from the labour force survey showed that in the banking finance insurance and business services in greater london the number in employment since nineteen eighty nine has risen by seven thousand
what message has the minister to give to the five hundred and five employees of UNK bank in london whose new year began with receipt of a redundancy notice at the very moment when the UNK new chief executive was having his pay doubled to seven hundred and thirty seven thousand pounds a year
what comment has the minister to make on this example of corporate UNK or does she like the prime minister believe it's no matter for her
is the matter for the honourable gentleman is giving his constituents hope what he appears completely unable to do
you will the house will note the house will note madam speaker that the phraseology of the honourable gentleman's original question was how many jobs have been lost in fact jobs had risen and he didn't even have the grace to welcome that
perhaps he would like
hear
to tell his constituents that with UNK share of world trade in financial services is increasing and is now at twenty seven percent that the financial services sector round the u k four point three billion that those employees that he refers to are in fact in an industry which even if it is UNK employment it's nevertheless growing
can i say to the honourable gentleman why doesn't he give encouragement to britain's performance in the financial services sector
why don't the whole lot of them
would my honourable friend is my honourable friend aware that employment in london and the south east has actually risen by over two hundred in the ten years from march nineteen eighty three and will she confirm that some of the hundred and fifty thousand places in the new apprenticeship scheme will be available in london
yes i have pleasure in UNK that and i also have pleasure in UNK that another good sign for young people apart from the creation of modern apprenticeships is also the way that the numbers waiting more than eight weeks for a y t place has now declined from over three thousand to just over three hundred
that there are now a large number of UNK in the country with no young people waiting modern apprenticeships are going to help that process even further and why aren't modern apprenticeships being welcomed
i take it that the honourable gentlemen are in fact UNK the government thank you very much
tony banks
is the is the minister is the minister aware that UNK have laid off or declared seven thousand redundancies
national westminster has announced four thousand redundancies and yet you still have to wait ages in the queue at the bank why is that
hear
perhaps the honourable member should do a UNK survey and go somewhere else for his queue i don't know but what i can tell the honourable gentleman is that even though there were losses in the banking industry for the last year there have been strongly UNK rises in insurance and business services
it's generally good news in the financial sector
that is the message which the honourable gentleman might be telling both those in the queue and the UNK
sir david
question number ten madam speaker number ten
ten
david UNK
er madam speaker er non wage costs never get into employees wage packets but do make it more expensive for employers to provide a job
on average for every one hundred pounds in wages an employer in britain must pay twenty pounds extra in germany thirty pounds and in france and italy forty pounds
mr UNK
does my honourable friend agree that one of the reasons this country is so successful at attracting inward investment is because of those lower non wage labour costs
does he also agree that the UNK of the social chapter which both parties opposite would like to force on this country would not only destroy our competitive advantage but more importantly would destroy jobs
hear
i entirely agree with er my honourable friend er not only er is the lower non wage cost a reason for inward investment being attracted to britain but it's also why together with our general economic policy why workers in britain enjoy in real terms some of the best take home pay packets in europe
alex carlisle
given the favourable non wage labour cost which the minister told us about a moment ago how does he justify the enormous discrepancy in wages between england and wales as an average and areas like south wales and northumberland where average weekly earnings are up to sixty five pounds less than the average and will he explain to us why the government is not tackling huge wage differentials in this country
well i have to say i'm amazed at the honourable gentleman asking that question
if he had his way and we signed up for the social chapter those extra costs would have to be met out of those pay packets and there'd be even less for people to take in wages so the honourable gentleman shouldn't be complaining about low pay when he wants to add to the costs of employment along with the rest of his party
michael UNK
does my honourable friend agree with UNK who is a supervisor with black and UNK in UNK in germany who when asked to comment as to why he felt that black and UNK were closing their plant in germany to move it to UNK in county durham said it's simple industry must be flexible the social chapter isn't
hear
er madam speaker i entirely agree with the UNK which have been expressed by black and UNK and i have to say to members opposite that when companies like UNK are starting to source outside of germany with companies like UNK are starting to look er outside europe and UNK and others alarm bells should be ringing for those members who are genuinely concerned about jobs because there is no doubt that the social chapter is driving people out of work and the longer that members opposite UNK to it er then the greater will be the er the possibility o of er people er in europe er UNK policies which will make those countries in europe less competitive and less able to provide employment
john UNK
can the UNK can the minister of state in view of his many visits to america say whether he agrees with the secretary of state's earlier statement that american does not have a minimum wage legislation
er i think er if the honourable gentleman checks the record he will find that my right honourable friend said that america did not have a national statutory minimum wage but i'm most i'm most grateful to the honourable gentleman for reminding us of the international UNK because he will know that the country in europe which has UNK his policy of a statutory minimum wage is spain and spain has twice the level of unemployment of the european average and twice the level in this country
anthony
in recognising the crucial importance of lower non wage costs in britain compared to europe
is my honourable friend aware of the fact that a german wheel maker has transferred all its heavy wheel making operations to my constituency
and also the carpet companies in my constituency are now going to germany to buy up their now redundant carpet making machinery precisely because german companies can't compete in the kind of regime that they are have imposed upon them
er i i'm most er grateful to my honourable friend for giving yet another example of how the social chapter has UNK jobs out of the eleven into britain
that's good news for britain as long as we ensure that we never ever sign up to the social chapter with its job destroying er job destroying characteristics
michael
number eleven madam speaker
madam speaker
the full range of modern apprenticeships will be offered to sixteen and seventeen year olds in september nineteen ninety five and there will be some UNK
starting at the er later this year
i note the minister didn't give er the numbers of apprenticeships and there's possibly a reason for that
the minister will be aware that in the last year of the labour government there was an hundred and fifty thousand apprenticeships in manufacturing alone whilst in manufacturing in nineteen ninety one there was only fifty one thousand apprenticeships
clearly the minister's response is inefficient it's quite inadequate and what is required is a much more positive stance from the minister and can the minister tell us whether or not he will be he will be giving the opportunity to mature UNK to the apprenticeship scheme so that people that have been thrown on the scrap heap over this last fifteen years will have an opportunity and can he tell us whether or not he's had discussions with british coal enterprise to allow miners that have been made redundant to come into the new apprenticeship scheme so that they will have new skills which will help them to get new jobs
hear
the honourable gentleman knows that the new modern apprenticeship scheme that the chancellor of the exchequer announced on the thirtieth of november is of course designed to encourage more young people to train up to n v q level three and to encourage even more young people to train to even higher levels
of course during the er during the course of this year we will be considering UNK which will enable those young people to reach that high level of qualification but he will be aware that under the national training and education target there are some of those targets which are directly related to the points that he has raised and the important priority for this government is to ensure not only that we have young people training to an even higher level but through programmes like investors in people that we encourage every member of the work force and those er who are primarily unemployed at the present time to train to even higher levels of qualifications
questions to the prime minister er mr the reverend martin smith
number one madam speaker
i've been asked to reply my right honourable friend the prime minister is in moscow for a series of meetings including meetings with president yeltsin and prime minister
reverend martin smith
madam speaker has the lord president of the council noticed the response of mr UNK and to miss mary UNK question what representations has he had been made to united states over gerry UNK visit
the response was that we do not get involved in trying i in to get foreign UNK to try to tell them what decisions they should make
would he ask his right honourable friend to press the prime minister to exercise the same restraint over the united kingdom particularly northern ireland
well as the honourable gentleman will know the issue over UNK was of course a decision for the u s authorities though our own advice as the house knows er was clear
so far as the main thrust of the honourable gentleman's question is concerned er he will know that we believe it to be right and indeed in the interests of all the people in northern ireland that the british and irish government should work closely together
as he knows the talks process brings together the two governments and the main constitutional parties in working together to find an accommodation and i think that is right
mr stephen
er would my right honourable friend agree with me that the appearance of jerry adams on the UNK programme proved beyond any doubt that whatever UNK say UNK have rejected the er UNK street declaration
would he not join me in urging UNK to UNK their position on this and would he also agree with me and confirm to this house that this government will never do what mr adams requests and that is become a UNK of the people of northern ireland to join a united ireland and will he will he recognise from me that many on these benches remain committed to the union of northern ireland and great britain
my honourable friend will know that my right honourable friend has me on may occasions made clear the british government's position in relation to the question of persuasion
as to the rest of his question then of course i and i suspect and perhaps i know that everybody in the house would urge UNK er to consider very seriously a positive response to the joint declaration
mrs margaret UNK
as ministers are still UNK that back to basics is the UNK star UNK government policy while the prime minister's UNK all questions about it
doesn't this show yet again that back to basics is making this government a laughing stock
hear
my er the right UNK the right honourable lady i'm er i don't know whether i'm sorry to say or not it's a bit out of date my right honourable friend has just today given a clear explanation of the back to basics theme
and he has er and he has once again once again made it clear he has once again made it clear that is particularly important in such areas as standards in education law and order and the provision of public services
and it applies also to the range of our increasingly successful economic and business policies
mrs UNK
i notice that yet again the lord president's list and presumably the prime ministers doesn't include the standard of telling the truth about tax
hear
why is the government why is the government refusing to come clean about the size of the further tax increases that british families will face in nineteen ninety five
madam speaker what er i and my right honourable friend will go on UNK is the contribution which our tax policies are making to the economic strength and the improved standards of living of this country
mrs UNK
but as the lord president must be aware my honourable friend the shadow chief secretary has questions UNK to this government about the extra taxes people will pay in nineteen ninety five to which an answer is not being provided
the government must have the figures we know the government has the figures and the people of britain will have to pay that extra tax so why haven't they got the UNK to tell them how much they'll have to pay
my right honourable and honourable friends have answered many questions and will continue to answer the questions that the honourable the right honourable lady's friends ask
but what we want to know from the right honourable lady what we want to know from the right honourable lady is when they will come clean about the public spending policies that will put taxes in this country up
hear
michael UNK
is my is my right honourable friend aware that yesterday the chairman of the board of inland revenue told the private accounts committee that some five hundred and fifty million pounds of UNK tax still remains to be picked up by tax payers who've been affected by the er the change in the tax regime in the last couple of years where for example women are now assessed independently
is he further aware that amounts to about eight hundred and eighty thousand pounds per parliamentary constituency
will the government do everything possible to ensure that the inland revenue makes this widely known to every tax payer in the country
the government and i'm sure that er the inland revenue are always anxious to make sure that tax payers are properly informed of their rights er and receive their correct entitlement and i have no doubt that every effort will be made to achieve what my honourable friend seeks
gary UNK jones
number two madam speaker
i refer the honourable gentleman to the reply i gave some moments ago
mr UNK jones
madam speaker in view of the fact that the real value of pensions has gone down for many years now following the break
following the break following the break following the break with the link with earnings and the fact that value of pensions in the u k is out of line with virtually every other comparable european country an in view of the fact and in view of the fact that the
compensation package for v a t for pensioners will not compensate them in full as was promised and in view of the fact that we've had extremely cold weather for the last week
will the government now introduce a special heating allowance for pensions
hear
madam speaker i r the er honourable gentleman must have a rather er curious source for his statistics because what has actually happened is not merely that the government have protected the real value of the state retirement pension but the combination of our policies both in social security in the pensions field and in the economic world have led to a position in which pensioners average real incomes have risen more than forty percent since this government took office
lady
number three madam speaker
hear
i refer my honourable friends to the reply i gave some moments ago
honourable friends join me in UNK the non sensible advice given by liberty to UNK school children that they should UNK police and isn't it absolutely typical that the party opposite tend to support them
hear
i would certainly join my honourable friend in UNK the advice which has been reported in the paper today er the government's efforts to improve the campaign against UNK and the to succeed in getting UNK pupils back to school which is where they should be i believe is and should be widely supported
for liberty to be opposing it in the way that they are shows that they don't UNK understand the best interests of our children or our schools
mr UNK
er would the leader of the house then express his concern that at the end of the march when the tory party conference comes to plymouth there's a hundred and thirty five children are going to miss a day and a half of their schooling because of that conference
i do not suppose they will be playing UNK
mr john
number four madam speaker
i refer my honourable friend to the reply i gave some moments ago
mr UNK
has my right honourable friend had time to study the recent annual survey of grant maintained schools which shows that since becoming grant maintained schools have been able to recruit more teachers improve their results and offer better facilities for their pupils
does he not therefore find it extraordinary that the labour and liberal parties remain committed to the abolition of grant maintained schools and that in local government they are UNK a UNK campaign against g m schools as UNK by the behaviour of essex county council
hear
my honourable friend is certainly right that the latest survey UNK the benefit of grant maintained status
those schools are achieving improved academic results better staying on rates and lower pupil teacher ratios
they are popular with parents and it's no surprise that well over a thousand schools have voted in favour of such status
as to my honourable UNK concerns about essex and of course his constituency borders mine
he will be as pleased as i to know that in essex there are now sixty three secondary and fifty five primary schools operating with grant maintained status
that represents sixty percent of secondary schools and seventeen percent of primary schools and despite the er endeavour to which he refers of essex county council i can tell him that the latest school to decide to hold a ballot on such status is UNK high school UNK
mr brian UNK
number six madam speaker
i refer the honourable gentleman to the reply i gave some moments ago
brian UNK
madam speaker when my constituents complain about high fuel bills and watch the bosses of UNK utilities UNK money am i to say to them that as far as the prime me minister is concerned it's nothing to do with him
hear
the er honourable gentleman's question appears to be founded on a rather curious premise er what has what has happened what has happened to electricity prices is that have fallen six percent in real terms over the last two financial years and if he wants to know another interesting statistics i can tell him
that in nineteen seventy nine the electricity companies then UNK lost the equivalent in today's prices of four hundred and sixty five million pounds
in nineteen ninety two ninety three they paid four hundred and twenty million pounds to the exchequer in corporation tax
hear
mr john
would my right would my right honourable friend agree that the use of american and french and british planes to bomb the hills around UNK may not necessarily produce lasting peace in bosnia and would he further agree that if the idea is to achieve a UNK zone UNK effectively around UNK then the best chances of so doing are by ensuring that russian soldier in united nations UNK in integrated units with british and french forces so help in the policing of that zone
UNK madam speaker my honourable friend knows well that the purpose er of what has been said and what is being considered about air strikes er is to is to bring about er the er UNK of the sort of UNK that we have seen in UNK and i think everybody will want to see that effort successfully er completed
mr george
number seven madam speaker
hear
i refer the honourable gentleman to the reply i gave some moments ago
will the leader of the house confirm that the government is UNK today by means of written answer an increase of fifty pence in the prescription charges
why is there no oral statement in this house
is it is it because having taxed the disabled and taxed the divorce the government are UNK afraid to face to the music and make an announcement that they are increasing tax on the sick
it er first of all i can confirm that an announcement is being made today er secondly i can confirm that it is not usual for such announcements to be made by way of oral statement
thirdly i can tell him that eighty percent of prescribed items are now free of charge compared with sixty percent in nineteen seventy nine
UNK i can tell him that prescription charges will raise nearly three hundred million pounds in the forthcoming year
UNK i can tell him that will pay for over two hundred thousand UNK operations or over seventy thousand hip operations and UNK i will ask him to tell me where he would find the money
nigel evans
number eight madam speaker
i refer my honourable friend to the reply i gave some moments ago
mr evans
has my right honourable friend had an opportunity to see the report from three i s investors in industry in which they have UNK five hundred of the companies in which they invest and the confidence factor of those businesses is higher now than it's ever been since they started the surveys in nineteen eighty eight
isn't this further evidence that this government has the right policies for british business and the british people
my honourable friend is absolutely right
this survey shows that firms in both the north and south of the country report greater improvement than in the previous survey and have become more optimistic about their own prospects
the fact is that the whole of british business in now increasingly confident about the economy and about this government's policies for business
time's up
mr UNK
point of order madam speaker i seek your ruling on the fact that the secretary of state for health has declined to make a statement to the house on the increase of fifty p in prescription charges
but that the leader of the house effectively made a statement in prime minister's questions on the same issue misleading the house into believing that the government were actually applying this money to patient care rather than to meeting their own political incompetence
isn't it a disgrace madam speaker that the government should duck the opportunity to make a clear statement on a sixty on an increase which is the sixteenth since they made the promise in nineteen seventy nine that they would not increase prescription charges
ministers of course always determine for themselves whether they answer by means of a written question or whether they come to the despatch box and make a statement
this is something over which i as speaker have no control whatsoever
yes mrs UNK mrs UNK
er madam speaker i'm seriously concerned about a minister misleading the house and i seek your general guidance on a matter
last night on the world in action programme the minister for health the member for peterborough UNK denied that there was no two tier system and he said i have no evidence of a two tier system developing in the n h s
very anxious to promote the wales in europe scheme because it's been very important to us including the links that er we have been able to build up with other regions of europe in UNK and UNK above all er which our sort of strong erm er neighbours which can teach us a lot about industry and these are the areas that we will want to link up with by having this extra seat in the european parliament er and obviously i mean there are sorts of areas where we have some sympathy with the occasional point that is made by the anti europe speakers on the other side
there ar there is er an excessive UNK of european bodies with the european parliament and now the new committee of the regions and then you also have the economic and social committee
in the end something's gotta be done to sort out that excessive UNK
but we er are welcoming the fact that there is a recognition of the rising population of wales er in giving us this er this additional seat er primarily the additional population has not come in industrial south wales which er which er people think of perhaps as the most typically welsh area it's actually in two counties of UNK and UNK that are erm growing most rapidly because of lifestyle migration retirement migration erm into those two areas and that is why the additional seat if you can put it that way er takes from all the other four of course is the mid and west wales seat which has been compared by the honourable member for cornwall er tonight and it has only got a population of four hundred and one thousand but on the other hand of course it is such an extensive seat because the population UNK in that area is much worse than even in cornwall and therefore it is going to stretch from south of UNK to the UNK area really within probably twenty miles of the north wales coast it's a who it's the whole of two counties plus one additional very badly UNK constituency erm in the county of UNK an awkward constituency but one that we are certainly looking forward fighting and winning to give us the five out of five er now that er the boundaries are going through tonight and obviously it's all in line really er to look at the other the third order of course the question of the registration of overseas voters in the nineteen ninety two election overseas voters had their first opportunity to participate in westminster elections
the conservatives in wales have actually taken this principal much further they don't only allow overseas voters to participate in welsh elections they actually encourage them to become UNK of our UNK as well as we've got david UNK chairman of conservatives abroad in UNK i if the panel out
about UNK whatsoever i want to something about the boundaries of the european parliament
mr morgan
er i mean the er it's er course there are three orders that we are looking at tonight it includes the er the third order er in relation not to boundaries but to the registration of overseas er voters to enable them to vote er in this in this er election within u k constituencies and therefore that's why the position that mr david UNK as the chairman of conservatives abroad er in UNK is relevant er but also UNK because of course the purpose of the european parliament for the first time as it will go through under these new boundaries now is that they will be able to UNK some of that democratic deficit
they will be able to have a voice in choosing the chairman of the european commission which is like a euro quango in a way so i do see a parallel which i want to put to you that we are UNK the democratic deficit in europe with that giant euro quango in the same way that we would like to UNK the democratic deficit with respect to the UNK of UNK in wales
a all very interesting indeed but for le let's now talk about the boundaries in the open business
mr UNK morgan
right
the other point that i
order
i think we've had quite sufficient of that let's get back to the european boundaries mr UNK morgan
sir i it was a terrible brief point about UNK in UNK riding boots and UNK jacket but all the point that i was going to make that i've heard about riding UNK over europe but mr deputy speaker this is ridiculous i the er the honourable
the honourable gentleman trying my patience now please get back to the boundaries of the
point of order mr bill cash
mr deputy speaker er i you will have observed that the two front benches have spoken at incredible length and you have had to UNK them or certainly the opposition for er going away from the subject matter and do you not er believe that it would have been far better to allow some back UNK to get
hear
i have no control over the length of speeches but i am perfectly able to control the debate
mr UNK morgan
i i'm grateful i i'm winding up that we on this side we do believe that these additional six seats are very important because we believe that the european parliament elections are going to be very important and fighting them on these new boundaries with the minimum of delay in spite of the delay that had been caused by the UNK incompetence we regard as very important we regard this debate tonight as very important to approve these orders because we cannot so far work out whether the government will be fighting the er the whole campaign on the basis of back to basics while the e p will be doing it on the basis of some other manifesto UNK or whatever it might be and they'll be trying to merge those into two UNK of o of er UNK basics or whatever it might be and this we do not know at all whether the government want to be part of europe and whether their back UNK are gonna be willing to cooperate with the european peoples party or they take the money from the european peoples party but they don't want to participate with them in the manifesto
on this side we have an agreement in fighting the eighty seven seats and it certainly in terms of wales we are going to win all five of them
hear
sir peter UNK
erm mr deputy speaker i'm sorry my honourable friends have not been able to get into this debate as i would have like to have heard them
i myself am going to take only a very few minutes that are left to me to comment on some of the points that were raised in the debate
erm could i could i first of all start with some of the remarks made by the honourable member for nottingham north
i was grateful to him for his tribute to the members of the two boundary committees they did do an excellent job they did it as he implied slightly less un UNK to the government er in a considerably shorter time than they and we would have liked but they did it very well and they did it very fairly
er we have been in er organising these new seats about the same time as the labour government took in nineteen seventy eight er i said that when i intervened upon him and i say it again it's worth paying on the records exactly the same pressures have been on us as were as on them
but of course er the timetable er for the constituency changes er now and the problems that we're facing are nothing to do with er any action in the UNK of the government here it is because france has yet to UNK one hopes they will
on the regulations about candidates and voters er from e c countries of course erm er that is a complicated er set of regulations
the er directive of december nineteen ninety three did have details that we were not expecting and looking for so there was a great deal of new work to take on board
er the honourable gentleman wondered whether we would ever have a UNK view again certainly not under the ninety three legislation because that was a once off as a careful reading of the act will show er but er we will erm and his honourable friend the member for perry UNK hoped er that er we would have no more reviews of european boundaries i know because he was talking at p r but we will certainly have one new review of er euro constituency boundaries because as soon as the parliamentary boundaries are completed er we will have to go into a new review on that basis of all the european seats and of course the full enquiries will be held in the normal way for them
i give way to the honourable gentleman
briefly i thank the minister for giving way
if the french do not UNK these proposals as may appear likely now er how late can the minister leave it before he UNK the people that they must fight the european elections on the old boundaries and not the new
i i've already said that i don't accept that er the french are unlikely to UNK er i think rather the contrary but that remains finally for them er and not for me
obviously i think the er the final time comes some time in april otherwise i think there would be and i use the term again too much inconvenience massive inconvenience for those fighting the election here er
would my honourable friend give way brief very brief
yes
i'm most grateful erm would he take the opportunity to UNK the comments made by the honourable member for perry UNK that we will not have erm an UNK voting system UNK upon this country forced upon this country as he said erm by the institutions of the european community
can i reiterate what he actually said in a meeting with UNK er UNK er last year er he said i do y the honourable my honourable friend said i do not see that UNK means adopting a system of proportional representation and i've yet to see a good case as to the merits of different states adopting the same procedure
we will continue to UNK any proposals that do not match our culture in this country
er what the honourable gentleman my honourable friend reads out is certainly my view er we will erm of course engage in any discussions on this subject that come up i in the council of ministers but it would take quite a lot of convincing i think to myself and my colleagues that any other form of election would be an improvement on first past the post erm and er the ar no i won't give way cos i have about four minutes left and er i do want to make a couple of other points
if there is any time left the honourable gentleman shall have it erm the honourable gentleman the member for nottingham north did say that he d wasn't looking to proportional representation for these elections i think he was absolutely right i hope that piece of good sense which he displayed then will be one that wi he will invest his thoughts in when it comes we come back to these questions later
i'm sorry my honourable friend the member for south UNK was unable to make all the points that he wanted to do as i would have been interested to hear them
but can i refer to the honourable member for UNK er again he talked about p r he thought that it would somehow if we move that the there for this election it would save some time
it most certainly wouldn't
which system we would have to decide who draws up the list er would the list be a u k one a regional one or would it be one in the separate countries that go to make up the u k a huge amount of discussion there not a chance missed at all er he wanted a separate seat for cornwall
well so many other counties would like a UNK a seat which is UNK with them i know norfolk would but the rule is that constituencies should have as far as possible equal numbers of UNK
the er commission the committees were able to take in special UNK considerations er but er they don't actually apply to cornwall
the problem with cornwall being a seat on its own is that its population is too small
there was no brief given to the committee a he suggested all the criteria that they should take into account were ones that were included in the act
the UNK and islands which he referred to er is er a different matter because their UNK considerations which don't apply to cornwall do apply
er my honourable friend the member for UNK he talked about p r i've mentioned that so he will excuse me if i don't go over his remarks
the honourable member for perry barn i've again referred to what part of what he said er but UNK i have considerable amount of sympathy with the remarks that he made
it's not something that i can deal with in these orders er i'm afraid that er there was a decision within the community which was then er made part of the nineteen seventy six e c direct elections act
there is no way that we can change those without the agreement of all the other members of the community er but i know that it's something that er my colleagues at the foreign office are extremely concerned with
i UNK with what the honourable gentleman says and certainly the feelings that are bi er of the er erm citizens of UNK
my honourable friend the member for southend east says does all this matter
well in the sense that i suppose whether it matters whether there are six hundred and fifty one members of the house rather six hundred and forty or six hundred and fifty five no it doesn't
but what the change does do is to reflect rather more accurately than the previous arrangements the various sizes of the UNK in the european countries and that is the logic and the sense behind it
he asks have i been in touch with the french government
no but i'm UNK that he's he seems to be implying that my doing so might help but that is a matter that er doesn't lie with the home office and i really aren't able to intervene
he wants to know what the job of a euro mp is well he is applying for a euro seat i do wish him the best of luck and when he's been there
hear
when he's been there a little while perhaps he can come with all the authority of a euro mp and tell us the answer to his own question er the honourable member for ashfield er referred back to the UNK of the european parliament er where it should meet there are three sites
er the position of the british government is this that it UNK er the inconvenience and the expense er it would like to see a very sensible resolution but it knows that there will only be a resolution as i know the honourable gentleman knows by UNK and it does not expect to see that UNK in the future though it will work for it
finally if i can refer to the honourable member for cardiff west who wound up
er i'm glad that he's pleased that wales got an extra seat it has got an extra
unclear the question is an a motion one
the question as on the order paper say aye
aye
the no
no
clear the UNK
okay so it's more of a long term
a long term solution
benefit
yeah
so and our company tends to look at things more on the short term
any other reasons for not training
time factor
time
you may not have the support of people around you because
saying you've gotta train somebody on the list for instance you've got to have a specialist to come in and do that so it's not something you do yourself
necessarily be able to meet your requirement
so it's not always having the resources
yeah
when you need it
i think as well though often say one thing don't they like they spend all this money on training
mm
and they have all these like really good ideas head office and area office and everything like it counts for very little unless you've got the support of the
yeah
and all too often erm people are taking off departments to do training but then it's the same old thing of well it's the needs of the business
mm
and you've got to get back down on the shop do it
mm
so you know there's no point in having all these systems set up if you haven't got the support at the branch level for it
no
no i agree totally
erm
there is coming out with the same old thing again
one thing about leadership through team work is that it puts a much greater emphasis on training for the purposes of delegation and the word that they use to describe that piece is UNK
it's just that you see so much of it not just like staff like training managers and everything they're told to stick up and stick up for their training and at the end of the day it's oh well it's the needs of the business and all that but UNK the company this
x amount of money to be a trainee
mm
and then they can expect them at the end of like x amount of time to be able to take over a department then when it falls apart they're gonna be the one to take it
so it comes back to the short erm thing again
yeah
and the short term goal
i think with the trainee managers being particular a new system of coming in whereby it will be it will be more difficult to abuse trainee managers
but how
because they're going to have to at the end of their period of whether it's a year or eighteen months they will hopefully be qualified for a national UNK qualification level three and in order to gain that they have to be assessed constantly throughout their eighteen months there's no kind of
that's still not gonna that's still not gonna take us away from you know sorry there's nobody on produce today you're gonna sorry training is out of the window today and maybe the department manager on produce i dunno goes sick or something and he has to take over there for two or three weeks and it's well don't worry you know you'll get back on to the training
yes
when steve comes back
i dunno maybe i'm just cynical
national UNK i really think that it's worse because they've not whereas when i was a trainee you had your six weeks on produce your six weeks on whatever in the branch of that now and they didn't have that they haven't got any training plan so they've got nothing to say well career branch need here and i need to be here and i need to be here
and they're just left to get on to these fifteen projects whenever
they should have been supplied with the programme by the area office
well they've told me they've got to go a tutor it's another branch manager at a different branch
they've got to what
have a tutor and they've
he works out the
wh wi what should be happening is that each trainee manager within each branch has an UNK within the branch who will be one of the deputy managers they also have a UNK within the branch
erm and eventually all the depart all of the training UNK
so be held to go to another branch
they shouldn't be
i think the difficulty at the moment because with that it's a trial only a certain amount of people have been trained in those roles and trainees are moved around a lot
pardon
reception
at the end of the day that trainee will not get his n v q and what's going to happen is that branch managers be UNK if that happens
will they be UNK
yeah that's true but how are they gonna be UNK
in their appraisals
because it's a national thing i mean it's something the company is hoping to go forward with the time it's a government initiative if we are offering trainee managers when they join us an n v q and they don't get it at the end of their training
one we're gonna have problems retaining staff and two we're not meeting erm
i mean can they UNK them
no you won't i mean there won't be criminal prosecution or anything like that
but erm you know they'll get a lot of trouble and there's a register there's a natural register of UNK and if an UNK is not seen to be doing his job he'll get struck off basically and that will cause major problems then
so w what are they going to do branch managers just slap his UNK in his appraisal and then
more or less
well as i said earlier today
appraisals are being changed are being UNK basically so that yourself and branch managers are much more accountable for training development
yeah but what's going to happen to the branch manager
nothing
what sanctions are gonna be taken
exactly i mean what are they gonna do
well
for a year or something
i would have thought the threat that you're not going to get on because you've had a crap appraisal would be fairly significant and i think that most branch managers
is one trainee manager important enough to affect his whole appraisal
no it's not it's not
it's not going to be the trainee manager it's not gonna just be the trainee it's going to be everybody all of the management team within the branch
becomes a m much major more major part of his appraisal then i mean branch managers tend to be fairly ambitious people they're not going to want to be let down on that i don't think
anyway that's something to speculate on
any other reasons for not showing do you think
some people don't train other people to do their jobs because they want to keep their jobs for themselves otherwise they start to lose their control
alright so fear of loss of control
do you think that's justified
no bad reason not training
yes
so i think you know the more you train people that really gives you greater power doesn't it
also what about the fear that somebody's gonna not gonna do it as well as you
anybody come across that
yeah andrew
yes
sometimes give it away and say right i'll teach you how to do this when they keep coming back and saying what wh you're running out of time and you think give it you can it's quite common
it goes back to the short term thing you fear that they don't do it as well
i remember when i was a trainee manager erm i was never allowed to do the ever
i practically never looked at the
basically because the produce manager who was training me was so scared of me making a cock up he never left my side when i was
i've got a trainee manager at the moment and i've been trying to he's just making such a balls up it's easier not to
that's how you feel anyway
yeah
but UNK nobody's ever gonna w learn anything are they
months
this to a and you're totally in charge of it you won't really get to grips and get
i can see your point
lovely
i see you then
yeah
at the end
yeah but at the end of the day how's that person gonna learn
i mean
sitting there and watching me
yeah i mean sitting there together possibly
yeah
for a greater length of time
and having a go services
just say no you're doing that i'm doing it
most times keep UNK all the time
mm
are a bit sort of
right now we a lot more problem
mm
it's a risk basically
yeah
training people is a risk
at the end of the day
yeah
when i was a trainee my deputy fresh foods went it with me and like he'd sit there and he'd say right this is how you do it at first and then he'd let me do some and well i'd do them and he'd say why have you done that and i'd tell him and then he'd let me do it
mm
and check it afterwards
mm
and that worked really well
so that's one way you think that people learnt how else do you think people benefit from learning
well phrase that one
by mistakes
how do how do people learn
by their mistakes
by making mistakes by somebody sitting down and explaining things to them
showing you physically how to do it to
sitting with that's what they call it isn't it
then showing them the results of what they've actually done
mm yeah okay
so it's a very much a two way communication spending time with them
that explanation comes into it a great deal really
erm can i have a volunteer please
not gonna set fire to you
okay
right alex i have something i needed to tell you
i am in fact not from retail training
i am an UNK from the planet UNK okay
and i need you to tell me how to light a match
i'm an UNK remember
can you understand it
can you understand my language
i speak plain english
right take that box put in flat in your hand
you are not allowed to touch me or the box
quite easy
take your two fingers like that no the other hand
box difficult
carry on
pick it up
with your hand
put it in the palm of your hand
two fingers this hand gently
hold the box
hold the box
step in the box
s strike it on the edge
on the edge on the top
do the other end the match
turn the match round right do it again
thank you
again
right thank you very much
sorry for giving you a hard time there
okay what did we learn from that
i can speak UNK
yeah apart from the fact that th about that
what did we learn from that
yeah
what did alex assume with me there
that you understood
that you understood
yeah that i understood
what i wanted you to do straight away
the actions
so we talked about the edge
we talked about pick it up
you assumed i would know to pick it up to like that and i grabbed it like that
okay has anybody ever assumed things with people that they've been training
what have you assumed wrongly
that they would pick up things as quickly or as quick as you have picked them up
yeah
that they learn like you do
that they would they would UNK you so if you think to er you were trained on something you think well we should know that because i knew that
i mean that's probably a big mistake we all make
right so UNK in different ways don't they
yeah
people have got different levels different speeds if you like
what else
the jargon when somebody's new you presume they know the word UNK
yeah
another example of that when a colleague of mine joined as a trainee manager she was being shown round the branch by the section and as they went they were walking along she said oh this is the room and UNK thought what's it a UNK and she said that's racking and UNK said what's the UNK racking
she said it's where we keep the b line UNK
which didn't help very much
i mean did anybody similar experiences
yeah
when you join the company there's so many j s words i mean you just you just i mean half of it goes over your head i mean it's get that go get that out of the UNK room
where the hell is that
yeah
i think that's something we've got to be careful of
so it's jargon it's assuming people will pick things up as quickly as we have and it's not recognising that people have different interpretations
i'm going ask you to do an exercise now and split you into groups of three
if you just sit stay where you are thank you
table you three
one of you in each group who put your hand up if you're good at making a paper aeroplane
one person in each group
one person in each group
right your training
you're the trainers
we also need one person in each group who's crap at making paper UNK
alright
the other person is going to be the observer
right
now
you've got fifteen minutes in which the trainer has got to teach the person who's making paper UNK how to make them alright and tell them
i want the observer to note the training methods used what basically went on and at the end of the day i will see the person who's been in training make a paper aeroplane and i will judge these on two UNK
firstly on how far it flies and secondly on its UNK value
first can i just ask as somebody who's building a paper aeroplane you got assumption whatsoever so am i supposed to say i don't know the first thing about making a paper aeroplane you told me
that's something you have to explore for yourself
right
so if you just use one sheet of a four does
you can go out on the landing if you want to
training method you could use is er
yeah you can go out in the hall or go in the UNK room
fold it down
yes
do the same thing again
like that
yes
yeah
okay right
like that yeah
well actually we're gonna
that's not very nice is it
do it on my own
i've gotta try
excellent
beautiful
take it away
are you waiting for this
no we've got you've got until twenty five past
i think we're all ready
if you're all ready go and get the other group
oh t tony down there
UNK
yeah i know
would have gone first
group one
have we got to make one in front of you
no you don't have to make one using your aeroplane your UNK erm would you like to come and have a test flight
okay who's the trainee
you are
right okay
thank you
group number two
erm okay erm thank you
this is a work of art this
thank you next one
UNK
okay well the one that went the UNK was
that one went further
okay well i think in UNK terms they're both awful
this one's a little bit of UNK
you've cracked it
i think it is going to have to be a draw
attractive but it didn't fly very far probably the aim of the game
the ones that flew are all designed with a serial number
the same i do believe
their UNK the same their UNK the same
just to finish then trainers who was the trainer from this group
he was
i was the trainee you were the trainer weren't you
no i was trainee you were teaching
you were teaching
who was teaching who
alex you were
the UNK what happened tell me what happened
the first thing explained exactly what the process was going to be
right
then he actually made a paper aeroplane so that she had an example in front of her that she can look at to see what she is aiming for
mm
erm and then what he did was he they went through it together and he showed her what to do and she followed him and as she did things right he UNK her and gave her feedback and said she'd done it correctly and then when there were things didn't understand she questioned him and then he clarified her
mm
it worked well
okay thank you
what about the rest
next observer
made an aeroplane very quickly first which i think was his big mistake because he then tried to explain to how to make it and kept wanting to touch her aeroplane
and you've basically i think the mistake you made basically was
he didn't make one at the same time as you know to actually show the UNK and that
to get both
exactly half way through to changing design so it was nothing like
okay
what about the next erm
to say
they made one together
yeah
and followed all the instructions and she wasn't sure she asked and then make one on her own and then
right thank you
next
we made one together one each in step by step so we showed 'em what to do and then if you weren't sure you asked or if he wasn't doing it right so they did it together technical erm situation
bit complicated
how about the next group next observer
yeah they did it together erm step by step erm it was okay she questioned if she didn't know what we were saying erm wasn't that specific but then she made one herself following his instructions
okay thank you and what about the last group
yeah that was good similar sort of thing really showing sort of thing by example
mm
made one at the same time together
mm
erm they just went through it like that and then he gave her instructions on how to fly it as well how to throw it
right
and erm practice at actually making it
okay so there's lots of showing somebody actually demonstrating how something is made then doing it together step by step and as you say follow up with going through the whole stage not just making the plane but actually demonstrating how it works
alright i mean you said there that people tended to ask questions if they didn't understand
did any of you actually say at the beginning if you have any questions while i'm going along please ask
no
mean you're all quite an UNK bunch here
yes
so you all took the initiative to ask questions as you go along without necessarily being invited to
some people won't do that
some people would feel silly if they're asking questions
did that right i think that that's a good point to remember when you're training somebody
what are the general points from that
praise
praise
did praise you
he did when i wasn't acting thick
right
so he was making you feel as if you were getting somewhere
finally then
if i can just have your attention for a moment
there are various steps when you're training somebody they go through a number of steps
the first one is what we call unconscious incompetence
in that when somebody has just joined into the store for instance joins the company they don't know what they don't know
okay so that's unconscious incompetence
the next stage is when they get to conscious incompetence
okay so they know what's expected of them but they would without having had the practice or the experience
are still at an incompetent stage they still are unable to carry out the job
thirdly people reach a stage of what we conscious competence in that they're very aware of what they're doing and they're doing it correctly but they're still at that stage where they're fairly new and they're very conscious of what they're doing
lastly which is something we all reach eventually hopefully is what we call unconscious competence when you know how to do something so well that you do it un without thinking it's like driving
teaching somebody to drive when you've driven yourself for a number of years is really hard
thinking about the various stages you go through and then once you've reached the level of department managers at on a lot of issues you tend to be at this stage but it's important to remember that a number of your staff may be down here somewhere
what i'd like you to do just for the last ten minutes is to think of a member of staff you have who has a training need and think about how you will go about training them and the methods that you will use
okay to try and improve their performance
so if you could just you've got
if you could just jot down a few ideas that
can i use this trainee manager
yes erm one once you've done that if you could give in diaries for the day and then your time is your own
there are handouts at the back the ones on that side are the ones from this afternoon there are some if you want a result of the really good for train good handouts there so i would recommend you have a look
so there's the
because
if you have any
who were the winning group by the way
who won which group was the winning group
which group won the aeroplane
oh right who was the two groups then
you was it you
it's a bit out of order
so where's the black ones
have we got all of that one
paint brush pot
i'll see you tomorrow morning got to do a shift
yeah
right i'll the erm
systems developing in the n h s the programme went on to produce the evidence the minister
come on carry on carry on
the programme went on to produce such evidence including a two tier system for UNK treatment where patients were
hear
treated not
has the minister indicated madam speaker this is my point of order whether or not he UNK to come before the house to acknowledge the reality of the two tier system and to admit he has been misleading the house
order or order the honourable lady would not expect me to comment on something that has been on television er in something that i have no er i didn't even see last night it's up to the minister whether he wishes to come and make a statement it is really not at all a point of order for me
mr UNK
thank you
can you just confirm that it's never been the practice to have an oral statement in this house on er prescription charges neither under this conservative government nor indeed under the pre previous labour government who were always deeply embarrassed by increasing prescription charges
if the honourable gentleman looks at the official report tomorrow he will see that the h leader of the house has dealt with that point
yes mr UNK
speaker you are aware of course of the severe weather which affects most of the country and what i want to ask you madam speaker is simply this
in view of the UNK difficulties faced by so many elderly people on very low incomes is there any way this house this week can ask the minister to make a statement whether the cold weather payments could be made and all the red tape regulations removed because those payments are not made unless there are seven days of freezing weather and it does seem to me the welfare of your old should have first priority
hear
the honourable gentlemen is asking me for procedural advice across floor of the house which he knows that i do not volunteer
yes miss UNK
further to the first point of order is it an order for the press to hear about the proposed rise in prescription charges before this house and wouldn't it have not been better if the secretary of state to come and made a statement and we could have questioned her about it
i did deal with that matter er originally and i believe that the state the er answer to the question was available precisely at three thirty today
yes mr c was it mr UNK yes
madam speaker
i i've just received a fax of a letter sent to the leader of liverpool city council UNK er councillor harry UNK by the right honourable member for UNK in which he UNK him to join an organisation called team two thousand er and as part of this invitation he's invited to attend functions and UNK at westminster er at which cabinet m er ministers e cabinet members ministers members of parliament will be present
my point of order is it i is it er in order madam speaker for ministers of the crown to abuse an office like this by inviting people here for party fund raising purposes
er the er the fax in the first instance has been sent by a back bench member of this house who is not a minister but i may tell the honourable gentleman that i get all sorts of things from mail shots inviting me to all er manner of functions all of which find their way into the waste paper basket
erm
madam speaker arising out of question time today the leader of the house the leader of the house told the house that the prime minister has made a further statement on the back to basics policy now since this has er we are told er UNK the whole of government policy since the prime minister's speech to the party conference last october isn't it time er that the prime minister was asked not to give statements to UNK and at er press conferences but made a statement to this house about the back to basics policy and at the very least placed a copy of his speech and his UNK on the back to basics policy in the library
hear
prime minister is normally here a couple of times a week to answer questions maybe the honourable gentleman will catch my eye one time very soon he can put that to the prime minister himself
yes mr wilson
i on a point of order madam speaker i understand that a major announcement in connection with rail privatisation is being made at this moment by way of written answer and press conference erm the statement will reveal a huge increase in access charges for railway operators and ultimately therefore huge increases in costs for tax payers and passengers
madam speaker this announcement is now almost a year delayed the firm of UNK and UNK have been paid one point six million pounds to come up with this UNK access charging UNK surely this house in entitled to the as entitled as the press to a full statement of the government's intentions so that they can be answered by
o order the honourable gentleman will recall that er in an earlier point of order i've already ruled on that matter
it is for ministers to determine themselves whether they answer by means of a written question or whether they make an oral statement
that it is over something over which i have no control
i i've already made a ruling on that on that point
i think we must now move on er yes mr
speaker is there some UNK that the chair can take against honourable members of this house UNK raising UNK points of order
er that o order it's a very good question er but i fear not that it is up to individual members themselves to exercise some restraint and to and to u order and to use the procedures of this house properly and correctly and not to abuse them
yes mr UNK
er madam speaker i understand the position you ma you the point you make about er ministers UNK er determining whether they're going to make a statement by an oral statement or by a written parliament question but surely the speaker does have power if he or she so determines to UNK er a minister here and particularly if there's pressure in parliament to require a minister to come here and make a statement that must be right
otherwise how could speaker UNK tell the king that the speaker on that's on that occasion could only be instructed by parliament
surely ministers are inferior to parliament not superior to a speaker
o order as the honourable gentleman is fully aware is fully aware the speaker of this house has no authority whatsoever in demanding that ministers come here and make statements
it is for ministers themselves to decide whether they do that the speaker has no authority in determining that
yeah mis mr banks
madam speaker we understand that er the tory UNK are UNK arranging UNK for certain of their members opposite
would it be in order if such UNK are arranged for them to be co joined er downstairs in st UNK
that is barely a point of order for me
i think on that note we might now pass on er to er presentation of bills
ray UNK
referendum scotland bill
second reading what day
eleventh of march
friday the eleventh of march
mr harry UNK
marriage amendment bill
second reading what day
friday the eleventh of march
friday the eleventh of march
rule motion mr harry UNK
i beg to move that lead beginning did beg given to bring in a bill to extend and improve methods of electoral registration and to allow disabled people to gain access to UNK stations
my bill falls into two parts one which deals with the need for a full franchise it is sometimes UNK believed that we already have a full franchise in this country but whereas legislation was passed in the past in order to extend the franchise in recent years we have let matters slip considerably on the methods that are used for registration and no longer can we claim to have that full franchise
the second part of the bill is to provide er access for disabled people and others to UNK stations
for even if we achieve the objective of a full franchise then the purpose of that full franchise will not work for disabled people if they don't have full access to UNK stations they only then have the alternative of using postal or UNK votes and not exercising their franchise in the same way that able UNK people er will do and their full right are part of the measure that i'm seeking the house to agree that i should pursue
what's wrong with the current methods of electoral registration
well there are millions of people who are missing from electoral registers who are people who are entitled to be registered and the problem is probably the greatest among those who are known as UNK and are qualifying for registration at eighteen for the first time in their lives the numbers of UNK er qualifying has reduced percentage wise year by year especially since the introduction of the poll tax and has not been UNK by the measures that remove the poll tax
in official figures it is shown that only ninety five percent of people who are eligible to be registered in england and wales appear upon electoral registers
in london the figure is only eighty eight point four percent but even the ninety five percent figure and the eighty eight four percent figures are artificially UNK because those elements include people who have died and not have not been removed from the register people who have UNK people who have otherwise moved to other parts of the country and who it is unreasonable to expect will all be seeking to make use of postal or UNK vote facilities
there's a great deal of double counting that takes place it might be that some honourable members in this house actually appear upon two registers one in london and one within the area in which they UNK normally within their constituency and many people are merely carried over from past registers without any serious canvassing taking place to find out whether they are the people to be on the registers or whether someone else should be put in their place
we also have a mobile UNK society in which people do get on their UNK move around from UNK to UNK with growing elements of homelessness and there are serious problems about registration
the office of census populations and surveys estimates that three point four million people in england and wales alone are missing from electoral registers
probably four million people in the united kingdom and a million alone in greater london
the method we use is UNK
we have a qualifying date for registration of october the tenth and the registers come into operation on february the sixteenth registers are coming into operation tomorrow
they last for a year so by the qualifying date has been acted upon registers are sixteen months old by they are finished with
the UNK society has shown that a register an average register is likely to be sixteen percent out by the end of the its life
now my bill will seek to tackle this serious problem by introducing a rolling register that would allow addition and UNK of names as UNK people move
it would provide for extra authority and resources for electoral returning officers
so that housing movement information details of deaths that are registered information from statutory undertakings
ex UNK er with information from other electoral returning officers and regular canvassing take place
all these to be subject to strict confidentiality rules so that the information is to be used for electoral returning purposes only
registers will roll until elections are announced and then when elections are announced it will be the closing date for that particular election and UNK cards will immediately be issued with massive publicity around them so that people who don't get UNK cards discover that they're not on registers and will still have time because they've qualified by the qualifying date to get themselves entered onto registers within a week of the election taking place
afterwards the registers will continue to roll
there will still be required annual registration but this will be more of a check upon the existing state of the rolling register and will supply extra information that can be acted upon by the electoral returning officer
when it comes to access to UNK stations this will require UNK audits to be undertaken by electoral returning officers
full consultations with relevant voluntary organisations representing disabled people
bodies such as links and the UNK society which produce quite a substantial report at the last election to illustrate what the problems were then there will be established designated UNK stations in which there will be various characteristics required such as wheelchair access UNK wheelchair access although the problem of UNK is for more people than those people who are in UNK and many people who are not registered disabled and are mainly old and UNK should have the opportunity to exercise their franchise readily and easily
designated accessible UNK stations er will themselves have to cover fifty percent or so of a constituency initially and people will be allowed to have access to a designated station if their own station is one that has not qualified at that time although the aim will be a hundred percent designated er UNK stations with full access
now the point about this measure is how will the secretary of state for home affairs respond to this proposal because this is a re run this ten minute ruled bill of the bill that i introduced last year under the private members bill procedure in which the er junior minister that is currently at the despatch box said that he accepted the UNK of seeking to achieve full registration but felt that the measure itself was premature in that the home office were investigating er numbers and matters concerned with the electoral registration and electoral provision arising from experience at the last general election but i think it was beginning to be accepted that the poll tax had a serious impact upon the electoral register although there were many other er elements that provided great difficulty
what we now need to ask is has the time arrived er for this measure to begin to be acceptable by the home office it would be nice if there was a just a little indication er as i'm er proceeding through er this measure from the minister at the despatch box that the time was now right for this er particular proposal er which was not anything that was voted against er on second reading but merely failed to overcome the hurdle of getting a closure when by seventy eight votes to nil er it was carried except that carrying was not sufficient in order arrive at a closure so that the measure could move in the committee
now it would maybe not be appropriate if there was to be an alternative government bill that would deal with these type of matters er in front of us and please to say that when i read out the list of UNK it'll be shown there are people from all parties or all parties in britain in this house who are true democrats
the question is that honourable member to bring in his bill say aye
aye
they UNK it the UNK it
who will confirm bring in the bill
mr robert UNK mrs margaret UNK doctor norman UNK mr UNK mr richard UNK mr david UNK alice UNK mr david alton mr bill UNK and myself
can't be bad can it
representation of the people amendment bill
seconded in what day
friday may the twentieth
the twentieth thank you
now come to motions one and three representation of the people mr
mr speaker i beg to move that the draft european parliamentary UNK england order nineteen ninety four erm the draft european parliamentary UNK wales order nineteen ninety four which were laid before the house on the twentieth of january together with the draft european parliamentary election changes to the franchise and qualification of representatives regulations nineteen ninety four which were laid on the second of february be approved
first i shall deal with the two constituencies orders which establish new boundaries for the european parliamentary constituencies
these two orders give effect to the recommendations contained in the reports of the european parliamentary constituencies committee for england and the similar er parliamentary constituencies committees for wales respectively
the two committees were set up under the provisions of the european parliamentary elections act nineteen ninety three to carry out the task of determining the european parliamentary constituencies into which england and wales should initially be divided to give effect to the increase the section one of that act made to the number of constituencies
i i'm very grateful to the minister but i want to ask him a straightforward question
there is the suggestion that france may not UNK the additional seats
if that was so and we today have passed these orders would it require new primary legislation to UNK the old boundaries er which would be necessary if i understand france UNK to advance the additional seats which were agreed as part of the maastricht negotiations
the honourable gentleman said that was a straight question i shall give him a straight answer er no it wouldn't er if i can return to the line of er explanation i was giving mr deputy speaker
if i may remind the house of the background to this
agreement was reached at the european council at edinburgh in december nineteen ninety two that the european parliament should be UNK by allocating additional seats to some member states
the primary reason for this was the large increase er in the population of germany arising out of the UNK of country
eighteen extra seats have therefore been allocated to germany to take account of the increased electric there
the united kingdom received six extra seats under the agreement of these six five have been allocated to england and one to wales which the government in a moment which the government believes is the UNK distribution on an UNK basis
i give way
would my honourable friend be able to explain why it was that in the run up to negotiations with respect to the question of increase in the number of seats er the german government made it quite clear that they were not interested or didn't want to have the additional number of seats and then subsequently for reasons that have never been fully explained we then found that er they had an additional eighteen
could my honourable friend explain how that came about
well no i can't give er my honourable friends the ins and outs of the negotiations
suffice as it's to say that the negotiations did provide for extra seats for germany in account of the additional population that accrued to germany from the UNK of east and west germany and er at the same time the opportunity was taken to UNK some extra seats to some other countries er which erm bore in mind er more closely than before the respective differences in population sizes of the various countries that make up the community er the two special committees that i referred to mr deputy speaker were set up in july nineteen ninety three
they followed as far as possible in the time available the practices and procedures of the permanent parliamentary boundary commission indeed of the six members of the committees five were members of the parliamentary boundary commissions and they were appointed to the committees after consultation with the opposition parties
the committees had to work to a very tight timetable
they published provisional recommendations last september and allowed one month for representations and counter proposals to be made
copies of all the counter proposals and representations were then placed on local deposit in council offices and a further period allowed for representations to be made about them
the committees made their final recommendations to my right honourable and learned friend just before christmas
in making those recommendations they made clear they took into account the recommend the representations made and views expressed to them whilst UNK with the statutory requirement that they should aim to recommend the european parliamentary constituencies with as nearly as possible equal UNK
although i recognise that they may not have pleased everybody an aim which i think the house would agree would be impossible to achieve i believe they have carried out their task in an objective and UNK way
the orders therefore give effect without modification to their recommendations and i hope the house will approve them
er may i turn now to the regulations before the house
it's just i did want clarification on that point and i didn't quite understand the answer
if the french do not proceed erm as they are indicating what happens then to the status of our own constituencies
do we have the constituencies as were before the additional six seats or do we continue with the constituencies with the additional seats
we we're UNK er by these orders to set up the new constituencies er they do not actually come into effect to enable the elections to be held upon them er until all the countries of the e c have agreed the changes that are necessary to accommodate the new numbers that er they will be having er so the act the ninety three act has a UNK hour within it
the UNK power er will not be put into effect by the home secretary until he knows that the other countries have accommodated themselves to the new arrangements
er if they don't the UNK will not take place and we will continue on the existing boundaries that would and i'll give way to my honourable friend in a moment that of course would create massive inconvenience i see no er real reason why the other states er which have yet to UNK should not do so er but my honourable friend i think wanted to intervene with a further thought on this point so i give way to her
no all i was curious to know was er the UNK yes but i mean w could you take it right up to the sort of the tapes until the day before the elections or what would be the limit on that
yes we could do so it would be a matter of judgement for the er for the home secretary how far to take it and he would have to balance the likelihood of er other countries all UNK and the inconvenience to those taking part in the election here er if er there is some uncertainty to the end and maybe having to revert to the current constituencies er i hope and expect that these matters will be settled in the next few weeks
i think the er the home secretary will be becoming increasingly concerned er if there isn't a conclusion by mid april but i think maybe er honourable friends on both sides of the house may want to onto when the last date should be
but there is no late date set into the legislation only that UNK when it is required means that from the first of the following month then the elections on the new constituency boundaries may take place under the new er european rules so that a decision is of course for an election in june er is in fact needed by the first of may
very difficult after that
minister's well aware this is causing considerable concern amongst the small percent of the population in southend on sea who are interested in european elections because the proposal is that instead of the links with chelmsford as we are at present we're going to be linked with UNK which of course is something different
now what my constituents who are interested would like to know is what actually does president UNK want
what price are we going to have to pay the french to get this through really don't know and i wonder if the minister could say what exactly does do the french actually want before they agree to this
i think that er that is a question better directed towards the french possibly my colleagues in the foreign office but my understanding is that the french assembly have indeed er approved UNK er but the french government i is declining er to append the appropriate signatures to it er until agreement over the erm the parliament building at strasbourg is completed erm but my honourable friend i think in true parliamentary form asks questions to which he already feels he knows pretty well what the answer is and i suspect that my answer squares with what he knows already
i give way to the honourable gentlemen
on that point er would the er minister indicate whether or not the british government supports the attitude of the french government because of course the british government at the time of the edinburgh summit were wholly in favour of the agreement to require the european parliament to meet both in brussels and in strasbourg and therefore i assume that there's an identity of interest between the british government and the french government on this question since the french government are maintaining their er opposition to the er six extra seats simply because they want to see a new parliament building constructed in strasbourg is that a position that the british government supports
er what the UNK the british government would like to see is a resolution of these matters er our precise position er and attitude and er erm the assistance we can give in reaching conclusions is much more a matter er for ministers of the foreign office rather than myself so the honourable gentleman er UNK me to UNK in areas that don't belong to me and do not actually belong to these orders that are before us no they're not they're not really relevant to whether we approve or not the orders that are before us er i'll give way in a moment but the honourable gentleman er for i believe wanted to intervene
isn't there a precedent for all this UNK and opt out clause
UNK er the precedent for the situation that we are in now yes indeed there is one and it was when er the labour government was last in power in nineteen seventy eight when we had er to er set up the european constituencies we had a limited time to do it in and all the countries in europe had to agree to bring forward the same kind of agreement and put it into effect at the same time
so i am telling the honourable gentleman yes indeed there is a precedent
er i give way to my er
getting more and more UNK by this and i'd like to you a question to which i genuinely don't know the answer
i thought i heard him say that there was some discretion in this matter if the french don't go ahead there is some discretion on the part of the british government i thought it was automatic that if the french don't UNK then we won't be able to UNK
er the original question i had is whether if they don't go ahead er whether we would have to have new primary legislation to revert to the current euro constituencies and i said no we wouldn't because there is a UNK date there is a UNK date that er the er home secretary would not put into effect until he was er quite certain that all the countries were on the start line and the and the new and the new constituencies er could actually come properly into effect and the six extra members would be elected
what i said was there was some discretion was in the hands of the home secretary when he brought forward that UNK date and what he would have in mind is of course the er not merely what happens er i er erm in the er our colleague countries in the community on their UNK er their changes er but also in the kind of time we would actually need political parties would need candidates would need to run an efficient election campaign here
obviously we do not want to be in two minds up to the last day and he wouldn't do that but there is quite a period of discretion where the time gets shorter and er he would have to make a judgement
i suspect that time would come somewhere in april
yes
erm my honourable friend will remember that er under er part two of the maastricht treaty erm UNK to UNK er article eight er not only are citizens of the union erm given certain powers but they're given rights UNK by the treaty which should be subject to the duties imposed thereby
then it states that every citizen of the union erm UNK in a member state shall have the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at UNK elections in the member state in which he UNK under the same conditions as UNK of that state and that the right shall not may but shall be UNK er before the thirty first of december nineteen ninety four by the council acting unanimously on the proposal from the commission and after consulting the european parliament which arrangements may provide the UNK where UNK by problems specific to a member state
now my honourable friend was er indicating that perhaps some solution would need to be found to dealing with the problem of the UNK french
now all i'm suggesting to him is that there is here apparently a requirement laid down by the treaty which can't be UNK by any one individual member state which could actually only be enforced by reference to a court of justice and what i'd like to ask is in the light of this very deep seated concern by the french about strasbourg er and the european parliament building and the knowledge that this is of such importance to the er of er voting and of representation in the community of the european elections
is there an intention by our government through some means or another to get this matter brought before the court so that we can have the matter er sorted out where it belongs
hear
er i think my honourable friend if i followed him er is confusing two things er because erm er what we he was beginning by talking about er are what we will come to in the regulations er which is the right of citizens of other er member countries to vote in the country of which they're not a citizen to vote
er but that doesn't er erm er enable anybody to take any legal process against france or the french government er for not UNK er those arrangements which would lead to six additional members elected from this country and indeed six from france
they're quite separate
but i will be getting on to these regulations now
because erm the er the purpose of these regulations which er my old friend has just UNK to and i s i and i have myself is to extend to the citizens of other member states of the european union who are resident here the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in the elections to the european parliament
our current legislation relating to elections UNK the right to vote and to be to british and other commonwealth citizens and citizens of the irish republic
but the treaty on european union signed at maastricht gave voting and UNK rights to citizens of the union who live in a member state without being a national of that state
article eight b two of the treaty related to elections to the european parliament which is the subject of the draft regulations presented here
the draft regulations extend these electoral rights to citizens of the other member states of the european union who are resident here by making a number of technical amendments to existing legislation
the overall aim of these draft regulations is therefore very simple but the regulations themselves are somewhat long and complex as those who've tried to read them will have noticed
the reason for this length and complexity is that er electoral legislation very rightly goes into often minute details of prescription and practice
this level of prescription is valuable in UNK electoral procedures from ambiguity but it does mean that even simple changes require complicated amendments to a great many legislative UNK
this accounts for the complexity of the document before the house
the general principal of article eight b two of the maastricht treaty is that non national residents in member state should be treated for electoral purposes in the same way as the UNK of that state
the draft regulations seek to achieve that equality of treatment in practice and we are not introducing of our own accord any requirements on citizens of other member states which we do not require of our own citizens
to register to vote for example a union citizen must have been resident in great britain on the qualifying date of the tenth of october or fifteenth of september for northern ireland in exactly the same way as british or other commonwealth citizens and citizens of other member states who wish to be candidates of the elections for the european parliament must conform to the same nomination procedures as candidates have UNK
but we're placing one or two small differences to procedure on union citizens directly UNK from the provisions of the e c directive implementing in article eight b two
in mentioning the directive er can i er pause very briefly er mr deputy speaker to apologise to the house that this document was not made available at the draft stage er an unfortunate combination of human error and several failures of communications meant that the select committee was deprived of the opportunity to consider the directive at its draft stage er i've noticed the select committee's report which has been put in the vote office in the usual way and acknowledge the government did not meet its scrutiny obligations with regard to this document in the normal means
i can only repeat here the apologies which have been made outside the house
as i said the draft regulations impose on union citizens a few minor procedural changes from those we require of our own citizens
the main difference from our normal arrangements is that union citizens will have to apply to register to vote and will have to do so to their local electoral registration officer by the twenty ninth of march
we will not be placing a duty on electoral registration officers to seek out non british or irish citizens for registration
a further small difference is that we will be requiring intending voters and candidates to supply information about their electoral rights in their home member state
member states will be UNK information on non national UNK and candidates on the basis of the information provided with the aim of preventing double voting or UNK and to enforce UNK imposed by a home member state
this requirement UNK from the directive who apply the provisions of the treaty and is designed to meet the concerns of some other member states
as i've said these regulations are apparently complex but merely affect a simple extension of rights to vote and UNK in conformity with our treaty obligations and i hope that the house will approve these too
question is as on the order paper mr graham UNK
er mr deputy speaker i'm glad er at last after some further delay that members of this house have the opportunity to discuss the important matter of the boundaries on which the european elections will be fought on june the ninth and the extension to the vote to e c citizens in the u k for those elections
er the european project goes on and for many of the UNK generations in this place it's not longer an article of faith er but a part of the political landscape that has to be dealt with on merit and it's all the more ludicrous therefore mr deputy speaker that the UNK internal divisions over maastricht have led to a situation where candidates for the ever more important european elections are only now being selected in certain seats just fourteen weeks before the election
given the size of the european constituencies it will be difficult if not impossible for some candidates to become widely known and for an informed choice to be made
as we argued throughout the proceedings of the european parliamentary elections bill the conservatives are entirely responsible for the fact that this process of drawing up the new european boundaries had to be compressed into such a short time
they are also responsible for the fact that the boundaries were drawn up not by the independent boundary commission but by the new european parliamentary constituencies committee
it took from the edinburgh summit in december nineteen ninety two when the current prime minister first announced the government's intention to UNK on this issue until the thirtieth of june nineteen ninety three before the european parliamentary elections bill had its first reading
now we all know that the reason for this UNK six month delay was that the government couldn't be sure of carrying a vote on anything european in the face of UNK from its maastricht UNK those the prime minister UNK the UNK ones
i understand that it is possible even at this late stage that the review itself could be UNK by the refusal of france to agree the new allocation of seats and we've already had an exchange on that mr deputy speaker which indicates that whatever we decide today might actually be UNK and UNK completely by the UNK of the french to UNK their part of the arrangement er the minister referred to it as a massive inconvenience i suggest that if we have to resort to going back to the old boundaries to fight these elections and indeed the problems that will cause for the selection of candidates as well that will be one of the greatest UNK that even this house has heard
i think colleagues on this side will seek to press the minister even further on the latest developments in france and indeed what influence we can have to make sure that if we pass these orders today they do become the basis of the european elections
mr deputy speaker we on this side of the house believed then as the bill went through committee and still believe today that there was time had the government been more efficient in the organisation of its parliamentary business for proper public inquiries to have been held
as we know the organisation of business er isn't their strong point at the moment whether its been run UNK by their own UNK or UNK breaking down the usual channels seems our non cooperation policy is merely an extension of the one that's been working so effectively inside the conservative party under the present prime minister
UNK all that confusion i think it is important that the procedures used in this parliamentary review should never be UNK as a precedent for future boundary revision for either strasbourg or westminster
we must be clear that this occasion must be the exception and not the rule
on this side of the house we believe that if people are to have confidence in our democratic system then they need to be sure that the electoral boundaries on which our system operates are beyond UNK
i stated when the bill came before the house that i did not believe that the home secretary intended to fiddle the boundaries some felt i was being a little generous to the home secretary but in his case er we should always be prepared to understand a little more and condemn a little less
it was always our contention that justice should not only be done but that justice should be seen to be done by the due process of the public inquiry
this process was one that we'd enjoyed the public inquiry process for over fifty years and it would be most helpful if the minister at some point in his er later remarks perhaps could take this opportunity to tell the house that the conservatives do not intend to side step the public inquiry stage of any future boundary proposals european or i'd be glad to give up
boundary changes that we would like to have the full UNK of o of inquiry a as the honourable gentleman knows the timetable was short here and what we had to do was to follow the model er that had been provided by the last labour government in seventy eight when it had a similarly tight timetable took a similarly er period similarly short period of time er for the reviews and where erm the normal enquiries had to be UNK with
they were not they were not UNK with well one could look back in seventy eight and say UNK how that process could have been started considerably earlier er the honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that er as the maastricht bill was winding its way through here it wasn't really practical to run this but indeed the processes were started before the governing legislation was on the statute book and i quite understand why honourable gentlemen opposite wish to make their party points particularly those particularly those who were not in the house in seventy eight which er doesn't i think apply to the honourable gentleman from birmingham when he knows perfectly well that the same kind of machinery is used now was used then and it was used as fairly and as honestly and as completely UNK as the time allowed
i'm more concerned about erm future possibilities not least the possibility that the if we fight the next european election under first past the post system then of course there will need to be a further set of boundary changes in the very near future arising from the parliamentary boundary commission proposals and i hope that again that the minister will take the change in his remarks a little later to assure the house that this was because of the time constraints and there are reasons for that i'll come to but because of the time constraints that this was in fact just a one off proposal because its sad that party political considerations that the minister has UNK to the difficulties that conservative party had over the maastricht bill caused our boundary procedures to be UNK with at all in the u k at the same time as we're seeing er a welcome expansion of democratic forms in the rest of the world in erm eastern and central er europe in south africa for instance we see the UNK of these forms in the united kingdom
we in this country and indeed in this house can be very deeply UNK when indeed we should be ever UNK about our democracy and the very precious forms that it takes of which one was the er public inquiry stage of the erm boundary commission procedures
public UNK certainly
been rather unfair to the conservative party over their attitudes to maastricht
would you accept as a euro UNK that the opinion poll published by the commission three weeks ago showed that the labour party in their UNK support for maastricht were wholly out of line with the average labour UNK and in fact it shows quite clearly the majority of people in britain not only were opposed to maastricht they were also opposed to the idea that the e c was a good idea at all
i feel er something of a stranger walking in on the maastricht UNK er annual dinner er at the er i have to say that erm i er wouldn't wish to cross UNK with the honourable gentleman on the detail of the maastricht bill but certainly but certainly i UNK to say that for many people and maybe even some people on this own side who may be prepared to admit it the false divide between euro UNK and euro UNK is one that doesn't appeal to the new generations of members and i suspect on both sides of the house we are in our considered view in europe and we need to make the best of it and treat europe on its merits rather than re live the battles of the er late seventies and early eighties
the public inquiry process within the boundary er commission procedures is certainly not er a declaration it has a very important function
in the previous round of european parliamentary proposals there were ten european boundary enquiries and five of these UNK provisional recommendations as a result of listening to people at public inquiry
now the home secretary admitted in the committee stage on the floor of the house that to have had the public inquiry stage would have added seven weeks to the boundary process
this mr deputy speaker could easily have been accommodation had the bill been brought to the house just seven weeks earlier than it actually was brought to the house seven weeks weren't the problem
the problem was the wasted thirty two weeks between the edinburgh summit and the introduction of the bill a delay caused entirely for party political reasons the conservative splits over europe in general and over maastricht in particular
i'll be pleased to give way
i don't go he knows the answer to this question maybe the home office will be able to provide with it
how many e c UNK are presently registered then to vote in this forthcoming election
at the moment there are no at the moment there are no UNK registered and i'll i will come to this later er potentially i understand there are some four hundred thousand who could register
erm mr deputy speaker we on this side of the house look forward with confidence to the nineteen ninety four european elections whatever boundaries they take place on
in nineteen eighty nine at the last european elections labour took forty five seats to the conservatives thirty two and we are looking forward to the elections in june when the party opposite UNK by divisions and UNK will suffer further loses and labour we hope will make further gains
we all know that there's a fundamental divide within the conservative party which no amount of packaging can UNK although the packing last time round perhaps er wasn't quite as good as it could have been
maybe this time they'll be a rather more serious effort in the european elections given that the er potential for influencing the outcome of the next leadership contest also lies in the balance there
in europe itself the conservative m e ps are led by sir christopher UNK sir christopher UNK is the vice president of the european peoples party and they sit the a debate may no doubt take place later on whether he's the vice chairman or vice president
my information until corrected is that he is the vice president of the european peoples party and it's a rather UNK relationship the er conservatives have with the european peoples party
they sit with the european peoples party in parliament
they speak on the european peoples party membership of committees that is the only way in which they can find a voice in committees and they take their share of european peoples party's funding from the european peoples party
now there seems to be a very close relationship between the european peoples party and the conservative party if only on that UNK basis
now the european peoples party manifesto calls for a single currency a central bank the UNK of the social chapter a common immigration policy and a constitution for the whole of europe
all of which have been UNK by members opposite with great UNK
things obviously very close to the hearts of members on the benches opposite
i can only wonder if it will bear very much relationship to the manifesto finally produced by the conservative party before the next european election
i'm very grateful to the honoured honourable gentleman
i'm certain that he would not like to finish his speech bef before mentioning the relationship of the labour party with the socialist parties in europe and their own manifesto
oh what a clever boy
and i certainly wouldn't dream of finishing my speech without er some substantial mentions of the er very close relationship that we are proud to tell people about
very close relationship between
order
before the honourable gentleman goes any further it would be advantage really to get back to the boundaries mr graham g
i'll resist the temptation er mr deputy speaker to follow members opposite in er what could have been a very interesting line of debate
erm has the honourable gentleman noted that er on the ninth of february it's only a few days ago the european parliament itself erm through its UNK mr UNK er the christian democrats but also of course with er UNK from the er european parliament endorsed a constitution er which contains even worse things than the european peoples party's manifesto
is he and his party going to UNK these
order my just recent remarks it would apply to the honourable gentleman just in reply to the honourable gentleman on the front bench mr graham UNK
erm i think the bad news for the honourable member from UNK is that er UNK is in fact a member of the european peoples party and no doubt no the honourable member with great respect said that he was a christian democrat and he's also a member of the european peoples party and therefore i hope that the honourable member for UNK will take that up with his conservative colleagues who are very closely connected to the european peoples party because i hopefully have made clear earlier in my remarks
i'd be very glad to give way to the honourable lady
is the honourable member aware that whereas all the conservatives voted against the UNK report the labour party the UNK er out there on the that side voted for it
i'm very grateful for that point of information from the honourable lady
er mr deputy speaker it's also quite important that i make clear the labour party's position in respect to the article which calls for uniform electoral procedures to be set up for elections to the european parliament
members of this house will recall that this matter was raised er in relation to an amendment er at committee stage and we argued during the committee stage of the bill that it was not feasible for an entirely new electoral system to be set up for the european elections in june nineteen ninety four and that it was er silly to apply a different system for the additional six seats to that applying to the other eighty one
however we also made it clear that as one part of labour's wider democratic agenda that we were sympathetic to looking at a UNK of electoral systems and that this might include UNK for a regional list system of proportional representation for future european elections
as i stated in the house during the debate on the seventh of er july the plant commission established by the labour party to look into electoral systems proposed as one of its many recommendations a system of proportional representation the regional list system for the european parliament
its report said such a system could be introduced by an incoming labour government for the nineteen ninety nine elections at the earliest
that report was sent to our national executive committee and on may the nineteenth the leader of the labour party stated and i quote the plant committee concludes that different elected bodies can be chosen by different electoral systems that is the view which i share and i support the proposals made both for a UNK second chamber and the european parliament
the proposal on the european parliament sensibly recommends cons consistency of voting for the one election that we share with other members of the european community
mr deputy speaker that strong sympathy expressed at the time of the last debate on these matters was approved UNK by the labour party conference last october and i state that for the record less there be any misunderstanding about our position on the issue of voting systems
hear
it also UNK the fact that the conservative government are yet again UNK behind even the right wing and christian democratic parties in europe and are utterly isolated in their UNK to UNK electoral change of any kind
mr deputy speaker the european parliamentary constituency committees have now made their recommendations
we on this side of the house have a number of specific dis UNK about the er way in which specific boundaries have been drawn in addition members will remember our strong call for an additional scottish seat
nevertheless we are generally satisfied that both committees that's the english and the welsh committees have done a thorough job and on behalf of my colleagues i would certainly like to pay tribute to those who served on those committees who i believe discharged their responsibilities with great UNK in circumstances made unnecessarily difficult by UNK and delay
mr deputy speaker we live in dark days for our democracy
days of executive UNK henry the eighth clauses and bills being agreed without proper parliamentary debate
i suppose in that context we should be grateful that ministers have not used the power that they have to modify the recommendations of the boundary committees
it is a sad day when we are grateful for not being abused in this house but it's about all we have to be UNK for until this UNK system is altered root and branch
hear
if i can move onto the final of the orders the erm UNK of e c citizens resident in the u k we on this side of the house welcome the change which allows e c citizens resident in the u k to vote in the european elections
these regulations which will give effect at the european council directive of december the sixth will of course alter the long standing position in the u k whereby only british and commonwealth citizens and citizens of the republic of ireland are entitled to vote in european parliamentary elections
it is a sensible and desirable change welcome on this side of the house and i understand and the minister may correct me if i'm wrong but the order relating to local government elections and e c citizens er will be before the house before the end of nineteen ninety four
we on this side of the house believe that this extension of the franchise to e c citizens resident in britain is a clear UNK of our practical commitment to greater european cooperation and rights that apply to all european citizens
consequently we've been greatly concerned by the government's delay in bringing forward this legislation which was adopted in draft on the twenty third of june nineteen ninety three and became a council directive on the sixth of december nineteen ninety three
it's indicative of this government's approach to all matters european
that every obligation of the maastricht treaty appears to be discharged UNK and after unnecessary delay
often the wheels appear to grind UNK slow particularly where democratic change is concerned
it was in nineteen seventy seven that the european parliament first passed a resolution on voting rights in european elections
i hope that many of those UNK of that time feel a sense of satisfaction this evening seeing this bill and these orders going through
it may interest them that within the last few months the european parliament has agreed to press for a bill of rights for the citizens of europe and for a written constitution for europe
who knows how quickly that may come to UNK
the UNK underlying this change are relatively straightforward as the minister's already er UNK article eight of the treaty on european union passed last year entitled UNK of the union guarantees the right to move and UNK freely within the territory of member states
i'd be pleased to give way
thank you honourable gentleman
isn't it also true that the european union or community or whatever you like to call it is also intending to introduce a compulsory identity card in the form of a smart card carrying details of the UNK health but which would have ample room to put all sorts of other things on
there are no proposals there are no prop
a list of recommendations
when he introduced the report in the house my right honourable friend the member for UNK upon thames made is clear that he accepted them all and that the government was committed to carrying them out
in a subsequent debate on the report on the sixth of november nineteen ninety two i spelt out in some detail how the government intended to fulfil that commitment and one of the regulations before the house today represents the UNK of our actions to give effect to one of sir thomas er UNK recommendations that the existing right in section forty seven of the banking act nineteen eighty seven for auditors to report relevant information to the bank of england should become a statutory duty
as honourable members will recall sir thomas was persuaded to this view by in part a conclusion of the treasurer and civil service select committee that although the existing UNK nature of section forty seven had worked well it seems desirable in his words to UNK the wording of the act so that there can be no doubt either from the point of view of the auditor his client or the regulator as to the auditor's duty to report
in UNK the government's intention i also made it clear that my right honourable friend had decided that a similar duty should be introduced for auditors of building societies and financial service companies and that my right honourable friend the president of the board of trade would want the approach extended er to the this approach extended to the auditors of insurance companies
hence the four statutory instruments which are before us today
in his speech er in that debate the honourable member for edinburgh central and the bench er in his place today er welcomed the government's acceptance of sir UNK and the select committee's recommendation and agreed er that it was in his words important that the statutory duty of auditors ought to be clear so that er to use his UNK phrase if UNK are to be blown they're to be blown without doubt
well since that debate the government has taken the decision to introduce the duty into a fifth regulated sector friendly societies and a negative resolution order under the friendly societies act nineteen ninety two is also is also prop be n reasons for taking action across this wide front madam deputy speaker first and most important the relevant provisions in the various acts are very similar and if we are to UNK the arrangements in relation to banks then we should do the same for other sectors UNK with the UNK investments
all with ensuring their daily risks
it would be difficult for me or for any other minister to have to defend leaving things unchanged in these other areas if the affect of having done so was subsequently to lead to a case of fraud in an investment firm building society or insurance company which the existence of the duty would have helped to prevent
i most grateful to the minister for giving way and it's good to see the government er at last UNK the justice of the amendments to do exactly what we're proposing now that we put in to most of the committees like the building societies c b bill a and like the banking bill when they were discussing the nineteen eighties but lord justice bingham also recommended er and i quote the determination of the correct relationship between client auditor and supervisor raises an issue of policy more appropriate for decision making by parliament than by the bank and the accounting profession
why in the view of that clear recommendation that parliament should decide these matters has he left the regulation of that duty to the auditing practices board a non statutory body
well the honourable gentleman for great UNK is quite right to say that these matters er had some consideration given to them during the passage of the legislation er but it is also true to say that er th in the bingham report there was a broad acceptance that the present s system of supervision of banks should continue
now with regard to auditors in particular er he will know because he's had some correspondence with me er on this particular subject it is the view of the government that the er recognised professional body the institute of chartered accounts in england and wales is best placed as a professional body to UNK er this sector er an argument can be mounted and no doubt he may seek to use this debate to do just that to say that er this should be the subject of some direct er rule from whitehall
but that is neither the history nor the practice of our professional system not just er for accountants but for the legal system as well and i think it has stood the test of time er he will know that there has been er there is a procedure for the joint UNK scheme er which enables the er institute to investigate whether there has been compliance by member firms with the standards UNK er with er by the er auditing practices board and that seems to me to be the er right way forward
but no doubt we can return to these matters if the honourable gentleman raises them further in the course of the debate
er madam deputy speaker erm er having determined the scope of the duty er the government er published a consultation document at the beginning of march at last year
this made it clear that it was not the governments objective to alter fundamentally the red relationship between auditor and client nor were we looking to increase the costs of audit
our object was the same as sir thomas UNK namely to clarify and strengthen the position of the auditor not to change it
so the government held back from imposing a duty on auditors to seek out fraud UNK and wrong doing
this would have meant UNK too far from the auditor's traditional role
the responses we received to the consultation document were considered carefully and my officials discussed the issues raised with the auditing practices board and with other interested parties in the regulated sectors
some comments could be dealt with readily by changes to the draft statutory instruments but others were not so easy to resolve as they raise more fundamental questions and in these cases my officials were able to explore with the auditing practices board whether issues could be more easily addressed in the statement of auditing standards which is being developed to UNK the legislation than in the statutory instruments themselves
i'd like if i may to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the er helpful cooperative attitude that the auditing practices board displayed in what were often long and very complex discussions and to thank them for the clear and helpful statement with which they shortly er plan to issue er to er UNK these order and to bring them into practical effect
for the convenience of the house i'd be most grateful if he could tell us is this board a quango that he's referred to
is it one of the new UNK or is it a s f r a self financing regulatory authority that has powers to issues and regulations and charge people for the job that it then does
i think the house would like to know whether it's a s f r a or quango
i i'm well i'm not entirely familiar with such jargon i think it falls within the latter rather than the former definition
it is not that case that er the auditing practices board is a body set up by the statute
but it is certainly er a body which is er recognised as responsible and indeed in er tax law and in various other ways er its UNK and the standards that it sets are generally regarded as acceptable but these matters of course are kept under review
er madam deputy speaker one of the difficulties addressed during the consultation exercise was that neither the term auditor nor the phrase in his capacity as auditor were defined in the banking statutory instrument or in the banking act itself and the government's UNK of the need to clarify who it is who will be placed under a duty by the statutory instruments and in which circumstances the duty will apply and while this is ultimately a question for the courts we take the view that the duty clearly covers any auditor of a bank appointed under u k company law
that is any auditor of an authorised institution incorporated in the u k it also covers auditors of authorised institutions whose place of UNK is outside the european community and who's initial authorisation has been granted by another regulator even though such auditors may be appointed under a foreign law
the government also takes the view that the duty applies to u k accountants acting as agents of the appointed foreign auditors
as for the circumstances in which an auditor might come under a duty to report the banking act as well as the financial services act and the insurance companies act uses use the phrase in his capacity as auditor here again we have no powers to clarify this on the face of the regulations
if any greater certainty could be given then it could be done only by an unacceptable UNK of the duty to restrict it to a part of the auditors responsibilities and we're also concerned that to do so could have potentially wide ranging implications for the scope of auditor's functions more generally
it may however be helpful madam speaker er madam deputy speaker if i seek to clarify er when an individual auditor is operating in his capacity as such and whether a partner in an auditing practice who is not involved in UNK er in auditing the regulated institutions is deemed nevertheless to be operating in his capacity as auditor
in our view it's reasonable to expect an individual who is conducting an audit to consider information relevant to an audit which is obtained in the course of other work for the same client
it seems realistic to expect the auditor to take such information into account in his review of the audit and the person acting as auditor also needs to be aware of other non audit work on his client that partners in his firm may be doing such as for example tax work and they in turn should consider whether any information that may arise from their work is relevant to the conduct of the audit and where it is they should also consider whether it is relevant to the duty to report to the regulator the partner carrying out the audit should also if possible discuss it with his client
in the case of information relating to er say client a which is obtained by the auditor while auditing client b the auditor ought as a matter of sound practice normally to use the information to make further enquiries for the purpose of the audit of a these interpretations have been set out more fully in the statement of auditing standards and the professional guidance issued by the auditing practices board that will UNK this legislation and as matters of courtesy to the house er madam deputy speaker i ask that a copy of that be placed in the library
once this extensive consultation process was over the government circulated amended versions of the draft statutory instruments for a second more limited round before setting them in their final form
in producing these UNK we bore firmly in mind the fact that if this duty on auditors is to be effective then it's vital that the auditors can continue to rely on the trust of their clients
so we've tried to set the duty at a level which makes it clear to those who seek to commit financial crime that they're more likely to be caught but which does not impose additional reporting UNK or costs on those who conduct their business honestly and that is a most important balance to strike
hear
i i'm very grateful to the minister for his patience but er on the other hand it could be argued that it's no use having a duty to report fraud unless you also have a duty to detect fraud
the auditing profession er argues and i must say the audit practice board's er proposals are very for very passive auditing the audit profession argues that it's difficult to detect fraud but on the other hand er the local government er act er local government finance act of nineteen eighty two requires local authority auditors to have er a duty to search for unlawful acts and report on them
now if that's good for the local authority UNK why isn't it good for the banking UNK when so much more money is involved
well the honourable gentleman as always makes er more than a debating point i think he makes a serious point which er deserves to be answered erm it is not if i can put it this way the intention of these orders er to turn auditors into er UNK or UNK er and to do so i think runs some very serious risks not only of reducing and UNK the relationship between auditors and their clients not only of imposing very substantial additional cost UNK on auditors which will have to be borne by companies and ultimately their clients but also there has an example he's given i think to be some difference put it no more than that between public money and private money even though i acknowledge that were talking here about the UNK in some cases of er d er public deposits and funds
so i think there are difficulties and i might er just finally add that were we to go along the lines he mentioned we would of course need primary er legislation because we couldn't introduce in orders under the relevant legislation this so it would have to be a matter for another day were we to er consider that seriously but it is not the intention of the government
to all er o on both sides erm there's one point he made which is terrible important which is that the costs of this statutory instrument and all the guidelines and rules and regulations and orders that flow from it will not impact onto small b business because that was the key to the deregulation bill and i wonder whether the deregulation unit has looked at this and whether it is satisfied it's not gonna be an additional cost onto the running of small enterprise
well my honourable friend is a prime champion of small businesses in this house and he raises a very important point er the answer is yes it has been considered er by er those concerned with deregulation
in fact my honourable friend the parliamentary under secretary of state for the department of trade and industry who's responsible for deregulation is also the UNK minister for one of these orders namely the one on the insurance companies and secondly our intention is that the cost here should be UNK or nil er in that they don't go beyond er what is already required or possible by way of a right to report here we're imposing a duty to report
that itself shouldn't er impose er any greater cost on auditors but it should and this is the crucial point i think it should UNK the ability of auditors to insist that their client companies er are forthcoming and open and where necessary correct if they can er problems which might otherwise bring their authorised status er into question and therefore it is a welcome enhancement of the law it UNK up the law without UNK imposing the costs about which he's rightly concerned
madam deputy speaker before i sit down i should also just mention that there is a european dimension to this issue as in november nineteen ninety two the vice president of the e c commission sir UNK out some general proposals for community legislation in response to the b c i affair
these proposals were subsequently turned into a commissioned proposal for a directive
one element of which would be to require member states to impose a duty on auditors of financial undertakings to report UNK of laws or regulations or other adverse circumstances to supervisors
as the house will know following discussions in brussels political agreement has been reached in the council on the amendment draft directive which if implemented in its present form would impose on auditors a slightly wider duty to report than that contained in the regulations we're currently debating
however the proposed european directive has a number of further UNK to be negotiated before it can be UNK and even when it is it's unlikely to be implemented before nineteen ninety six
even though some minor changes may subsequently be necessary in order to conform with the directive the government doesn't want to risk a further period of delay before bringing these necessary measures into effect
given the widespread support on both sides of the house for sir UNK recommendations the government believes that we should now act promptly to pass these changes into law
can i conclude madam deputy speaker once again by expressing my UNK to the auditing practices board and the many other professional bodies who've been involved in considering this legislation
we believe that these measures will greatly strengthen and clarify the position of the auditor and represent an important step forward in the fight against financial wrong doing
i commend them to the house
the question is in the terms set out on the order paper
mr UNK darling
hear
madam deputy speaker
as the minister said these orders impose a new statutory duty on auditors and as he quite rightly reminded us it is something that er we welcomed when we held the debate on the bingham report in november nineteen ninety two some fifteen months ago er i think it is fair to say that whilst we welcomed that recommendation from bingham we didn't say that was all that was required and it is certainly our view that whilst these orders are very welcome they are only a start in the battle against UNK fraud and other crimes of UNK
action was promised as the minister said in october nineteen ninety two by the former chancellor when the bingham report was published but i believe that these proposals are under the bear minimum requested by bingham and they hardly live up er to the er minister's announcement at the beginning of his speech
indeed they were only introduced after much discussion and some opposition from the auditing industry
now whilst the minister quite understandable pays tribute er to those who spent some considerable time and effort in getting the practice notes right and responding to the government's proposals it is fair to say that there are many not just in the auditing industry but those who represent the companies who are audited who have expressed a number of concerns a minister has mentioned some the relations with the client for example
indeed that is something that bears closer examination because there are many people who believe that the relationship between a client and an auditor can be too close and that there ought to be a respectable distance between them
there is the question of professional UNK which i shall return to shortly because i think it might be helpful if the minister were to say something about that
but madam deputy speaker these order don't pay any attention to a number of matters in what i would regard as the public interest and whilst the minister as i say has quite rightly paid tribute to professional organisations involved in this process we must never forget that we're here to represent the public interest and not just er specific professional interests that may be relevant in each case and indeed in the light of what has happened in this field of enforcement er over the last two years the minister must be aware that the public are requiring higher standards of commercial UNK
i believe the government should have conducted a proper and wide review into the role and duty of auditors not just in the area covered by these orders but also throughout the whole of industry
i understand the various UNK er professional bodies in the accountancy industry are in fact doing that but i think the government should also do that because it is not just the UNK of financial institutions we are concerned about it is also er the auditing of other commercial concerns and it seems to be that in this case the public interest has taken second place to the government's wish to do as little as possible yet again the minister said in the debate that if we were to do anything further in response to a question put by my honourable friend the member for grimsby it would need legislation primary legislation
so what
that's what this house is here for it is here to introduce primary legislation if we need it and in my view we do need it in this area and it is it's high time the government recognised that and should not be afraid t to take action simply because primary legislation is required
the government has for example nothing to say about a central enforcement body which is part and parcel of what i believe should be a proper and focused attack against crimes of UNK er in er financial institutions in this country
the government has said nothing about the need to end the fiction of self regulation and to replace it with an efficient and effective and cheaper direct regulation
but madam speaker there are a number of questions specifically related to these orders that we need to address
the first one is what exactly the duty is so far as the auditor is concerned
i notice that the phraseology adopted in each of the orders is different
if we look at the insurance order and the one relating to building societies it is quite clear there that the auditor has to be acting in his capacity o er as auditor
now the minister er when in his speech earlier er made the point that he thought that the proper interpretation in respect of all of these orders was a fairly wide one
if that is the case why is it that the order relating to insurance and building society er building societies specifically makes the point that the auditor must be working erm in his capacity as such whereas the orders on banking and financial services er it may be implicit the er the auditor is working er in his or her capacity as such er but it is not explicitly stated because the phraseology is different
but of course the minister in his speech earlier went far wider than that er he seemed to imply that it wasn't just er th er duty on the accountant er acting in UNK his capacity as an auditor but er the accountant would have the same duty if acting as an accountant tax advisor or indeed in any other capacity
now that is to paint a far wider duty than i had been er thought and indeed er those who follow these matters have suggested that's rather wider than the than the er secondary legislation here before us actually provides for
clearly it will be of crucial importance in any er court proceedings because the court will have to decide whether or not an auditor was in UNK of his or her duty having regard to what is on the face of the statute
now i know erm following a fairly recent er case in the house of lords that the courts are er entitled to rely on what ministers say in debate but perhaps the minister could er spell out a little bit more clearly the apparent discrepancy between what he said in his speech and what is on the face of these orders and indeed why it is that the orders in r relation to banking and financial services UNK a different phraseology er to that used in the orders relating to insurance and building societies
i know it could be something to do with regime er banks of course are UNK by the bank of england at the moment and er the financial services er regime is UNK by the s i b and it could be that is the reason why it is not explicitly stated er that the accountant has to be acting in his capacity as erm as auditor
but i do think the minister er should er b be quite clear about that point er because er it may be of crucial importance not just to the industry er but also to the public interest who will want to know what the position is so far as er these matters are concerned
and indeed er the association of er chartered er the chartered association of UNK accountants wrote to me recently er asking exactly what the position is and i quote from the letter they say firms of accountants are quite likely to be engaged by the same client to perform services other than a statutory audit and then they go on to list financial planning and so on
now if the minister is right and a partner in the firm or indeed an assistant in the firm a acting as a tax advisor or financial planner might come across something er tha that er if er he were acting as auditor he would be bound to report
now as i understand it the minister's position is that he be bound to refer that matter to the partner responsible for audit and that partner er would then be put on notice that er he ought to report it to the relevant authority
now if that is correct perhaps a minister could say so and clear in explicit terms er because it is very important because increasingly er a number of firms act in er in er in both UNK and indeed for the large firms i think many of us are aware of the difficulty that's now arising and there are only half a dozen very large accountancy firms that are capable of providing accounting and auditing services in this country and indeed most of them are beneficiaries of this government's UNK in UNK public service contracts er to a surprising degree and so the government will be well aware of the problem
to my honourable friend because not only are these er large er particularly the big six er centres of accountancy power pretty well UNK they dominate the institutions that are meant to regulate them er but when it comes to international er affairs they don't exchange information with each other
when the UNK came to enquire er into the audit performance of price waterhouse er the british partners of price waterhouse claimed that they were an entirely separate organisation have no obligation to give information to the er t to the UNK and nothing was effectively passed on er so an enquiry was conducted there without our partners er price UNK partners in this country UNK in any way
what my honourable friend raises a very interesting point because er when i we studied er the law relating to partnerships one of the basic er UNK was the personal relationship between partners and i'm bound to say that when one looks at the headed UNK of these big multi national accountancy firms sometimes the names of which cover most of the letter and there's very little room in fact left er for the message
er one wonders how on earth they speak to each other or if indeed they even know who each other is or where their offices are and there isn't that personal relationship that one might expect to find in the normal concept of a legal firm and indeed er without clearly we go to off the point somewhat to have a discussion as to whether or not er a partnership is a suitable legal entity for these people to trade under
it does raise a very important matter because in the b c i inquiry it was quite obvious er that parts of price waterhouse weren't fully aware of what other parts of UNK price waterhouse were doing and indeed worse than that and in fairness to price waterhouse some of the regulators in different parts of the world didn't know what each other w were doing and the only people that did know what was happening were the UNK behind b c i who UNK that situation
so clearly that is something that er e i is a matter for the accountancy profession in some way er but of course we've got the problem as well then that er price waterhouse operating in the united states presumably er comes within the jurisdiction of price UNK the accountancy profession in the united states and it is something that the government is going to have address itself to
it is already accepted in money UNK for example that er the f fraud is an international crime and it would be interesting to hear er what steps the minister is proposing to take to have a look at the problem that undoubtedly was er raised in the b c i report
but before i leave this particular part of my criticism er perhaps er in case the minister er doesn't accept what i'm saying i could quote er the words of the right honourable gentleman the president of the board of trade er who writing before he was a president er in his book where there's a will he said accountancy firms ought i believe the UNK from doing any other work for a company for which they act as auditors and in a number of other countries there are laws which UNK auditors in this way and prevent to prevent any possible conflict of interest
this discipline should be extended across the publicly quoted private sector
now that was certainly the views of the president of the board of trade before er he er returned to the cabinet er at another time and i'm not sure if he's UNK from these views but i think they're worthy of some weight
i understand there are problems er but as a general principle it does seem to me that it's something that needs to be looked at and the minister has said that a lot of these matters will be dealt with by a statement of practice and er he was asked by the honourable gentleman the member for south UNK i think er what the status of er these people were
well er to me it doesn't matter s er that much what i'm concerned about is that this is a matter of public interest it shouldn't just be a matter of professional interest and it's for these reasons i think the government should take a rather more lively interest er than perhaps it does
there's a whole question of rotation of auditors
that is something that has been UNK on many occasions
is it wise to have the same firm of auditors year in year out er all of us are familiar with the er the last item on the annual general meeting a motion to propose the re election of the auditors er i wonder whether or not that's something that ought to be looked at
i understand the UNK the expense question but there's also the question of UNK and efficiency because firms ought to look at audit as a useful discipline it's not a question of UNK or UNK as the minister said er audit is an essential function for the efficiency of the firm as well as for the protection of the public
the next point that i wanted to turn to is who the duty of care is owed to er as i understand it the present law is quite clear
the auditors owe a duty of care to the shore share holders collectively not to individual share holders or what are called stake holders employees for example er nor do auditors have a general duty so far as the public interest is concerned
i believe that's something that needs to be looked at and if the government were prepared to embark on a review of auditing er generally then that is something that i think there is some useful point in pursuing further er it's interesting that er erm when bingham examined this point at paragraph three er point three nine in his report er he has a long paragraph er discussing these matters and er he says that er he at the end of the day he doesn't come to a concluded view er although he does er acknowledge the fact that there are many people er UNK or example share holders and employees who might have an interest in a particular company
then in paragraph three forty he goes on to s to point out that the law er which was then recently established was that auditors due owe a duty of care to their client company and the whole body of share holders but not to individual share holders and not to non share holding UNK
now he was talking in the context of er of a er but it is something that i think the government does need to look at because given the nature of multi national companies or even the nature of public companies and private companies in this country where there is a public interest not just in efficiency but also in UNK
that it's time perhaps that we should look at the role of bankers and see whether or not they should have a wider duty than at present
i and we er don't have a concluded view on the matter but it is something that i think that we need to look at
i also think that there is substantial merit in the point that was put in intervention by my honourable friend the member for UNK on the duty of auditors
he drew attention to the fact that in terms of the local government act er local government finance act of nineteen er eighty two that auditors have a far wider duty than is proposed in these orders before us because the duty is to detect fraud
now to my mind that is not a question of being a UNK a UNK or even being a policeman er it is er indeed if we look at section fifteen of the local government finance act of nineteen eighty two er it it's quite interesting to see the words used because the auditor is under a duty amongst other things to see that the accounts are prepared in accordance with regulations er made under the act er to see that proper practices that have been followed and to see that the body of accounts that have been audited have made proper arrangements f for securing economy efficiency and effectiveness
now that's something that erm particularly that last point that audit committees that are established in most efficient companies want to look at and i come back to the point that audit ought to be looked at as something that UNK companies in efficiency as well as a mechanism for UNK fraud and yet the government doesn't appear to be examining that
it seems to be saying this is entirely a matter for the profession
i would have thought that it is in the government's interest to promote efficiency it's certainly in the government's interest to maintain the public interest with regard er to fraud or other wrong doing er but it's something that the government ought to look at and again it seems to me that it ought to be a matter that er could be looked at if there was a proper inquiry
i note that in these orders madam speaker there is a reference to er information or er material that may of significance
it will be interesting to know how the wha how the minister proposes to define er materials er material significance er who will issue guidance on that point er will it be the professional associations is it something that the government is going to turn it's mind to and what is what does it actually mean er for example if the auditor was looking at the maxwell accounts er what is a matter of material er significance er for example would it be UNK significant that just about every one er who you spoke to at the time thought that maxwell was a UNK although interestingly that wasn't er apparently the view of the regulator or that are directly responsible for these matters er but even before maxwell was exposed for the UNK that he was er many people knew from him that his conduct er the way his conducted himself the d t i itself of course had said that he was a UNK person er to be in charge of a company
is that is that an example of what er might be er information that would be of material significance
it would be helpful i think if the government er would say something about that
madam deputy speaker there is course another matter of er of er broader significance and that is that er whilst these orders er cover erm certain financial institutions they don't erm they don't cover others they don't cover lloyds of london in so far as i could see erm i'd half expected to see the honourable member for UNK west er in his place to pursue his campaign that apparently he er he is not able to be here and indeed er others who sit on the benches opposite who lost a large sum of money in lloyds er but they might have had something to say about it as it does seem odd that lloyds has not been covered no doubt the minister would tell us that needs primary legislation and i i'm quite sure this government would move heaven and earth not to introduce another lloyds bill er because of er the problems that would no doubt attract
but perhaps the minister could tell us er why they're not covered and indeed i understand that in particular er non u k banks with branches in the in the in this country er are not covered either
i may be wrong about that erm but perhaps the minister could address himself specifically to that point and also to the question of pension schemes perhaps er covered under some other legislation but i think these are matters that are of erm of some concern
er as i said the government has already accepted when we introduced the legislation last year in the criminal justice act on money UNK that there are far wider er interests and UNK fi far wider implications than there have been ever before and i think the government needs to do a little bit more to show that it is aware of international implications and the sheer scale of what we're dealing with and er i touched earlier on the question of UNK er perhaps the minister could specifically address that point
i notice that er section a hundred and nine of the financial services act nineteen eighty six er quite explicitly provides an UNK
what is the position with regard to auditors in this case er what is the UNK
i assume that if they can bring themselves within the terms of erm of these orders then they will er be UNK
the question that arises though is if they can bring themselves only within er the er words used by the minister will they be protected
now er i'm thinking in the case of er perhaps a young accountant advising on financial management who finds something odd and perhaps he reports it direct to the authorities will he be covered or will he have to go through some procedure in order to bring himself within the protection
it is an important matter because clearly if er if the matter er if the suspicion er turns out to have been reasonable but not to bear t further examination then an accountant er could find themselves in great difficulty er both with regard to pecuniary difficulty and also professional difficulty and it's something the minister needs to look at
i think there are two substantial points that er the house ought to address itself to in conclusion
firstly and i return to this point which i have mentioned again and again in debates such as this and that's the question of the lack of there being a central agency er in existence to see to the enforcement of these matters
it's been brought to my attention on a number of occasions by UNK bodies such as the stock exchange that because of the UNK of regulations er because of the complex nature of the legislation concerned and the er the comparatively large number of regulatory or UNK bodies er that there is no er an and because of the fact that there are so many differences and standards and so on that there is a need for a central enforcement body to bring together whatever evidence is available er so that these matters can be prosecuted if i use that general term
now yes
i think that if i may say so is a UNK view because of the UNK of rules and regulations he's probably right another quango or another body is needed
what i think we're saying on this side of the house i don't know if we're saying it loud enough or it's going to have effect is that we must reduce the number of rules and regulations you don't actually need the body which the honourable UNK talking about
you don't want another body because of the number of rules and regulations you want to reduce the number of rules and regulations you don't need another body
well i agree with the honourable gentleman to this extent and that as he knows er we would scrap the self regulatory system and make the s i b responsible for er UNK er the industry and in time merge it with a banking er regulatory body er so that would answer that point er and i think that the s i b er could also be responsible for the enforcement of these matters
again an extra quango wouldn't be needed and er he's probably aware of that there is a UNK er there is a group of er of er various regulators who erm who operate under the UNK f i double n and which is referred to er in the fact that i think the chancellor made some announcement about it
er i think it would be far better to have a UNK regulatory system which would make the much cheaper and more efficient and i'm glad that the honourable gentleman seems to be agreeing and perhaps he could try and persuade his honourable UNK member on the front bench that legislation primary legislation is needed i'm glad to hear he's working on it erm on the second on the second point he made about the number of regulations i'm not sure i would agree with him that the best way of UNK this problem is to have less regulations er though i would agree with the general er thrust of what he might be saying and that is that if the regulatory system was to concentrate on promoting higher professional standards and have less emphasis on rules and regulations then i think that would help
but when we're dealing as we are in this case with fraud then clearly there has to be regulations there has to be er primary legislation er so that was the point i'm making but as i say it's not just me it's the stock exchange the s i b all of them believe that we need a single enforcement body to look at these matters and i do wish perhaps the minister does but the government must UNK and a number of UNK obviously with a number of UNK and a number of di exploit the different rules and regulations and to get through them because they know they are never going to be caught and the little chance of being prosecuted and even if they are prosecuted er then the chances of being convicted are remote and even if they are convicted i'm afraid that the UNK system shows er that the worst they can expect is a few hours UNK the grass in front of an old folks home or perhaps a few months er in the country residence albeit owned by her UNK
it is something that the government needs to look at and indeed it goes hand in hand er with the need to overall the whole regulatory system er which is something that i've referred to often enough before er and i have no hesitation in repeating it again
madam er deputy speaker there is a feeling abroad in the country that an audit certificate is rather like an m o t certificate it's good for the minute that it was granted but it is perfectly useless thereafter
i think that feeling has got to be UNK and it's for these points that the for these reasons the government needs to turn its attention a little bit more er to the issues that i that i have raised and i would refer in conclusion madam de deputy speaker the minister to the bank of UNK er memorandum submitted to the treasury and civil service er select committee in its report published on eighth of december last year when at page a hundred and eighty five they draw attention to the european directives that the minister himself referred to
i understand it's run into some difficulty but i urge the minister to press the commission to get a move on because this is a problem that doesn't just affect this country it is certainly a problem that affects the whole of europe and the european union in particular but also the er the whole of the world and it's something that needs international action
we er erm in this country have a very bitter experience with b c i it wasn't just the knock it took to the regulatory system but i need hardly remind this house there are thousands of people who lost everything they had and that and there are many people who lost everything they had and feel that this house has not taken their concern seriously and it's something the minister must show that the government is willing to pursue these matters even if it means introducing primary legislation
madam deputy speaker i re read in the newspapers today that there has been s some criticism er that the matters such as this have been taken on the floor of the house
i think it's important these matters are taken on the floor of the house because they are very serious
perhaps this debate won't be as lively and er as controversial as the one that er we arranged to have on the question of UNK dealing but it is an important matter because auditing as i said is not just as assistance to companies but it is a reassurance to the general public and the public at the moment are in need of grave reassurance that the UNK that the er the financial services industry as well as industry generally is being properly looked after and for these reasons er although we support er the orders before er the house tonight we have no hesitation at all in ensuring that they are debated properly than not something that should simply go through on the nod
hear
mr anthony
madam deputy speaker
i think erm a as you've kindly called me er i think i will try and make this debate a little more lively erm but i'm not sure about being controversial er because here i was last week i was making a speech about the significance of er the deregulation of contracting out bill and er i said then that the bill is so important because it is the first major attempt by government to UNK the red tape UNK
the UNK that man UNK nothing from history is often proved true that the bill i said shows the government learning from history
er i went on to say throughout the ages the government has UNK legislation there's nothing new about UNK legislation it is UNK either because it is proved UNK or because it's simply UNK its shelf life
i went on to say in the new world in which we live legislation has grown like UNK and thus requires more drastic UNK
those in the house who are UNK know that UNK grow UNK and to keep trees and UNK in fine condition UNK is essential
madam deputy speaker nineteen eighty nine there were five times more pages of legislation than in nineteen seventy nine
brussels UNK out five volumes of legislation before we joined the european community
it now UNK out thirty seven volumes each year
however the cause is not simply too many UNK in brussels directors of the commission are often sensible and come in general terms to britain suggesting a simple way of dealing with the problem
trouble is once a directive hits whitehall UNK of officials are UNK into action taking time and effort to interpret and rewrite the directive
madam deputy speaker throughout my speech last week i got approval er from the front bench i got UNK from my colleagues and UNK and a hear hears whenever i said anything about deregulation
we have the president of the board of trade and industry making a UNK speech and saying that four hundred and forty proposals as a result of the booklet called cutting red tape were either being implemented or under active consideration and he talked about the explanatory guide to the bill the new scrutiny committee that might be set up in each house he spoke about the business task forces that had made over six hundred recommendations the debate i thought UNK was er i thought the debate UNK er a new age where over UNK would be a thing of the past
where whitehall UNK would be sat on especially those who were involved in over interpreting general directives from brussels and this side of the house has been UNK for position i am told in order to get on the standing committee which is about to start upstairs
the aim of that bill is to cut back on rules and regulations to reduce the number of statutory instruments which in nineteen ninety two reached a record level of three thousand three hundred and fifty nine yes three thousand three hundred and fifty nine statutory instruments and here we are debating banks
the UNK member continues er are we being treated to a UNK of the speech made recently because i think it would be more appropriate if the honourable member discussed the orders tonight otherwise there will be a bit a UNK from the chair
madam deputy speaker erm there'll be no need for any UNK from the chair because i had just mentioned the word banks at the very point that you madam speaker got up and i can assure that er UNK would not be in order
here was that er we're debating banks and banking regulations building UNK society orders auditors regulations and financial services rules
madam deputy speaker i didn't mention those at all in the speech i gave last week which was so UNK received by the house
here are all my colleagues rushing upstairs with great enthusiasm UNK into the committee room anxious to get on to UNK the ever growing number of rules and regulations and whilst they're upstairs UNK getting on with it here we are downstairs passing more things which we say we don't want to do
will the honourable member give way
yes
in favour er in his pursuit of er deregulation in UNK all regulations er about fraud attempts to stop fraud controls on fraud and is like this is deregulation going to be a UNK fun day
where is the problem
every regulation that this house pass is always a good reason for it
you'll find whether it be anything with safety hygiene or security and fraud there will always be quite rightly a pressure group or an interest group that will push for that rule or regulation
so i'm not a for a moment suggesting that some rules and regulations aren't needed and i think that er the trouble is that every rule and regulation that is passed in this house there's always an excuse for it and there's usually a very good reason for it but that is the problem that the government faces and it's quite fairly er a problem the treasury face when they introduce these statutory instruments because er no one can disagree that fraud must be UNK out all i'm actually saying is that unfortunately upstairs we have a deregulation bill going ahead at all pace with hundreds of clauses and hundreds of new rules to try and red hundreds of new clauses to reduce the number of rules and here we are downstairs on the floor we have passing for very good reason perhaps more rules and regulations and there are four more tonight and i believe that every government department madam deputy speaker has a minister specially appointed to keep an eye on deregulation and i just wondered although er my honourable friend on the front bench mentioned that er the even the d t i minister responsible for deregulation has looked at these i wonder if there is a minister in the treasury they've actually put a minister in the treasury responsible for deregulation or is the ministry actually above deregulation because i think that er i got the impression that the that every ministry would have a deregulation minister and i think it would be rather useful to know who the deregulation minister is in the treasury
i know er it's been looked at by the d t i but has it been looked at by the treasury itself
you see madam deputy speaker deregulation unless we're very careful could just become another layer of bureaucracy with a whole new sub culture of civil servants being consulted as to whether something should be UNK or not
UNK of what's going on next door it could be a huge UNK deregulation the new in thing
there'll be a new quango there'll be a new s f r a there'll be a government ministers er and a lot of UNK civil servants we already have the deregulation unit
my concern madam deputy speaker is whether we're all being UNK into believing that deregulation bill is opening a new chapter in our legislative history when in fact it's no more than perhaps a UNK word describing one thing but er another thing is happening
i'm sure the minister does have a very good reason as to why these four statutory instruments are needed and i'm sure both sides of the house recognise that they're needed
but i've been on an immense number of statutory instruments upstairs er and everybody says they're greatly needed they usually say they're greatly needed because they want to go out in three or four minutes and ten thirty comes and ten thirty five they're out
er i mean deregulation a bill er is not perhaps gonna affect the numbers of statutory instruments going through the house and i think that er the city would continue without the statutory instrument er i think the country would continue it would go on if we'd hadn't passed these regulations and in essence are these four new statutory instruments really going to help run the country more effectively er are we imposing duties on auditors er and regulators er with the UNK er tied up with the investment board another quango er do we need all this
and then of course the insurance regulations have a compliance cost assessment
have the other statutory instruments have a compliance cost assessment
and the most interesting thing is that er the UNK found it difficult to assess the extent of any additional cost arising from deregulation so you had a regulation you had a compliance cost assessment and you had employed people consulted as to whether in fact that statutory instrument was gonna cost any more
i wonder how much that cost
so i do think it's an industry which is very dangerous now and which could well get out of hand
i think madam speaker we seem to live in UNK land
we seem to be able to argue vigorously and UNK about anything and equally UNK on reflection that we didn't really need the rule and regulation in the first place
as a nation we are now obsessed to the point of UNK with rules and regulations
it's surprising one can move without some rule UNK on one's freedom so concerned is the state on the issues of welfare hygiene security and safety matters
order er the honourable gentleman seems to have forgotten my previous warning we're not discussing all manner of rules and regulations we have four statutory instruments and he must address himself to those
i do hear what you say but these four regulations are in the framework of the whole government policy towards rules and regulations
one can't actually separate them although you will try to from all the other rules and regulations we are passing all over the place
what i am trying to do is to is to question the wisdom of introducing more rules and regulations and every time i try and raise this issue whether it be in standing committee or on the floor of the house quite UNK the chairman or the speaker deputy speaker in your case raises the point that in fact i'm going outside the rules and regulations and the result is you can never challenge the whole principle because every time one tries to challenge it one gets up and that's the disease i'm afraid we've now er facing in this country
but madam deputy speaker i will appear
may i remind the honourable member that there is no reason why he should not tear to pieces these four statutory instruments if that's what he wishes but that is what he must do not deal with all the others
i am grateful for that direction
in fact in my own way though i'm not as clear as some honourable members i was actually doing that erm but er i was pointing out that these were better than most although all of them could we could have perhaps done without
madam deputy speaker i was gonna give a very UNK example of what i'm talking about but perhaps i will allow the house to have that example on another occasion because i actually would prefer not to be er prevented from giving you the most vivid story of what i'm talking about
but clearly this isn't the right place er but i'm never sh
i'm never sure madam actually when is the right place is but it's certainly not now erm madam deputy speaker
i'm just wondering er the statutory instruments we're passing tonight er and i did raise this point to the minister about the drain on the private sector every time a rule and regulation is passed
i think it was UNK to learn that er these er these rules and regulations will not impact on private enterprise
because it would be bad news for the country if we are UNK another fight between the private sector and the state and i hope that we're not going to see in the whole rules and regulation industry versus er the public a sort of repeat of the UNK final fight er with never knowing who in fact er wins as the battle of o of continues
madam deputy speaker i only wanted to make a short intervention er on this point and i think i will return to it from time to time because it is a UNK annual problem of every time the minister introduces a rule and regulation we can understand it's extremely useful and how can one say that er regulations about fraud are not useful it's just the culture of our country has been UNK by these rules and regulations and i'm surprised that anybody can actually make any profit or do any business simply because of the weight of UNK and the weight of rules and regulations which prevents them from getting above er the surface
i think that that's really the message which i'm quite sure er the economic secretary has got er and i do apologise if i have UNK the point but i will be doing so until we can have a situation where we don't go on passing more rules and regulations but in fact all the legislation coming to the house is purely UNK legislation so we don't actually need any fresh legislation we just UNK what in fact er we have introduced er because it is it is er not helpful to the prosperity of this country
mr austin UNK
won't attempt to follow the honourable UNK er of his speech last week on deregulation bill
except to note that now that the right honourable member for UNK is publishing his former speeches as a video it is rather a cheap operation to come and repeat them in the chamber er rather than putting them out er for public consumption there are places where he could repeat the kind of speeches just given unfortunately the government is closing most of them down at the moment and putting the cut the UNK out in the community er but it had no relevance to the er the subject we're dealing with today
talking of UNK madam er deputy speaker er i almost feel i'm involved in a series of UNK with the er with the minister himself because er in a series of bills er committees in the eighties standing committees on the building societies bill on the banking bill on the financial services er bill as they all were er he was speaking at that time er in favour of more effective regulation backing the votes of this side er for kind the kind of policies it's introducing today
they were speaking in favour of it now here he comes along er and er we we're i find myself UNK i think because er his er a minister very well informed in these areas with er who made in those committees a very powerful and effective contribution now we find ourselves on the er opposite side but i have to say now that we are on opposite side that what is introducing today er is really er too little er and far too er too late
it's inadequate er and it creates the impression in my mind the very possibility that the government is actually is in favour of fraud because they're doing to little far too little er and these regulations are far too little er to actually stop it down
is it that the UNK are the only section of society that is going to vote for the conservatives er at the at the at the next election because certainly er the reputation of the city of london er is going down all the time because of the UNK that are being UNK there a and the government is UNK behind er in catching up and in providing an effective regulatory framework er that's going to deal er with them
this madam deputy speaker is no way to regulate for a major issue
we've had no inquiry
these er orders today aren't based on a thorough inquiry er into how audits on the financial institutions are conducted what's wrong with them what goes wrong not even a thorough er inquiry into what happened in the b c i case er we can't UNK we can't UNK or regulate i put it without er a thorough inquiry and yet here we have er orders brought in er without inquiry
the they're not fitted in to any framework of stronger structures to back er the proposals put before us er t today
we have a confused and UNK structure er the honourable member might be interested in just how confused it is er and how it can be UNK by er going along with the proposals we're putting forward on this side of the er the house because there's so many UNK authorities it's just not clear who's actually responsible for enforcement and compliance
i mean if you take the regulatory we did it with today that it consists of the bank of england the UNK and investment board twenty four organisations of the s i b s siblings you might call them er under it the building societies commission the police the serious fraud office the department of trade and industry the london stock exchange the inland revenue five recognised UNK bodies all those dealing with er auditors and the others it's chaos er and nobody knows who is responsible for what and in that chaos you get UNK decisions er and conflicting regulations everybody tries to ensure themselves by UNK too much er and it's a situation which UNK needs UNK but we don't have any proposals for UNK and making that work er frame work more effective to back up er this er simple proposal today
all we have is the government time from time to time UNK up the regulations as its er as its er it its doing here
you cannot rely on them deputy speaker if the government is doing er in these orders er on auditors to be er the effective and certainly not the only er police force of financial institutions
they can't relied on as a guarantee of public interest and UNK as a counter against fraud because their powers their role their functions the way they carry on their business is inadequate to deal with that particular area
honourable member what he's really saying as i understand it madam speaker is there's too much bureaucracy and the bureaucracy is going to prevent anybody acting because they're all UNK they're all paid out of presumably the public purse as well there's a there's a enormous number of public off officials that is preventing er a clear direct UNK executive arm
is that what he's saying
