she absolutely could not move because her level of arousal was so high she had no performance her performance being walking in that case
well but i mean that's an example and as i say at this end where you've no arousal you're either asleep or dead there's no sort of performance of any sort and we talk about having those UNK in the stomach don't we
we talk about the UNK and that that's to do with this effect of the UNK in the system
now the professional UNK is the one who can get them to fly in formation
it's not about being able to get rid of them totally and we agree that we need some sort of level of arousal it's being able to perform despite them to use that arousal to put into an effective presentation and that's what this two days is about is getting those UNK for you to fly in formation
to be able to actually present effectively whilst still having those UNK whilst still having that slightly anxious feeling
i get it i get it every time i come into one of these but i hope that i've got it in got them in formation
now the purpose of therefore of this training course and any training course is to do this is to be able to handle the arousal and increase your level of performance and even get the peak to move that way so for any level of arousal you're getting better performance but you're also able to handle a bit more UNK a bit more of the nerves in order to perform effectively and apart from a training course like this how do you achieve that
experience
experience which is based on
practice
practice doing it yep
so when i said to bob this morning was it bob i said don't i don't have a magic UNK that's gonna get rid of them but what i hope i'm gonna give you over these two days is a system whereby you can use that and can support you so you're able to effectively present despite having the nerves and be able to put over your point of view effectively yeah
how do you feel about that yeah okay
yeah
everybody happy well i you just sort of went like that and i wasn't quite sure whether you was sort
it was an early morning
oh sorry so that's what it's what it's about so what we want to do then over these next two days is to develop the skills of design and delivery and will allow us to do that allow us to improve our performance despite the fact that we do have the nerves and by practice by doing it by putting yourself in the situation where you have to make a presentation and almost as one chap said one time sitting there actually with your sitting there remembering he said actually volunteer to make presentations to the other people there
but it's about doing that and about being able to practice and use these skills and techniques so that we can improve performance
so let's look at what we can do then
well okay this morning what i'd like to do in the half hour or so that we've got before lunch is to talk about the skills we need when we actually come up here to deliver then this afternoon we'll look at that feedback from the video and what you did and then we'll move on to the skills of design the preparation skills
so when we come up here to make a presentation let's put aside at the moment the content of what we actually say what do we what do we need to think about
what are the areas that we need to think about the skills that we need to develop
the way you look
the way you look your appearance in a way is what you're saying yeah
your stance
your stance the way you stand that's right those sorts of things
body language
body language yes we'll talk a little bit about body language and take that just a little bit further
the people who you're delivering to delivering the presentation to and whether they understand
right okay whether they understand yes so how you get the contact with them yes
how you maintain their interest and how you get feedback from them
okay let's put those sorts of ideas you turn to page three in the notes you'll see there's a UNK there
okay so we're going to concentrate on the left hand side for the moment
the delivery skills thing
okay now we talked about things like as tony said body language er we talked about things like er contact with the audience but what fundamentally are we doing when we stand up here
talking
talking right
so what's that about
well i mean what's er what do we have to think about
communication
yeah communication in general possibly about breathing about the way we use the voice yes and of course the words we actually use
accent
accent possibly yeah
well we'll talk about that because joanne you and i er have accents don't we
yeah
that are not the standard english shall we say something like that
so let's think of all first of all then about the voice
now there's a word i'm going to use right now which is a technical term in a way and that is er the technical term for the study of language and how we speak the word what we say and how we say it
it goes under the lovely title of UNK
para yeah that's right yeah
UNK is the study of the words we say and how we say them
so quite obviously the how we say things is all to do with the voice isn't it
now i've got four letter ps to do with the voice er and what i want to do is think about the comparison of aspects of the voice when we have a normal one to one conversation and compare that with the same aspects when we're making a presentation standing in front of a group
first of all power
the power of the voice
how do we need to adjust the power when we're making a presentation
to the size of the audience
to the size absolutely to the size of the audience so if we say a one to one we've got a certain level of UNK power if you say so with a group like this it has to be
just raised slightly doesn't it yes and obviously if you've got fifty people and you don't have a microphone or anything then it becomes even more so
you get much above about fifty people you perhaps do need a some technical assistance with the power
so the power needs to be just slightly raised okay
now another p anybody think of other ps to do with the voice
pitch
pitch that's yes
now pitch is to do with er technically to do with the frequency isn't it the high or low pitch like on a piano from high notes to low notes
what do we need to ensure in terms of pitch when we're speaking to a group of people
variety
sorry
variety
variety that's right there has to be variety because if you talk in a UNK all the time then it all becomes rather boring doesn't it
so there's got to be variations in the pitch
power pitch there's one i want to squeeze in between but i mean it doesn't matter
pace
pace yeah
in a way projection is sort of with power
pace that's right you've been UNK and looking on looking on the next page
that's right
the pace okay
the speed at which we speak okay
yeah
power and pace and pitch and pause
yes okay
let's just go back to the pace then
how does the pace want to be compared with normal con one to one conversation perhaps
slightly slower
slightly slower just so that the words come over a bit clearer yes so people can actually take in what you say okay
now the pause how about the pause
to get attention
you do don't you
it gives emphasis it attracts people's attention
sorry
pregnant pause
pregnant UNK that's right a pregnant pause isn't it
i mean
but it's perhaps one of the most difficult things when you start out doing presentations isn't it
because you get that silence in the room and UNK you want to fill it so but you're right the use of the pause effective and particularly with a variation in pitch that gives that emphasis the two combined together can be very effective
okay so the power the pace the pitch and the pause all to do with voice and slight variations on those compared with normal one to one conversation okay
so that's about the voice itself now under UNK also comes that the concept of words
words are i mean what are words
a simple thing to say but what are words
expression
yes er but what do they express then
sorry
feelings
could express feelings yes
facts
thoughts
facts feelings yes thoughts absolutely there a code aren't they
i mean if you speak three different languages you could use three different words to put the same sort of thought of a picture dog UNK hound there's probably an italian and a and that but if you speak the languages then different words different codes if you like are for the same idea
so that's what words are about
now UNK any anybody here like me from yorkshire
no you're from slightly further north
you're from yorkshire
sometime ago
sometime ago right so you may catch this and you're from slightly further north than that i think
right okay
anybody from the liverpool area
no okay
if i said to john and joanne erm that i saw a boy running up the UNK no you understand
you do you do
yeah
i know what you said but i dunno what a UNK is
okay a UNK
i don't know what a UNK is either
no
no
yes
but i know what you're saying
alright yeah okay you see the point that it's words what the UNK he talking
no i know exactly
oh you did yeah it's er no but i mean in terms of the actual word you don't know what it is
no
er it's about geography isn't it er coming from different areas of the country
right let me just explain then just for the sake of UNK
erm in the days when they had terraced houses back to back terraced houses erm well anywhere in the country i guess but where i come from it was fine for the people who lived with their doors on the on the road but the people who lived at the other side of the block they couldn't get from the road so every so often down the down the terrace they had a little UNK way an entry i think you'd probably call it in scotland don't they
we talking about this and i was saying about coming from construction i says i've says i've to go up the cut like
oh the cut yeah
where i call the cut and he's going the cut what cut that's the UNK i says up the cut between the two the two buildings she said no that's the UNK
that's the UNK yeah or the UNK or the UNK you know or in liverpool they call it a UNK
or the cut
yeah so you see the point if you're making a presentation and you use words like that based on where you come from the geography you know your regional variations then it's a bit it's a bit difficult for er effective communication isn't it
so we have think about making sure that we use or if we use a word and people don't understand it
explain it
explain it absolutely now so that's about words based on geographical variations or regional variations within the country er something to be avoided but what about in the industry you're in
jargon
jargon
absolutely yeah
now there's a word that covers that and that the choice of words based on getting it right for the audience particularly in terms of jargon is what is called UNK
UNK choosing words in if you think of a parallel with blacksmith a blacksmith takes base metal and sort of bends it and shapes it to the appropriate shape
choosing the right words for the audience particularly based on jargon is what's called UNK
now somebody said they got involved in UNK meetings yeah
mike who might you have as an audience in a UNK er hang on er UNK everybody understand UNK
let's make sure we didn't use any term that everybody understands yeah
understand what
right exactly because you might you might have the client or a representative of the client as well as architects and people who would so you have to be careful don't you in terms of using the right words
so your presentation would be
UNK
UNK that's right
where the jargon might arise would be perhaps in response to questions from an architect for instance yes
technical yeah the technical people but you have to ensure don't you that with your audience that you understand who they are but if you don't then you have to keep it to a common UNK
yeah and that's about UNK choosing the right words for the for the appropriate to the audience and of course jargon the industry jargon erm is the thing you've got to watch
okay so that's about UNK about the way we use the voice in a presentation and the way we chose the words so that we have effective communication with our audience
okay
now was it tony who said about body language yep
yep
now body language if we move on to that
if you read books on body language then erm that says erm i'm not quite sure what i'm talking about yes i'm not being UNK and that means that i'm really not being really very UNK or again i'm unsure
but what could it also mean
UNK ear
you've got an UNK ear or an UNK absolutely yeah
that it exactly that
so body language if you read a lot of the books on body language it takes one single action and it UNK it based on that
now if we take it just one step further there was a lady well there still is a lady called and she did some research what she was trying to look at was the sort of body language if you like the actions that people er use and associate that to their personality and she looked particularly at people who were open positive UNK i suppose but people who were open UNK and looked at the sort of things they did and also at people who perhaps weren't quite so honest and open and UNK
and she didn't take individual actions what she took was what she called UNK
UNK of actions so she looked at things like the use of the hands the use of the feet the use of the eyes erm and what she called the centre line
the body's centre line and she UNK that and what she said was in terms of the hands that people who were open and positive UNK used on average more symmetrical open palm gestures than individual or closed palm gestures non symmetrical
and if you look at there are certain er types of people in history who use very non symmetrical hand gestures who perhaps you might say were not the most open UNK in the world
and if you take a film of erm hitler and er people of that UNK in the second world war and you analyse almost frame by frame you'll see that and count the number of non symmetrical hand gestures you will find that they're quite high as a percentage
now i'm not saying that we stand here and all we do is that because when you want to emphasise a point then sometimes a single non symmetrical a single hand gesture is more appropriate
but on average you will find er and you look at people in the pub you look in the bar tonight at the people having conversations and see how many symmetrical hand gestures there are
it's quite interesting
what i'm talking about here are not things that are unnatural but things that er will come naturally as you relax into your presentation
are you suggesting that
absolutely and you will find when we look on the video the number of people who held up a piece of paper if you hold things up and i'm holding this now because i'm about to write but if you stand here and hold a piece of paper then it's very difficult to make symmetrical palm gestures open palm gestures
so that is one thing as i develop this theme you'll see
so of course the next question comes well how do you manage to put it down i guess hands we'll come on to that
okay
now another thing as i said that she looked at in terms of UNK was the centre line
now ladies and gentlemen we all know that there are certain parts of the body that it is quite natural that we like to protect
such as a direct free kick
erm and ladies perhaps would tend to do the same sort of thing
now what that does of course is close off the centre line and what found was that people who were positive UNK as they spoke to somebody they presented the centre line to them
now if i'm presenting my centre line to tony and speaking to him that feels fine yeah but if i talk to you dave over my shoulder like that i mean how does that feel
talk to you and tell you something you know
it feels as though i don't care
lack of interest
lack of interest that's right
so presenting the centre line and okay we're going to come on to the eye contact as well in a moment presenting the centre line with eye contact means that it feels much more positive for the audience in terms of the delivery
so the centre line is an is an important aspect of now if you're holding your notes yeah i mean that's not a very open sort of centre line is it because i've got this as a barrier
in a way this standing behind and it's unfortunate we have to have something as big as this table er and if i stand behind it then you know UNK not getting my full centre line yep
so standing behind a barrier is another thing
the third aspect the third aspect that er noticed was movement of the feet whilst in this sort of a situation
in any communication and mike used that term and this is what this is about in communication there is a gap it doesn't matter whether it's you know writing a letter making a phone call or just standing this sort of distance away
there's a gap over which these words have to flow
yes there's a gap in this communication
now if i stood here all the time for two days and presented to you just standing here do your eyes move have to move if you're watching me all the time your eyes are fixed aren't they in one position
yeah and the problem is that because you have to look in one position it means that the whole thing becomes boring and your interest starts to drift
but if i'm moving around slightly like this and you're having to follow with your eyes as i'm making my presentation it brings variety to it brings that bit of variety like you said earlier that it brings some interest to it
so just small movements of the feet i'm not talking well there's a classic one i had when i was at college we had a lecturer imagine a big lecture theatre you know two hundred people and there was there was a board and he presented his lecture like this plenty of foot movement but he presented his lecture like and he just walked up and down
well i mean what do you end up doing if somebody makes a presentation like that
give up watching
you either give up watching or you keep a score don't you yeah
how many times he's gonna walk in the next minute you know let's time
you don't listen to what he's saying because you know just it just becomes so it takes your attention away
but small movement a little bit of movement around and some people did as we'll see when we look at the video this afternoon but some people you know grew roots er it becomes that way
again it's part of the UNK yeah i'm gonna put me notes down there and i'm not gonna hold them i you know i don't want to be anywhere away from them so it's all tied up with the preparation as well
but some movement of the feet er is important to keep variety
so that's what er worked on connection between the cluster of movements and sort of advanced body language if you like and the personality so someone who is perceived as using UNK symmetrical palm gestures and open centre line and some movement in the feet is seen more as a as a positive UNK a more open UNK and it UNK the quality of the presentation
now there was one other thing that was mentioned
the third aspect was contact with the audience yeah
audience contact
why is it important to have audience contact in your presentation
just to make sure that they think that you're talking to them
absolutely so they feel involved don't they
they feel involved as part of the presentation
that helps the audience feel involved but what does it do for you as a UNK
what can it do
helps you get your point across
yes indeed it also gives you some
gauge the reaction
yeah gauge the reaction some feedback
gauge people's reaction you know as i said to you earlier are you with that mike because of all i had contact and i thought i saw you
i dropped off
and you dropped off well that is the other important thing isn't it because part of the feedback is you know am i interesting everybody you know
are they with me on this or am i boring the UNK off them yeah
and you may then want to adjust the presentation
so audience contact
what's the what's the primary method of getting contact with the audience
well the method
eyes
looking at them
yeah using the eyes yeah okay
both to feel to make them feel involved and to er gauge the reaction gauge how things are going so you can er get some feedback on how you're doing
okay
you need to keep their interest don't you
oh absolutely yes i mean i mean
the effect
sure erm no amount of audience contact will compensate for a boring subject
yeah oh yes i erm i'm not saying that and that's when we come on to the design and the content that we put in
yeah you're absolutely right very important point yeah no amount of eye contact is going to compensate for something that doesn't hold their interest
okay
what else then what other methods do we have besides having eye contact what else might we do to involve the audience to make them feel involved
questions
yes absolutely so questions er a very definite way of involving the audience and again it gives a measure of feedback doesn't it because if you get the right answer you know that they are with you and you know they are understanding what you have to say
but obviously if there's some hesitation over it then perhaps you just need to step back a stage in what you're saying and er go over it again to for clarity and tony what's another way of involving the audience
well you've got to get them to participate but i suppose you would do if you question them
well yes i guess you would
jeff what's another way that you might make the audience feel that they're involved
mike
well yes okay that's a possibility and that's something that we'll come on to tomorrow
but in terms of audience contact sarah
jokes
well yeah a bit of humour a bit of humour
smile at them
smile at them well yeah okay
bob another way of involving the audience making them feel part of it
ask them to relate their experiences
yes okay but that in a way comes under questions doesn't it yes
ask them
yes
look directly at them
well yeah that's eye contact
well done thank you
i got it with the fourth one
yeah that's right that's right you were just waiting for me to say tom weren't you yes that's fine
and some of you some of you did that this morning although you may not have realised it er but you said well like rob said and er just making people feel part of it by using their names and that's exactly the purpose of having these UNK in front and why i asked you to use erm to put your name on them is so that we can do that
so that we can use people's names as part of the presentation and yeah you know he actually noticed what i said and that sort of thing
so they feel really part of er part of it
sometimes i've er okay so it seems like it seems like a terrific amount to think about while you're standing here doesn't it as well as thinking about what you're actually the content of what you're actually going to say
but a lot of these things come quite naturally er i hope we'll see on when we look at the video that really i don't think anybody had a major problem with the voice er and the words as well when you're talking about two million pounds so in terms of the voice i don't believe anybody has any major problems
there may be one or two when we might just say well perhaps just a little bit more volume but it's not perhaps just er UNK off on the pace a little bit
so i don't think in terms of UNK anybody here has a major problem
but when we come to look at the cluster and the and the audience contact then you know we may see something a little bit different okay but er those are the important aspects things like things like whoops the use of the hands you know several people put their hands in their pockets or put them behind their back or something like that
now that is you know what do you do with these things i mean they're a nuisance when it comes to making a presentation
the secret i find and you may over the next day or day and a half to a couple of days you may well see me just do that occasionally i'll just throw my hands back down to me side
if they get in if they start getting in the way the best thing to do is just let them relax to the side and try and forget about them i know it's difficult to forget about them but just to the conscious effort with the hands is just to put them at the side
then as you start to make the point you'll find your hands will come up naturally and bend from the UNK it sounds crazy to say but if you suddenly go UNK i've got everything in me pocket but
just do that that's what i find is the best thing to do and then carry on with what you have to say and then the gestures become quite natural because all of this is not i'm not trying to
six pairs of UNK and then expanded by okay now that that's fine but how do you move on and where do you move on to in order to get that structured thought pattern
if you're going to come and stand and present something to somebody there's got to be a reason for it
yes there must be a reason and as i'm sure i mean like the objective and then what you can do at this stage in the design process is once you've got the objective then you select those themes or ideas from your what you've done just now to support that objective so that when you come up my objective is to convince you or my objective is to inform you then the information that you're going to give out supports that objective
so one thing that was mentioned this morning was somebody wanted to be able to be more persuasive in order to put a point of view across
if you can clearly state what your objective is what you're trying to persuade the audience to then everything you say supports that and you stand a better chance of being persuasive
yes
it seems fairly obvious so what do we do
well we've got to select a number of themes to support a given objective
how many themes do we select
so what you've got there is a mass of you've got six twelve words on the first circle and then you've got twenty four words on the outer circle are you gonna dump all that information on to the audience to try and persuade them of your objective
there's only so much that anybody's brain can handle at any one time so let's just do a little experiment because there was a chap called george UNK an american UNK who worked on this idea of what is the capacity of the brain how many bits of information can the brain hold on to at any given time
if you turn to page eight what's that john
i'm useless at this
i know what's coming
you know what's coming
george UNK called this the span of conception
the capacity of the brain to UNK or hold on to any information
you'll see there we've got three UNK a six number a ten number and a twelve number
what i'm gonna do is just speak out a six UNK number
what i want you to do is try and hold on to it in your brain then when i've finished write it down in the appropriate box and see if you can hold on to it long enough to do that
so the first number listen to this the first number and try and hold on to it
three eight one five six two
just write that down
okay
let's try and ten UNK number then
listen to ten UNK try to hold on to them and then write them down
seven four two nine eight one three four seven six
i've gone wrong
okay try a twelve UNK just for the experiment
try and hold on to twelve numbers here we go
listen to these
nine o five one six two four seven three eight two seven
now that's it's interesting what joanne said that you lost it in the middle somewhere yeah
i mean er let's just read them just see how you got on
three eight one five six two
okay seven four two nine eight one three four seven six
i've got the mixed up
yeah and nine o five one six two four seven three eight two seven
say that one again
nine o five one six two four seven three eight two seven
nearly got it
so but i mean where was it
was it generally in the middle or at one end or
the first the first two numbers
yeah okay
after the first five numbers
that's it because what you well you either hold on to the first five or six and then you lose the rest or sometimes you remember the beginning and the end and you lose the bit in the middle ah
it's like that game that they used to play on UNK for those of you old enough to remember UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK yeah erm that's
a UNK
there was a game wasn't there that they played
UNK
so long as you got the question wrong you got a UNK if you got it right you got a prize
right that's right
and that's what the UNK like you've got to try and hold on to
UNK
all these UNK yeah
you've got to try and hold on to so much information that something eventually has to drop
because some people do get the ten and some people can get to twelve but guess how they do it
they chunk it up into pairs or groups of three or something like that so four groups of three or two groups of six or whatever because what UNK actually found was the span of conception was and is seven plus or minus two
people can hold on to seven plus or minus two bits of information and the plus or minus two he called the local factors which are you know whether it's warm out whether you feel warm or cold or whether or what time of day it is have you just had a heavy lunch whatever it might be
something that effects even the time of the year all sorts of things
so the maximum is nine that people can hold on to and the thing about nine of course is it splits up into three threes and that's why i say some people will group a twelve number into four threes or something like that or three fours because they're all well within this span of conception
so as it says at the bottom of page eight there's a golden rule for presenting is use three themes
okay
so the number of themes you use to support your objective is three and then for each of those themes you divide it into three UNK
remember what i did there i got three themes and for each one i got three UNK so that what you put over to them to the audience are those three themes
they're able to hold on to that for the UNK of the talk and be able to understand them as concepts and therefore it helps to put over the ideas
so we'll have a coffee break and then what i want you to do when you come back is i'll give you an objective for the talk that you're going to give based on that you've just done and then i want you to select three themes and three sub themes that will support the objective that you'll then be able to use
okay
right
start again
yes
the aldershot method
it goes under the nice little saying tell them what you're going to tell them then tell them and then tell them what you've told them
now you think about news at ten UNK you get the headlines
yeah
and you get the headlines and so it UNK you it emotionally UNK you for what's coming
give you headlines and then they start and they go they expand on each headline don't they
and then at the end they give you the headlines again they summarise it
absolutely and it does because it a it what dave says it's an emotional whole and you start off and you come back to where you started
it's a whole a complete and so it emotionally UNK with the headlines tell them what you're gonna tell them then you tell them it and then it UNK them by coming back to where you started
so in other words it's about an introduction an expansion and an end now as i've said tomorrow i'll fill in a bit more detail on those so if you leave some gaps there between those three sections
so an introduction
do you remember what i said about the er structured thought pattern you've now got in front of you let me go to mine which is all blank
the introduction is good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my name is i'd like to talk to you about flying and i hope to persuade you to come along on saturday and take part in some flying
and i'm going to talk to you about three things about the safety of flying about the cost aspects of flying and the enjoyment that you're going to get out of it when you take part
and that's my introduction i've told you what i'm gonna tell you
and then expand on it and so i go into each of these and i go to the and i say a few words about each of these particular themes
i won't go all through that again
and when i've expanded and i've told you then i then come back to my ending and i say okay so what i've done i've told you about three aspects of flying about the safety of it ab about the costs involved in taking part in flying and about the enjoyment you're gonna get out of flying and i hope that i've persuaded you that you will come along on saturday to take part and that's the ending
so it's use the red obviously the title and the UNK for your introduction to say what you're going to say then say it by using your UNK and then say what you've said by going back to the red and coming back to your objective
now coming back to the objective i say it leaves you on a high note then rather than the and that's all i'm gonna say tell them what you're gonna tell them then tell them then tell them what you've told them
okay
so that in a UNK is what it's about
so you've all got your structured thought pattern now yeah
yeah
right erm three minutes again so you can spot your timing now it's under a minute on each of those red things because you've got your introduction and your ending as well okay
so three minutes set the clock again as you did before and er one other thing i'd like you to do is as you come up is do something that UNK do huh and that is to er give an UNK
now you may see UNK you know when you see the UNK there's the lady with er erm
UNK
UNK thank you there's the lady with the UNK
then you see or somebody you know looking at the long jump and they're UNK away to themselves
well there're not normally saying will you get out the way before i throw this thing or i'll stab you with it
what they're actually doing is they're UNK to themselves they're UNK the performance improvement or the performance they're going to give
remember i asked you this morning to just after lunch to jot down what it was that you need to improve on just as you're setting the clock just say something like by the end of this talk i'd like you to congratulate me on having moved around a bit more having not put me hands in me pockets whatever it might be
yeah so just an UNK an UNK of what you intended
okay morning everybody
morning
let's a what are we going to be doing today then as UNK already observed because he's seen my notes it's going to be a very full day er so we need to crack on
what i'd like to do first of all is just to summarise wha what we did yesterday
just very quickly summarise that and what i'd like you to do is take notes in the new form that we've got now with er a thought pattern so if you
morning okay
excuse me
okay we've only barely started if you take a fresh piece of paper then a fresh sheet of paper and er the orientation that you now know we need to do if we're going to do if we're going to do a thought pattern
this morning
tom we're jus just gonna summarise what we did yesterday by means of a thought pattern
so if in the middle of the page you write day one let's just summarise er what we did yesterday
well it was twenty three hours i was going to say twenty four hours ago but twenty three hours
we started off with er some introductions and er the introductions you introduced yourself and we discussed the objectives that the company have and also the objectives that you have for the course
the objectives give us a way of er measuring at the end of the course whether the course has achieved for you what you wanted from we'll come back as i said to those this afternoon and just review them to see that you got out of the course what you
okay having done that we discussed what the content of the course was going to be and then i asked you to make a first presentation
UNK presentation one and it was to last three minutes and the subject was what would i do if i won two million pounds and we recorded that er on the c t v for later playback
having done that we then talked about the problem that we all have on these sorts of occasions which is the problem of nerves and we talked about the symptoms of dry voice and the shaking limbs the UNK voice and the reasons why we have er these nerves and we also talked about the causes of the primitive UNK of fight or flight er how we get our body ready to handle this unusual situation
and we discussed the difference between anxiety and arousal and how we can turn our anxiety into arousal to ensure performance and i UNK a little graph if you remember
of performance against arousal levels and we agreed that the purpose of training like this and also putting these principles into practice is to be able to handle more and more arousal er more and more nerves and still and still be able to perform in a confident manner
we then talked about the first of those two towers of tower bridge if you remember which was about the skills that we need for er delivery
what are the skills that we need when we stand up in front of people to actually deliver what we have to say
and there were three aspects we looked at i wonder why it was three
i wonder why it was three
erm three aspects first of all there was that little word i gave you er to describe pa
UNK
thank you the voice and the words that we said UNK is correct
the study of the voice what we say and how we say it i then introduced you to if you like advanced body language and based on the work that UNK north did and rather than take an individual movement of the body we took a cluster and how many aspects where there to cluster i wonder there were three weren't there
hands feet centre level
okay so UNK the cluster and the other one was the need for audience contact
the way we get feedback from the audience the way we ensure that we involve the audience as well through the use of the eyes the names er and asking questions
and then we had the moment that a lot of you er weren't looking forward to which was playing the video back yes
and this gave you an opportunity to see yourself to see others and to take part in some UNK something that we did again yesterday and we shall be doing again today we then talked about the design aspect first of all we talked about er the way the brain is involved in this communication and some of the aspects of the brain
so the brain we talked about the two UNK the left and the right UNK the fact that the left is very much involved in a linear way whereas the right is involved in UNK way anybody remember the relative contribution of the two halves
yeah ten for the left and ninety for the right and the reason we talked about this and the way that's involved in communication is that we said well if there's a lot more power or a lot more contribution to the design of what we're doing of a UNK nature and that is how the UNK brain work more UNK in the UNK nature let's present what we have let's design it and then deliver it as close to a UNK nature as we can okay
that was the purpose of talking about the brain and the two the two aspects of it
and of course the left brain is very much involved in the words the right brain with the ideas so that's the creative side
okay then we used this er in a way that we're using it right now to er produce our design for what we were going to say through thought patterns
now nice UNK for thought patterns is UNK t h o p when we talk about thought patterns or UNK a method of gathering ideas a UNK a method of getting things down on paper so we don't lose them but not in a linear way in a UNK way a right brain activity
and what we did we created a framework first of all with six pairs of UNK pairs of UNK and er if you remember this happened in a fairly slow and UNK way very much a left brain activity saying well okay is this a valid pair of UNK to do with that
so that was that was a very much a left brain activity
we then moved on and expanded we expanded we brought with a minimum of two words to do with each of those twelve words that we generated and we did this in a much faster way a much more creative way a right brain activity
when i say a right brain of course it doesn't mean that the left UNK just shut down completely but it's predominantly a right brain activity it's the creative part
and then we use this method to then go a stage further to prepare for the second presentation
so i gave you a topic sport or a hobby or an interest that you had and you produced a thought pattern for that just as we'd done in the practice one with the subject of water but then we moved on a stage further to get what are called a structured thought pattern
structured thought which had as its main UNK three themes of course before you had that you had to have a clear objective which helped you to choose what those three themes were and why did we choose three as a based on
yeah
yeah yes verbally yes if we're writing we'd actually be six but it was it was the span of conception wasn't it the capacity of the brain the span of conception says that if you deliver your presentation in groups of three in three themes and three UNK then the audience is able to hold on to that and the way in which we set up the delivery or the way in which we delivered the structured thought pattern was through method
aldershot
aldershot method yeah which goes under the little the little UNK words can anybody remember
that's it that's it as dave described it it's an emotional whole it's er satisfying er to the UNK
it's complete in itself and er people by human nature like things to be complete or whole it is it is emotionally satisfying
so basically that was er an introduction an expansion and an ending
the aldershot method
got through quite a bit yesterday didn't we
quite a bit there er when you lay it out like that in a pattern a thought pattern which shows just how much er we did actually get through er from where you started at ten in the morning or just after with the presentation right through to the second presentation
there were a lot a lot involved there er and some of you actually found that there was quite a lot that you really had to almost worry about and think about and er yesterday for the first time of doing it with this new method it does take quite a bit of thinking about and as we agreed practice is what's important
incidentally everything i'm doing here whoops everything i'm doing here with you all the two days here is in thought patterns
so it does get used ha in a practical way
it would be very strange if i stood here saying don't use a linear script use thought patterns and yet i was reading everything off a linear script wouldn't it
you sort of wouldn't really believe that er i was serious about it
okay right what i'd like you to then select red on your pen
now in a way what you could say what we have here is a trunk of a tree and the branches and then the leaves and the fruit at different levels on this
what i'd like you to do is put a UNK round three words it doesn't matter where they are on the whole thought pattern three words that are the highlights what were the three things that were the highlights or the most important thing for you yesterday
for instance i might go erm that one that one and er that one
okay just a UNK round three er things that were the highlights for you yesterday the most important things that er came through to you yesterday
so he knows what's coming
the eyes don't ya
some a lot of you said yesterday that you don't always get in this formal situation having to stand up in front of people
but what if you have sort of meetings one to one or even in three or fours
so you know when you get in a meeting sometimes you've got a point of view on an agenda item and you think how where am i gonna get support for my point of view on the meeting
or you know you're in a meeting and the chairman what's your opinion john on this where you what do you think about this
a good way of doing it is the aldershot method how to your put your point across very clearly but also UNK you know short and to the point
so if somebody said to me what were the highlights for you yesterday aldershot method tell them what you tell them just list them
so what are the three important things for me yesterday were the aldershot method the arousal curve and the need for audience contact so i told them what i'm gonna tell them
now i tell them why if you're gonna tell somebody why your opinion is something the word because is bound to come into the sentence soon
so i've said i've listed them well the important points for me were the aldershot method the arousal curve and the need for audience content
the aldershot method was particularly important for me because i realised that it's something we use every day or we see every day er and it emotionally UNK the audience the UNK for what i'm going to say
tell them what you're going to tell them before you tell them and then summarise it at the end and tell them what you told them
it's emotionally satisfying it's a very important method to get a point across
the need for arousal thought well should i be absolutely calm when i'm giving a presentation but i never am so is it right and now understanding that you need a certain level of arousal to be able to perform at all is satisfying for me because at least i understand the situation now and able to work with it rather than against it
and audience content when you're making a presentation i feel that's very important because you need to have feedback as to how well things are going
if you don't look people in the eye if you don't involve them then they're not with you and if the audience aren't with you then the presentation doesn't
so for me the three points were the aldershot method er the importance of understanding arousal and the need for audience contact
do you see the aldershot method there you list then expand on each one saying why and then just summarise by listing again
yep
so can we try that just to from a seated position not from up the front
the best thing to do because having said that then i might say mike what's your opinion what was important to you and pass it on
so obviously if UNK been chosen once or he's done it he doesn't want somebody asking him again
so just jot down at the side of the page the other eleven names in the room okay everybody's tony mike jeff sarah bob rob gordon john tom joanne mike dave
just jot the other people's names down and then obviously when they've been they've said their piece just strike their name through so you don't go and
tony mike jeff sarah bob rob gordon john tom joanne mike dave
you should have eleven names down there are you alright can you see where have you got to rob
rob yeah gordon rob gordon john joanne mike and dave
okay right let's the meeting
so you've got your three points so remember the er the aldershot just list what they are then expand briefly on them then list them again and then invite somebody else to give their er their opinions
okay
morning everybody erm the three points that were important for me yesterday were the aldershot method the arousal curve and the need for audience contact
i particularly found the aldershot method important because what it gives you is a clear structure to what you have to say when you stand up if you're going to introduce by saying what you're going to say before you expand and then at the end summarise and bring it all back to a nice conclusion
it actually gives you a framework on which to base any few words or any talk that you have to give
arousal curve well understanding the need for arousal for me helped because i now understand that having nerves while you're speaking is not unnatural it isn't something that you're able to get rid of but you need to be able to work with it and practice to improve performance
and the need for audience contact i found particularly important because if you get feedback from the audience looking them in the eye involving them then you're able to know how your talk is progressing and whether you need to modify it in any way to be able to maintain the UNK interest
so in summary the three points for me were the aldershot method the arousal curve and the need for audience contact
bob what did you find yesterday
the cluster i found particularly er important and so like yourself the aldershot method and structured thought patterns er the cluster was important er because as you say when people have got nerves they need to get some basic guidelines for UNK the problem er we all tend to put our hands in our pockets and stand UNK to the spot and all the rest of it but there are ways of UNK it it's just a matter of practice erm the aldershot method is er obviously a very effective method erm if you get into the habit of doing it in threes er erm you see every day you use the news at ten news at ten analogy obviously
obviously UNK it's a very effective one and also the structured thought patterns idea er before you go into something to actually sit down and prepare something er your thoughts in a developing from there er it's a very simple thing to do but very effective
those are the three things the aldershot sorry the cluster the aldershot method and structured thought patterns yesterday
you were looking at me i knew you were going to say that
again the three things that came out for me yesterday were the structured thought patterns obviously the arousal and the need for audience contact
i found the erm structured thought patterns and the span of conception is very interesting in the fact that you do things in threes and obviously that gives a certain logic net to everything that you do and the way that you prepare your presentation
the arousal i've always thought that er that you shouldn't be nervous but you always are but obviously as you're nervous when you do a whole host of things and nerves as you become more skilled at it go away er and i'd assume that like most things that the nerves will totally disappear and was somewhat surprised to find out that you're always UNK
that's right
when you do that and obviously the need to gauge the erm presentation against audience contact to see that they're involved and they're obviously understanding what you're saying and pick them up and grab them
so for me the three things were the structured thought patterns plus the arousal and the need for audience contact
what did you think sarah
i found the three most important things for me yesterday were the span of conception the UNK and the whole subject of nerves
the span of conception useful to gather that three is the best number and dividing it up into threes and threes again was simplest and effective way of setting it up
UNK and nerves well again i always felt that nerves were supposed to go away when you got good at things now i'm pleased to discover that isn't true
i also found that the UNK was useful for we all said guidelines
what to do when you stand up there like an UNK so to sum up that the three most important things the span of conception nerves and UNK
erm from yesterday er i think meself personally i'm very UNK sort of person and i felt what was most important the UNK meself was thought patterns and the use of most structured in a presentation and also the importance i couldn't believe how that using them made such a difference actually to yourself when you're standing there and the audience participation erm thought patterns well i've always used that was just a revelation i mean i've never
thought it could be so easy to put me thoughts on a piece of paper could help me so much i think that's what i thought patterns structured
well yesterday the three things that i felt that were most useful to me was one the delivery two the UNK and the thought patterns
erm thought patterns being actually understanding laying it out and seeing the way it works which obviously structured thought patterns but it's the basis of and UNK erm actually delivering it your delivery erm of it using the cluster but the UNK was invaluable it was constructive criticism we all know what was wrong and it just helped yesterday for someone not to be UNK just to help you through it erm and i think all those three things became invaluable really mean because most of those leads on to the other ones structured erm so the sort of thought patterns the UNK and the was very good
well things that i learnt yesterday was erm aldershot method the structured thought patterns and the UNK erm the aldershot method is tremendous i liked that a lot for expansion editing UNK and first class and i will use it from now on
erm the aldershot method works or appears to work very well with structured thoughts the two merge together very well and erm again that's the putting down on paper i didn't believe that had actually talk at all and yet it works and as you read it things come into the brain and when you combined all that with the UNK and you can see what you're doing wrong the rest of it
again that's excellent but it's also to see yourself video
erm and realise that no you don't sound quite as bad as you think you might
so the three things that really got me yesterday was the aldershot method the structured thoughts and the UNK they all went together very well and rob let's see what he thinks
well the three things that er were most significant for me yesterday were the cluster the thought patterns and the aldershot method
erm the cluster makes you realise how you presented things to people what you can improve them having things in your hand that it just makes you erm more nervous because you're UNK about what makes me more nervous you're UNK about with something trying to do something that you don't really need to do
erm moving around er feet movement i didn't quite master that yesterday but it it's something that er i know that will come with time and er it'll all come together
the thought patterns like joanne and others the concept of putting a little circle down and one word in it and expanding that out and being able to stand around and talk erm for three minutes or ten minutes or whatever for a significant amount of time erm that was also a revelation to me
and along with that erm the aldershot method erm an introduction and expansion and an ending all on the same subject erm makes it a nice concise er little parcel erm for you to talk through
so the end the three things for me yesterday cluster thought patterns and the aldershot method
thank you very much
well for me exactly the same as bob sorry robert the aldershot method plus er the thought processes
the aldershot method because er it sort of explained to me the most effect way of getting across whatever you want to say so that made me a feel a bit happier about that
it also made me think that perhaps i had more control over the whole presentation generally which is my biggest concern so get up there and just do some and therefore it's going to go on to the confidence side of it
the cluster erm i was always very aware of this bit so it made me you know aware that there are things you can do and watching everybody just seemed just the answer inside you
it didn't look er odd it looked okay so that would make me a bit more confident i think a bit less self conscious
but the most important thing i thought was the thought process i mean just saying this while you were just going on i just UNK down in the same way you could come off with three ideas that around and i felt that was that was ideal
it keeps the your presentation and it stops those pregnant er UNK you know suddenly you realise christ i've forgotten lost the thing
so for me aldershot method cluster but most important was the thought patterns
gordon
er yes there the three things i got out of erm yesterday's course was the thought patterns the aldershot method and the delivery
the thought patterns allow me to erm put down what i wanted to talk about expand on it and at the same time break it down into areas and on the other and spend some time on each area
the aldershot method erm because it showing you how you broke that subject down allows you to erm introduce it expand on it and summarise at the end
er the delivery part it was more the cluster but the overall delivery allowed me to prepare how i was going to be standing er how to get the audience in contact with me the eye the eye contact and also the way i spoke
so to summarise the thought patterns the aldershot method jeff
the three things that came out of yesterday for meself were the aldershot method the delivery
the aldershot principally because it gave a structure to what i had to say at least went up there fairly confident of what i had
the delivery because it gave me what i had to think about when i was up there language body language and then the UNK i could look at the two things that mike just highlighted as one and two
the aldershot method the structure of what i said and the way the delivery had come across
the feedback gave me a review of those questions
so out of yesterday it was how to put the structure together as the delivery of how it came across and what the UNK reaction was to it
morning ladies and gentlemen
carry on mike and then to john
good morning ladies and gentlemen the three main items i got out of yesterday was the er structured thought patterns the cluster and the playback
the structured thought patterns i found that the most important because when i was up at the table on the second presentation i was able to have my thoughts relating to the layout already and with in fact just the single element of the subject shown on my paper i could immediately focus on that and in fact give the details of that right the way through
on the cluster erm not having in fact had any erm work on this type of thing before i didn't realise that holding a paper could close you down and in fact without moving my feet i wasn't getting movement i was just static and with no use of the hands you were to express yourself sufficiently
with the playback that in fact erm as has said it showed me what in fact i was doing right and wrong erm i've been on television before once when i was running the london UNK but this time it was actually me and me alone in a work element and i could in fact see what i was doing and why i was doing it and understand in fact the UNK from the morning to in fact the afternoon presentation when i came back for the second one
so the main elements for me were the thought process the cluster and the playback
now let's
john
john
erm the three things i er got most out of yesterday were the structured thought patterns playback and the audience contact
the structured the structured thought patterns gave me an actual er organisation to my talk be it only just a few words on a piece of paper it was simple yet er gave the organisation to the actual talk while you stood up in front of an audience
er the audience contact when you were actually stood up in the front and you're there on your own just getting a little bit of feedback from the audience itself er does help and then the playback which erm i think it helped a lot to see how you UNK particularly on that fir first attempt what areas you had to concentrate on to UNK your problems
so in summary the three main things i got out of yesterday were the structured thought patterns the playback and the audience contact
great thank you all very much indeed
so i hope you see that this aldershot method which several people have mentioned is a very effective way of UNK what you do here it can also be used very simply in a meeting just to be able to put your point across simply but effectively
so that's another situation and as we'll talk about and i UNK at yesterday er the UNK vote of thanks situation and the er giving of the gold watch and er and the being a best man at a wedding or even a bride or groom at a wedding er again is a is a way of helping this aldershot method is a way of helping you to get your thoughts together and put them across effectively
so what else are we going to do today then
two things i want to just touch on er fairly briefly er because of the time factor but i do want to touch on before you get into continuing with your er development for your third presentation
er the questions of how to handle questions and also the use of visual aids
let's do them the other way round let's talk first of all about the visual aids
why do we why do we use visual aids like the overhead UNK and the flip chart why do we use the things at all
about ninety per cent
it is it is in a way isn't it well very much so not just in a way it's very much because we have what's that saying we say a picture is UNK a thousand words yeah
if we can put something UNK it saves probably half an hour's explanation doesn't it if you don't have that so very much er the use of the right brain getting the point across visually er gets it across er much more quickly
so that's one benefit of using a visual aid is to is to put a point over er much more quickly
what others
going back to the same point again
you could indeed you could indeed it UNK a point doesn't it so i mean i so went back a few times with the UNK yesterday with things that we need to re reinforce yes
jeff you've a lot of experience of doing UNK what does it do for you as a UNK
i've used it to erm to develop the lecture
i let the audience draw their own thought patterns
yep
that produces something that then moves on to discussions
right
i call it no notes at all
right
and they write the lecture for me
they write yeah
they write the lecture as it takes place
yeah
yes
good preparation
well no there's actually there's a lot of preparation in that isn't there
well what i do it on is planning
oh yes
and er control of sub contractors then you get a mixed group from tarmac er different companies and their conception of what planning is and conception of what controlling sub contractor is
yeah
is totally different so i did the first lecture with what my idea of to find myself talking to a contract housing guy whose biggest order was two thousand pounds
right
so i've have them produce the lecture and then we've gone on from like doing
yep
exactly the thing
right
pick out three things and we'll talk about them
mm
and that's how i use visual aids
so it can actually be a stimulus can't it
so i then find myself doing nothing else but walking around so i go and ask
right
so it forces me
yes
out into the audience
well that's what you UNK at yesterday as well didn't it
i mean if you're here even now you've got your notes down rather than in your hand and you stand and read but you don't use that or you don't use that then there is that tendency isn't there to
so the focus of attention switches from people looking at me
yeah to the visual aid yes
to this to actually looking at what they're producing
right yes and that's an important factor that if you feel everybody's looking at you it is important
attention
it does it moves attention away just takes the little bit of the tension off you so you can do that as well
so it's it appeals to the right brain that visual aspect it can take attention it can actually make the UNK move around when it switches attention what does that do for the audience then
wakes them up
er absolutely yeah it keeps the interest going doesn't it
so it's an interest thing as well it keeps the interest it changes the emphasis switches the attention makes a break doesn't it just changes er a natural break that happens and it changes attention
so there's lots of reasons to illustrate the point then and another thing of course it does is if it's one you use on here it helps you remember you don't have to have that written down because it's there already produced if it's a pre prepared UNK as we call as we call it
so and it can break up a long session it can it can maintain interest
so two methods i'm going to talk about really is the overhead and the UNK
you may have caught me doing this some of you may have noticed that i try to force meself not to and it's something to remember
if i'm writing something up here and i talk to you while i'm writing up here then what does it do
it loses impact
it loses impact doesn't it because a the power of the voice is hit against there b it's very rude to talk while i've got me back to you as well so people yes lose interest
so while you're writing on the board have one of those UNK
now again it's oh there's silence in the room but while you're writing what are the audience doing if you're not speaking
watching
absolutely they're reading it with you so they're with you so you're holding their interest even though you're not actually saying anything yeah and again you may you may have noticed well another thing is once you've once you're written put the pen down and the easiest thing in the world to have a but if you want to make a point and you probably noticed once i once i put the red lines around the red boxes round there and i gave you the first demonstration of the aldershot method i stood here okay
now if i want to write something i can just turn like that and i'm not turning me back away
okay if you're left handed then i guess you're probably gonna feel more comfortable that way round erm but while you're using this and while you're making a point about what you've written just stand to the side of it i usually put me hand up have done there just make the points to be made yes
so that's the way to use that is not to talk to it but to have a silence while you're writing er and then to stand at the side while you making the points that are that are associated with what you've written up
i would recommend for any talk that you give that you don't use more than two types of visual aid
i know we used the video but that was for a very specific reason but if you know have you ever been to one of those lectures where there's overheads going on here and then they go and they write on there and they you have some slides and then you have a video and then you know it's like being at UNK
er if you stick to just two as a maximum er ah an overhead and a UNK or maybe a video and an overhead then it actually doesn't it really helps not to confuse the audience
that's actually all i want to say about the UNK unless anybody's any other comments i mean UNK you've obviously got a lot of experience in a do you feel there's any anything further than that i know i've covered it very briefly
well the only one that comes back to me is you've got the ability to review
that's right that's right you can you can
yep good it has that creative element about it doesn't it because as you say if you get them to produce it get the audience to help produce it then again it's involvement and the whole thing is erm more spontaneous than pre prepared
i mean if i'd done that this morning and i'd written it all up before you came in and then said well what we've done is this and then we did that and then we did that but as it was generated as we discussed then you were with me i hope at the way it went
it's quite important though to do it fairly neatly
oh indeed and i'm not the UNK writer in the world i will say and erm
i wasn't
no i know you weren't getting at me
i know i
that's right
the first time i get up well you see i UNK i have it lightly UNK in
well that's
you can do that
that's because that's
you want to start suddenly you find yourself either
i have i tell you i've done that before now and then that one ends up right down in the bottom corner
and it's
it just it just takes the edge off it so it is a good tip actually it's just if you've time beforehand is just even as you were saying producing a thought pattern like this even just doing the first level just in pencil
i've actually seen erm er been in a workshop as a UNK where a chap who was excellent at this had what he did was while the participants were doing some sort of an exercise he was actually making these tiny notes up in the top corner for himself so that when he when he came to the next sort of section that he wanted he'd got he'd got the odd notes just up there in the corner
so again that's something you can do but yes good tips thank you jeff
just doing it in pencil lightly in pencil beforehand
UNK does that
yeah he does doesn't he yeah that's right
i don't do it on that i do it on a big UNK
that's right that's right yeah there is that but
well the way i do it is i try and avoid the lecture lecturer
yes
because i assume the audience knows as much about control and sub contractors as i do
right
but the idea is to get their ideas so that you can tell somebody else how you do it on your side then you can tell somebody else
yeah
the need i need to change information
yeah
it brings out some interesting ideas
i bet it does
and i the UNK
yeah
and that's the only way it's amazing we ever get any sort of
right let me just then talk very briefly about this fella
now we're fortunate with this that if i turn it on it's very quiet but if any of you had and i'm sure jeff you've probably seen it where you get some older machines and the fan in there UNK like mad and there's nothing worse than having that thing UNK all the day
so the first point is if you're going to show something show it let everybody deal with it let everybody look at it then when you've finished with that turn it off because you want the centre of attention to come back to you presumably
even if you've got a series of slides i recommend that you turn it off between each one so that you know the audience don't see the things being put into position or moved about because that can be a bit UNK so er it does mean that you'd obviously need to know where the on off switch is and this is a nice one because it's right there
now this material that we use technically called UNK and the nice thing about is that you can write on with if you get UNK pens so you can UNK to produce UNK diagrams etcetera
obviously you can have UNK or laser prints copied on to this material but i have here some pens and a box of blank UNK which you will have the opportunity later to use if you so wish
now we've got a variety of colours there
we've got two four six eight colour okay
if you want to make a point if something's you want to make more emphasis than others then there is a hierarchy to these colours on this UNK light
okay this is light being UNK through these colours and up on to the screen
so i have a list here now it isn't in the notes so you might just want to make a note of this
the hierarchy of colours
what's the theory behind that
it's the brain right brain response to colour and it's the response through the eye to the colour
some things have more they have more emphasis and they appear more important than others
you'll be interested in some of these colours i find the order of these quite interesting
so the hierarchy of colour i'm going to just UNK down there i hope you can all see
right at the top of the colours i have here are is purple i often wonder whether that is the reason why UNK is UNK or purple is associated with the UNK purple UNK etcetera
i don't know interesting
interesting question
but of the colours we've got here in this list purple is the one that has the most impact followed by blue
a very low base and that is going to be used by the home secretary when he puts the cash limited budget together next year
we are going to suffer as an authority for many years to come from that low budget
i actually put forward an amendment to the police authority whereby we take that er million pounds o of pensions and by a certain amount of slight of hand it be put back into county balances and then re allocated back to the police authority for this year and that would have added an extra million to the base budget and it would not have cost this county council one extra penny
and that in fact was produced a split vote in the police authority fifty and it was chucked out by the chairman's casting vote
that is absolutely correct
erm now as this so called generous funding in fact the police authority are facing a straight deficit of three hundred and twenty eight thousand they are facing a further deficit of four hundred and twenty five thousand because they have only been given one and a half percent for pay where all the information we have been given from the home office you can shake your head as much as you like chairman it is in fact true and in fact in fact as reported in the guardian on only the day before yesterday yet again the police bill is to be almost certainly four percent not one and a half
that amounts to another four hundred and twenty five thousand the total shortfall is therefore seven hundred and fifty three thousand and that's without any projection costs
i mean they've gone out the window
erm now erm
yes or it's zero based budgeting
they on the contrary the police authority have a working party which had four very long and very detailed meetings and went through their budget line by line by line and these are the figures they came up with
there was no argument about it that was passed by the working party and main authority
so erm don't let's have any of this nonsense about being having privileged funding
erm the er i refer to the er freeze on police officers in fact we need sixty eight more
but we're not going to get them now because this county council won't UNK won't pay for them
i certainly support er mr 's amendment and totally reject what is here in this democrat er proposal
mrs
thank you very much mr chairman
er colonel is erm doing a very good job over there in trying to make our flesh creep over the whole police situation but i can tell by some of the remarks that have been erm given from the body of the chamber that not everybody agrees with him
i would just like to answer one or two things erm he one of the things he's saying er is that erm oh dear i've forgotten what i was going to say now and i haven't got it written down got it written down can i go on to something else erm the home secretary does seem to be in some UNK over the proposed bill
i'm glad to say it got a thorough sort of UNK in the lords and so i think it's rather premature for him to say that by fixing a budget we have UNK the whole police service in wiltshire for the next er eight or whatever number of years he said i think that certainly is rather premature
i have hopes that this bill will very much will be very much amended er when it comes to the commons
erm mr mentioned about erm the new provisions would cut down the paperwork work and put more policemen on police on the beat
but erm the chief constable himself and i have heard him say this has no confidence that the paperwork will be reduced and that any er more constables will be seen on the beat
i'm also very worried and this has been mentioned erm by mr that the er the home secretary seems to regard the police UNK as a mere crime UNK organisation whereas really the preventative work the crime prevention the work in the schools and the community work is absolutely vital if we are ever to solve erm we're ever to stop the er if we're ever able to stop the rise in crime and this really has to be done hand in hand i feel with local councils and i'm glad to say that there are some initiatives around one of them in mr 's own district which is making erm some very important steps towards that
erm one other thing that i want to make about erm the victims erm i am very much er involved with erm victim support wiltshire and one of the problems with victim support wiltshire is their work is increasing all the time because the crime rate goes up and every time there is more crime there is more victims but the government has not yet said that they will put the money up that they erm that they er the grant up that they give to the victim support
if perhaps the government were to fund victim support properly erm mr who was UNK and has never got over it might perhaps have had a visit and some counselling from a victim support worker and that would be a very good thing
thank you very much
mr
thank you chairman
colonel really can't have it all ways
er in his er comment just now he er referred to the UNK the enormous er amount that it was costing this council to er fund the special protection service
erm when i drew attention to this one of the first things i did when i got elected to this council erm we get papers back which seem to suggest that in fact the home office are funding it at a level which dare i say suggests that we might even make a small profit er and i have in fact recently been approached by colleagues from UNK asking us how we manage in that er exercise because they're concerned about the high cost of er protection for certain royal establishments in their county
and they're most interested on how we er achieve this exercise
the fact of the matter is that the police are getting more money and they do need to er manage their resources most carefully
and yes we did argue i think there were fourteen meetings of the finance working party involving hours and hours of consideration and we were er treated to four meetings lasting fourteen hours fourteen hours in total
we were treated to the long UNK of detailed considerations about the cost of paper UNK and god knows what else
the fact of the matter at the same time erm as you yourself have said chairman we are in a situation where we have four communication rooms coming down to two next year hopefully i personally think it should come down to one but lets recognise that they're costing the police authority one point six million pounds they're tying up forty one UNK police officers and something like fifty er civilian officers on those exercises
so lets be quite clear that there is still a great deal of UNK in the police budget whi money that could be used to er put policemen on the beat
mention has been made to the paperwork i think that it's worth reminding ourselves that a lot of the paperwork that has been generated is a direct result of conservative government introduced legislation particularly UNK criminal justice er legislation which requires a considerable amount of paperwork erm to be completed by officers quite often in long in UNK and not making use of technology where in fact they er a great deal of time and effort could be con er could be er saved
members other members have referred to the crime prevention exercise i'm very pleased that this council has actually UNK that UNK and is going to fund a crime prevention co UNK at some stage in the near future
i notice it's not coming out of the police authority budget it's coming out of UNK er this er committee's budget
but we really need to er put the cart before the horse or the horse before the cart as you may say i mean we are now being told by the leader of the conservative group that er we're going to we should be supporting the idea of amateur parish constables
i look to the day when the to see what the tabloids make when one of these individuals gets UNK over the head er in carrying out their duties
i think this is policing on the cheap and it is something UNK to be UNK
i would much rather see more emphasis placed on er UNK the special UNK er because i think that is a far more er productive initiative
i mean i am totally opposed to UNK on the street and that's what i think a parish constable service er runs the risk becoming
but at the end of the day there simply is no point in UNK criminals if you can't catch them and i think it is absolutely critical that we should be UNK our attention er to policing that catches criminals and prevents crime and i entirely support the points just made about the er initiatives within the community particularly in the schools because i think it is absolutely critical that we er promote a society where crime should not pay
sadly in modern conservative dominated britain crime pays
thank you chairman i i'm rather amazed actually at colonel 's er comments because er in UNK st margaret there has been a sixty one percent increase in crime and a four and a half percent detection decrease in the detection and prosecution of crime and i was absolutely amazed when he come out with the figure that there's going to be a seven hundred and fifty three thousand pound shortfall in the police budget when on the radio in my car this morning from a very UNK source of wiltshire there was a police officer on there this morning saying how good they were in producing a UNK newspaper for distribution to every household in the county to show the police UNK the chief UNK report this year
my question is to that er police officer or to the chief constable or to anybody who can answer how much is it gonna cost that for that paper to be produced and would it not be better spent in putting a police officer in UNK st margaret where there hasn't been one on the beat for the last six months to help us reduce the number of er of crimes committed in UNK
i would like an answer to that
how much is it gonna cost the police authority to produce this UNK newspaper
mr
thank you chairman i despair sometimes when i listen to everybody trying to make points out of a discussion like this
i mean what we're talking about is that throughout the whole of the world there has been a tremendous increase in crime whether it be in britain in france in germany or wherever
what we're also talking about is elderly people being able to go out at night and not be too frightened to go out at night
and the only way round that situation that may not even amount to crime when they're put in fear it may amount to UNK on the pavement or people er cycling on the pavement or just being their usual threatening UNK
at the end of the day the only way to do something about that is to put more men on the streets
i mean increasingly we see that we're we get more constables here more constables there but they don't ever appear to be actually out on the streets and until we can get more men on the streets with the deterrent effect that their appearance has let alone anything else we are not gonna get much further
our most of our rules and most of our laws are made by people who are frightened of losing their property and not the sort of people who are frightened of being mugged at night
if they were the sort of people that were frightened to go out up to the newspaper shop or something like that our UNK and our priorities would be slightly different
and my plea is apart from all the politics that's going on and all your wrong and i'm right etc if we've got sixty odd police constables available then somehow or other we ought to try and find the money to resource them
if that money has to come out of the existing budget then we should or the chief constable or the police committee ought to look at the priorities again
but the number of police constables that we can have available would make a big difference to the lives of the very ordinary people and that's where we should be looking at first
thank you
miss
thank you
yes well i mean i'm very happy to be able to agree totally with that erm people who make the laws aren't the people who suffer from the physical and matters might be a great deal better if erm they paid a bit more attention i do hope that he would agree however erm that police officers who are female also have a good effect on the streets because he was acting as if erm it was only the male person who were any use and i'm sure that is not so
erm UNK people can't have it all ways there hasn't been any cut in the police service in the police budget i'm sorry erm we have for many years funded the police in a very generous way
this county council has funded them more than social services erm for i don't have the figures in front of me today but for a long time erm this is unlike the overwhelming majority of county councils who spend more on social services than they do on the police
so as a proportion of our budget they have been well funded by wiltshire and i don't think anybody could dispute that
it it's possible that the UNK per hectare in this very rural county is lower than in central london i wouldn't be at all surprised
but erm you know it's like erm if you talk about erm funding per head or funding for the for the overall spaces you know if it's mr he always wants to be funded by the mile of UNK for the population because we have rather a lot of one to the other and i think there may be a similar situation with the police
erm i don't see how anybody can possibly say that the police are not privileged
every other committee or part of this county council has with the exception of probation service which we did today social services and libraries which we did at budget UNK have been funded at last year's cash limit plus one and a half percent
the exception to this is the police who have had by far the largest addition to that they haven't lost money when they lost s a erm we have been ge extremely generous to them far more than to any other committee this year erm and although we haven't given them money for to pay awards because we don't know exactly what it is
we've never given money directly for pay awards anyway because if you do that that's what the claim always is you know
there is sufficient money in balances to pay our share of that if we need to do so and i think making scare stories about it doesn't do anything towards what i hope we all want which is an efficient effective police force in this county protecting us erm from crime and helping to prevent as much crime as possible
i urge you to support 's motion
mr
thank you chair
i think has UNK up quite well there i think which what everyone's aims is which is that we want an effective and efficient police force which everyone has got confidence in to make sure that it protects citizens against crime in this country and nothing could be i don't think anybody who is erm UNK in this county or this country would want anything different
but i think that there has been some interesting arguments put forward this morning about the act there's more policemen or sorry should i say police officers available to wiltshire
but if the home secretary feels that we can have more er police officers why doesn't he give us the money so we can employ them
i mean it's as simple as that and i colonel 's comments saying how hard done by wiltshire police UNK could be next year because we haven't set over the odds budget for this year so that the home secretary can take it on
if he the home secretary feels that UNK so badly funded next year if he's a caring and UNK home secretary then he'll put more money into wiltshire and provide more police officers for wiltshire
it makes a change that the burden of more want is put on the central government instead of local authorities because too often in the past central government has said in many issues oh we think you should have that but the responsibility for paying for it comes from the local authority
but we're not going to give you any more money
so it'll be nice to see the tables turned and mr start keep rather quiet about the number of extra policemen sorry police officers needed in this county and other counties in the country because he'll have to pay for it himself won't he
and that'll be a t turn up for the books for him
but what does UNK me is the reason why this motion came forward in the first place
it was quite obvious mr thought he had something up his UNK to UNK the labour party and liberal democrat parties of this council
he thought when this lieutenant colonel came back to him and said oh my god the police UNK in problems we've got em here that they put something onto the council agenda
and he's had it UNK in his face because this council has provided an adequate budget for the police authority it has pr treated it fairly and UNK like every other council committee and made sure that the service they provide is adequate for the people of this county
it's funny that he UNK at the interests of the party of crime
i think nowadays we all know that the UNK of the conservative party crime is no longer a thing they can fly high
we're on about taxation this week well the they're in trouble over that now
the party of low taxes the party of high taxes they failed on that
i won't mention back to basics because i know that's really embarrassing for them
so we not we'll go over that very quickly as possible
so we have had a failing government we've had a failing tory administration and the people who are interested in looking after this county and all it's services within the budget set by central government has made sure that we have got a good police force which it will not receive cuts in it's services cuts in it's er it's er forces and make sure that other services like education social services libraries highways and everything else will also be adequately funded in this county
right well i'm going to reply to the debate and then i hope we can move to a vote ah oh i didn't see your hand earlier mr i'm sorry
thank you chairman
i think enough has been said regarding this today in relation to this i think we have supported our police force we have a fine police force in this county
we're very supportive of it and have been
unfortunately as was earlier on central government has led the attacks it's led the attacks through UNK right the way through and we were supportive of our police then i think not only of this county but of all counties and all county police forces said the same and we will support our police force and certainly this budget recommends itself to that
if central government wishes to increase those expenditure levels when they go over that is down to them
they've been trying to get the police on the cheap for too long and blaming us and now i think the tables are very reversed
thank you
as i say i think i'll sum up and have a vote and then i intend to break for lunch on conclusion of this item
i think what i find most unfortunate is the intellectual UNK of the home secretary
he's a very bright man michael howard but it's quite clear that he's much more concerned with UNK the headlines and finding UNK than with taking action through law that will actually improve the chance both of preventing crime and of UNK crime and then even more so UNK people from re UNK and it's most UNK to see that when research showed that a particular non UNK method of punishment is effective in perhaps fifty or seventy or eighty percent of cases whereas prison is not he goes for prison he goes for picking on UNK he goes for picking on the defendants right to silence so that we can see more people like er UNK when they were innocent
but i've left that sort of civil liberty out of this motion today because we can't deal with all the because we can't deal with everything all at once but perhaps it can be UNK touched at council because we had colonel who also doesn't like to be confused with the facts trying to tell us that next year the or the year after next budgets will be cash limited but i've got news they already are cash limited
they are trying to suggest that erm somehow this year we're cutting the police budget he seems to have forgotten that last year when he was chairman of the police authority a three hundred thousand pound cut a genuine cut was made in the police authority budget budgets were cut to make up to make up to that three hundred thousand at the discretion of the chief constable and to the credit of mrs and her other colleagues in the police committee virtually no attempt was made to make political capital at that time instead of which now when all we've seen is a request for the chief constable to defer proposed new spending all of a sudden this is presented as a cut
now reference was made to the police finance working party which met for a long period of time and unfortunately made no progress whatsoever in zero base budgeting
there's obviously been a misunderstanding there a lack of communication or whatever but whereas some departments have got to grips with the issue unfortunately police wor finance working party just stuck to the traditional way rather UNK of mr 's old budget working party days which doesn't get to grips with the real needs and the real costs
now mr referred to a two percent clear up rate i'm not quite certain what figure that is i know in wiltshire it's much better than that in the thirties and forties
but nationally the clear up rate has fallen under the conservatives from forty one percent to twenty six percent and there is no excuse at all for a freeze on the number of police officers when we were promised an extra thousand
ah but you're going to be getting some extra police officers by taking them off er paperwork er you're gonna get two thousand three hundred i see in the press well that as shown that of course will be twenty three but if anybody here thinks the chief UNK gonna produce twenty three new police officers through reductions in paperwork and through the other initiatives the home secretary has announced well i don't believe them and we shall have to wait and see
this council needs to take seriously crime prevention and crime detection and most of all fear of crime and that's why it's become part of the policy committee's concern and i think that's with the police committee's agreement for years they've been trying to tell us to get involved in crime prevention and from next year we're going to do that
crime prevention is not just about UNK about making the little buggers pay
it's about preventing crime because people who are UNK would rather not have been UNK in the first place
hear
and of course the UNK that we've had over the years when they they've been of the UNK and knee UNK sort and i remember the short sharp shock for instance under UNK they didn't work because they weren't thought out they were just to make them UNK at the tory party conference
to his credit lord UNK having been forced to bring in the short sharp shock dropped it when it was proved not to work
everybody hopes that we've forgotten about that but we haven't and we're reminded of it because of the courage of lord UNK and his advanced age and ill health getting on to the t v last week and saying the home secretary is wrong to UNK the police
hear
in fact conservative opposition in the lords is proving very important and if colonel is concerned about the future level of the police budget why doesn't he do a bit more to stop this UNK of the police going through parliament at the moment and i just want to quote the words of conservative chairman of the sussex police authority over the years from nineteen eighty two to nineteen ninety three four of them and the most senior of course who led the association of county councils for the conservatives
these ill judged proposals present a dangerous step towards a UNK national police force
they are irrelevant to the battle against crime and the improved efficiency of the police service which we all support
i can't put it better than that
and finally the criminal injuries compensation scheme to cut the amounts paid to people who are victims of gang rape to cut the amount paid to people who are victims of child abuse that shows just how much the home secretary cares about the victims of crime and his other measures show that he's far more concerned with his own career with UNK the conservative party conference and with trying to do anything i mean he's brought in whatever it is twenty seven proposals one or two of them are bound to work if you throw enough stuff at the fan some of it usually hits the target
but we've got to take the issue seriously
mr is still moving a motion which refers to the party conference proposals which have now moved on to bills before the house
he might be more constructive if he cared to pick which items from that he agrees with we might even find a measure of agreement on one or two of the issues because they're not all rubbish
but i move my motion and i ask for those in favour to please show
i'm so sorry mr 's amendment
those in favour of mr 's please show those against
that is lost
those in favour of the substantive motion please show those against that is carried
adjourn for lunch and be back at two
welcome back
item twenty one regional representation on the european union committee of the regions
i er move the motions set down in the order paper and does anybody else wish to speak on this
those in favour please say aye
aye
those against
oh that is carried
that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong
i don't think it's i don't think it's an essential office motion otherwise cornwall would have done it by now
item twenty two one budget review sub committee minutes i move to receive the minutes from the budget sub committee those in favour say aye
aye
and against that is carried
erm twenty two the recommendations not yet dealt with the first is the review of the county farms estate and i will move paragraph nine one that is to say the recommendation of the property services sub committee okay here we are which is a recommendation to this committee to adopt option one as set out in the submitted report namely to maintain the county farms estate at around it's present size and to manage it in accordance with the nineteen eighty eight review of the estate
i will say in moving that would i note that the property services the property sub committee i should say is receiving a further report on recommendations on how to preserve the long term viability of the estate which i consider to be the right priority erm the long term viability of the estate is essential for the value both as an estate and for the value of it er to us should we need to dispose of any of it for development land in the future
erm mr
thank you chair
i wish to move an amendment which is erm that we defer any decision on this until the property the director of property services has made his report to the property sub committee on the erm future stroke to the organisation which is th the subject of his next report to property sub committee
seconded
yeah i think that we need to look into more depth the issue of the county farms estate we agreed from the start it was something that could not be rushed and we had to the principle question that needed to be answered was that was there a viability for county farms or role for county farms in the nineteen nineties
i think that question has been answered and i think the role of the estate has been answered in the report put by mr
but since the initial motion was put forward by the policy and resources committee the question of local government review has become more prominent within the minds of this council and other councils across the country and i think that issue needs to be addressed before we make as a cou a council our final decision on the county farms estate
can i just clarify then how far do you imagine this being deferred that is to say are you awaiting the outcome of the local government commission report
no i do believe that mr 's report is coming to the march property er sub committee and then it will be the subsequent meeting of the policy and resources committee which will be at the end of march
er any debate discussion will be deferred until the report as described in nine one two has been reported to the property committee this is a report to the next meeting recommendations on how to preserve the long term viability of the estate
so what happens to the resolution that UNK resolution that came from property at the bottom of the budget page four resolved
to that's dropped that's all deferred is it
right i'm the chairman of the meeting so i'll try and tell you what i understand mr has moved
he's moved that this matter be deferred
he's made reference in his UNK motion to a report coming to the next property services sub committee and i recognise that report as referred to in nine two of these minutes of budget review sub committee
erm and i understand that to be the position
any other report erm such as to request the director of property services fully to explore all options for the disposal of all or any part of the county farms estate for the maximum financial benefit to the county council that sort of report for instance has not been requested by the property sub committee nor by any other committee with erm er as i understand it
according to mr 's motion
right mr
yes chairman we did have this debate in er budget review as i remember it
erm if we are asking mr to look at the long term viability and the ways of preserving that those options may be other than option one which was what you moved and i think it's rather premature to actually go down a road that says we preserve it in it's present form with some UNK when we are asking for a report for it's future viability which may mean complete disposal or may not and i think that that's why i've seconded mr 's amendment because it's right we should wait for that report to come to property know the full facts and then we can make a decision as to which option we want for the county farms estate
so it's only a matter of two months and than i think we can make a long term decision not the short term
i there is a worry of course that er county farms if we happen to end up in three unitary authorities could be said to be not a core activity of those three new authorities especially the core of an urban one and it may be that if we're not careful the county farm estate can end up in the hands of the UNK body for sale and i think what we're looking asking mr to do is to find ways of moving it forward without ha falling into that net which may not be what we want
mr
thank you mr chairman
i'm just a little bit concerned that if we do delay it while discussions are going on about the unitary authorities and such like we'll put restrictions on mr running it as a commercial enterprise and i think we have got to make sure that any long term UNK on this we don't UNK him UNK selling off the odd cottage and this sort of thing and the UNK as we go along and UNK ones because i think it's he's got to be able to run it as a commercial proposition during the course of deliberations
mr
yes chair i'd be very sad if anything that was passed here meant that mr wasn't fully exploring all avenues as described in the terms of resolution passed through budget UNK
and i take this opportunity to say that erm i had i moved this at budget UNK and my intention was to move erm pretty much the wording that mr moved at property but i was unable to obtain that wording by the time of the meeting so i put this forward erm knowing that it obviously was different words but with that same sense that we do have to address some very real issues about county farms and not to UNK about it i think that er any comparison between the county farms and a commercial enterprise is a coincidence of terms but i can't see how we can have forty million pounds worth of estate as it's valued on the free market to be making two hundred and ninety one thousand pounds a year out of it and think that is commercial
i can't see how we've had a UNK in nineteen eighty eight which has recommended a very specific course of action none of which appears to have been implemented i don't see how we get a report which describes er the intention of the county council as maintaining the UNK of the county farms whatever that is as i don't recall any decisions like that and certainly if we've made one i'd be interested in being party to changing it i think wha what we have to say is we've got a lot of land are we using it to the best interest of the people of wiltshire and that is one thing it's addressing not a way of preserving the county estates as they are not a way of keeping a hundred and twenty farmers and their families erm as tenants of wiltshire i mean they're not gonna be out of jobs are they
i think there are many purposes that the county farms should have and we need to look at what is the best value financially that we can obtain for the people of wiltshire so when everybody talks about they'd like their country schools maintained they'd like this that or the other bought they'd like UNK station purchased we could buy it easily if we sold a county farm couldn't we
and the only thing that seems to stand in the way of doing anything UNK sensible with county farms is that every time we deal with it somebody says ah but it can only exist as an entity let's keep it as that let's pass it on to a trust let's safeguard it let's do this and that
well i'd like to see a very open report and that's why i mr and i'd like him to look at all the options we're UNK this so that we can see what's possible you know perhaps UNK trust would like to come along and offer us fifty million pounds for it that'd be a fair deal wouldn't it perhaps somebody else would do that
perhaps erm the UNK of cornwall would like to take back the land that we rent from them in order that we can rent it on lease well we lease i mean same thing isn't it
erm we rent land from the UNK of cornwall perhaps er well you know long UNK we bought it this way and we pay low rent
there are things around this that i wonder what on earth we're doing and what is the best way forward and i would like to see that kind of report come back to us
and the reason i say it and the reason i labour the point is that i think amongst the problems that we've UNK particularly in budget review is to have chief officers and their staff producing reports in which they have a very clear vested interest
not least in their own jobs
and i think it is a great pity that this council is losing some of it's capacity to produce reports which are independent of the departments which are the most affected by them
i think the great sadness of the report coming forward on county farms is that it's no doubt going to be produced by mr a further report and erm what can we say if he comes forward saying it's a wonderful institution and he wants to keep his job running it
am i going to say oh i think that's a very fair free independent thinking view
it may be it may not
i think that i would like those considerations borne in mind by mr when he's doing his report and i'd like us to have a very open view about what we do with the county farms
well i'm going to disagree with mr on a number of issues
he does seem to suggest that if you're directly interested or if you have a direct interest in something you can't take an objective view and i would say that actually members have shown their ability to erm to achieve something different from that the way they wear different hats at different committees mr comes to mind where he will argue for the d s o's at the d s o managing board and for the client at education committee
and i actually think it is coming close to a professional UNK on mr to suggest that he can't take an independent view
and what leads me to that conclusion is the UNK that mr brought in suggesting that the estate is worth forty million pounds
if you read the report at paragraph seventy you'll see that it has an investment value in the region of eight million pounds it's only worth forty million if you kill all the tenants overnight which is rather drastic vacant possession in other words
now you might achieve vacant possession over a period of seven years
vacant possession can't be er achieved er overnight as you appreciate but if the government's agricultural er land UNK hey don't keep UNK
if the government's agricultural land UNK reform proposals go through which i rather hope they do it'll be a little while yet we could well see a change in the security of UNK issue which might make it easier to achieve er vacancy and vacant possession
and it comes down to a basic difference of approach to this
either you consider that the county farms are playing a role set down by law and supported over the years of an which no other authority and no other body in the country can provide and which is a socially valuable role and that is to provide the first step in farming and clearly they do
or you think that all they are is another piece of silver to UNK off like mrs thatcher UNK off the UNK industries
i don't consider i don't consider that the UNK of this county council's financial position justifies this in the UNK it off at all costs approach
now what mr has moved is to defer the matter and i'm in mind of to accept that
but i would make clear to mr if he looks at the minutes of the budget review sub committee that the suggestion of the director of property services UNK his time fully exploring all options for the disposal of all or any part of the county farms estate for which he probably asks for a large amount of money since it involves an enormous amount of wasted time is not been agreed it's a non delegated item it was a recommendation of this committee which has not been moved at this committee and it was a most unfortunate and UNK form of words
what's been moved
hear
is to defer the matter pending the director of property services report which the property sub committee properly called for at it's last meeting
i'm happy to accept that amendment and i would put the motion as amended to the vote
those in favour please show those against that is carried
did you have a bad lunch chair
i had a lovely lunch i just thought i'd try and get my own way for once
chairman in your UNK to get your own way for once i mean i had my hand up for about ten minutes and i thought that er our friend on your right had UNK you of that because i think that you gave just as much a distorted view of what the real problem is as perhaps mr did and i think that the way you UNK that one through does you no credit at all
yeah ch cha chair it is possible for mr by moving a another small but you know perhaps relatively UNK motion on this same item as we've not moved to the next one and i will i will happily second it in order to enable him to speak to it erm to actually express the views and very valuable ones which he does hold
he is actually one of the few amongst us who is probably quite expert on these matters
he would he would be worth listening to i think
chairman is that to be the case
chair point of order you don't point of order you mr doesn't need to move an amendment or anything else you can still accept debate on any item on the agenda until you've called the next agenda item irrespective of the motion on the table
i know you do chair you know what you're doing but i'm saying it's a waste of time us having to move one
chairman what a let down this is gonna be
you asked for it
for what it's worth my opinion in property and my opinion now is that we need to retain if we can a viable unit for county farms
in other words a unit which comprises several farms which is big enough for us to move tenants about and big enough for us to retain a management structure
what we don't or shouldn't do is to regard every county farm as a sacred cow
there are opportunities for development in the UNK front garden in the UNK front garden the UNK front garden wherever and it is my belief that since this county council originally purchased those farms and have since maintained them that if there is going to be a development windfall then that should accrue to this county council and not to thamesdown or whoever else it happens to be
the problem is that nobody will ever take and i suppose it's possible that i don't take a balanced view of this
everybody's in their own camp and it it's only when you come to consider and i mean my group is nowhere near behind me on this because we have farmers who again think that anything to do with county farms is UNK
but until you consider the amount of money tied up in county farms and the return it gives us and the subsidy if you like of so few people and you think that school can't have toilets and things like that then these should all go into the decision making UNK pot and this council should not blind itself to the various options that there could be and in those circumstances mr i think should be allowed to explore the possibilities of the market
in as much as if we are suddenly told UNK yourselves of county farms then we will be in a much better position to make a balanced decision and to UNK return from those county farms if we had that information available
i do not myself think that mr ever produces a biased report on anything and i would think that erm on reflection mr may think that he UNK the mark there er i feel that we should if we can defer this in it's entirety which also includes the note at the bottom that would allow mr to go out and explore the possibilities
that's all he's gonna do this council UNK the final decision and we wish to make that decision with the benefit of all the knowledge that is available
and if somehow or other the whole of that er erm number nine including the can be deferred and i believe it should be then that is what i would wish to happen i would wish mr to continue to have the freedom to see what the options are for this county council
right now there's one we've made a decision to defer consideration of this report but because both mr and mrs had indicated they wanted to speak before i took the vote i'm prepared to take the speeches but i don't know that there's very much of a motion that can legally be moved
mr
thank you mr chairman
er i moved the original motion and the thinking at the time was after a lot of discussion that eight one as it appears on the agenda to maintain the estate at around it's level was the correct decision
and then we added eight two which asked the director to explore the long term viability of the estate now we made that and i said so at the time the answer to that could be either positive or negative
this left it to mr to come up with sufficient information to enable that decision to be made
thank you
mrs i excluded you from the speech after you asked the question
erm i hope two sentences thank you mr chairman
one is really i felt i should reply in support of mr concerning some of mr 's remarks
i don't know whether he's read the county farms estate report but it was actually option two was one of the proposals we had to consider which was to was to dispose of about a third of the estate reduce it from twelve thousand acres to nine thousand acres which was actually rejected at erm the property sub committee by all parties including labour
thank you mr chairman
right next item twenty two a twenty two b commission application for additional funding
it's a recommendation from the budget review sub committee at minute six
er i move to note the decision of the budget review sub committee
miss oh mrs
thank you
i'd just like some clarification of what this resolution from budget review actually means
does it mean that p and r today are actually supporting the establishment of those posts and we are going to go and get the money or what
thank you
i that is the UNK in the negative we're not setting up those posts or funding them today but they've enabled us they've prompted us to carry out a UNK i think i wasn't present at budget review it
mr
in moving these matters from commissioning in grant a erm to this committee erm even if social services had the money available if they would have still been moved to this committee
the purpose of that or the reasoning behind f behind that was that over the last few years erm this type of expenditure has been charged not to social services but to the section one three seven account
which the treasury is responsible for and this committee is responsible for
erm so that the purpose of bringing some of these corporate activities back into policy and resources where they can perhaps determine how that erm is going to be managed in the future
and it was the reasoning behind the erm the resolution at budget review
there's just one point i'd make on erm the first one regarding the th wiltshire and thamesdown racial equality council
erm the UNK report under statutory responsibilities does say that under race relations act local authorities have a duty erm it's a little bit stronger than that actually in the act
it states it shall be the duty of local authorities there i and on that point i you know in this area i don't think that wiltshire county council has done or spent a great deal of money in actually UNK those
thank you
mr
thank you mr chairman
er seeing this here does it mean that anybody that loses er a vote in a sub committee can then move it to the budget review to have a second go at winning it
i honestly don't think that's what happened but mr
chairman i note with surprise the attempt by thamesdown c a b to get extra money and i w i would wish guidance on how i could join UNK c a b into the same er situation
would i need to er ask for UNK c a b to considered by the er the chief executive in his report
would that be sufficient
right let's have the chief executive
er i think there may be a bit of confusion about this minute
my understanding is what the budget sub committee well what the social services er committee were saying was there are a number of grants which in their view are not peculiar or specific to social services but are of a corporate nature
budget sub committee said we understand that what we're asking what we ask is that the er director of finance and the chief executive look at it and come back with a report
that report would include such grants as we may feel are of a which are of more corporate nature rather than specifically a service based one and how we would recommend the council to deal with them
at the moment it is not transferring nor has anybody agreed to transfer the burden of those applications to the policy committee
well er lots of hands one at a time erm
sir with due respect to all members the officers will make an objective assessment when they report
they will not be UNK as to what they should put on or should not put on
chairman i object to that because i think that wasn't either the tone of my question or the implication of my question
what i'm saying is that if the chief er executive and the UNK chief finance officer whoever is going to make a report i don't wish him to UNK his report to thamesdown c a b money advice service i wish him also to consider UNK c a b money advice service and start UNK
i thought that was fairly straightforward and didn't deserve the answer it got
we are looking at or we will be looking at all grants that are made by all committees to decide which ones in our view should be recommended to you to be treated as a corporate kind of grant
thank you chairman
erm to actually raise this issue
i mean i think one the first thing to be said is that one can assure members covering all the other c a b's was that they actually got their bids in full
if the thamesdown one didn't er the officers for their own reasons have separated out this particular er activity erm and i felt at the time that it was unreasonable to give a hundred percent funding to er most c a b's but not to one
and i like mr ask that this issue should in fact be addressed we should be looking at their total responsibilities and i support the action of the budget review in saying that er we should be looking at this with a view to it being a corporate responsibility
er the i also make the point that er my understanding is having now talked to a number of the other c a b's that in fact they were looking to thamesdown money advice centre because this money was actually to replace funds that previously had been er available through the allied UNK sponsorship scheme and which has which i gather was withdrawn er at very short notice and they were looking to thamesdown to er provide that support and resource as a county resource and i therefore felt that it was right to bring it forward
but the important point here i think is that this is a corporate or may be a corporate res responsibility and therefore my understanding is that the officers are going to look at those parts which may be looked at as a corporate responsibility and i would therefore erm assume that one would look at all the c a b services in that light
yes thank you
er mr
thank you chairman
i would like coming back to the erm racial equality councils taking into account statutory responsibilities and i know that certain statutory responsibilities often have in very small print at the end of the act subject to available resources
i'm not sure that exists in this case
erm but reading it very carefully and it says local racial equality councils as well as being supported by the commission for racial equality and i think that is a very important as well as being supported are also entitled to receive financial assistance from local authorities
it does appear however the application made to us is exclusively local authority support and not a part of an overall support that includes the commission for racial equality
i think that definitely need to be looked into as does the er requirement of this particular post within the act
now that is the type of thing that i would like to see come back for legal opinions on that statutory responsibility the level of it and the reasons for it
i think the reference is a general reference and the minute is a general minute
erm there are a number of issues there are three separate issues there's the c a b issue which i remember for years trying to get additional staff funded in the north wiltshire c a b from this council and we couldn't afford it then and we can't afford it now
and in the end the district council were able to afford a bit of funding towards staff which broke a tradition that district councils tended only to fund premises erm and indeed the district council have done that as well in our case recently by moving them to better premises
there's the racial equality council issue where erm i mean i think there's er i would like to look again at the degree to which compliance and contract compliance can be achieved through the county council's procedures which we looked at about four years ago and i would see that at least as important as working and funding outside activities
but erm in a sense both of those are subsidiary to the general erm point of the recommendation of the motion of the debate which is that erm since we're UNK trying to set corporate priorities and a corporate policy for this council certain voluntary sector organisations such as c a b and c r c r UNK clearly work in that sort of field and clearly have the sort of objectives which fit which may fit into our own corporate objectives
erm i'm i don't know to what degree the specific er cases for development workers erm and indeed the extra funding for thamesdown fit into our corporate responsibilities because we haven't UNK them yet and we haven't seen the report
but i do think the specific point you make as to whether there's any prospect of the national commission for racial equality putting any money towards the development worker that's wished ought to be addressed by somebody at some point in the context of preparing the next report
erm was there somebody else had their hand up
no
can i move that we mo go to i'll put this to a vote then those in favour of the recommendation from budget review please show and the against that's carried

aye
and the against that is carried
twenty four two the re designation of the director of public protection the chief executive to report
er sir er yesterday i received a letter from the institute of trading standards administration and if i may i'll read a paragraph from it
my institute would wish for it's concern that having UNK to establish the statutory qualification the diploma in trading standards and consequently persuading employing authorities as officers holding that qualification use the title trading standards officers now sees the potential of confusion
the institute clearly does not wish to interfere with the er council's rights er to decide what it should call er people
er i don't know how members er may feel about it
i appreciate that one of the concerns was the use of the word director er and maybe it would er help us all out of the problem after all you have decided to merge the two departments and therefore calling them er chief officer using the two department's names seems to work against what your attempts have been and therefore maybe chief public protection officer rather than director
you have a chief fire officer
i know this caused an immense amount of debate at personnel sub committee and i thought that personnel sub committee had come to a reasonable solution
i note that the this institute of trading standards administration suggests a title such as director of consumer and trades services director of health and consumer services head of regulatory services and department of i don't want to you can't call a person department
i think it i think it's a combined
director of trading and consumer protection
they're not trying to push they are only trying to be helpful but i think it is a material matter for the committee to consider
mr
i was just having a word with one of your colleagues here trying to take up what mr 's point was and i think we've come up maybe with a compromise is that we call him the county public protection officer
and i will move that
mr will be able to sleep UNK in his bed
yes the problem was with the previous suggestion of chief public protection officer director appeared to have confused with the responsibilities of the chief fire officer but if we say county public protection officer
mr oh well we've already appointed him so at least we don't have to alter the outcome
erm mr
as always it's something very small that has the longest discussion property and it was at personnel
erm i don't like long titles and er and erm and i am wary also of the public protection words because i think they do UNK as was stated quite clearly at personnel they do UNK that the chief fire officer's somewhere in there as well and he isn't
erm surely we can find something director of consumer protection or director of consumer
miss
well i find that one difficult
firstly because i understand there's some problem with the word director which i don't understand but everybody says well i don't understand but well maybe some officer will explain that to me when i finish speaking
but if you just say consumer protection you're not covering the public health side of it awfully well
erm that seems to me
yeah well an awful lot of this sort of waste disposal regulatory work and so on is very UNK removed from most consumers and they would be rather surprised if they knew you were doing it
well only er thank you mr chairman just very briefly to second the objections to the word director
i mean we have all had representations about this particular word of director er it implies the n er the er certain UNK of that service over another under public protection
erm
yes
erm have we did personnel receive anything from erm the erm from er the chief er public health officer
i mean has there been any because there may be some argument in having a quick go at it at public protection and hearing from the new department what they'd like their chief officer to be called
sir er i UNK
mr
i understand that one of the problems is the word consumer which is not er particularly liked in some quarters
erm and therefore you're thrown back at er finding something else this sort of vague compromise of director of this that or this that and the other er appeared and er it seems to me a long UNK er but also it indicates something against what you've already tried to do which is to merge the two together
now i appreciate that some people seem to object to the words public protection erm i'm not certain why bearing in mind you have a public protection committee
oh come on
no i i'm
still remember that we're debating mr 's amendment which is director of consumer protection
mr
chair i think er i think anyone can say that mr as the county public protection officer isn't going to be in charge of the fire service
it's obvious the chief fire officer will be in charge of the fire service and i don't see there's any problem between the two
the public protection committee deals with the th the consumer affairs public health trading standards and it therefore the person who's in charge of those three departments should have the thing as public protection
the fire service is separate but it reports to the public protection committee
i think it's quite obvious and quite distinct
mr
sir i'm beginning to wish i'd never UNK this matter
but there was concern about the title of the director of public protection
to answer the question of mrs i have spoken to mr he is mr and he has already explained would like a short title and would like to keep away from the previous department's tasks of trading standards and public health for obvious reasons
erm if members don't like the word consumer then i think they would have to use public er it does cover i think the title county public protection officer would er satisfy mr and i don't think it would upset the chief fire officer
right those in UNK any more speakers
mustn't forget
those in favour of mr 's amendment which is director of consumer protection please show
one two three four
and those against
that is lost
those in favour of mr 's motion county public UNK er nearly mr
i assume chairman director is the right word because we've used it amongst all the other we've got the director of library services we've got the director of property services and what have you
i believe it should be director of public protection
right those in favour of mr 's amendment seconded
mr 's amendment is director of public protection those in favour of that please show those against erm we come to mr 's motion director
county public protection officer those in favour please show those against
item twenty five the minutes of the property sub committee held on the thirteenth of january
erm first of all i move that we receive the minutes
those in favour of receiving the minutes please say aye
aye
and those against that is carried
er twenty five two a the capital disposal of surplus property mr
thank you mr chairman this was erm a comment on the minutes at twelve two
could we convey the thanks of the members of this committee to the property services and the chief UNK department for their efforts in UNK sales and gaining large scale capital receipts for the county
thank you
yes i'd certainly second that and i think you can see from the figures that er a great deal of work was done and a great deal was achieved
the erm with that addition i will move the recommendation in paragraph three of minute twelve of the property sub committee's minutes to make representation to the association of county council urging the government to UNK it's policy in not allowing local authorities permanently to make use of the full amount of capital realised from sales of assets
mr
thank you chairman
you moved that local authorities should be able to make use of the full amount of capital from it's receipts
of course we do
you don't sell a house and keep the mortgage we have debts
we have probably less debts maybe than some of the other authorities in wiltshire and thamesdown has a far greater debt than ours
but it is only right it's public money that if we are UNK money that we should have to use some of the er money from UNK of assets to UNK the debt
if we were then to get to a position like UNK county council who have no debts they of course can spend a hundred percent of the money they realise from assets
and i get rather tired of the constant UNK that councils can't spend they're not allow they have to they lose fifty percent of receipts they don't lose them they go to the benefit of the UNK er tax council tax payers of this county in reducing the debt and reducing the debt burden of interest er interest on the budget
and i'm quite happy with the present situation
miss
well i think what mr is really saying is that the conservative round UNK in er the first sort of i don't know six decades of this UNK this century were rather more sensible than the conservatives who ran wiltshire at the same time because they made sure they acquired some assets they could UNK for development and put themselves in this happy position which the ones in wiltshire had obviously failed to do
erm i'm quite sure that we ought to be able to spend this money and i think it's very sensible and it would help a great deal with the problems that we have
and i think for mr to pretend that the government has nothing to do with our problems is unfortunately becoming more and more UNK as an excuse
right erm oh mr
chairman er i don't often disagree with er mr in front of me there but i have been consistent in my approach over the years er wherever i've had the had the opportunity to speak at political meetings and ministers have been present
i have consistently said why don't they allow er councils to spend the receipts from council houses on building new houses and i've never been impressed with the replies nor the reasons
er and in this instance i have consistently erm asked that we do all we can to allow us to spend our capital receipts and the fact that we had the holiday last year was er of great benefit to this council erm there are er times when we should er perhaps be putting money into reserves or paying off debt but this council should be allowed to make those decisions rather
hear
rather than the appropriate minister so in this instance and i can't support er on this issue
i think i think i would having moved the recommendation would seek to clarify what we're asking the government to UNK erm because we're not saying what they should come up with as a new policy but i think we could add the words for capital investment at the end of the motion recognising that at one level of government central government it has been the practice in the past er when they had some capital they could sell in the form of british telecom shares and er indeed other UNK industries er not to use the er the results erm er release this realised by that capital disposal for capital investment instead to use it for revenue purposes which was in the long term somewhat unfortunate
but it comes down to first of all whether it's sensible to borrow against assets and all of us do if we're lucky enough to own our own homes we tend to have borrowed either our first mortgage or sometimes a second against it and we make our own judgement and i see there are some suggestions on how the government spotted this with regard to schools in suggesting that perhaps schools could raise money by UNK their school buildings of course
it doesn't sound quite so good when you put it at that sort of level cause it puts a school at risk but of course there's no reason why a county council shouldn't borrow considerably more than this council does looked at on accounting principle unless i'm wrong and mr i'm going to call in a minute will correct me if i am
but it seems to me we've got more than enough assets to cover the UNK we've got at the moment and indeed many more besides
it should be a matter of judgement for local authorities to what degrees they are UNK because they do have to pay the interest by and large from the er from the money they raise on erm on council tenants and from other income
but er having added to the debate and added those words to the motion i'll call mr
yes chair i think mr was quoting michael UNK wasn't he in about the er when you sell a house you don't not pay off the mortgage and of course what most people do is buy another house sorry who was it
oh alright
when you when you sell a house you pay off the mortgage
of course what most people do is when they've sold their house and paid off the mortgage they take out another mortgage and buy another house because they need one to live in
erm what of course people like mr UNK do is sell other people's houses pay off the mortgage and throw them out on the street
but the reality is
in westminster in westminster city council how many thousands of people thrown on the street moved out
but yes
but of course the government already controls the capital borrowing that we can make
they control our borrowing limits
we've had a very restricted capital programme which your group mr particularly mr were complaining about earlier in this meeting which UNK the amount of road building we can do
now if the government wish to restrict the capital borrowing that we can make which they do anyway why do they need to restrict also what we do with the results of any spending why don't they allow us to spend it perhaps on the roads that mr would like to see built
mr
thank you mr chairman
i don't know whether i'm agreeing or UNK with mr
but i think it is a point
i think if we go down not having a responsible position to our debts UNK our debts in the long term erm we are going to be restricted on what we can borrow with the capital because no government is going to you know my party or your party is going to let us go on building debts and more debts by giving us permission to borrow money and more money and more money
and it does worry me because if we're going to go into UNK authorities whose going to take over these debts if we're going to build them up
and what you said about UNK a school how can a school mortgage it's school premises if we've already UNK it with our eighty five million borrowing we've already got half the schools in this county on a mortgage anyway
so you know they're taking a second mortgage not a first mortgage because we've already UNK it
i would back mr 's opinion and i think we ought to take a responsible position towards paying off our debts
and if it means fifty percent of whatever we get in capital receipts going to pay off our debts it's a worthwhile attitude and i think we ought to take our debts responsible
we shouldn't just think we're not going to be here in two years time it's somebody else's problem they'll take over our debts
i'll put it to the vote those in fa sorry so sorry
yes i er at the risk of getting unpopular with other people that live in UNK today
erm let's cover one or two things because about a year ago in two articles in the local use sorry who was it allowed to sell the UNK fund from council house sales on building new houses and two weeks later the deputy leader of the council argued that he needed that money invested because the council couldn't exist without the interest on it
now that's a case of having your cake and eating it isn't it
and actually when we come back to the paper in front of us i would like to get one other thing clear
it's perfectly true that the front garden policy on the assets has been stated by thamesdown borough council they don't want to sell it
that is thamesdown borough council who don't own it
er and this came up several years ago when this council went into conversation with the UNK estate and the UNK estate wishing to dispose of our assets
at that particular moment of time as the leader of the labour group here i had a discussion with the leader of the labour group on thamesdown borough council with the political officer down there and i was asked to resist any attempt to sell off the garden of UNK because once thamesdown became a unitary authority it would want that to sell for itself to get it's capital
now that has never been denied by the leader of that council although he keeps on it is not UNK policy
you know it's a UNK anything that comes from that side
point of order chairman point of order can i can i
chairman point of order this is not thamesdown council
point of order point of order can mr give any written evidence that the leader or thamesdown borough council in a meeting with him as leader of the labour group on this council that he made that statement
if he cannot then i suggest mr keeps quiet because people could UNK him of lying for the sake of UNK sake
now i think it's i think erm the best question to ask in these circumstances is who benefits
and erm it s it seems to be an entirely er rational position for any public politician for instance mrs thatcher before the seventy nine election denying that she had any plans to double v a t or mr major denying some of the plans for raising taxes that we've come up with or indeed denying plans to UNK the UNK commission
well he did
that is not the matter before us
the matter before us is whether to recommend whether to make representations to the a c as shown in minute three with the words for capital investment added at the end
those in favour please show and the against
yes
thank you
that is carried
twenty five two v minute fourteen of property sub committee disposal of assets in the borough of thamesdown
we are UNK i will move that we amend the county council's policy of consultation with the borough and district councils by increasing the three week period referred to in the report under er paragraph six to six weeks
aye
those in UNK well mr
chairman this is not what we er agreed before and it seems to me that there's been some re thinking on this and i hesitate to say that once again er members are trying to face all ways because they don't want to upset somebody but the policy that we've had in the past had total support at property and it is it is a policy that has worked
and we've had instances of why that policy didn't work and i'm only sorry that those people who supported it before are finding it impossible to support it now
mr i'm moving exactly what i moved at property sub committee
to increase from three weeks to six weeks and i believe it's important to respond to district and borough councils when we're trying to co operate with them
not to do what they want because we're certainly not giving the sort of assurance that's requested in the borough council's motion and we're certainly not giving special treatment to the borough
but we are responding by saying well we will give you six weeks to respond when we notify
if this committee agrees with that amendment
i take the point that you're suggesting that another group may have re considered it's position
no i think mr
i'll decide when the
can i can i say something
i think three weeks has worked quite well we've had no troubles with it
they've had plenty of reason to mar put up a marker in the three weeks and we've spent the next three or four weeks after that discussing it
and therefore why should we change it
and it has worked so let's leave it alone if it UNK if it's not broken why mend it
miss
well if it's not broken why on earth should six weeks be such a problem
you know i mean if
i don't see why giving a little more time for consultation should cause any problems of any kind
those in favour of my motion please show those against that is carried
twenty five two c old UNK minute seventeen
aye
those in i'll move the recommendation of seventeen paragraph one
those in favour please say aye
aye
those against that is carried
twenty five two d members allowances for meetings of the south west county farms authority recommended to approve attendance travelling and subsistence mr group and travelling and subsistence only when he takes duties on behalf of that group
mr
thank you chairman
erm we talked about this sort of issue earlier on in relationship to the to the r a d erm i'm not quite sure of the strong importance of that organisation to the council but i am sure that this erm committee was set up by a number of south west authorities who are trying to look at the future of county farms
and i think that er mr was chosen because of his extensive knowledge of the subject
and i think if and i know it was agreed at group leaders meeting that if we could find a way that mr could be paid these erm allowances it would be important to allow him to pursue the work which is being done on that committee and i would hope that we might all agree to the recommendation and that is when he's on the steering group it's attendance erm full attendance and er travelling but on the others travelling and subsistence
i think it's difficult to actually find that it's attendance on the sub group
but i mean that it is expensive to keep going to london and places like that i think he should be UNK for it
i thought that's what i moved actually that he
i didn't move it i'm agreeing with what you did chairman
all right thank you
those in favour please say aye
aye
and against that is carried
if somebody gets on that list do they get UNK from personnel or do they
see the reference to regular members of the personnel sub committee
it does require that unlike other committees the er officers need to be clear who our regular members of personnel sub actually are
chair can i ju give the i'm sorry i thought you'd already passed the motion the labour group names are and
yeah well we got halfway through the vote
those in favour please say aye
aye
those against that is carried
mr
twenty seven which is on your main agenda paper i move to appoint mrs erm as shown to the trust
those in favour please say aye
aye
and the against carried
twenty eight the report of the county UNK move
could i just say sir this is the re report which is made er each year to this committee to inform the committee of the work and i hope members are pleased with the er wide range and volume work which has been carried out and note in particular the involvement of this service with the public and the er pleasure of the public and those have made donations the fact that over eight thousand people have visited and the number of people who've erm received lectures and have UNK from that
and i hope that members appreciate as i say the range and scale of work which is that you will also have seen that they've been able to open now one evening a week and for a very small service with a budget of about three hundred and fifty thousand pounds erm they are doing sterling work
i hope members will add their UNK to what is in the conclusion there erm for the work of the staff who've achieved this
members will see at paragraph eight how the UNK er office UNK with the national average we are well below that and i think this is a very good service indeed er county council which is not just value for money that that's too UNK but actually provides an excellent service with within those limited constraints
mr
thank you mr chairman
i'm always worried when we get to item twenty eight at this time of the year and somebody UNK through and doesn't actually say anything about this
well i'm pleased to hear you have
i think too often the county UNK and the records office are forgotten and left to do their very worthwhile work over there without very much appreciation of what they do from members
it it's a part of the county council i've always taken a considerable interest in and i support them in all their efforts
it's an excellent report
it shows how well we are conducting the service in what is an old UNK factory after all and if you've been to UNK lately you will have seen a six million pound record office with modern architecture in a prominent position in UNK er which i'm sure they're conducting a service but i'll bet you that pound for pound we're giving a far better service in wiltshire with our dedicated staff who've been there a long time
and i would over the last few years i've suggested that members visit and see the work of the county record office
it was a great disappointment to me that when having set it up with an invitation couple or three years ago about three members turned up and i think that was very UNK
the work is most fascinating the records they hold are quite er large and erm i'm pleased to say that on their request the conservative group have given the records of our group meetings since nineteen sixty to nineteen eighty six to the erm record office and before anyone UNK over there is a slight before they're released to the public
but that will be after the UNK of the wiltshire county council
i wouldn't want to UNK those that are here now with anything that's in there
but er also i i'm currently UNK er getting together the records of my old company that go back to eighteen seventy nine and i've been UNK in getting one or two of the governing bodies to get their records in
they do an excellent job members should take a little more interest and go and see what they do
yes i'm not certain whether liberal group records go back beyond nineteen eighty one but erm
i UNK
i i'm not certain that they were particularly group organised but er certainly i shall be looking forward to deposit a large number of files there from our group
just to get them out of the house
mrs
thank you very much
erm i would like to propose i'm not sure correct form that we minute this council's support and appreciation for the work of the county UNK rather than just note the report
well only just to really actually all mr has er said and just one other bit of information the time when the chairman of the council extended the invitation to sixth UNK looking for alternative entertainment for the sixth UNK of school after they sat through a full council i took them over to the er UNK er department and we saw the paper UNK sorry shouldn't say paper UNK at work and these sixth UNK already knew of the existence one of them asked to see the records of parish because he knew they were there and i mean i think this is wonderful that the sixth UNK already er children are being taught about the ar the records and they will want to be sure that we kept them and i think it's our moral duty to keep er the records of the past for future generations
i hope you'll support my whatever you call it proposal to minute our appreciation
thank you
mr
thank you very much mr chairman
i would like to second mrs 's motion
away from the county council i am myself very interested in industrial archaeology local history and particularly the history of wiltshire parishes particular reference to west wiltshire
so i did really enjoy reading this report a well written report and for me well received and i offer my congratulations for it
erm i haven't yet visited the UNK department but they can expect me
ooh
they can expect me as er as i say but probably for me one of the more interesting papers on the whole agenda today
thank you very much for it
mr
thank you chair
erm i think that this erm part of the agenda is most interesting because i think it's other departments which also report back to the policy resources which really we as a erm council don't get much chance to see it's doing
i remember when my mum and dad were on this committee actually the this records department is part of the UNK erm committee's responsibility records sub used to be there and used to regularly meet and that used to deal with it
erm i've endorsed the comments UNK been made i think the er congratulations and can i say i've got a UNK feeling originally this paper was put on the agenda to UNK me so that the records department can get the new shelves i originally blocked
but i have passed it now
mr
thank you
erm the report is extremely valuable the work of the UNK service is extremely valuable
it's not only about UNK and the past
we are today creating history and those documents will go into the UNK
it is a creative process not a past process and something which is just stored away and lost and kept for the future
it is something creative it's about today it's about tomorrow because those patterns go forward to tomorrow
it is an extremely valuable service and one which tends to get left behind
but it is one of our most valuable and we should do everything that we can to support it
right mr
thank you chairman
yes like many of the others i happen to be one of the ones who did go up there and take a look at it erm at the time and i hope that the motion as er not only to the county UNK but all the staff over there for the very hard work and UNK work of which they put in
i saw and i have had in actual fact UNK to actually use that service over there and it's rather interesting if one can t to say that er in the particular village which i er represent they actually came up when i asked a certain question they gave me a far more than what i actually asked for at the time but found out who the first village constable was and i think myself that er that service over there it deserves every praise it gets UNK on it
thank you sir
mrs
th thank you very much
i very much echo all that's been said and i'm very pleased to hear what mr sa said
i very clearly remember being at the records panel when i er first arrived and seeing erm mr reaction when it was a member of the party to my right which re said well as we have financial problems and as we have these documents why can't they be UNK and we'll sell them off
and there was a UNK through the meeting
erm but the point that i really wanted to make slightly UNK but the point i really want to make is that i am very concerned indeed about the future of the of this service er in the re organisation of the councils and i really feel this is something we need to keep very much in mind in short to ensure that this valuable record is er is maintained
hear
thank you mr
thank you chairman
erm i too endorse the er views expressed by other members but i think it's also worth commenting on the work that and contribution that's made of voluntary by volunteers to the work of the UNK which is referred to in the report
i'm sure many members will have been sorry to have noted the erm the thefts of materials and one hopes that security cameras has now in fact been er installed and if not why not
erm and i think it's also perhaps right that we should note with pleasure the comment made in the third paragraph on the second page about the work of mr and mr er i think that does UNK er give some recognition to erm er the role that the UNK are playing in the wider community and i think that is extremely er UNK and i think we should send our congratulations from this committee er and our support for what they're doing
mr
er thank you mr chairman
erm i fully support all the comments about the UNK system i have a membership ticket here and i was a member of that system long before i came here
i would fully support all of the good work that is done and i would wish it to continue
thank you
right so the motion is to note the report and to express our appreciation and support for the work of the county UNK
yes
and his staff
and his staff
those in favour please show
aye
and the against
that is carried
item twenty nine a d c conference on community safety
i move to take no action on this matter
aye
those in favour any against
right now main agenda where we're being informed of a planning and environment committee's concern at the conversion of county council owned residential accommodation to other uses and i did suggest a briefing but i don't think anybody
erm i will move to note the concern of the planning and environment committee and to ask the officers to ensure that when planning applications are submitted for the conversion of county council owned residential accommodation to other uses that the matter be not determined until the policy and resources committee has been consulted
second
in other words we get consulted so we get a chance to comment on the planning application when it's made
can i just comment i think on the process what happens is that in fact the application is made by the director of property services we don't now have a first resolution or a second resolution
i think it would be when the committee comes to the director of property services and says we would like this to happen that's when we'd have to come to you before the application
only to say that i would be opposed because i believe you should delegate to committees to run their affairs and their resources in the way they want to
and in this sort of instance i mean UNK with the with bringing in of north UNK it's important that we do have extra accommodation the police are doing it within their within their remit
i can't see why we've got to have all this sort of thing coming back to policy
but obviously mr is about to tell me why
with pleasure
too often now in the last four years in planning committee time and time again we get applications from departments and most of them coming from the police authority for changing residential accommodation to other uses
we believe it is morally wrong to be taking away residential accommodation when there are so many people homeless in our society and we should do something about it
and time and time again the planning officers and mr said this is not the right form to do it we are a planning authority and it is a decision that has to be taken by the service committee
over the last four years we have consistently UNK we have passed resolutions at planning asking committees to consider and nothing has been done
and that is why we are now taking this direct route of saying that policy and resources as the policy making body of this council should have some input to make sure that we in the planning committee are not the situation on a planning application when instead we deal with the moral issue of turning away people who need homes
yeah actually i'd be interested if someone sitting on the planning committee or perhaps a director erm yeah or perhaps you could tell me er why if the planning committee members are so concerned about this did they grant the planning permission
right erm mr can answer that one
well when you are looking at a planning application mr chairman you can only look at planning matters
er the matter which i am sure all of us in this committee are concerned with is the principle involved and the principle behind the letting
that is something the planning committee can't look at
er and i think that the way that the way that er erm er councillor has mo th the proposal that councillor er has moved is a sensible way around
you will note er that the erm planning and environment committee were concerned at the conversion of county owned residential accommodation and we decided to inform the policy and resources committee of our concern
this is the right way around and erm councillor 's motion addresses that particular question
mr
yes chairman
i w would like to point out whether or not we are going to continue to delegate degrees of authority to our service committees or whether we're going to over rule that and say oh no only p and r ultimately full council will be able to take any decisions
now recently a colleague of mine er that comes from an area where i grew up and heaven UNK that i heard the news that UNK has become liberal but
oh labour
but the particular council which is UNK district council started off after last year's victory by the liberal democrats by moving to one full council meeting a week lasting about six hours once a week
the chairman then went to the extent of UNK every committee and having three full council meetings a week on the grounds that every member should consider every issue
now is this a suggestion the thin end of the wedge that we now start taking away the authority of our service committees to decide what they want to do and have to pass it back up the line for decisions to be made because quite frankly i don't want to come down here five days a week ten hours a day for full council meetings
well i was hoping we could we could avoid discussing the activities of too many district and london borough councils for that matter such as westminster today erm but erm there are certainly some very fine london borough councils
i don't think we're taking away the planning and environment committee's delegated powers we're merely trying to ensure the policy and resources committee is consulted on proposals for conversion of residential accommodation for the oh i will say the moral reasons that mr outlined i wouldn't really disagree with what he said
mrs miss
yes i mean it erm mr is quite right and i'm very surprised at the length of time i'm not sure if he's still in on planning but he's certainly been on and off it a lot erm hasn't worked it out yet
erm this is part of the legacy of the UNK who changed the presumption to be in favour of development
erm and therefore that planning committee erm basically has to vote in favour of development unless there are over riding planning reasons why they should not
and unfortunately concern about homeless is not a planning issue
it is not considered relevant however important it is in normal human terms in planning terms it is non UNK
therefore the only committee which can over ride it is this one
but it's not taking away the erm power of the planning committee on any other matter whatsoever
i don't see any problem with this as a former chairman of planning and i don't think any other one would
right those in favour of motion please show and the against that is carried
item thirty one er mr
excuse me chair
thank you
try that again
thank you chair can i just say er i think that the motion UNK in it's first two erm paragraphs the actual benefits of having a direct service organisation to this county
it says that not only does it save it's money when it comes to when we're putting in the tender bids but actually the profits it makes goes back into the county council it has a two UNK saving of UNK to this council and we've known and seen in the years that it's been running that money has come back into county council balances which means that we can have more money to spend on other services
i think that and i know that members from the d s o board many members excuse me er agreed that there seems a need to be a more positive approach taken to save the schools and other organisations within the county council network when considering erm the uses of the d s o the advantages that has not only on the county council but them as an individual school college or whatever
i know the colleges are out now
erm for them because it means that the county council when they are making a profit d s o makes a profit has more money to spend on education which will improve the standard of our schools in this county
and therefore the schools should remember this when looking into going for other options which may mean there's very little difference between them and the d s o and the fact that th that the profits made by the d s o will be lost if they haven't got that contract and i think that's a very important point that they should take on and i think a lot of schools miss out on that particular idea
i know one other thing that is important is the fact that a marketing document the need for a marketing document which can go to non erm schools i think erm brought this up the need to promote the value of the d s o overall
the last part of the resolution is it's actually taking up the area where at the present time we haven't got a d s o it seems stupid that you go into a school and you can clean their classrooms cut their grass and look after their do their grounds maintenance cook the kids' UNK but you can't do any minor repairs you've got to call in another organisation
now there may be a legitimate reason why the d s o does not see there is a role to be carried out
and that is why we're asking for officers to form a report on whether or not a small building maintenance team should be set up to be able to carry out that work
i think it should go to the d s o board to be able to look into and then come back to policy and resources
i think that is a there is a need to look into this it is an area where we haven't looked into at the moment and when you consider the valuable work that our staff in the d s o organisation does and the profit it makes for this county council and the savings it makes for the county council it would be sensible for us to also look into building maintenance as well
thank you
erm i think oh there are several speakers mr 's next
chairman i shall leave it to others on this site to make the case if they wish er against the recommendations
my concern is on the first page the UNK errors in the
cor
i er i mean it sticks out like a sore thumb and one would have expected that this paper came from education
but if people
if people can't recognise UNK pronoun in that the it's is short for it is er somebody ought to check it because it lets the whole thing down
yes mr i made that very point
mr
thank you mr chairman
like you i am a member of the managing board for the d s o erm and erm like you i'm sure that erm you would like to repeat your words that you said then about UNK this report and it's successes and reminding the members and th of the public and members of this county council the real benefits from maintaining erm our d s o and from the erm the way in which it has been managed and the way in which the amalgamation is working there
i really do feel that erm it's a success that should be it should be we should make the most of it we should public it UNK it erm wherever we can
whether it be in schools town halls public libraries or whatever
and i would support all what mr said in that
in regards to of this motion i don't really have a great deal of trouble with that at all
erm it's only just asking us to have a look at an idea which has UNK to us once or twice erm we can have a look to see if erm we can erm have an in house building maintenance to develop the UNK the amalgamation a little bit further than what we have already erm it won't harm us to have a look so i've got no real trouble with that at all
thank you
thank you mr
thank you chairman
erm my fear of this report is that we are actually erm it shows to me a certain level of UNK
and i think we're in danger of being UNK over the d s o now i have over many years been involved with the d s o and er and i support their efforts
but times are moving on local government review is just round the corner and erm we see that grant maintained schools of course are coming along
they're not actually erm using the d s o and i've just been involved in the
i've just been involved in the selection of UNK for erm south UNK grammar school and i've got to say and i've told mr this because he UNK me concept catering weren't in the le in the frame
their presentation was appalling their attitude wasn't much better and the presentation from the other companies was superb one in particular erm came and really gave a good presentation
that isn't only that school
most schools that have gone grant maintained have declined to use the d s o now my concern is erm that we're not actually when we come and compare with the outside world we're not actually giving the service that we may think we are
er and that's of some concern because i don't want to see the d s o UNK in that way
in th and this is not a school who's decided to set it face against the county council and it's services
and mr will know that in fact we've employed quite a few of his services and other services of the county council
we went in with an open mind but i have to be honest the presentation was so UNK that there was no way that we could in fact continue with them and we have the same problem with the cleaning contract
in another school which is er locally managed we are i think about the only school in the county who have decided to employ our own UNK and our own cleaners and in fact the UNK that gives us has really allowed us to do a lot more in that school erm with the staff and the staff are happier
so those may be exceptions but don't lets run away with how marvellous everything in it is
we have lost contracts the d er the grounds maintenance section have lost two major contracts in wiltshire to other companies
those other companies one of them thamesdown i see mr smiling away up there because thamesdown won the one up there and broke his one in the one in the south
there were troubles to start with but you ask any of the schools in the south whether they want direct services back and most of them will say thank you we'll keep we're very pleased with them
so let let's just there'll always be arguments over this i know
lets not be too UNK about it
on the building maintenance side it has been looked at several times in the past
i think the time has probably passed now all the schools have got their own budgets they've got their own builders who are giving them a good service and i doubt whether this is the time to UNK that especially with local government review not far off and the future of a county wide d s o in some doubt when it comes to local government review
i think i ought to just come in there because erm i don't know to what degree it's appropriate to discuss erm the er some of the background details to the letting of contracts in public but perhaps it's alright
because i can agree to some degree with what mr has said
i've been and watched and contributed to some degree erm or at least in listening to the reports of governors at the school erm in the allocation of some of their contracts which of course include some being let under l m s and some being let under g m s with regard to building and cleaning they were very disappointed with the presentation that the d s o gave and even though the d s o was eight thousand pounds less than the competing bidder o c s they gave the contract to o c s and a report has had to be made to the district auditor to give their reasons
now it is totally true that the start of that o c s contract was a disaster and it is also true that several months on the pay of the cleaners is still not being correctly done and concerns are being raised in the governors it's a four years contract being an l m s contract and under g m s they are UNK one year contracts
on the other side of the coin the grounds maintenance service is very highly UNK at and we have this interesting shared UNK cu campus with UNK where i think the district council d s o is cutting UNK grass and the county council d s o have been cutting and you'll be able to walk along the divide and see which looks better i suppose after a bit
but i certainly think that with regard to concept catering the merger did not come s could almost didn't come soon enough because we needed to turn concept catering from a school meals organisation into a catering organisation and give it stronger management and a better lead and a better appreciation of what it means to be customer UNK
and now particularly the point about making d s o's customer UNK i have stressed again and again both privately to mr and mr and also at the d s o managing board and i think public session
er so there is undoubtedly a lot of work still to be done in making the d s o competitive as for building maintenance work i'm not certain we've ever considered having a building maintenance d s o we may have looked at it in the days before d s os but that's er a long time ago and it's certainly worth having a look
er mr
thank you mr chairman
as you've said before you know i'm a privatisation man er and i think that comes down to number three if we UNK the lot and pushed them further out if they felt there was a need to do building maintenance they could do it
it's only while they stay so in house as a d s o that we have to be so careful about what we do and what we don't
and i think we have got to let them compete UNK with the private sector we've got to push them further out
and that is why as mr said i think they ought to be allowed to produce some sort of advertising UNK and get their act together because if they're going to go and compete out there they've got to be prepared for it and we've got to allow them to give a decent presentation at least have a decent glossy brochure to push round so at least they can say what they do because they will never compete when they are UNK unless they get it
mr
thank you chairman
i have to admit to being somewhat encouraged by er some of the comments that have been made here
i mean i do think we need to er recognise that tremendous efforts are being put in by the individuals employed by the d s os but i do think that we need to recognise also that there is a lot lacking in the particularly the marketing of the services
er i'm involved with a school at the moment that in fact has just put concept catering out
erm and the reports that i've had back from the governors was that concept catering was so absolutely certain that they were the only people who could do it that when they were faced with competition they hadn't got the UNK idea how to respond to it
and er the competing package which incidentally i have to tell you were the d s os own staff who decided to do their own management UNK er of the service
they have cut the price er of meals charged to the children they've er made some adjustments o c to the menus offered which was what the parents wanted and as a result they've actually increased the take up of school meals by something like sixty percent
and that's the d s o's own staff buying out th the service from under concept catering
so i do think that the i don't think it actually does necessarily come down to glossy brochures but i think it is a management attitude erm in terms of mark developing a very much more pro active marketing approach to going out and competing UNK in the market place for the contracts
i'm absolutely certain that once you've got the people there once you've got the contracts in place the er the people employed will deliver a high quality service
but unfortunately they are not getting the opportunity because of er some of the management UNK means that they're not actually getting the contracts to which they're entitled
mr
very briefly chair to say i think nothing's perfect as i said i mean there are areas that still need to be improved and i think our the image and in a sense our marketing section does need to be improved and i think no one would deny that
but the figures are quite clear that there are benefits of having in house erm fields that can compete against the private sector for county council work and the fear and the reason why they were set up in the first place to make sure that you couldn't have outside erm er or private organisations setting up UNK to basically screw the local government down and charge whatever price they want and con us through and through
with local with in house teams it means that we are protected from that ever happening and i hope that our in house teams will continue to go on and on from strength to strength valuable resource to the county council
and can i just say a governing body that i am on i've just recently gone on to UNK private cleaning contractors it didn't want the d s o and ever since that contract has come in they have been in terrible trouble
right those in favour of the motion circulated please show those against that is carried
item thirty two
aye
those in favour please say aye
aye
and the against i will move that is approved for purposes of members travelling and subsistence those in favour please say aye
aye
those against that is carried
recommendation of one two three on the letter
ca can i query the accuracy first of all of that report
as i understand it is not i think what i voted for in number three that specifically the county secretary and solicitor should inform a member of authority
i don't think we said who should inform them
i don't think we actually said who was going to inform the member authorities
we actually said we should we the body corporate should erm i have some i if it should be the county secretary i believe it should be in consultation with the county supplies officer
that's the only point i'm UNK making
i understood
i think it should be in consultation with the county supplies officer because i think it is important that he also has ownership of that letter which goes to the fellow p our fellow members at resource
yes i mean i would like to support what mr is saying
in fact erm what we agreed yesterday was one on this paper two and three followed from it erm but were not actually moved at the working party because it was me who did the moving
erm and er they are necessary but they are not actually what we agreed
so i think we have to do them but i think it is very important that we do not erm er talk to the or communicate with the other member authorities in a way that looks as if this is wiltshire saying well we want to find a way of UNK off this asset without worrying about what happens to the future of the service
erm it's very important that we find a joint way forward to make sure that whatever the future of local government is in this county there is an UNK effective and efficient purchasing erm er service me who did the moving
erm and
mr
thank you chair
can i just move a slight amendment to the erm
well then i will move one and i will move mr 's wording for three and on two basically delete that the money should come from the identified savings made in the chief UNK department
it has the same effect chair
i have to say that when mr was there he didn't mention one single word about a supplementary revenue estimate did he
he didn't mention what it would cost and we actually said we hope by today he would
chairman
come back with how much the consultant would be
i'm UNK surprised to see it's three thousand i hope we're getting the quality of advice that is necessary for such a large organisation
erm i think it's important that we find wherever that three thousand comes from it's important we find it
this is a critical issue because local government review is coming up fast
the other members of the consortium are worried about what's going to happen and if we do if we do leave it to later on chairman the we have every danger that the consortium will not be a core activity of the new authorities it will end up in the residual body and be and just be sold
and i think what we're doing here is getting ahead of that and trying to look to the future of the consortium
it's important we do it
if there are savings identified savings in the chief executives department i'm sure that from those to this should be the way forward but er i'm happy to second what mr said erm with th and that is in three with the addition of in consultation with the county supplies officer
right that's the motion passed by mr seconded by mr
thank you chair as the chair of that meeting yesterday i was wondering if i was at the same committee as this m these minutes came from because when i read the minutes two and three i certainly didn't remember us passing those
so first of all i would call in today the accuracy of the minutes because as far as the revenue supplementary revenue estimate was concerned no figure was mentioned
in fact mr did then say where do we think we're going to get the money from
my comment was i'm certain that by tomorrow afternoon mr you will have found somewhere from your little UNK that you will find the money for it
and that was the comment that was made
no question was asked of how you raise the supplementary estimate for this and
you would find the money and that was left to that
and through request to the county solicitor it was again mr quite rightly said it was said we would and we as a corporate body i e the county council and the c p d and i would go along with the er proposition
mr
chair i'm just going to join mr in UNK to the supplementary estimate
i don't think there's any need for it and there are substantial erm UNK in the chief executives department already if he wishes to spend it out of that
i would suggest even that since there is a surplus in c p d of over a million pounds that er they are perfectly capable of funding their own studies
but perhaps the intention is that er they don't fund it that it's funded by the county council but certainly i don't think this committee should be UNK a supplementary estimate
i don't think it's necessary in any circumstance
mr
were you moving a
basically i did s well if you want a technically but i've said it comes out of the er identified savings of the chief UNK department as already ma er made
effect using pi squared
i'm doing a handout now
i'm gonna do it for everybody not just the joint management
er it'll probably be about a fortnight before we get it back okay
so i'm gonna send it down to shortly
right somebody asked a little while ago UNK and non UNK
it was in the tutorial on friday
erm i won't look them out
erm if you still don't understand it come and see me at the end of the lecture okay
you won't get anything on it here but if you haven't been told
right we're gonna look at correlation over the next couple of weeks
we're gonna look at the UNK cross product or product moment correlation and UNK rank order before we do i'll just put this on and make sure it's working okay
we've looked at pi squared and we've talked about the term i used was association
now the reason i used the word association is that it's different from correlation which is what we're gonna talk about shortly
no what we said was that if you were interested to see if two variables are associated this is for a pi squared you might look at sex differences men and women and smoking or non smoking now if they were associated what we've said is that you might for example ex in fact UNK probably smoke more than men
anybody know the figures well let's pretend they do
what you might find is that out of er fifty women thirty smoke twenty don't smoke
out of men you might get twenty smoke thirty not smoking
now if you did a pi squared on that it might come out significant i don't know
but what you might find is that there's an association between smoking and non smoking
so we've used the word association
what it means is that if you know that somebody's or if you know somebody's sex then you've got a better than chance bet at guessing whether they smoke or not
so what you're saying is that these are associated
now correlation in a similar way measures something similar to association but it gives you a bit more detail
erm let me think reaction time and intelligence are correlated
what this means is as your reaction time increases it's believed or been shown that your intelligence UNK or i q measure UNK
now what it means if you know somebody's reaction time you can have a guess of how good their UNK or the value of i q that they obtained
er for example incomes as people get older they earn more so they're related
now there's a difference between correlation and
if you get a correlation between two variables it may be because one causes the other or directly influences it or it may be that it's just cha it's just a chance UNK and the two have occurred together or it may be a combination of the two
now the correlation or the calculation of a correlation coefficient or carrying out the correlation statistical test doesn't tell you about the nature of the relationship whether it's caused or whether it's erm by chance or whatever
now it's alright i'm looking at people and they're smiling and it's throwing me
erm that's right exactly erm
now to illustrate the difference between sort of UNK one of my UNK is if you take the number of new born babies in holland and you take the number of UNK they're found to significantly UNK
that is as the number of UNK increases so does the number of new born babies
now some of you s might still believe in UNK are about to be UNK
i don't think that people would UNK is a actual direct link between the two to bring the baby
it turns out that there's a common variable in between them which is nest sites
erm as erm more housing sites are built young people move in or young couples and they start families so you get an increase with the number of new buildings or new homes i the number of babies
what you also get is the UNK have got nest sites in UNK so you get the UNK so what you've got is nest sites for people and UNK increase together so there's an intervening variable
but sometimes you can't even identify an intervening variable they just seem to have occurred together or arise in some way
right so correlation is different from UNK
let's try and do a little graph
i'm gonna turn some lights down i think unless you can read that
now what we've got there is income increasing with age
that can you see that at the back
i can't hear you yeah
yeah
fine
now what you've got is income is increasing in that direction
age is increasing in that direction
now what we've got if you take this little point here that means that somebody has a sort of quite a young age and quite a low income
this person is about the same age but UNK a bit more and so on and so forth so your age increases
each one of these represents an individual in this case person who we ask about their age and we ask about their income
now as you can see from the dots the relationship isn't perfect in that everybody who's older than somebody else necessarily UNK more but there's a sort of trend or a general pattern so there seems to be a relationship between the variables of age and income
interestingly in this country if erm you're classified as manual worker your peak income occurs in your forties
if you're not a manual worker your peak income occurs in the fifties
so as you get older your potential to earn increases now in this case because age is increasing and income is increasing i e they're getting bigger together it's said that there's a positive correlation in the case of reaction time and intelligence UNK as reaction time gets bigger i e gets worse i q increases so in fact many people would say that their in i q and r t are UNK correlated in the sense of as your i q gets better your reaction time gets worse
it depends how you measure things whether increasing positive is good or bad relatively speaking
i'll give you some graphs in a minute now for those of you i w i what i want to get across to you is the concept of correlation positive correlation negative correlation
i'm speaking fast in the hope you might not write it down erm and how to interpret a correlation coefficient and what it means
erm the sums behind it i'm not too bothered about but i'm gonna go through them because they're quite UNK and i dare say there's some poor UNK here who'd actually quite enjoy me to do that so we're gonna go through some of the sums not now but a bit later on
right
let's take the top one okay that's what we've just had where you've got a and b both increasing
if you'd worked out the correlation coefficient or some measure of correlation you would UNK you'd say that they're positively correlated
if you're uncertain about correlation coefficient it's always worth doing a UNK plot
that's what that's called
it's where you just draw the two axis for the two different things and then plot the people's scores on them UNK plot now i'll put that there just to
the alternative is where a and b are still look at the axis a and b are still getting bigger as they go along the axis but the relationship is different
as a increases s as b increase is that right
have i got that right
what i'm trying to show is a negative relationship
as a increases
that's right so as b increases a reduces
or you can say it the other way round that'll be a negative correlation now the alternative would be when you plot them you get a circle almost you get there appears to be no systematic relationship between the two so what you'd be tempted to say is no correlation now i'm gonna try and move towards how we might measure how might we actually measure get a measure of correlation because what you'd be able to say is well they're more correlated or less correlated
now what we can do is do that UNK which is the exciting bit for some of you
erm for those who don't understand it just write it down and come and see me if you really want to but i'm not gonna be testing you as to whether you understand it right just a little bit of UNK you don't need to write this down but it's there in case you do
erm for each case or subject there are two scores
if they are correlated in some way then we should see a pattern when we consider the sets of scores across several people
sometimes you have the same person and you have lots of different scores for them and you see whether they're correlated but most o more often than not what we're talking about is a number of people and to see whether the pairs of scores in some way are related now this is probably a bit more important
if there's a positive relationship okay i d i mean that was just UNK something i said before so if you got it you've probably got it down twice now okay if you knew that there was a positive relationship between two variables and we said that their score on one of the variables was high then we would expect although not necessarily because w it's not true in every case but it i there's a general trend we would expect that their score on the other variable would also be high
so n i it's just re interpreting what correlation co positive correlation is
now a way of determine determining if a score is relatively high compared to the rest of them is to look at the z score yeah
that's one way of doing it
you know that if the UNK above the mean don't worry i've got an overhead for this that's if the UNK above the mean then i you know relatively speaking to the mean it's high right
and the further th away from the mean the higher relatively speaking it is
now a z score is a convenient way of UNK that and this is a way that we're gonna g work out the correlation coefficient okay
whoops i'll put that on the somebody left a UNK in my office on friday a yellow one
no
if you wanna pick it up god you must have good eyesight
i can only just make it out and i wrote it no charge for the free eye sight test
d'you want me to read these out if you're at the back
or are you c you happy
happy
oh god it's appalling written which one
it must be
okay sorry i'd forgotten i've UNK into notation
positive negative and the thing at the end is a z of sorts all scores above the mean if you converted them to a z score you would expect them to be positive
all scores below the mean if you converted them to a z score you would expect to be negative
if the two sets of scores are positively correlated then we would expect positive z scores to occur together and similarly negative z scores should be UNK
so if you were to convert the pairs of scores to their relative z scores then what you would find is that the positive UNK if one score is positive then the other score should also be positive
in fact the more positive one is the more positive you would expect the other to be
okay
can i move this off
move it up to about there
now what i've done here is just put that in a table saying that if score a has a negative z score then you would expect score b to have a negative score
similarly if score a has a positive z score then we would expect variable b to have a variable z score
do i say that the same way twice
no
that's unusual
now that's if they're positively correlated
if they're UNK correlated then you would expect the z score for one to be positive and the other to be negative or negative and positive
you'd expect them to have opposite signs
if there was no correlation well you'd expect them to be mixed up a bit so that negatives might occur with negatives or they might occur with UNK vice versa now i'm g try and give you a feel for how these numbers how we work out the correlation coefficient in terms of z scores
if you consider what i've just said about z scores let's assume that there is a positive correlation because if we have a z score of one on a let's assume we also get a z score of one on b these numbers in fact can't happen in practice
they wouldn't add up to the sorts of things that we've got
why i'm showing i mean this is just the same as the table you had before but this time what i'm showing you is the product of a ti a times b the product of the two
now because score a has plus one b has plus one er then it's negative slight difference there on the negatives but both negatives and both UNK both positive what you'd say for those sets of scores are that there's probably a positive correlation between a and b and if we look at the total of each one of those multiplied together it comes up with about plus eight
now what we'll do is do exactly the same but this time for a UNK correlated score and you might expect the z scores to be UNK up like so
when you have a positive z score for one you'd expect a negative for the other
negative positive negative positive negative
and if you multiply those together you end up with a negative total
we ended up with plus eight for the positive cases where they're positively correlated we ended up with minus nine for the negative cases
now if there was no correlation between the two then the patterns of the UNK z scores would be quite UNK arbitrary in that there'd be no consistent pattern
so for example we've got a positive with a negative then we have a positive with a positive a negative with a negative and a negative with a positive
and you'd pi be tempted into saying that they were probably not correlated either positively or UNK
and if you look at the sum of the two z scores UNK each other you end up with something close to zero
so you begin to get a bit of intuitive feel
if you g if you take the two z scores convert the UNK scores into z scores and multiply both of them you get a big positive number if they're positively correlated at the end of the day
if they're UNK correlated you get a big negative number
if they're not correlated you get something approaching zero
is it cold in here
well i never first time
it is okay now what i'm trying to tell you is that th a measure of association or as we're gonna call it correlation
they are but i'm just i mean y'know it's cos it's not really correlation yet so i'm sort of u that's why i've put quotes round association
now you can't see them both
i mean i i'm confusing the notation but i've put little quotes round it
it's just that it's not quite a correlation yet
we haven't evolved the UNK to where i'd call it correlation yeah
cos otherwise UNK tell me that this is how this is the correlation coefficient
i don't want you to do that so it's i've just association wi
i suppose you could put correlation with quotes round it if you prefer yeah
now don't forget the UNK means the just the grand total
now i'm not gonna bother to put the n sort of equals one to n equals n or something on the top yeah
what it means is that we're just adding up all the products for all the UNK scores right
as we did in the example before now there's a bit of erm UNK or UNK coming up which you don't have to understand but for those of you who are keen on it it's there
what i'd like you to think about if i can find a rubber is we've said if you take the sum of z UNK times z y they were a and b before i think i might have confused that
right that's all the UNK multiplied by their corresponding UNK on the pairs and you add them all up
what's interesting to know is what is the maximum value that can UNK
alright
now i think it's m minus one i'll just check yeah
the answer will be n minus one where n is the number of UNK scores so the maximum value that can obtain is n minus one
now there's a proof for that and i'll give it to you but you're not expected to know it but it's there for those of you who want it
well you're gonna have to take something on trust already
erm the maximum score of that expression is obtained when z x equals z y so the maximum time is when the two UNK standard scores are a exactly the same not just they're both positive or both negative but they're exactly the same value as well
now those of you into differential UNK your time has come cos you can prove that on friday night
UNK and UNK but i'm not gonna bothered with that one now what i suggest you do is just jot this down
i'm not gonna bother to explain it too much
erm if z x equals z y is when that's the maximum then z x times z y is either could be put down as z x times z x or z y times z y cos they're both the same
if the two scores or the two z scores were identical then it would be a straight line of points for x and y there'd be no little UNK there would be no little dots about the line the line would run perfectly through them
that would be when you get a maximum value of this product of the z scores z x times z y
now the tricky bit comes back to remembering what z actually equals okay
z x al a z score is the UNK from the mean divided by the standard UNK
so let's assume that we've gone down the line of saying that for a maximum value z x times z y equals z x squared
right let's assume that we've done that
we substitute those into the z scores and lo and behold at the bottom of the page you end up with the maximum value of those of the product of x y sorry z x and z y is n minus one
now that's if they're positively correlated
i drew the diagram and they were positively correlated now you don't have to know that proof but if you ever wonder where it comes from or you wanna tell your grandchildren one day UNK what did you do in the UNK classes
wrote my other essays is an answer that i for those of you that believe that statistics and research matters is about hard sums you can endorse that view okay
okay can i put the other one on
the max value em so the max value if there's a positive correlation if there's an ideal perfect correlation between x and y the maximum value of this standard score x times standard score y the maximum value that can take is n minus one right
UNK it so the max value of that product is n minus one now if you wanna know what the maximum value and UNK if the UNK are UNK correlated rather than positive you end up with exactly the same expression n minus one but lo and behold it's negative
that's an exercise for the students to do themselves if they want to is to derive the negative version
now that would be the minimum vale but what we mean by that is the th maximum negative correlation cos if there was not correlation you'd expect it to be zero
don't forget n in this case is the number of UNK scores
it's typically the number of subjects but sometimes it's not subjects all the way through so it's the number of UNK scores
now there's a certain UNK to this number there is ther there is because as you shall see right
right the correlation coefficient is given by da r equals now we've already met this is your old friend the product and what we're gonna do is divide it by n minus one now if you think i'll wait til you've got that down let's see if i can find this bloody rubber
now if we've said that the correlation coefficient is the product that we've been working out and we've said the maximum positive value that this little expression here can obtain is n minus one n minus one divided by n minus one is plus one
so the maximum value a UNK correlation coefficient can obtain is plus one and that would be when there's a total positive correlation UNK the minimum value it can obtain is when this expression on top is minus n minus one so it goes down to minus one for a complete negative correlation and it's zero if there's no correlation and then there's the values in between that's just saying what i've said
if a correlation coefficient UNK a value of minus one or plus one it means that you only need to know one of the scores of the two and you can say exactly what the other one will be
it enables you to perfectly predict what the other score would be
it means if you know one score you automatically know the other
of course in true life real life things like that don't happen
you quite often get correlation coefficients in the order of about point three r equals point three r equals minus point three
if you're really lucky you get up to about point six
now in social sciences you very rarely get a correlation coefficient going about point six or seven very unusual
but if it's positively associated it means as one score increases the tendency is for the other score to increase
if it's UNK correlated it means as one score increases the tendency is for the other one to decrease and if it's virtually zero it means there's no relationship between the two
now that's the first sort of introduction to correlation
i've got s don't go yet we've still got a bit to get through
erm what we're gonna do now is look at some number UNK and what i'll do is give you UNK erm formula for calculating the correlation coefficient
it's not very nice
it's in your text books
there's lots of different formulas for this by the way
you take whichever one's most appropriate
i suggest you use this version because it's one of the easier ones to calculate
they all end up the same way but you do it by different ways
for example you could actually work out all the z scores but this equation you don't have to but you could if you wanted to
you could actually work it out the UNK way the way that we've described it yeah i think you'll find that that's meant to be x and x
the b's are supposed to be UNK
i do apologise i nicked it the b's are meant to be UNK and the a's are meant to be UNK
i thought i'd got rid of them all but i hadn't right
w you've got two scores x and y for every subject yeah
x y now the b's should in fact be UNK it's what comes of talking about it in a's and b's and then changing to x and UNK
i mixed it up when i wrote it down if you find something in the text books looks about right and similar to that use the text book version i might have written it down wrong
this is not an x it's a times
that's actually a times multiply so what you do is that n times that bracket times n times that bracket and then the whole lot is square UNK i'll come on to that shortly another way of thinking about erm the product moment correlation is that what it's doing it's putting the line of best bet through the data
it's finding the best straight line through the UNK plot
now it's another way of thinking about it
that way of thinking about it will become very useful for things like linear regression which we may touch on and erm for the notion of UNK accounted for which we certainly will touch on shortly now there's different sorts of UNK
there's somebody's mentioned UNK row i'd already mentioned it before i think
erm this is known as UNK and there are certain assumptions regarding it
have you written that down
yeah
okay assumptions for UNK are it assumes that there's an n an approximate linear relationship between in other words you could cos what it's trying to do is draw a straight line through it
if it goes all over if the relationship is UNK linear then you have problems with UNK so it's gotta look like there's a straight line relationship in the first place
approximately that now i've it's very y'know UNK most people don't bother but you should really do the UNK plot to see whether a relationship is linear as opposed to something like that which would be UNK linear
it's a repeated measures design
now it doesn't have to necessarily be the same subject but in some way it's a repeated measures that's where you
it assumes that the scores have been derived from random samples
it assumes that there's interval level data
it assumes that you've UNK derived the samples from normal populations and it assumes there's a home between the two
so what you're doing is making assumptions about the population from which your samples were drawn so therefore this is known as a UNK technique nearly there now another interpretation of UNK r or the correlation coefficient generally is UNK if you square the correlation coefficient it equally the proportion of UNK in x accounted for by y now that is actually a very good measure of how good a correlation is
if you get a correlation of about point seven it means that you're only accounting for forty nine percent less than half of the UNK in the other UNK the other sets of scores think about it if it's a positive if you've got a correlation coefficient of one what it means is that you account for a hundred UNK or sorry if you're gonna make convert it to a percentage you times it by a hundred it's the proportion there
