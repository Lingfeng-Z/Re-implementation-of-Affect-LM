so if it comes out as one squared is one so you've accounted for a hundred percent or all of the UNK in the other variable which means that if you know x you automatically know y or if you know y you automatically know x when you're doing a correlation study it's very hard to work out what's the dependent and what's the independent variable because by it's nature you don't know
little aside
very last overhead and you've only got to look at half of it
we're gonna do UNK next week for those of you who want to what you can do you can take the correlation coefficient
i've called it r p to distinguish it from UNK which we're gonna do next week but you can convert the value of r to a t score and if you've got a t score you can look it up in t tables to work out whether it's significant
most tables though in fact already give you correlation coefficient
so what we're saying is that you can take the correlation coefficient multiply it by n minus two divided by one minus r square root it first and you convert it to a t r p is the correlation coefficient ca calculated by the way we've j that that's just a little UNK
has no meaning as far as i am aware
that's where i fell asleep probably
and next week UNK rank order i'll stay behind for about five minutes if anybody wants to ask any questions
don't forget some of you've got a lab class n erm from five til six
last monday
that's right did you miss the start of this
no i just came in when you were saying
that's right yeah they'll be about all night
oh right that's alright then
okay
do you mind if i get the stuff for perception
er is it
yeah
i mean i'll bung them in to you at some point
yeah that's alright yeah
it's one of the non urgent jobs unfortunately
are there any absent friends who're sort of gonna appear UNK
oh here's one
have you just had a lecture
just had a lecture
oh right just had lunch
breakfast
is there erm here
did you get a copy of the that's what i don't know what's gonna happen with that because nobody's got back in touch with me at all
oh right but is i went to t i said to them d'you wanna scrap it yeah
i said there's y'know it was a couple of minutes late and they said erm it had to be processed through the proper channels
waste of my time for an hour waste of whoever's gonna have to sit on the committee for even more ridiculous
it's a w new way of the system i'm afraid
it was a waste
i just went over there and said it was okay th i'd put in a letter and they still couldn't just take it off
they said it all had to be processed so it's gonna have to go bef but i mean i will get very angry if that gets taken any further cos it's ridiculous isn't it
is there a course work deadline today
fine just in case i'm running over a little bit
we don't want to cause any body some distress
okay h p only
it's alright i'm just checking
apparently last week there was a course work deadline i didn't realise
erm UNK psychology first years erm that you isn't it h p one
you're the only ones who have to do the essay for perception
combined UNK don't
that's my understanding from the book
is that correct
okay well h p one's on your notice board you've got four titles of possible essays
you can pick any one of those four
you can pick more than one of those four but the second one won't be marked
yeah
anybody else gonna turn up
no
right
can i borrow a sheet of paper off someone just t
front UNK packed today
well you turned it off there
okay we started off and we was talking about the fact that when we perceive things they start off in origin as energy signals in the environment and we detect those changes in the energy and somewhere in the process they get converted into our experiences of perception
we perceive the objects or patterns or whatever
in the handout pattern perception is UNK with object recognition
object recognition is a case of pattern recognition i suppose
now we talked about attention as being a process whereby we could explain how it is that with all the information that we receive or our senses receive that we only process part of it and we saw that within the information processing model
now in is it UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK erm you'll notice that it UNK on UNK which is a particular interpretation of the type studies where you look at the responses of the brain to particular UNK
now as i said in one of the quotes that we were talking about a psychological explanation does not need to rest on physiological causes
in other words you can have what goes on in the brain at the hardware level does or at the level of UNK doesn't necessarily have to UNK with what goes on at a high level description
so leaving aside the hardware involved is feature analysis one of the processes involved in object perception
now what we're doing is a sort of historical UNK
we UNK erm the UNK feature detection the work of grandmother cells and we said that in fact that probably wasn't what was happening we were looking at UNK instead
now when their findings came out that the cell there were cells that appeared to UNK to feature UNK in the real world a number of theories immediately UNK up which tried to take this into account
so a number of theories of perception erm came on to the market as a response to the work of people like in the fifties and towards the end of the fifties we started to get theories of perception which were based on feature UNK
now there's loads of these different theories
there was a whole sort of i don't know what's the word UNK of them that came into being
er i'm gonna talk about a couple because it'll give you a bit of a flavour on perhaps some of the more popular works that you'll find in some of the text books
now the first one was UNK model
UNK it's actually pan UNK which is quite interest i couldn't work out what it really meant pan UNK across demons well that doesn't make much sense but you'll see why it's called UNK in the conventional sense model
there were two key components to this there were things that er were labelled feature demons and there were things which were labelled cognitive demons
now the feature demons UNK to feature UNK
so for example what you find is that they're a number of features are detected by the feature demons such as straight lines which are either vertical horizontal at an angle angles that UNK at ninety degrees half circles small circles so they it was UNK that there were a number of feature UNK that erm were UNK features early in the pr the perception process when these features were detected or well when these features were detected this information fed into cognitive demons which started to respond
so if y there would be the cognitive UNK which was the letter a and what would happen is it would start looking at the features that were coming into the system and it would say are they the ones associated with a
and if some of them are then the a cognitive demons start shouting that by analogy and that's why it's the UNK because many letters share similar features so that there would be lots of different little cognitive demons jumping up and down saying hey it's me as more features become apparent or more features are detected
the decision UNK which is this one over here which is p is a cognitive UNK looks at the UNK the output from the cognitive demons sees which one's shouting UNK and then decides that that's the letter
now as you can see that maps quite well with the sort of UNK feature UNK
you start off with a stimulus which is here there are the various bits that feed into the feature UNK
the feature UNK fire higher cognitive demons start UNK responding to the features that're fired
the more features that're fired the more likely it is that you'll get an out or the higher the activity level of the cognitive UNK and then the more likely that the decision UNK will decide that that's the appropriate character
i think that was fifty nine UNK model that was the year it was published
it was at the end of the fifties fifty eight fifty nine now i don't know whether you've done language yet
i'm n have you done anything on language
erm you'll find that there's something known as the UNK model which was proposed by john UNK which is UNK to this which is a feature detector for sound
it's when it's known as word recognition
it's for recognising words rather than features or objects visual
this i was taken to account for visual in particular of word UNK letter recognition through the visual system
UNK model was concerned with how we recognise wor UNK words and that was an a sort of UNK process to this
if you have a look at it it's quite sophisticated and you'll come across it certainly by the end of your second year
and that was the UNK models for about ten years feature models were quite popular in perception
erm i'll talk about one of the later models which was UNK e UNK as opposed to j which again was concerned with letters and whether or not we construct letters by recognising features from them
can i take this one off
okay although i'm referring to UNK work i mean this was typical of the time there were a number of other UNK who were using similar ideas and UNK
erm the idea is that letters are UNK specified by different UNK of features but certain letters would share more features than others so the idea is that you might consider that the letter x is made up of two features line going that way whoops yeah and a line going that way which when they're UNK together make the letter x the letter y is made up of a line going that way and a line going that way
they are UNK features that is one feature that is detected
now we're not su we're not UNK er UNK didn't suggest that was the feature that was specifically detected by erm UNK cells
it's just that we can think that is a feature that is detected by the UNK system
it wasn't said that there were cells that actually UNK to those features not but nonetheless the output from the system could be thought of as a feature detection system
now the ideas was that if you presented the letters x or y very quickly that people would tend to confuse them
if you present the letters very rapidly just so they could only just be detected erm you'd find that sometimes x and y would be confused whereas x and p were very rarely confused
now they used something called a UNK i'm not sure about the spelling of that which you don't come across these days it tends to be computers that're used
but a UNK was a bit like an UNK or a screen where you could flash a word up for a very shore period of time
there's a lot of work done on UNK in the sixties and the seventies
by and large they've been replaced by computers now
but you often hear the expression tack UNK stock UNK as presented by a UNK right there you go
some letters were found to be more often confused with other letters and these letters were deemed to share similar features e g b and p were often confused whereas b and x weren't so you'd be flashing either a series sequence of letters up some of which shared features some of which didn't or we thought shared features and then we saw whether they were confused or not and this was taken to support the idea that features were extracted from the input or that's how we constructed the letters or characters that we were UNK
interestingly enough when you come to language we'll find that that's a far more complicated topic
erm how do we recognise letters and words and you'll come into a lot of other factors influence that
but one of the earlier findings which began to cause problems was that the sound of the letters as well as the features determined whether or not they were confused so b and d for example sound similar therefore they tended to be confused
you could also find some letters that were confused they didn't share common features but they sounded the same and they tended to be confused as well there was a lot of enthusiasm from the work of the UNK th with the discovery of cells which appeared to be sensitive to particular features
erm that over a period of about ten years began to UNK and by and large now i think feature analysis per se has been abandoned as a as a model for understanding human perception
interestingly it does feed into some of the later ideas that were associated with UNK modelling i e using computers to recognise objects on model processes in particular UNK ones
the rip there're a number of problems with feature analysis and you can read books on them
erm i'll try and summarise them a UNK an understanding of perception whereby we say that i features are UNK extracted is unable to deal with ambiguous input
if the input information is slightly ambiguous then a feature UNK would be confused and unable to deal with it a pure feature analysis
for example if we take those words there i hope that most of you can work out that says the cat right some of you can be difficult and say that you can't but i should think that most of you can
but if you look at the h and the a's they're in fact feature wise identical but you're able to work out that one's er an h and one's an e based on the context
so any feature UNK would have to deal with context so therefore they started to look at the role of context and we're gonna look at UNK effects later on probably next week or the week after
so the way that we process or UNK it cannot just be we take a we take the information an and build up the letters by UNK the features from it because if you did that then the h and the a would come out the same both times but they don't
so there're other processes that're going on
right in a simple sentence UNK influences are not easily UNK accommodated by feature analysis
when you look at certain letters you can see that they've got exactly the same features involved in them
take the b p and d you often see that the p's the UNK du and the b's share similar features
they've each got ideally a circle and a line so they have identical features but they're different letters so clearly i mean it's quite obvious it's not only the features present but also their relationship to the other features that're present that determines what type of letter is recognised so any model of perception would have to take that into account
another thing when you look at how people recognise characters it's not a the features that they pay attention to but the overall shape
quite often when you're looking at people's handwriting you can tell by the overall shape rather than the single features
so a feature UNK would also have to take into account the overall shape of the letters so it's becoming a bit more complicated already in terms of the model that would have to account for it
now all of those criticisms come about on the work that's been done which has mostly been done on the recognition of characters and letters
erm wh most of these criticisms would become far more exaggerated or far more relevant if you considered what happens in the real world
what are the essential features in the real world
so these problems and similar ones to them are generally led to an UNK i suppose or a lack of interest in UNK in a pure feature analysis view to how we build up and recognise objects
the next topic we're moving on to in a way w is erm speaking in terms of time UNK the work of the feature analysis the feature UNK
erm it dates back to the twenties perhaps a bit earlier than that
we're gonna look at psychology and what they had to say about or the school had to say about perception
they were far more interested in how the whole image or the whole perception came about
rather than being concerned with the minor details being UNK into a more complex picture they were just interested in how we come to group erm features together for want of a although they weren't thinking about them as features
most of you have probably come across the saying the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
now to some extent what that's UNK in the role of perception is the fact that perception isn't a bottom up driven process
th it's not a case of everything's contained within the stimulus that's coming in and we elaborate it into UNK the object
er we bring ideas er concepts and knowledge which are very important in interpreting information
so they were in a way UNK th that sort of work or approach
now this psychology there's absolutely loads of stuff on it so and the UNK got quite a good coverage of it so i'll go over it quite quickly alright
generally it falls although i've used as the sub heading i suppose the overall title of this area is perception organisation the way that erm things become organised how we perceive them as an organised whole
okay with objects are perceived as structured coherent UNK rather than as UNK component parts
so they were quite interested in that process most people are probably aware that the school produced a load of laws that were associated with perception
interestingly they also influence memory
i don't know if you've covered the influence school on memory have you
in your memory lectures
is that a yes or a no
no
what lectures did you say
oh
well anyhow the had something to say about memory as well erm which is quite interesting
most of the ideas or the laws that were derived which erm UNK to the school derived from something called the law of now would anybody care to pronounce that
UNK
anybody here do german
no
does anybody here actually speak german
okay what does that mean
UNK any idea
UNK i s to be quite h i've forgotten it used to me it means something quite interesting and i've forgotten
so thirty five of several UNK possible organisations that one will actually occur which UNK the best simplest and most stable shape
so that's the UNK principle of the view of perception
most of the other laws if in a way follow on from that one you'll notice that i've sort of UNK the writing out today so you haven't got to do so much
same number of overheads to keep me happy but you've gotta write less to keep you happy there you go
now the sorts of laws that they came up with were things like the law of UNK the law of similarity the law of common fate good continuation and closure
right now the i mean there's loads more as well if you wanna look them up
they're the more common ones or the more popular ones
it's a very sad sight y'know to see all these empty seats
it's quite i'm sure they were UNK at the start alright
i mean is this a general tendency in most lectures or just mine
i've noticed
you can be UNK k o f k a okay
can i take this one down
a picture that you'll find to sort of try and ex give you an example of some of the l a the text books have got some great pictures on these particular sorts of examples of the laws in practice
we have here well what do we have here
that's an interesting question eh
okay what we actually have are a selection of dots UNK those little well sort of funny looking dots UNK dots there you go
yeah dots
we have those sort of things
but in fact the dots are seen as lines due to the laws of UNK and similarity
they were looking for the principles of organisation how it is that we organise things like dots into a meaningful whole why is it that we tend to see two lines crossing in the middle rather one two than two UNK
law of good continuity then you tend to get things like closure where instead of seeing four separated lines you tend to see a square or a UNK or whatever
the law of closure
the books are full of good examples
they've also got some lovely UNK erm figure and ground UNK wh ambiguous figures
y'know the old UNK and the young lady as victorian sort of principles
now when you look at the stuff it looks qui it's UNK it seems to describe what you see in practice
it seems to be a good account of it
but when you start to think about it in terms of erm sort of psychological explanation as you're becoming used to then it becomes perhaps not such a good way of thinking about perception UNK got some very examples in it of this of those sorts of things by and large were concerned with people's experience self reported experience quite often of the UNK saying well tell me what you see when you look at it rather than being based on the sort of lovely stuff that we love good solid empirical data yeah
so being UNK who can't get enough of it empirical solid data we tend to erm be a bit UNK of the methods that were used by the although these laws tend to describe what th what's happening they don't actually tell you how they're achieved
w what mechanisms what processes UNK these laws of perception
it doesn't really tell us very much about those at all
they weren't concerned with that although they did come up with some UNK um UNK static field or UNK fields in the brain or something
it wasn't really erm a very satisfactory explanation and it lost favour quite quickly there's lots more UNK lists a load of problems
these are sort of a summary of them erm i may have missed one of the minor ones out
the laws whilst they're pretty good at applying to things like erm visual UNK and two d and dots on pieces of card they're not very good at really applying to solid objects
it becomes very difficult to apply the laws to solid objects
surprisingly considering a lot of the UNK that were provided in fact rely on UNK information
what i'm gonna say may seem strange but they don't allow for certain UNK influences
now y'know you can come up with a description of that as an UNK but in exactly the same shape in a slightly different context yeah you know it's actually circular and it's a UNK and your perception of the object is different
they don't really give erm much of an account for w how it is that erm similar objects UNK grouped according to their laws erm can be perceived differently in different UNK
for those who came in late the essay titles are up on the first year notice board
essentially the four areas are UNK modelling what contribution a don't write these down because they're not the same as the ones on the board but it's looking at the role of UNK modelling in perception although you could start off with a broader definition of it within cognitive psychology
erm we're looking at the modern approach to th or modern UNK evaluation of the approach
looking at visual UNK and UNK errors and i ca what was the oth oh and the role of attention in perception
they're the four areas
some of which we haven't done yet some of which we have so it's up to you
you can either do what we've already done or you can base it on stuff that we'll do in the future
either way it should be helpful now interestingly people more recently and by that the late seventies and the eighties have attempted to actually UNK and measure the principles and they've come up with some fairly UNK experimental designs to take tha to explore these avenues
er i'm gonna give you one here although there are several more which you'll find references to in text books okay
now this is a lovely quote i think
it really gets over
UNK i think are sort of breaking things into their sort of components if you like
them on the floor and watch them UNK into natural pieces di dum di dum di dum in the absence of such a direct technique more UNK more indirect alternatives must b must suffice
they're saying is it'd be nice if you could take something that's a UNK perception and UNK it into the component parts
but of course that's very difficult
the notion of getting hold of a sort of re a perceived object and dropping it on the floor and watching it split into it's component parts is quite appealing if you take a if you imagine you could take an object that you're UNK yes
and you could break it into its fundamental component parts yeah
it's just what i said before
yeah now UNK who's one of the people in the quote has done a lot of work recently er by that in the last five six years looking at how we can investigate the or UNK the measures that w or the laws that were used by the
i'll talk to you about one of his experiments to give you a sort of flavour of it although other people and himself and others have done a lot of interesting work that's similar
right
let's have a look at this
what've we got
if you in case a if you imagine that you're presented with a piece of paper or card and it has two symbols on it right
it could have it like those like those like those or like those so that would be one deck of cards that you'd be given and they'd have the four types of symbols on them separately of course
now the alternative deck of cards in b would be those four
your task is regardless of the symbol that appears on the left to sort the cards into the four shapes right
so you ignore that symbol and you just decide which deck to pu pile to put them on based on those f the four first symbols
now in deck a it was argued or proposed that there is the symbols are similar whereas in group b the symbols aren't similar
so UNK argued it should be easier to process just the right hand signal if they're not grouped together if they if the processing system doesn't tend to group them as a single entity
so the it should be qu easier to sort these than it is to sort those
sorry the other way round
it's quicker to sort those rather than those because what tends to happen is that you process them as an entity rather than as single figures
it's a very difficult task when you come to do it if you want to have a little play at home
you can even entertain the kids
okay the task was to ignore the right hand bracket and to sort cards based on the left hand bracket in fact you'd sort them into two piles not four
he did a load of different experiments this is just an example of one of them
they're all very similar he or they UNK the notion that similarity they UNK by varying the distance between the two brackets the two pair of brackets
so how far away did you have to put them before you no longer saw the interference
what UNK and others are attempting to do is to UNK definitions for UNK similarity closure and those type of measures and then they're seeing whether or not they're using visual processing time or decision task or attention task to as v as ways of investigating the similarity or otherwise take this one off or
now another notion we talk about the idea of bottom up versus top down processing
bottom up processing is where you start with the input information whatever that might be and then you based on that input information you extract or UNK or extract more meaning from the input until you end up with whatever it is that you recognise
so the process starts with the data and it's totally determined by the contents of the data right
an it's a notion that you'll come across again and again in cognitive psychology
the alternative notion is the idea that you impose meaning on the input in which case it's a top down process and it relies on UNK information and information that you already have i on previous knowledge
in perception you tend to find models of perception that're based on top down or bottom processing
now the UNK feature analysis that we've done so far was predominantly a bottom up data driven process
whereas most of the models today that we think of we regard them as a mixture of the two but with a he and depending on the type of or the piece of perception that we're working on we have either one the other
we tend to have but they never they very rarely occur in isolation
there's always a little bit of bottom down and there's always a bit of top up regardless
so you th this distinction isn't a pure one
there there's no idea of a pure bottom up or pure top down process
by and large most cognitive processes are a mixture of the two and in fact it depends on the context that you're operating them in we tend to be able to split from one to the other
now in perception as we've mentioned that you've got bottom up and top down driven processing but what you've also got is something called global versus local processing
now this isn't a very good impression and i think you'd go to the doctors if you had something like this
the idea is i'll present it you and you can i won't try and UNK you with it because it is hard to do that under these UNK
what we've got is a shape here and a series of shapes there
now isolated they look fairly meaningless and it's very hard to work out what they are
that might be a letter or something
what you've actually got if you bung them together well you've got a sort of face
if you had a face like that you'd be down for plastic surgery tomorrow wouldn't you
i mean look at it
but er yeah UNK man mhm
down
there you go
i think you c well you c that's it
there's only global versus local processing above that a and b only make sense when seen together
a provides a context for b but b serves to provide context for a these are known as local features and that's known as a global feature
within perception you quite often get erm a local processing going on UNK apparently UNK with a global processing and the two sort of UNK influence each other
so that's distinct from top down or bottom up
there's another sort of notion of whether you process the global feature or whether you process the local features and you attempt to find out they it UNK vary between processes and which one they use but it's another way of UNK the sort of processing that goes on
i've only come across this with perception
you don't tend to get it in memory and problem solving although you get the forest for the trees in problem solving so i suppose it's there in a way
do you pay attention to local features to build up global or d the other way round
well it seems that the two UNK
it's hard to say it's one or the other
but it's another way of looking as processing
you could describe it as global or local
next we're gonna look at the role of context or UNK modelling
i'm not sure which one is better to present to you first
ah UNK modelling is easier for me to present to you but then the role of context might become more important so you can appreciate it in which case i shall give you that first
i don't know i'll have to think about it
normally i do the UNK modelling first then context but i might do it the other way round right
so it's one or the other next week
i've run out of things to say
thanks a lot
by scientific UNK
how're you spelling UNK as well
k u h n
yeah that's fine
erm long report can you do the short report
yeah
yeah
that was easy wasn't it
just a couple of things by way of introduction
erm the first point relates to a microphone here and er and er tape recorder and i think members of the sub committee will have received a note from the chief executive department
UNK are doing a study into the spoken language and are looking for i think ninety million words that are in common usage
they came to the county council and asked for our permission to record a number of meetings in order to get a variety of UNK and words different words they used
it's the same procedure that we accepted at the finance committee last friday and in mentioning it and hoping it will be acceptance that UNK can have the benefit of the UNK sub committee contribution for the next hour and a half or so
there's to be clear about it that it's completely confidential that their looking only for particular words that are used in different parts of the country and in different locations
no problems i presume sound
right
the second thing is that people everybody should have three extra pieces of paper erm relating to agenda item seven
the paper january reports on employee resources
one's headed UNK construction the other is page thirty two which needs replacing
thirty two that's plain paper out needs to come out and thirty two needs to go in
there's also the salary scale a green card
having said that can we move go into
yes
any apologies or UNK
certainly chair
there are no apologies but there are two UNK for this meeting
councillor to replace councillor and councillor to replace councillor
both for this meeting only
thank you
if we can move to the agenda
agenda item one
as we received the minutes of the personnel meeting held on the eighteenth of october nineteen ninety three
these minutes have been circulated with the agenda for the meeting of the policy committee on the second of november
chair just before we go into there's one quick thing i would like to add
i omitted the attendance of councillor from those minutes subject to that i would hope you would approve them
is it agreed that these minutes be approved
agreed
agreed
thank you okay if we then move to agenda item two
minutes of the appeal sub committee held on the fifteenth of october nineteen ninety three
paper a perhaps merely to receive this paper from the appeal sub committee fifteenth of october
agreed to receive it
agreed
agreed
thank you next item right agenda item three notes of the joint consultative committee held on the twenty first of october nineteen ninety three paper b if i could just say a few words
this meeting was i think the second meeting of management and staff side on the county council
it's part of an UNK programme of meetings where there's consultation between employee representatives and employer representatives
specifically most of the items that we discussed are picked up as agenda items throughout this particular agenda
for example on page two number nine one trade union recognition is item nine of our agenda
we could mention occupational health service review
this is going ahead and we had discussions with the staff side about that issue
local government review on page three is again an agenda item in relation to the staff commission at item ten in our agenda
couple of points that were made in relation to this particular report was the backing by the employee side erm to the wages board initiative that took when we wrote to the government saying that we felt that the abolition of the wages board was not in the best interests erm of the people of lincolnshire
and that was supported
there will be a further report at the next personnel meeting on the outcome of the meeting that we held with j c meeting on the twelfth of january and a further meeting is being fixed up for february
i don't know if anybody wants to make any comments about any of the items on paper b okay is it agreed to receive this report
agreed
agreed
if we would then move to agenda item four
association of county councils personnel sub committee digest paper c graham
it's simply a report circulating for information UNK really because of it's obviously it's a dated er paper that appears from a c because of the difference in committee cycles
if there are any items that er members would wish to pick up then i'm sure we would be happy to do so or the chair
well thank you
anybody want to make a comment on the a c digest
councillor
chair
two the nineteen ninety four pay round
erm basically we've got a very poor deal from the government this year in terms of an increase in our spending allowance
erm i note that for ninety five ninety six that they intend to give us two per cent rise
er with nothing in there to pay
and i note that in ninety six ninety seven we're gonna get one and a three quarter per cent rise
and again with nothing to pay with the county's expected to find the money for pay rises for their staff from savings from UNK
now i mean we've always been told that this is been an efficient run county council and that the scope for making savings is just not there
we've got inflation that i it looks to be pressing perhaps to three and a half per cent between four and three and a half per cent
erm we've got pay review bodies which may we don't know what they'll come out with in terms of recommendations for the pay increases and i think that this is placing the councillor in a in a very bad po er position
erm i don't think it's fair upon the employees and i don't think it's fair on the counties
erm i just wondered if you from your manage from your meetings with the a c that you would want to pass on any more comments on that
thank you
come back to that
does anybody else want to make a contribution on this paper
what er councillor says but i can't find it
it's agenda i it's two
no
is that right
no
i think i think the chancellor in the erm budget speech on the thirtieth of november actually said that local government increase in spending will be two and a quarter per cent in nineteen ninety four five
two per cent in ninety five six and one and three quarter per cent in ninety six seven
yes i appreciate that but i just wondered why we were discussing that here now when we were turned down
i'm sorry i just was a bit confused
right i think it's to do with the fact that two on this digest is about the
pay round and the pay round is linked to what money
given to actually give to the local authorities
any other contributions
if i could just pick up the point you made councillor i think that at the a c discussions there was a great deal of UNK and understanding of the need to consult with staff side in the run up to the beginning of formal consultations
and i think that a comprehensive consultation exercise has got to bear in mind that the key question and that's UNK
that we recognise that local authorities are in a difficult position
we also recognise so to are the workers of county councils and district councils particularly because the er the government initiatives one good point to v a t on fuel and the increasing in national insurance contributions and increases in taxation so between the two sides has got to be some accommodation bearing in mind the need for both of us to want to continue to deliver quality services
it's going to be a tough nineteen ninety four
anything else of agenda item what is it c paper c okay
do we agree that the digest be noted
agreed
agreed
thank you
right paper d agenda item five options and UNK annual report
thank you chair
michael
er we report annually to you on our UNK of the options and the horizon agencies
erm the options agency is a county wide youth training agency with contracts with the lincolnshire and the greater peterborough er training and enterprise councils
er we're also with that particular agency looking to establish a contract with the er south humberside
the majority of the training is within the options agency erm achieve a positive outcome and i do apologise with all the jargon that will creep in erm positive outcomes in terms of these programmes are that they achieve jobs
national UNK qualifications
n v UNK or they go on to higher er studies in further education
and virtually everybody who joins the options agency has a positive outcome to more than one in some cases er in so far as that agency is concerned
so overall the options agency has had another successful year
internally the options agency UNK training for young people who qualify to our employees at the county council and so we do receive assistance through the youth training programme and with our costs as an employer in training young people to achieve the these positive outcomes and n v UNK and so on
so the options agency has had a good year and hopefully will again next year
the UNK agency serves lincoln and district and that's called the lincoln travel to work area which UNK virtually UNK as far as UNK to the east and UNK to the er west and market UNK to the north and UNK to the south so it's a very large proportion er of the county but it's called the lincoln travel to work er area
and it serves it from premises in road and lane in lincoln
it has a contract with the lincolnshire tech
for youth training and a contract for adult training
and it is UNK over the years in craft training particularly in relation to the building and engineering trades and has made unique provision in the district for the less able
the less able in the jargon of these programmes are called an s t n special training needs
er the method of funding is changed for these programmes and this is leading to particular problems for the UNK agency
er we started off originally with all our expenses being met on these programmes
it then moved to being paid so much per week for an trainee and we now have a mixture of such much a week and so much for the output related UNK the jobs the n v UNK the f e courses which i mentioned earlier
and there is a move to move adult training particularly to total output related funding
the tech is funded in this sort of way by the er national arrangements and they in their turn has passing that on to various suppliers
this will pose particular problems for the UNK agency because we rely very much on the weekly allowance for the people with special training needs because their output in terms of o output related funding is relative to the so our income is cutting for the people with the who need the highest training staff ratio in order to succeed
and this UNK particular problems for us in the UNK agency
we are in discussion with the tech and those discussions are not included
erm we're meeting er on a fairly regular basis with them to see if we can seek some solution
and you'll see in the report that we do point out that some of the training that we do things like woodwork training and brickwork training are relatively expensive to deliver compared with other training of UNK
erm and we've had i'm afraid to give protective notice to six members of staff it's about er discussions with the erm tech are not successful then they will have to leave us at the end of this programme year which is the thirty first of march
that difficulty on one sense UNK the successes that the agency has had and this is particularly successful in the area of catering training and business training
we do run er an organisation called lincoln energy save out of the UNK agency which er UNK programmes er in er properties
it's in part a government and partly e c funding programme and er the rules on that have been changed which will make many more people eligible for assistance with er UNK on their houses
trained people are on the way and many of the people that we train go onto work college other commercial agencies
so there are successes in UNK agency you just have to at the moment by the difficulties in finding the necessary funding to cater for people who are not great UNK in terms of output funding
right
i'll be happy to answer any questions chair
thank you
right councillor and then councillor
well er i think you know it's a i mean in er one way it's a it's a good it's a good report i mean and er it UNK you know the success of what the we've got
i mean we've got this it's been on mrs i know she has the same as i do but er the these people who need such help i mean i'm not being it just it just they've just not included in the programme really and er we've written i think from this committee over the years er made submissions over the years and message still doesn't seem to have got through that er this and i think very valuable work that can contribute to the quality of life for all of us if we can improve the lot for these people
it does reflect right through society er still doesn't the message still doesn't get home and i would like to move mr chairman that er we do again er write and see if we can get some special recognition of this very serious problem that there is
there's some valuable work gone on there and you can and if and if we're going to deny these people the opportunity of achieving anything like their potential i mean it seems such a shame when we you know when we are UNK in the rest of the programme
and i would like to ask you er and the rest of the committee of who whatever we can do and that the officers should advise us what we can do to make a further submission
i don't i think we must do because it UNK it's as sp it's been a slow UNK down for these people and we're getting now very near to the bottom where we're not going to be able to help any of them at all
so i would urge the committee to make a submission on their behalf chair
thank you
councillor
erm yes well i go along with er councillor on that
but first of all i would like to say the officers of the agencies really should be UNK on
doing a good job
i'm sure councillor and erm and certainly there does seem to be more emphasis on helping people with difficult educational disabilities and those with learning difficulties but if we could encourage even more excellent and i think it's very important that er bank agencies er emphasise the fact that it's training plus their main aim being er also a qualification which does help them get erm jobs
and the end product record does seem to be very good particularly erm er you know with options seventy five per cent you know very good indeed
but could we please be told just a little bit more about UNK course er run by horizon that's mentioned in the last paragraph erm on the on green one it's on the first page
defined as severely disadvantaged young people
does that include young people with severe physical and UNK disabilities
yes the UNK course was really a further work orientation course for people who had just left school
mm
and generally speaking they had left the special schools of is it st UNK in er lincoln and er other special schools and they were not they hadn't had sufficient er work experience or knowledge of the possible market to find jobs at the moment
and so what we did we ran this particular course erm for which we received a fee but it came back as expenses area wasn't under the same arrangement as the rest of it
and we UNK got people placed in various work places which was sympathetic to their particular disabilities
when you get down to these groups of people you have to work with each individual if you you'll know and find somewhere where you can UNK on their strengths and hopefully get away with whatever disabilities they had
so some people were very low academic people some had physical problems and er some had er combination of problems erm which er very often you would find er combination of problems
but it was UNK to accept that sort of course
we had run one in an earlier year erm i think that was slightly a different type but that er the idea was the same
have you thought of sorry chair
mm
er will be spreading to the er other parts of county as well
erm i suspect er that the tech
if it sees a needs for this
yes
er type would contract with somebody else apart from elsewhere in the county erm rather than with us
er we're not erm geared for instance to deliver a course like that in UNK but some other agency may be
yes
and we haven't thought to do it from anywhere else other than
press forward
we don't i mean whatever experience we have we are not available to any other
thank you
okay thanks
councillor
thank you chairman
er the question on b five please
erm could you tell us a little more about the venture and the this one
yes i'm no expert i though if you probably are erm but as i understand it it's erm it's growing or starting plants off erm to grow in a UNK culture
yes
erm it's an odd plant i've UNK round it sort of steam heat situation as far as i can tell
and that fairly quickly but erm it's it really producing plants in a forced situation which i don't translate into others and grow strongly elsewhere and er i'm afraid i'm no expert in this plan
UNK
this is this is this is a way that er erm garden centres and whatever er do produce a lot of their material
and there is quite a lot of growth in employment in gardening centres at the moment
particularly if you can send somebody who has knowledge of the process as well as the n v q with the point there that was being made erm and we felt that this was a growth area
we have had quite a few trainees youth trainees in garden centres and golf courses which surprised me but golf courses apparently could use quite a lot of people
and er this extra interest we thought would er you know force their chances of employment
so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that idea
i think at the moment the it's the scottish theory not proven but it looks UNK
thank you i'm UNK that it is a viable UNK future
well i think so
i mean can you
we feel it's got a in a sense of what we produce within the training situation we know we can sell
good
and we also feel it got a future to the people who are working within it in that it will lead them on hopefully to useful employment opportunities
the people who take this job on are not necessarily the highest UNK they tend to be looking for a job with a particular interest in that and are sort of reliable and UNK people
perhaps they have been finding our UNK version of you know to be there early and to be there late and sometimes be there saturday and sunday as well
mm
so that i mean they are getting a reasonable working environment or reasonable view of the working environment so that it doesn't come
everyone's got a skill it's just having erm finding it
well
UNK it really
thank you
thanks
right anyone else
okay
just to come back to councillor point
the difficulty in a sense that we got if we look at two paragraphs towards the end the report
paragraph five two actually su actually suggests that output related funding a hundred per cent output related funding based on achieving jobs and n v UNK has been tried by lincolnshire tech
with a view to introducing it to all contracted providers in nineteen ninety four ninety five
we then actually go over to paragraph five which refers to the fact that output related funding has an effect on UNK because essentially we're dealing with people that have got special training needs
mm
so we in a sense we've got a clash of principles or a conflict between for example the government wanting the lincolnshire tech to have an hundred per cent output related funding based on jobs and n v UNK which is not er perhaps er an easy way of delivering output related funding services to people who've got special training needs
which seem to me re reasonable to be suggesting that we could lobby government in order to say that people with special training needs can't be included within the whole of the hundred per cent linked output related funding be because the issue is that then er they do have special training and that's that that's the justification for them that particular group
putting them to one side from the ordinary trainee where you could expect jobs and n v UNK to be the outcome and for them to be treated as a special case
i mean i don't know what people would think of that
well i'd like to do that we do that i mean we have i think made some submissions in the past but i think it's now quite clear that the fears that we've expressed in this committee over the years are well founded and we've got to the point where the whole er project for the special needs people is going is going to be very vulnerable
but i mean it could be er could be ver we're talking about redundancies now aren't we so it er i think you know i'd like to move that we do that if the if there's a seconder and lobby very strongly
okay
i wonder chair if i might comment
we have in the past raised this through the er association of county councils in the education side with and we there was quite a lot of support and also have had support in the past from er kenneth UNK and douglas UNK erm who were supported the view er which was particularly in relation to youth training as this is more adult training we're talking about here
but i think there is a body of opinion out there that we could tap which would be supported
jim's proposition
is it seconded
UNK
right anybody else want to speak about that approach
er i take it chairman that this would be through our ideas about the
oh we could do it in a variety of ways
we could actually go to the association of county councils
described all the avenues that we can pursue
yes
would that would improve things certainly would improve things mr chairman
i mean
presumably department of trade and industry is it contains erm minister of state under our local all the six lincolnshire m p's
mm
chairman i have spoken to kenneth UNK and his and he's very sympathetic
right
so the be sympathetic response from us
yes
fine
is that agreed then
agreed
agreed
thank you
thank you michael
if we could move to paper e item six joint staffing watch
again back to yourself michael
erm chair this is the joint staffing watch for september ninety three and its mandatory on the county council that it's presented to the committee er within a period of preparation as it is issued to the media
it's the snap shot of people paid in a period and it has in it UNK with the previous quarter june ninety three and the previous year september ninety two
there are in this second page national UNK between june ninety two and june ninety three between local authorities
it is of limited UNK and it's perhaps a requirement on local government that they could very well drop
erm because it seems to with the changing nature of organisation of authorities it's used as a comparative purpose must be er very doubtful and we've always UNK it er beginning the position UNK on a particular the day it doesn't say what's in the pipeline or what's going out of the pipeline at the other end
and we do know that from UNK the september report is a particular UNK one
erm but there it is it has value just in itself as a UNK
the next papers that we have chairman are much more useful in management terms and er if anybody has any questions on this particular report i'll be happy to try and answer it
thank you
if we just pause for a moment and look at the a c digest that the papers see
there is an item about this joint staffing watch at item ten which suggests that the government are also finding that it's got limited use and are suggesting that these returns should be completed on a different basis and rather than quarterly annually
so this joint staffing watch as it exists at the moment has got a very restricted shelf life an and i doubt if it's going to survive
but anybody want to ask any questions or raise any points about it
next year it's very limited use and we find the same situation in south which is move that we agreed to that in the report
anybody else
is that agreed jim
fine
at the farmers expense
agreed to the report be noted then
agreed
agreed
thank you
at much
a much more substantial document
paper f employee resource report
erm chris
thank you chair
can i just remind er members on the er additional papers that were placed in UNK in front of them this morning
page thirty two about UNK you'll substitute for page thirty two in the report and the report on UNK construction fit happily between pages twenty six and twenty seven and apologies for the UNK of that particular
report
paper f i believe gives you as the employing committee of the county council a mine of information about the employee profile of lincolnshire county council
it's numbers permanent temporary casual employees at a at er first of october via employment group full time part time agenda grades and ward salary and so forth
in addition of course there is a brief commentary by the departmental head or the general manager of the public service unit saying something about the movement in staffing over the previous year and a brief word or two about what is going to happen in the current and future years
this report of course is capable of further UNK and we will welcome any suggestions for further UNK and we want to improve it
we do want to provide information that is useful to you in the overall management of the employees resource and accounting
erm always has a
UNK i think the parliament use that it er the cost preparing such detailed information must not be UNK er to the use it's going to have and with that UNK we would welcome further er erm suggestions as to UNK and er i'm not going to go through this in detail
it is all there for you and we will endeavour to answer any questions that you may have
if we can't answer them this very day or in fact if they do not occur to you this very day but on UNK occasions of course we will endeavour to answer the points a little later on
thank you
certainly we employ thirteen thousand seven hundred and ninety one staff as at the first of october
a substantial work force and this is th a valuable document a wealth of information
welcome any comments
just to congratulate the officers for putting this together
er i think as the other previous document was UNK useless this is useful and i mean i think it's er something we can't take in a day and night to spend to spent some more time over this because yo you know it does reflect very well on er particularly that er information that we needed earlier in terms and er
i think you know it it's er something we made not all that
thank you
councillor
erm just a quick erm question please chairman
will this be available to the trade unions
this document
i'm sure it will be
i'm sure if it's not already
well i'm sure they
i'm sure they will want what the previous one was actually
useless now
thank you
councillor
yes chairman two questions
first on page nine computer services er i know we see an increase in the staff information technology
has there been a corresponding decrease or has there been an increase at all in other departments er due one UNK through having more information there will be a staffing reduction elsewhere
has this occurred
i think sir it will be very difficult to identify erm quite where the reductions are
as you know the authorities or control very closely as to the additional members of staff that come on
erm and each chief officer and each general manager has to er look very closely as to whether we can afford additional staff and er recruit them
but to identify one on and one off as it were throughout the organisation i it would be er virtually impossible
in addition of course there are great demand for increased information
indeed what you have before you is a demand for increased information and this is generated by er a computer system for example
the growth of er information technology in mounting information is required at member level and chief officer level has indeed been enormous over these years and does not necessarily reflect in reductions elsewhere
thank you
just another question i want to know
sure
okay
no problem
er page thirty six paragraph two the new environment officer the first the question first and as i understand it please correct me erm the agreement policy was there was to be one environment officer personal assistant
here is that there's mentioned of further assistance
also there is also further assistance further assistance to or support to members in addition to the extra secretary that is being established
first UNK the question and i'd like to comment as well is erm what are there plans for the future of greatly expanding environment department er and why is it er and why is it not being put through policy first
wh what i remember going through policy is the fact that we wanted to employ us environment officer with some clerical support and i think that that's actually what went to policy
and that is what is agreed sir
the er environment officer post has been established and has been filled
the clerical support office officer has not yet been filled and that is one of the two mentioned
because of one of the two mentioned here in this note has nothing at all to do with the environment
yes well it is er yes well i comment on that when i get more
yeah
so
yes
that that's i think that's
so the posts that are to be established and to be filled are exactly as those approved by the policy committee
no more
so
so as far as i know there are no plans
so are you UNK to say what exactly has been in numbers
one environment officer
one clerical support
yes well i see fr from this it's not exactly clear not exactly is what is intended
it implies there are more to come
not to my knowledge
thank you
well i'd just like to comment on the as here we're talking about the environment officer
er i should know that or certainly agree that all the staff in the environment must have coped UNK adequately well before under the UNK system where each officer each department was instructed to deal with the environment as it came along
er i'm in the view that this er environment department is at the moment is doing nothing at all anything that's happened so far
it don't seem to be any good at all whatsoever
so i believe it is a rather a waste of money it's just talking shop UNK papers about and we regret that in the time when er resources are difficult staffing could be put elsewhere instead of this
right i note your comments
but don't agree with them but were certainly noted
councillor
thank you
with these posts as well because it has actually stated we have employed an environmental officer
yes we know that
and then there are two further posts two UNK over the next twelve months
one to provide assistant to the environment officer and the other to provide further assistants into to members
right
instead of one extra there's two extra
yeah i th i mean i can i can see precisely where you're coming from
but i think that the two further posts one is provide assistance to the environment officer which is a clerical support that councillor referred to
full stop
the other post nothing to do with the environment to provide further assistance and support to members
but why should members need even more support
i mean
hang on that's not the same question as the environment
i think we've got that one sorted out haven't we
it's
i'm sorry this is all under environment
yes
no it's not
no it's not
it's under the UNK execs department employee resources
yes
i appreciate that but it comes in the same paragraph so it you must admit that it's a little er confusing
well it's not meant to be
i mean there was no intention to do that
i think we can agree that there's one environment officer one clerical support for the environment officer and one erm of clerical support for assistance and support to members
now i think once we've established that we can have argument about whether members need more assistance but at least we're arguing on the same basis aren't we
i agree now yes it was just all in the same paragraph and it just sort of a bit odd
point taken
councillor
thank you chairman
one of my constituents that i read in the newspaper about the erm the green way in which the party should be moving and said that erm he would like me to express my UNK to and i thought this perhaps this would be quite a useful place to his UNK but council tax money is being spend on this sort of erm work when there are far more urgent erm services needed in the county and he would much rather have the highways er money from which is now going into the environment to go into highways erm so as er chairman council i'm passing his comments on to you through this committee
he feels it's a complete waste of money and he would like it to go please
so i pass this message on
right
some people take a view that the quality of land air and water in lincolnshire is important
yes er maybe i wouldn't have mentioned it but er well that's a story of one like dozens of people UNK us that at long last we're going to do something about the environment and protect it for the future of our children and they consider it money well spent and asking the question why wasn't it never done before
i think they know the answer
but it was it was so restrictive the er the way that it was handled you know just with the er senior members of the conservative meeting and the er friends of the earth and such as that
it never came to the fore
so that now at least the people are becoming more aware
and people are more aware of the environment so i see no problems on that score whatsoever from members and er not convince people but er we er advising them more of what's going on and becoming more aware of the problems that there are within the environment
before i move on to other contributions can i remind everybody that we are dealing with the employee resources report
and this is not a sub committee of the sub committee of environment
right
you've been very UNK chair
councillor
thank you chairman i can note that remark but i do think that we do have to defend the position a little on environmental issues
i mean the tories are ready shouldn't they complete to environmental issues whereas every public consultation or survey that ever carried out demonstrates every time that the public are very concerned that they're of the environment and they will put it at the top of the list and i think our con the environment by having a dedicated environment officer proves our positive er commitment to the environment
it's it seems to me to be UNK
obviously it's something that's gonna develop and er as times does on more and more issues are gonna be referred to this committee
thank you
councillor
thank you chairman
just a brief comment
i can't remembered who said it a little earlier but they said that the er conservatives er dealt with the environment as it came along and it's been all too apparent that they UNK dealt with it as it came along
it was hit and miss and it was more miss than hit
and qui and most certainly demonstrated the need to set up the very same committee as we have set up
thank you
thank you chairman
a bonus for anybody who wants to move away from page thirty six when they make a contribution
i've got councillors erm and who have spoken already
i think i'll er i think you ought to move on chair
right
any anybody else
i'm not i'd be happy if you were to come back but not on the environment
it's just that i've really chairman page thirty three little one could somebody er the growth a review of the authority contracts hire for officers
why is there i've assumed from that there is a need for more contract hire for the officers
why is this
if i'm please if i'd known i'm sorry sir
yes it is in the authorities interests that as many of it's travelling employees as possible use the car contract hire scheme because it saves the authority money and yes officers around this large county have the cheapest possible rates
to see that there is a take up of the car contract hire scheme it constantly has to be held or kept UNK the scheme has to be kept under review to make sure that it is attractive and it is what er the employees want to see and would prefer rather than an UNK means of transport
so we're do encourage it we hope that it will grow and resume counties interest if it does grow
if it does grow then there is a certain amount of administration that has to go along with it
all of which is UNK in
point
sure but on that then we get the benefits of scale and i think it's a well proven scheme and i think the evidence is there that it is
thank you for that support jim
right
if nobody else wants to make a contribution do we agree that the report be accepted
agreed
agreed
thank you
if i could just add my thanks to the officers substantial piece of work which is i hope going to be used by many members to come for the next year
right
can we move on to item eight
annual report on equal opportunities
paper g jack
yes thank you chair erm
about eighteen months ago this committee reviewed and revised erm it's equal opportunity policy
and accept a few requirements on officers which are identified in paragraph er two of the report
so the report before you is the first real annual report on equal opportunities inter county council so you've got all the relevant statistics and in that sense it UNK the previous report that you've just examined
and identifies target which have been pursued or have been agreed and are being pursued throughout the county council
appendix one of the report sets out the position in relation to registered disabled employees of the county council july ninety three and you will see there in summary
that we've had a slight increase in the percentage of our employees albeit that's got to be seen against erm er a lower total of employees altogether
it does indicate nevertheless a step in the right direction
but one needs to add to it at least two relevant considerations
one is that registered disabled employees and we will be bringing forward further proposals on initiatives to you at the next meeting and i hope that if you agree that will be amongst other things with the issue of non registered disabled employees and the other consideration in looking at movements in targets and so on is inevitably the whole job market situation and the opportunities for achieving that
appendix two er challenges a er UNK profile
erm and i would like to come on to that immediately if i may but again it does indicate erm a movement in the right direction of getting more er women employees into higher management levels
a small movement but nevertheless a movement in the right direction
erm this report will be the subject of consultation with your employee representatives after you've received it
erm but having been supported by each chief officer and general manager you will see in paragraph eleven of the report the various actions that have been taken over the last twelve months or so and i would like to pick out particular the fact that chief officers are now operating or required to have effective arrangements for achieving equal opportunity in employment in their department or unit
the county council as a whole is now operating and using this new logo UNK conditions that go with it for the employment of the disabled
we are going to
we have star started a monitoring scheme for ethnic monitoring
a trial some
people would say
and more particularly in appendix three you've got for the first time individual chief officers and general managers comments for achieving a better equal opportunity profile in their department or unit
erm i really don't want to add anything else other than the summary erm that i gave you on appendix one chairman but if you move over to appendix two for a start erm this first of all relates only to our a t in and we hope in future to improve this sort of information in the other employee groups
erm members may well want to look at this and spend a bit of time examining it
could i just make a correction which would help in that respect
on the total okay so twenty nine to thirty four throughout on all the relevant places
but i do suggest to you that about demonstrates what we've really known all along it was UNK that county council actually has more women employees than men
but actually we need a lot more women employees in terms of opportunity and advantage to them at the senior management levels
as i've mentioned earlier we've got a slight movement in the right direction
i hope that the targets that are before you in appendix three demonstrate the way in which individuals and general managers do have inevitably their targets vary because of the circumstances of their particular er unit or department
erm i'll try to answer any questions you may have on appendix three bearing in mind all the detail there involved
but i do suggest that if necessary we can come back with answers later on
i do suggest that if you with your relative responsibilities want to you could take that up with the individual chief officer and general manager and i just do need to draw your attention to the fact that the targets and the whole policy in education does not apply in schools because that is the responsibility of UNK individual government bodies
so in that sense your role is purely advisory
with that chair i would recommend that you agree the er support you brought before you which is as i said will the subject of full consultation with your employee representatives
thank you
councillor and then councillor
yes when i looked through appendix three the equal opportunities targets and the public service units
when i saw computer services i was immediately a bit disappointed
er to say nothing referring to the registered disabled and any positive er encouragement taken on
but i can reassure members that i've spoken to the department and they are committed to attempt to encourage disabled applicants for jobs and taking them on
it's more of an UNK on the paper than an UNK in a er intent
erm they do they are they have had er registered disabled employees previously er and they are committed in one ex example of two work experience er children from the st UNK special school they take two every year er for works experience training and i do intend to talk to the general manager and ensure that they are encouraging di disabled people to apply for jobs of that kind
thank you
that's most helpful
right councillor
well thank you chairman
er first of all i would like to say i'm all for equal opportunities
erm but i do believe who is the best person for the job
and then to apply for a job i think should be on the complete basis of what they are what they've achieved what they've done regardless of whether they're male or female
erm there's a perfect example in appendix three in and planning it's the second page of appendix three and to read through it and i won't read it because obviously everybody has done
every is going to be female now does that mean to say that if no males apply or if you only advertise for someone female which i presumably erm actually going to er run the UNK do it
only fe only males apply they won't get
could i just
i mean i it's so it really does it does
when we are trying to get into equal opportunities and as i say i agree with you entirely but i still think that the best person for the job
i take i take that equal opportunities does raise peoples erm blood pressure to say the least
i think that the points that i want to make here because people come from different positions is one this is a long term strategy
right in UNK other words within four to eight years
UNK so there could be
so there could be a number of chartered engineer vacancies come up during those four to eight years but during the next four years hopefully we will be able to recruit one female chartered engineer
now the point about merit has to be recognised side by side with opportunities because the points that i want to say firstly the many women and people with disabilities under achieve
th they then very able to do jobs but the lack of for example training and they don't get into those jobs and secondly we need to make an equal opportunities culture very clear so that women can come forward and don't feel as though the they're going into a workforce that it to totally male dominated which is quite off putting
so it's about culture training opportunities and to make sure that people from whatever walk of life and whatever UNK or race or ability to have or disability do not under achieve
i mean that's m my contribution as a committed person to equal opportunities but i'd welcome an example
well if i may chair i would like deal with it in terms of the principle or the policy and then the application to highways planning
you are right and indeed all of our advice all the particular professional that michael union gives to all of the er county council matters is that recruitment is on merit
it is unlawful accept in two areas to er discriminate in the way that you suggested but essentially our appointment process is on merit
it there are two exceptions that i mentioned we must give prior consideration in any vacancy that we have for a registered disabled applicant
i would like to see that for a disabled applicant but nevertheless for a registered disabled applicant and we can make special provision for the training of er under represented groups
and i hope that when we bring our initiatives to you next month you will see how we are addressing that
so in general terms i agree with you and that's the way it works with the exceptions i mentioned
specifically in highways and planning if you look at the previous report the UNK following profile one you will see that in the highways planning department UNK the offices it is almost entirely male and i think this is it's for the director of highways and planning to say in the end i think this is an acknowledgement by him that in the way that you mentioned nevertheless it seems to be apparent in some way shape or form women are not getting equal opportunity in that department
chair may i just come back on one point
mm
thank you
i can appreciate all that and i appreciate the way in which females are being encouraged to apply for posts
but i hope at the end of all this there will still be how much training you've had that when the post is eventually advertised it will still be
and that is the situation
i i'm pretty sure that that's so chair and you d when you say you're recruiting erm young people from school training or erm taking them on to engineering vacancies
you do have people from both sexes of equal abilities and potential strengths and it would be possible at that stage to have a training pool of people which perhaps er UNK the balance and perhaps er gradually have available many people but you can only do that if people come forward without skills that you need in order to train them into the jobs
er and that's one of the problems is persuading good people to put their names forward for these jobs and that's how you present it
yep
right
yep
councillor
yes i think councillor has just highlighted is that there is a need for a change in the culture
i worked in a construction industry and er and it was a male orientated dominated er industry and i think what councillor is probably just taking small parts in isolation highways and planning which has at least one chartered engineer and additional female
you've then got to go below that and say this was achieved through actual and it is the advertising making the public aware that we are prepared to employ females providing they're good enough
and this also has got to be encouraged through the schools so that er young er you know women leaving school going into career will realise that they will be accepted into a previously male dominated industry
that's really what it's all about
you know probably some of us are too old to accept this but er the younger people
UNK erm
will er the younger people will be encouraged to start to accept this and it is a change in our thinking that it i find it difficult as well
but i'm certain by doing it this way we will encourage females to put in for these posts
even that our managers have got to be made by way of
councillor has said will they be accepted on merit
i would ask will the men be accepted on merit and i would suggest that in the past only a suggestion but i'm very aware of it that men were taken on and they weren't even as good as the women so applied in the past
can i just be clear councillor that you meant no UNK to the councillors at all
erm 'cos if you did i'm sure that wouldn't be popular in this committee
under equal opportunities they could both be the same age
yeah you don't want any
councillor
erm yes thank you chairman
it does seem to be on the whole a very encouraging report
i am pleased with the targets that each department's have achieved
er with regard to erm disabilities
for a number of increase in employed
but i would like to say that this is very much and i think councillor knows that previous personnel committee it's all in the mind we want former administration and one of the latest tests was the adoption of the national disability symbol and encourage them to talk about it
erm i do understand that er you know we've got another report coming to us tomorrow on it and there may be some additions on it disabled people hopefully about getting more people to disabled people to that that's another aim we help people to
i think other people want to speak actually
oh sorry of course i've forgot
i'd be delighted for your time
i mean i fully acknowledge that this equal opportunities policy was initiated at a sub committee on the ninth of october ninety two so you know there isn't an argument on this occasion about previous conservative policies coming forward
right
councillor
erm thank you mr chairman
erm as you know erm we did have erm equal opportunities erm conference erm in erm what came out of it was the fact that although you could provide training it was trying to get the confidence er into the women to have the nerve to apply for jobs
erm and a lot of them training but unless you can actually erm increase their confidence and that is the attitude of the people all over the place
so it's going to take a very long time because it has been male orientated but until we get the attitude of the work place which is encouraging their UNK to apply for jobs instead of oh of course i don't think i will apply for that job
and the women are very difficult about apply for the jobs so i think it's going to take an awful long time erm i'm all in favour of equal opportunities erm on all accounts and i would agree with councillor that one of the difficulties about registered dis disability is that a lot of people who could actually be a registered disabled person but for reasons of pride don't want to be registered disabled
erm a lady could be try and get the stigma away from that registration
thank you
thank you
i mean i do i do take your point about the culture and it and it's it is a significant issue which will take some time i mean probably wi with your experience in social services you'll know that a substantial number of directors of social services are in fact female and maybe one of the questions that we have to ask at a senior level is our s senior erm chief officers erm the fact that we've got no woman chief officer and it may well be because now that we've got an equal opportunities policy that we may get applications from erm very able women who see that we have got a clear commitment to equal opportunities demonstrated in this paper
councillor
yeah thank you chairman
i know the erm remarks made about getting extra people to register and to have their green card i'm probably one of a few councillors with a green card
but i must say that having got that i do not regard myself as disabled i have a disability i do not regard myself as disabled and it's this business that you have registered as disabled person which is a bit of a stigma
i think perhaps here though it might be something we have had a paper earlier about the j c c's meetings and it might be something that unions might be able to help us with
because sometimes if the employer goes along people will think oh yes they're only doing it to get their quota up and they regard it as something that just helps us and we can get nearer our quota and it might be something that we could encourage the unions to help us with because they could point out the positive benefits to people to be registered despite the rotten name that they're called
right so that's a good point for the next j c meeting
right councillor
right i don't want to repeat what's been said in fact i wouldn't like to speculate around the age of any member of the
right
what i would like to say is that on the er it is question of culture it does take time er in my experience i've been very interested in theological debate that's run with the ordination of women
in fact we in UNK we've been UNK women for the last twenty five years and it has become as natural as breathing to us
but it does take time and i think you know this puts the this gives the framework in which this can usually open the opportunities and the methodist women are not short of confidence and i think that's why i married an UNK you see
right
well it just gives a framework with that relieve that problem
right
thank you for that UNK contribution councillor right any anybody else wish to speak
councillor
briefly chairman yes i fully note that the county council will encourage younger women especially to come forward er especially to higher grades as they are under represented er i think there's hope in the future because college and universities are now more what were considered male dominated territory more and more women are coming forward and inevitably by sheer weight of numbers in the years to come they will be er they will come forward and i'm sure we will find on a say chief officers for the county council
going back to hire and planning section i bear that all in mind i do fear that under hire and planning especially when it says at least they're not at least that is UNK on the possible discrimination because as councillor said if no one all the best males forward and they're all better than the females after four years say the erm surely the highest paid the temptation is going to be say that er for example that er inferior female employee instead of a inferior female to a male
erm i think that sums it up
when you've coped with a positive situation which is in fact i believe is er will do more harm that good as a personal i believe
well two things i can assure you that married women will remain the one of the most issue on selection
positive action rather than positive discrimination is the approach and that these are targets not erm contracts and if after four to eight years it may well be the case that women have been taken on and have left and at the end of the time that there is no woman chartered engineer
but there are targets and i think targets are important in order to shape a culture
right
if nobody else wants to speak erm councillor you're to deliver the recommendation
thank you
recommendations one and two
right
thanks that's paper g if we could move on to paper h trade union recognition
jack
yes chair if i may it'll be relatively quick
we brought a report to you er last time in relation to trade union recognition in the er b sector giving up most of our erm employees have now gone to the independent colleges
we undertook to you sorry you authorised us to de recognise the three unions that were recognised in that field if the unions agreed i have to report that two of them have and the other one naturally discussions are still going on
we will report further as necessary
any comments
no is it agreed with a recommendation
agreed
agreed
thank you
paper i
agenda item ten
local government reorganisation
staff commission report
thank you chair
i'm not sure to what extent we in lincolnshire will have to take the local government staff commission seriously
i'm not at all sure that er UNK announcement will er make it any clearer but we will see
it is however right and proper that we do report to this sub committee on the activities of the staff commission and that i do in the paper before you
in paragraphs two onwards i give the names of the local governments staff commission erm what their statutory it is and can i just point out at the bottom of the page paragraph five please remember that the staff commission is advisory and it has in itself no mandatory powers
it may recommend to the government and the government makes its powers but in itself it cannot er make any mandatory arrangements
it can merely advise
paragraph six detailed what the secretary of state of the environment is asking the staff commission to advise him on and paragraph seven gives some details of a circular which the staff commission has already put out which for the moment at least really more applies to other authorities such as cleveland who are now or the isle of UNK who are now in to this particular situation
staff commission has issued a number of UNK or has issued a consultation paper and i detail that in paragraph eight and in our response to that basically we have said the nineteen seventy four arrangements for the staff commission seemed to have worked very well and we hope the staff commission will the new staff commission will stick very closely to that and only vary them when they've got a perfectly good reason for doing so
in paragraph nine i report that erm members of this council including the chair of this committee vice chair committee councillor met with this local government staff commission here in these offices
erm we have a very useful meeting
we direct our directed our input in our meeting on two erm UNK
firstly erm issues of principle and i i've outlined those in item nine one six and then UNK them with the lincolnshire situation special things that we thought applied in lincolnshire that they ought to be aware of
clearly for example how er employee prime card including for example the erm p s u arrangements that we have here which is perhaps not common to other parts of the country and so forth
and we made all these points clear to them we also very much drew their drew their attention to making sure that any rules or advice they gave did actually work out in an equal opportunity way
there's some danger that you can erm design rules without understanding what the effect of those would be on perhaps women employees of local authorities
we drew all those to their attention
some of it was clearly new to them and er they made the right responses
in addition i agree and i have now done so supplied them with further information about this county's employee profile and that's sir is where the matter now UNK
thank you anybody want to ask any questions on local contribution
not really
sorry
i was just commenting er you know we just want to work in the county of lincolnshire i presume
that's right
i mean there are two issues
the first is where is lincoln going lincolnshire going to left after the local erm government commission put their proposals forward and the government have a look at them and then secondly what our as we note from item eleven a UNK report will be brought to this sub committee when the local government staff commission or the secretary of state to give us definitive advice
so we're waiting on two UNK in a sense
anything else
just to comment on
councillor
er one thing i think we highlighted after the meeting with the they're sort of working awareness of the setup in lincolnshire if you look at the er structure of the er commission one from personnel chief executives they did seem to have er very little knowledge of a rural UNK county
and if you look at er in para six arrangements for staff transfers you couldn't find staff transferring en UNK
they didn't realise the implications of that in lincolnshire was UNK in a system operating out of lincoln
you know on er sort of long process over a number of years
if er there was the in lincolnshire try and transfer those you know en UNK it's just not on
and especially with the age group higher er and again not being UNK to anyone it is a lot the average age is much higher in some of these administrative posts
in other words people have settled into an environment where they live and to even attempt to get to talk and get themselves out
you six off to boston you six are go round to you know just stamp them you know lincoln
and anyway we did put them in the picture they left much more UNK than when they came
that i mean the er guy from er UNK was referring to his experiences in nineteen seventy four wasn't he urban area which is completely different to lincolnshire
and it worried me that these are the sort of people that would have been advised into the committee
if our officer had not sent them away with lots of facts and information
the fact that they do that
which i've now supplied
that's the whole
yes
only one significant point is that the county council's workforce that has more than twenty per cent of staff over fifty years of age which is quite unusual compared to other local authorities and it has quite serious implications for the pension fund
mm
in terms of paying out any UNK if people take early voluntary retirement or are made erm if a package is with at the time of government reorganisation
so that's quite a significant erm issue that we've brought to their attention
right
do we agree that the report should be noted
agreed
agreed
agreed
thank you
can then we then move to paper j local government superannuation scheme
there's two parts to it
the efficiency scrutiny and the compensation regulations and UNK going to deal with both of them
thank you
if i may i'll tackle the second one first and that is to say the proposed er alteration to the compensation regulations
i think it's wise for the local government superannuation scheme
erm we were consulted by the a c as it were between committees and had to respond on proposals for giving individual local authorities wider UNK in paying compensation to their employees erm the issue here actually UNK quite well in the digest that you already looked at paper c the relevant which at one of which was that the a c sought powers for local authorities to have a UNK a discretion to award up to an extra up to fifty two weeks pay in addition to existing statutory requirements
the proposals department of the environment are actually for sixty six weeks but including existing statutory requirements which can be as much as thirty weeks for the long serving employee
therefore we have supported the a c line on the basis of the flexibility that it would give you as an employer bearing in mind you don't have to do anything it will be your choice in the individual case er within your policies
we've as i say we've supported that
since then there's also been erm consultation as to whether that principle or rather those UNK should be implied UNK to your other UNK employee groups i e teachers and firemen
the consultation at present is on teachers and the department for UNK view is that those regulations should not be extended to teachers but the support of the director of education county fire officer and county treasurer we have erm suggested that any change to the local government superannuation scheme should be extended to those other groups because quite frankly you can't UNK different arrangements if you simple take the score
but if you like governments could do this for the non teaching staff and not do that for the teaching staff
so i hope that you will agree or confirm the action that we've taken in expressing those sorts of views
one more thing if i may we've just been told of the government's first response to the consultation arrangements sorry wrong item it's all right
stop
right
it's an answer it's on item two
fine
contributions on item two before we move on to item one
as logic demands right okay can we go then to item one
yes chair as some management will probably know erm the department for environment has had an efficiency scrutiny report on the local government superannuation scheme and the finance sub committee er agree county treasurer's proposals for comment on that as it were since the recommendations of the scrutiny report are set out there in paragraph one three of the report before
the three main headings and i'd like to concentrate on the de regulation and the flexibility points rather than administration of this
erm it was not possible to get your views in as it were personnel terms rather than financial terms on that er report but er as it were on your behalf we supported the treasurer's er recommendation for reasons set out in paragraph one four and if i can er explain that for you a little more de regulation could mean that each employing authority has it's own scheme of superannuation or not and if not would simply leave employees in a position of taking them off the state scheme s e r p s or going for a personal pension
clearly apart from the financial arguments in terms of employment policies if that is the case erm then employees who are present see their pay their total pay or reward package has included the benefits of the local government evaluation scheme will say well you take that away or you'd better start doing something about our pay arrangements in UNK
and that itself takes you into inevitably the cost side of that and clearly against that background there are potential industrial relations implications if those proposals go forward
i hope that on that basis first of all that you agree with the views that we expressed in UNK of your view and secondly erm that we really do need to look at through you these sort of aspects of pension management on behalf of the county council
don't want to interfere at all in the business of the administration of the scheme the investment side of it but there are clearly UNK areas in the superannuation regulations which effect significantly your pay employment and reward policies
hope you agree with that er chair all of the recognised unions were informed of the county council's approach in early decision and supported it entirely
sorry and it is this one that we just got an update on
erm and if i can just we will treasurer and ourselves be reporting to you in more detail on this in the appropriate areas but suffice it to say that the government are accepting the need for further investigation on some of these issues to look at some of them in the light of the national b u d report on superannuation and pension arrangements generally have nevertheless agreed that individual authorities ought to have some more discretion and the compensation regulations that i mentioned earlier is one example of that
thank you
i mean it does seem to appropriate to say that the both the personnel sub committee and investment sub committee are inter related committees with common agendas
quite simply personnel policies that we set can have major impacts on erm the funding of our superannuation scheme and i think that at some stage in the future it may be appropriate to think about a seminar for both of those committee members to look at both the good report and the department of environment scrutiny erm so
anybody want to make a contribution
councillor
yes just a point of definition really
i just wondered with the so called if staff members independent advice erm on what is best for them to do with superannuation pension scheme
normally we'd have
yeah normally we'd have roy here
but he's in hospital i believe at the moment
who wants to take
but the answer is that i'm not sure of officers but it's something like county treasurer one of the existing county UNK and the superannuation manager roy are registered as independent UNK
i think they may be UNK that and maybe bringing proposals back to you but that's the crunch
councillor
i totally agree that there is er i think probably a need for seminar you know it's an area it's er it's changing you know all the time
erm we all know the problems that some people have got into by opting out
yes
yes
and that er you know has lead to a lot of misery in some cases er also i mean there's question of viability of our own scheme and i er think er you know er there are a number of questions which i as a lay man would like to be you know i think the seminar is probably the right to do that
i would er if
it depends on timing because i'm not sure when government reports are coming out
anyone excuse me
right
do we agree the recommendations then
agree
thank you
right
a trip into europe
item twelve paper k european community recent development
thank you
the committee has asked from time to time that i keep it updated with er european legislation in so far as it affects UNK matters and this i've intended to do in paper k there are two appendix
appendices
appendix a reports a european councillor of directive ninety three stroke one oh four stroke e c which erm is being challenged or would like to be challenged by the u k including european court of justice erm and that will be heard in the timescale that these things take place
if it were to be erm
not UNK is it likely that the directive would affected from something like ninety late nineteen ninety six
paragraph four gives you this summary of the main provisions of this directive and there they are for your consideration or observation
appendix b is rather one earlier in the process where the european community have produced a green paper on european social policy which will have impact upon employment legislation later on in the process
this green paper is capable of being commented on by this sub committee through our normal channel would be the a c it doesn't contain a lot of detail it is a matter of principle and er hopes and aspirations
where we think and i mentioned this in the conclusion and indeed in the recommendation where we think as officers it rather falls short is that although it does mention in the text equal opportunities in all our er activities as we would understand it here
it fails to put forward any options for accept for erm equal rights for disability or race and we think this is an UNK and if it were your intention to write a response we would want to include that point in the response we make
thank you chris
can we look at appendix a first
the recommendation is simply that it be noted and i wondered if anybody wanted to make a contribution or ask any questions put anything forward on appendix a councillor
yes thank you chairman
i would i would hope that as erm as a committee we can support all these objectives er it does give me some cause for concern that our own government is UNK to these provisions
erm just to comment on for example maximum average erm UNK week forty eight hours
erm only the other day in the transportation department we were talking about drivers hours and er it's obvious implication there on road safety where the government are trying to relax the provisions for what's the european committee are trying to UNK them up
and er we see on the media very often the problems faced by doctors in hospitals working eighty hours
once again a proper UNK situation that we should be working to er relieve but doesn't seem to be the way that the government's moving
i hope we can support this one
thank you
councillor
er yes mr chairman
it night shift not to exceed eight hours
quite a number of people on of twelve
er how's it going to affect them they're quite happy to do it and er
there won't be a deregulation of course
hang on jim UNK i'll write your name down all right
right hang on right
carry on
you see people of priority that deliver employment mr chairman
whether they go on late at night or hair cut the next morning it's not it's not to the wall but er this would appear to cut right across the board
that they aren't going to be allowed to do that
which means some changing at night or doing a bit with the night or other one
right
how does that fit in to
right
that's part of presumably one of the objections from the u k government erm that essentially it's saying that these arguments can't be justified on health and safety grounds and that the approach de regulation and freedom in the market to al allow people to do what they want to do which is the fact that they if they want to work twelve hours then presumably the government and yourself are supporting that freedom
on the other hand one can argue that it's not about necessarily what individuals want to do it's about providing a framework that is good in health and safety terms
well this is what i'm getting at mr chairman mr chairman
er quite a few i know in security work they prepared to go on not later than eight o'clock at night
so they can stay on normally in some part of the year it is dark but yet there's other people around and about and they get in UNK before very late so the twelve and twelve suits them and it's better for health and safety and erm in other mr chairman
regulation tends is intending
is what they want to do
regulation is intended to protect everybody's interest
councillor erm
i'm glad you said that chairman i was i was just thinking erm cut out the but regarding on equal opportunities erm policies as we've been discussing already i would have thought housewives would have been delighted to have conservative hours rest presumably i just thought i was
the right contribution helps our meetings
councillor
er thank you chairman
well i give a vote that erm because certainly not everybody's aware that er this er service director is merely a way to get round to payments that different people have opt out of the social chapter
well what people forget is that if you put employers in a straight jacket the people who suffer first are the employees which as you appreciate will not take on the future
one of the reasons why er kenneth has a respectable UNK this country is because there is more flexibility over there to this country
advice is taking people off with in the knowledge that they will not necessarily er put themselves in a straight jacket
er we keep meaning look at certain things report a eight hour week including overtime have a record period of four months and then the filing industry take it away the work is seasonal
that's the of con of considerable concern and it will mean possibly that faith er farm workers who rely on overtime to increase it's wages will suffer as a result
so i do hope er that we that we do not support this er we've got to remember it's not europe is not the end all and be all of the world there is a there is a far east out there there's the UNK of the world the UNK
their employee costs are much lower than ours their social costs are much lower than ours and in and in the real world we have to compete with them and the boiling point will come from being competitive supplying goods and services at a cost that the other countries will not by putting themselves in straight jackets
thanks
councillor
oh yes i've come to er just ask the advice on the officers on the appendix a six er negotiations i e flexibility clauses for certain circumstances for certain mistakes
flexibility er in implementation and i think that is the necessary part of it
but what i think we do need to have is quite a we've not a no solution body who would agree with me er you know some of the things that have gone on within the er agricultural industry in terms of gang masters which is if surely if we had been more clearly defined if would enforce probably the whole industry into UNK and i feel that we do need a framework with a with a supply into europe because in the end we will not just be competing against other european countries we will be competing against the third world and some producers that are producing very different situations so i think er and i'm concerned that it is the it is that delegation and it is the interpretation that our own government will put on it because there's been so much UNK surrounding europe
i went to the er conference that we had at UNK which together with er john er my vice chairman er on europe the other week and there is so much UNK er that has been UNK by people who are half UNK towards europe or got a vested interest in no has not been committed to europe and they use this and in fact the classic example was that one of our own lincolnshire m p's claimed that he had saved UNK from the UNK of europe
absolute nonsense and he took an UNK for that when in fact it was never under any threat from european legislation it was our own british food act and that our own interpretation of european war that has brought the threat to us
so i think that there's i welcome you know the social chapter on that basis but it does clearly say and UNK er something that can only be UNK applied and if there are there is need there is need er there is scope for that with delegation through particular industries particular circumstances
thank you thank you
councillor and then councillor and then we can take the recommendation
first of all councillor comments erm you know there seems to be this er conservative UNK that is let's drive all our working conditions down to the level of the competition which means you know we would have a mining industry if we were prepared to put children in like that do in UNK
now i now i personal arguments has always been that we raise people's standards out there throughout the world
not bring people down to the worst conditions that we can find in the world to be competitive
this is it it's not the attitude that we need to be taking and there's no where else we'd be supporting in this er opposition to this particular european council of directive
it i mean it UNK me that we are the country in europe that that's always dragged kicking and screaming to the table to discuss things like this which are the benefit of the majority of the people in the in the european community
it's just those few committed UNK that see profits as the only the only motive to be on this earth that seem to be was they seem to have the influence in this in this country and like er i'm hoping that this er british government objection to the court of justice does fail as is er suggested it may do erm and let's hope it does and let's hope that we get this er implemented
thank you thank you
councillor
yes er thank you chair
i can't see anyone can disagree with the objection
oh you can i mean we've just heard some
yes well probably it's time for me to try and change his mind
er because er we do we want the rest of the world to follow us not for us to follow the rest of the world
and he mentioned about both competing with china and er the third world countries
very recently not so long ago i saw on programme on india in one of the sweat shops you saw young children boys and girls about twelve years old on their hands and knees making matches and a man walking down the centre with a stick
that was that's the reality of cheap UNK from the third world
now the er whilst we cannot expect them to adopt say our ideals because we are er you know we're probably more UNK in lots of ways but we can set a standard which they work towards and er he mentioned about the fact that people er the UNK coming down a lot with the jobs they're just part time jobs and they're very cheap paid jobs and very er bad conditions for a lot of people as far as health and safety goes
because we mustn't miss the point it does say it's er the government is UNK be on the grounds of health and safety
now this is leading towards that to make people work too long especially part time jobs come from one to another
they could be very tired we've seen er the consequences of that and er a lot of er these accidents happening on er with the coaches and one thing and another
because people have done one job during the day and then having to go on to another job at night and make no mistake that you know this is the sort of legislation that we need to protect us the public from what you know the consequences of somebody working
they're sensitive aren't they
right before we er kick off the lecture erm we'll have a lecture on wednesday right hopefully we'll finish the course then on wednesday we're running over a touch behind
will that be the last one
yes that will be the last one
we may finish today but i don't think so erm
now i was talking to your doctor who was wondering whether we might want to go out for a few UNK at some point
going home for christmas or possibly after the exams
both
so are you all going home fairly UNK
oh yeah tomorrow night
right in that case its probably a better idea if we go out after the exams if you want i mean don't you don't have to
yeah
right well in that case
erm we'll put a notice up or something erm around the exam period and let you know when we will go out and we'll try UNK a few UNK in after your exams but before the start of the second UNK so erm
we'll have to try figure out a time when you're all available
right
okay so on friday we were looking at erm a model of agricultural supply and response that incorporated erm a notion that farmers take some time er to react to changes in er in prices erm due to psychological UNK fixed factors and so on
and so forth
although hypothesis as a useful er sort of description of how farmers might erm adjust their supply it's a very simple one alright
if you recall we said that the desired level of output s r t simply function of last year's prices alright or more im or alternatively right you make erm the planting decisions on the basis right of current prices right so when that supply comes onto the market in say a years time it's now a crop right
that supply will be determined by not current market prices but prices of a year ago when you made the planting decisions right
now if you do recall your first year notes this is the relationship UNK a UNK model right that prices were based on erm or supply decisions were based on prices at planting right and we showed you that UNK model erm farmers make systematic errors right cos they never appreciate the cycle there is a cycle to prices right so they're making systematic errors right cos prices are high this year as a result erm of plant a lot so that when the supply comes on the market next year right prices are very low and you would thought farmers would er would learn but prices UNK right
so we may want to introduce a more sophisticated mechanism for determining what the desired level of supply is and what we'll do is that we'll say this is actually a special case of a much more general er more s sophisticated
right what we're going to do is to introduce the idea of expectations right cos what this UNK really saying right is that farmers expect price UNK in t minus one alright to UNK in s t right so that's what we're right in their ex their expectation of prices in t right are based on er current prices in sort of t minus one okay and that is what we would call erm expectations alright
but what we're going to do that's gonna be a special case in a more general UNK that we're going to look at now which is the UNK expectation hypothesis
right this basically it's too UNK right we know that farmers are more intelligent than the UNK model suggests that they are let's try erm increase the UNK of their supply response
but we'll do that using UNK expectations okay right
all the UNK expectations model says is that farmers supply right s t is some function of the expected price right erm
when the supply comes onto the market right so this thing here is the expectation of price in p t when the supply comes onto the market right and that expectation is formed at t minus one right so at the beginning of the year farmers make some forecast or some expectation of prices when the crop will come onto the market in t right and then they form that expectation or that prediction right at the beginning of the period or at the end of the last one t minus one
right
let's call that equation one seven er in actual fact what we'll do is that we'll put a random error term on the end as well just to say that this is rule is not perfect and there will be some UNK around it
okay now expect farmer's expectations of prices are assumed to be revised right each year farmers revise their own expectations of future prices so that makes some sense
you wouldn't expect them to forecast the same price all the years right
now expectations model implies that the revision in expectations right year on year alright is proportional right to the error last year right the difference between actual and UNK last year right if they were way out if their forecast was way out for last year right they'll revise their expectations for the next year okay
so UNK the expectation at t minus one prices at t minus the expectation of t minus two in prices at t minus one i e revision in expectations or how our expectations change from one year to a next is dependent upon gamma into the actual price t minus one minus farmer's expectations of it okay
so the revision of expectations year on year alright is some function alright UNK to the er the difference between their forecast for prices of p t minus one to track it from what actually occurred okay
now we can just rearrange that expression to get the expectation of prices for the period t right all we're doing is that we're adding p t minus two p t minus one to both sides alright and we'll get gamma into p t minus one erm plus open brackets mi minus gamma into expectation at t minus two of prices at t minus one okay
so we're just UNK the first expression okay and getting this one right so now we've got er a decision rule to obtain a farmers will form their expectation of prices say next year in t right on the basis of last year's price last year's actual price and last year's the expectation of last year's actual price okay
right so as you'll probably agree alright gamma scribble here right plays an important role in this model and gamma is the co efficient of expectations the expectations co efficient
now when gamma equals zero then what does this model imply UNK under different conditions alright
if gamma equals zero right what happens here
the expectation for next year's exactly the same as what we expected last year alright just turned UNK out okay
essentially there are no UNK no UNK in expectations if gamma equals zero right this right hand side top here completely UNK and if you wanted t just leave the error turning then any changes in expectations there's no systematic behaviour
but like i omitted that just for UNK right
so when gamma equals zero there's no revision to expectation
when gamma equals one what happens now
when gamma equals one this turn here drops out alright so expected price for next year exactly the same as the current price t minus one alright
right
scribble that and poverty is er that case is called naive expectations alright
where gamma equals one we have naive expectations so d'you think that what that implies in the top equation right the revision to expectations and gamma equals one is the whole of the difference between actual predicted last year okay
so here you have no revision under naive expectations we have four right now the closer that our expectations come to gamma lies to one the more weight farmers attach to last years price relative to prices in t minus two t minus three t minus four right
when gamma equals one all the weight is given to last year's price all the weight is given to last year's price okay right so past history all past history is ignored apart from the price at t minus one right and the closer that gamma is our expectations co efficient closer gamma is to one the more weight be attached to last year's price relative to the previous history of prices okay right
if we play about with this expectations model right this is the erm this describes the expectation of prices in t it can also use the same as a decision rule alright to find out what prices would expectation of prices were right in p t minus one okay t minus one right here
what we now want in t minus one was cos that was the actual price what we don't know what was the expectation of prices in t minus one
well we can use the same decision rule and just change the UNK by one so you've got gamma into p t minus two right plus one minus gamma the expectation of t minus three prices t minus two okay and we could substitute right the right hand side here right into the UNK into that expectation up there
we then have to er determine the expected value of t minus three and the price of t minus two and we then use the same rule substitute it in there right we could repeat repeatedly substitute into the expected value right in that manner like we did in the er the UNK between UNK expectations and partial adjustment type offices
but we just repeat repeatedly substitute into this UNK term right
i mean we come out with erm an equation that look like so expected price and t is a function right it's the sum of gamma into one minus gamma into j into p t minus one minus j and j goes to infinity
but we just repeatedly substitute back er for that UNK expectation right
so again we find out that erm the expected price in t minus one sorry in t is a function of all previous prices all previous prices okay and it won't surprise you to find out that the weight giving to treating the historical prices right becomes UNK in exactly the same way as the UNK as the partial adjustment er co efficient or the partial adjustment model implied alright
so the way it's given erm t to previous prices decline UNK right
trouble is you've got a bit of a problem at the moment right if we want to find out what the expected price in t is right this UNK tells us that it's a UNK sum of all previous prices right
we won't be able to estimate that model right simply because we don't have all the previous prices alright
we cannot use this expression up here either because we've got an UNK variable in there we've got the expectation of which we don't know alright we don't know what that is what number that is through time so the analysis could reach an UNK here right this nice little theory nice hypothesis about how people form expectations but it it's not UNK it's UNK right we can't use it
however we can apply something that will trick known as the UNK transformation right that will enable us right to convert what is an infinite stream of previous prices into something that we can estimate right just has a very few number of parameters right
now right those parameters that we that we will learn will get this model in the end which contains only UNK variables only those so it will contain prices actual prices and actual supply alright
there's no ex expectations in there no UNK
now what i was gonna do now was go through this UNK transformation right you're not gonna be asked t to produce it in an exam or anything like that but the reason why i'm doing it now is that you will need it for your er your q m exam not er your exam your project right cos there is a similar UNK it's quite a commonly used tool you'll find er where wherever we have a erm an expression with an infinite number of erm possibilities or an in infinite number of arguments
so you can go to sleep if you want for the next minute to erm but because you will need to know this UNK transformation for your q m project you do want may just want to note it down
so this is a UNK just gonna UNK through it very quickly we don't really need to er spend much time on it
let's think of the general model right
y t alright is a of constant alpha plus beta into erm x t plus lander x t y is one that's lander squared x t minus two plus lander cubed x t minus three and so on and so on into infinity
alright so let's call that equation er a okay
right similarly at time t minus one we have y t minus one equals alpha plus beta x t minus one plus lander plus lander x t minus two plus lander squared x t minus three plus x t minus four infinity again we call that b and that's just the same equation but we just erm shifted the UNK and right this explains why in t this ex explains why in t minus one right all the UNK have just been just been changed
right well if we multiply both sides we multiply both sides of b right by this co efficient lander alright we get right lander by t minus one lander erm right then what we do is that we get beta into lander x t minus one plus lander squared x t minus two lander cubed x t minus three and lander to four x t minus four and so on and so s so on until infinity right
no notice right with these are exactly the same as those now alright so what we're going to do is we're going to subtract right if we subtract from a subtract b from a all those terms that run off into infinity we're gonna drop out okay
alright so if we tr subtract b from a everything drops out apart from the following so you have y t minus lander y t minus one plus b minus a right equals alpha into y minus lander plus beta x t okay
if you just rearrange that in terms of y t we get so we just add y t minus one to both sides and so we get y t into alpha into one minus plus beta x t plus lander y t minus one right that's it
okay
so you too would assume UNK transformation we've got a UNK progression in here that goes off to infinity alright which is equivalent to that little thing alright we've got three parameters here this one that one and that one alright so we converted what is an infinite stream into a UNK stream using this er UNK transformation
right so that's the UNK over and done with it's pretty fascinating stuff okay you'll need that in the in erm in your q m project if you have to apply one to a particular problem
anyway so applying the UNK transformation back to er supply response we apply this UNK transformation to equation seven alright
we get the following supply response model right apply that UNK transformation to seven yields s t equals alpha gamma plus beta gamma p t minus one plus open brackets one minus gamma close brackets beta s t minus one alright plus u t minus open brackets one minus gamma u t minus one okay
right so this is if we incorporate expectations in our model of supply response alright so instead of saying that the desired level of supply instead of saying that we say it's actually this right if we actually incorporate expectations specifically alright then we get a supply response model alright like this and our hypothesis y'know cos we don't know how expectations are formed right economics can't tell us anything about how expectations are formed are they rational are they naive are they UNK who knows nobody knows alright
but nevertheless it seems like a reasonable hypothesis the that er expectations about future prices are revised in proportion er the errors in expectations in the previous period alright
if we incorporate that hypothesis we get a supply response model of that form right notice that we've only got UNK variables s t p t minus one s t minus one we've only got UNK variables in there alright
so we can estimate this model although we've got a couple of problems that we'll come to later on but nevertheless it's essentially UNK
now the reason why we've gone through all these horrible equations right and looked at the UNK expectations model and the partial adjustment model is because both of these two things are incorporated into single res erm a single supply response model that was developed by UNK in nineteen fifty eight old model but very popular right
this UNK supply response model that UNK both UNK expectations and the partial adjustment hypothesis alright has been applied so that five hundred right different commodities throughout the world right
so it's the most widely used supply response model in the entire universe alright and as a result of it's UNK you have to learn it as well
right as you can imagine things might get a little bit nasty we're incorporating two er two hypothesis and although very simple produce algebra that er that's a bit nasty
but never mind never mind
now this UNK supply response model alright was introduced by mark UNK in nineteen fifty eight right in a heart breaking book called the dynamics right of supply right erm UNK of farmers response to price okay
john UNK university press i think there's a copy in the library erm you may want to have a little look at it but so what we're going do is we incorporate both these two hypothesis into a model supply response okay
we'll er do these just crack handle and then we'll show what information we can obtain alright from this model and there's an example on a sheet of paper just to er run it home right
okay
let's start from the top let's suppose that the desired level of output right in any period s star t right is simply a function of the expected value of the price so we're using our par our well that's just a general a general statement right
decide supply you UNK beta of expected prices right in t supply in t is based on the expectation of what the price will be in t right
how are expectations UNK right it says nothing about how expectations are UNK just says that private supply will be dependent upon expected prices alright
well let's assume deducted expectations model is a reasonable model of expectations formation right call that equation number one right so our UNK expectations model is e t minus one so that's e t right minus e t minus two into p t minus one right so that equals gamma into p t minus one minus e t minus two p t minus one right so that's the same expression as we had before right that's the our ad our UNK expectations model that's how we're assuming that expectations are generated right or revised right so we're incorporating expectations into this model but we also want to incorporate the fact that farmers take some time to respond to changes in price alright
adjustment is not complete it's partial alright so we're going to say that supply UNK in the following manner right according to the partial adjustment hypothesis alright so changes in actual supply alright will be delta of the difference between the desired level of output for t right and the actual level of input t minus one alright plus er alright so that was just our partial adjustment model that we looked at last week right we'll call that equation three okay right
what we're going to do now is combine both of these UNK right into our supply response model alright and we come out with the following
now it may look a little nasty but don't worry it UNK very easily
so we combine those two UNK right we get s t equals alpha delta gamma plus open brackets open the second set of brackets one minus delta close brackets open brackets one minus gamma close brackets into s t minus one minus open brackets one minus delta one minus gamma into s t minus two right plus beta delta gamma into p t minus one plus e t minus open brackets one minus gamma times e t minus one right
u t was just that random error term that we looked at
right
now looks pretty horrendous alright but if we bum data on s t s t minus one s t minus two and p t minus one all actual variables if we bung those into the UNK and ask them to form the regression it would do right it would just you'd get s t equals a plus b that's t minus one plus c a t minus two plus d a t minus one alright and b t so before we we'll call that equation four right so although it looks nasty alright it's fairly straightforward it's all we're doing is we'd be asking the computer to UNK s t on constant like how you would yourself t minus one to like values t minus two and like prices okay
right
so it would actually be very straightforward to do this although not a couple of problems in this model that we ought to just say something about alright the specification of four does present a couple of problems right
the first thing and these are statistical problems that we won't spend too much time on them but just make sure they are our error term in this equation right is no longer a random error term it's dependent on it's value in the previous period right cos b t actually represents u t minus UNK of e t minus one right
so first problem is one of serial correlation in this model right if we estimated this model and things were as we thought they were this UNK these UNK were working and farmers were behaving erm as we thought they might do right this model will automatically use serial correlation right
so if you didn't get serial correlation and you estimated a model like this you'd be a bit curious and wonder why right
secondly we've got erm model we've got a dependent variable a dependent variable right s t minus one right will be correlated with the error term right so the dependent variable will be correlated with the errors alright
because s t minus one right will be contained in the information up here
right
now because of these two problems we UNK er a couple of assumptions of ordinary lease squares right and as a result the UNK of this is that we get biased estimates of our parameters a b c and d right they will be biased and also they won't have the minimum UNK property right they won't be the best UNK you the statistics you talk about blue estimates best linear and biased alright
so if for any one of those parameters let's just say b right let's just say that's the true distribution of the parameter b what you'll you estimate o l s and you'll get alright you'll get biased estimates this is what you would get from the computer alright so we'd be biased cos the true value is over here but not only that is that instead of having a nice peak distribution would be quite flat alright we'd we wouldn't have the minimum UNK property alright
so that there is a measure of the bias and the flat distribution is a measure of er erm the fact that we don't have an UNK that's got this minimum UNK property right
so effectively what would happen all our t ratios right would be very small cos the standard area would be very large but don't worry too much about these UNK problems what i want you to do is to appreciate that UNK a supply response model right can cause problems unless we do something about it
right i think we'll leave it there for today we'll finish off er this tomorrow
no
er just to appreciate erm what it comprises yes so UNK expectations what does that imply partial adjustment what does that imply
what can we get out of it and we'll do that tomorrow we'll derive y'know estimates of expectations co UNK and elasticities and it's those sorts of things that you might be asked to in an exam but you won't need to derive anything in your exams
erm i haven't probably better to see
is he in there now
he should be there now yes he should
right so i'll see you all on er on wednesday
the item or the issue for discussion this afternoon is there a need for an a fifty nine a sixty one harrogate relief road
er and i have to remind you that the panel has to be concerned primarily with the need
erm but we'll see how you go in presenting your cases
but i don't really want you to stray into detail which is not necessarily within our remit to er to consider
i propose that mr will make the opening statement and then i'll turn to mr and then mr are you speaking on behalf of the residents' association
thank you
er and then if you will come in after mr
i might say that the members of the panel have actually read all your submissions so don't feel obliged to go through them word for word in the same way as for example you might be presenting a proof at a planning enquiry
i want really if you would to point up the major issues the major points as you see them
mr sorry mr
right er thank you sir
perhaps if i start by saying that er i have er produced a one page summary which wasn't with my er initial statements which i passed to mr and to mr but if i could er pass copies of that to yourself and to the panel
wh whilst that's being done can i just add that don't feel inhibited ab i want you to make your best case but i mean you know if you can make it in five minutes instead of half an hour then nothing will be lost in that
and the other thing is that once we actually get into the discussion session if you want to ask a question or make a point then if you just put your name board up on end then i c i'll see whether you want you know who wants to speak
and would you also please make sure you give your name at the time you speak and who you represent because the matter is being recorded and we want to make sure we know who has said what at what time
mr
right thank you
perhaps sir if i just refer to er it's about a page if read out the er the summary of my statement
since the decision of the county council in march nineteen eighty one to promote a harrogate and knaresborough southern bypass the council have investigated ways of improving the flow of traffic through the two communities
initially the council investigated traffic management measures to UNK the southern bypass
er improvement schemes and measures were identified and have been implemented over a period of time
there are still others yet to complete
the council however concluded that the scope for improving traffic flows in the two communities even with a southern bypass was limited
and the solution lay in the provision of further relief roads
route options for relief roads to the west of harrogate and to the north of harrogate and knaresborough were assessed
public consultation on the need for a sixty one and a fifty nine relief roads and on specific routes has been undertaken
these showed substantial public support for the need for the relief roads and the preferred routes which have subsequently been selected
the a fifty nine and a sixty one both for part of the primary network which is a national network designated by the department of transport for the movement of long distance traffic including the movement of heavy commercial vehicles
in recognition of the problems caused as a result of these routes passing through the urban areas of harrogate and knaresborough the county council has designated both roads as key routes for improvement in both the structure plan and the t p which is the transport policy and programs document of the county council
traffic flows on both routes are in excess of twenty thousand vehicles a day giving rise to severe problems of congestion at peak times a high degree of UNK of both communities and major road safety problems
the northern relief road would reduce traffic flows by between twenty and thirty percent on the a fifty nine through harrogate and knaresborough
the western relief road would reduce traffic flows on the a sixty one by thirty percent to the north and south of the town centre
measures to increase further the transfer of traffic to the relief roads will be investigated as scheme design UNK
there will be substantial road safety benefits as a result of the transfer of traffic to the relief roads with anticipated savings of twenty nine injury accidents per a per annum on the a fifty nine and seventeen per annum on the a sixty one
the relief roads both offer substantial savings in journey times and together with the road safety benefits represent and excellent rate of return as measured by the department of UNK economic assessment program
it is accepted that there will be environmental costs as a result of the construction of the relief roads and these have been the subject of extensive investigations
these costs have been weighed against the environmental traffic road safety and economic benefits of the scheme using the department of UNK manual of environmental appraisal for public consultation
based on these assessments the proposals have the support of not only the county council and the borough council but also the general public
both relief roads have been included as a firm commitment in the county council's forward capital program with a planned start of construction for the northern relief road and killinghall bypass in nineteen ninety eight
and the western relief road in the year two thousand
the individual schemes will need to be taken through the statutory planning process which will give the opportunity for further debate on the details of the route construction standards and UNK measures
thank you mr
mr
thank you sir
er i'd like to make two statements if i may it's easier for me
the first one on behalf of parish council and then the second one on behalf of residents' association
first of all for parish council
taken in conjunction the written statement and the key diagram indicate an intention to construct an a fifty nine relief road passing to the north of harrogate and knaresborough
the parish council refer to this as an outer northern relief road
the specific route being investigated by the county council is a modification of the blue route put forward in a consultation exercise at the beginning of nineteen seventy nine
the parish council do not consider that there is any alternative outer northern route which would produce a significantly better balance of costs and benefits
taking the blue route as an example an outer northern route would achieve limited traffic benefits on the a fifty nine and a six one
the figures produced by the county surveyor in a september nineteen ninety one committee report show anticipated traffic changes at six points on these roads as they pass through harrogate and knaresborough
these are reductions of seventeen percent nineteen percent twenty eight percent twenty three percent ten percent and thirteen percent
reductions of this scale are unlikely to bring significant environmental benefit
the county council's own environmental consultants reported that outer northern routes passed through a mixture of urban fringe landscape north of harrogate and some of the highest quality countryside around the two towns along the UNK
the impact of the routes on the wider landscape is UNK as for western routes by varying UNK many distant views
there would appear to by no UNK way of crossing the river UNK
o m two subsequently to become the blue route offers a less damaging solution than o m one which would cut through the heart of the UNK creating a major environmental conflict
as with the western routes few properties would be directly affected by routes
UNK would be a more general UNK of landscape quality over a wide area
the parish council are broadly in agreement with the consultants findings the parish council do not consider that the calculated economic benefit of an outer northern route UNK the net environmental harm
it is recognized that the construction of an outer northern route was favoured by the UNK to an nineteen ninety one consultation exercise
however such an exercise should not UNK the main planning issues
in addition the leaflet on which the public response was based did not adequately highlight the difference in effectiveness between an outer northern route and the other routes on which views were sought
at an early stage the county council rejected all the inner northern routes despite the recommendation of the county surveyor and the county planning officer i have at this point said that the harrogate borough council erm h had also recommended that the inner northern routes be retained for investigation
i said that in my summary
erm i now accept that was a UNK of harrogate district council's resolution which was rather more ambiguous than i have represented it here
an inner northern route would have been about twice as successful in UNK traffic on existing roads and would have produced fifty five percent more economic benefits
the county council's environmental consultants had said of the inner northern routes rather than damaging an UNK sensitive landscape as could happen with the other routes the inner northern route could be seen as a means of improving the landscape
in the light of the advice from their own officers and consultants the council decision to reject all inner northern routes throws doubt on the decision making process which led them to support an outer northern route
there has been no technical report which attempts to weigh the economic and environmental costs and benefits of the various options and certainly no technical report which concluded by recommending in favour of an outer northern route
the parish council consider that it would be unsafe and UNK to afford an outer northern route the degree of commitment which would be implied by its inclusion in the structure plan
accordingly the parish council requests the panel to recommend that policy t seven and the key diagram be amended to exclude the provision of an a fifty nine relief road to the north of knaresborough
i'll now go on with my statement for panel residents
yes please
thank you
taken in conjunction with the written statement and key diagram UNK taken in conjunction the re the written statement and key diagram indicate an intention to construct an a sixty one relief road to the west of harrogate
the county council have investigated several routes to the west of harrogate
according to the county council's published figures the most successful of these would only succeed in UNK reducing traffic flows on the a sixty one by thirty one percent
a reduction of this scale would be likely to achieve only slight environmental relief
the scale of relief that would actually be achieved by a western route is UNK on a number of grounds
if these doubts are justified the UNK scale of relief may be even less than the slight relief implied by the county council's projection
the county council's environmental consultants reported that western routes pass through some of the most attractive countryside around harrogate
the UNK and valley nature of the UNK to the west of harrogate would make all routes difficult to integrate visually
all the routes would therefore be prominent in the landscape creating a lesser or greater degree of visual UNK across a wide area
in time with large scale UNK and excess extensive planting routes could be integrated to a certain extent but where UNK are crossed at right angles by bridges or UNK the visual result will always be UNK to the landscape
it is the UNK and valley nature of the UNK around harrogate that the draft local plan considers so important to maintain because of its contribution to the special landscape character of harrogate
the residents' association are broadly in agreement with these findings however they consider that the western routes have other environmental disadvantages which are detailed in my full statement and its appendices
the residents' association do not consider that the calculated economic benefit of a western relief road UNK the net environmental harm
it is recognized that the construction of a western relief road was favoured by the UNK to a nineteen ninety one consultation exercise
however such an exercise should not UNK the main planning issues
the consultation leaflet was UNK in a way er which moved the response towards support for the proposed relief roads
UNK it is unlikely that UNK would have either the time or experience to make a thorough appraisal of the information presented in the leaflet
in particular most people will be UNK to the assessing the impact of percentage changes in traffic on existing roads or of weighing them against the environmental costs of the new road
er i would also point out that erm even though there was a respectable response to the public consultation exercise i think the number of UNK in total only represented something like seventeen percent of the number of households in the harrogate and knaresborough area
when the county planning committee considered the western relief road on the third of march nineteen ninety two they resolved that a western relief road for harrogate was environmentally unacceptable that the harrogate and knaresborough southern bypass used in conjunction with the proposed a one motorway should be seen as the preferred route for north bound traffic UNK to the south of harrogate and that the ultimate selection and implementation of a relief road for harrogate and knaresborough should be part of a package of measures for solving the problem of urban congestion and improving the quality of the urban environment
the committee's subsequent decision to include policy t seven in the structure plan appears to have been taken without debate and without formal recognition that it's inclusion UNK with their earlier er decision
er the residents' association erm feel that this examination in public is not the right forum to erm answer a question which has never properly been asked erm at the county council
erm and they do not consider that the full testing and evaluation erm o of the environmental harm as against the claimed highway benefit has properly taken place
the association er also consider that it would be unsafe and UNK to afford er a relief road a western relief road the degree of commitment which would be implied by its inclusion in the structure plan
according they request the panel to recommend that policy t seven and the key diagram be amended to exclude the provision of an a sixty one relief road to the west of harrogate
thank you
thank you mr
mr
i'll be as brief as i can because some of the ground i'll be covering will be the same as mr 's
erm first of all the one we would er make is the question of the need for it as a bypass or as a through traffic route
the southern bypass and the a fifty nine link to the a one already supply that as recommended in fact by the county planning committee to the highways and transport committee in may ninety two
and we've brought additional evidence to support that today
not UNK that even if we have a subsequent northern relief road there would be a second choice for them to use the a sixty one continuing to ripon
it would also be our contention that there should not be an attempt to direct traffic er in a UNK direction onto the a sixty one itself beyond killinghall because it is a particularly UNK road with considerable bends on and i would be inclined to think it was far safer to direct them to the a one via the a fifty nine and southern bypass
and make them journey from killinghall towards ripon
the n y c in their assessment do not we believe have taken into account the severe environmental damage which any western relief road would impose on the landscape
and i hope we can come into that
on the question of the figures we have some doubts of the assessments made which were done prior of course to the actual opening of the southern bypass and therefore what would happen when it did happen
er thirdly we believe that if in fact this western relief opens there will be considerably more pressure on some of the existing roads which are not designed to take it particularly the b six one six two
which would in fact join this er western relief road and which is already heavily UNK it's the main part of one of our presentations to you
or the environmental damage
there does not appear to have been an account taken of the of the factors that may reduce traffic on the a sixty one er and ways of UNK the current problems on the road which are not just a question of the volumes but in fact the timescale it takes in fact to clear that road in the mornings
and we're really primarily talking of the morning problems or the e the evening problems
and as far as we know there's no been no account been taken that er the subsequent development that is likely to take place on any of these roads which is clearly implied in some of that statements of the UNK traffic that would generate in itself
and there appears to be no evidence of er these figures in their in their presentation
er that concludes ours at this moment mr
thank you mr
mr do you want to say anything at this stage
yes just er just a few brief words chairman
david harrogate borough council
erm i think if i could start by explaining the borough council's position on this matter and that's that the borough council is committed to the concept of an UNK road system around harrogate and knaresborough and that should be as part of a balanced transportation package for the area
notwithstanding that position the council clearly had a number of reservations about the design UNK and environmental impact of a western relief road and we've asked the county council to pursue its proposals for a western relief road on the basis of a single carriageway all purpose road and to give further consideration to ways in which environmental concerns can be UNK
we feel that er the a fifty nine a sixty one harrogate relief road schemes are properly included in the structure plan alteration as they do accord with the advice contained in p UNK twelve and draft p g thirteen
and the borough council considers that the need for the new roads has been fully justified as set out in the county council's assessment
the borough council's case on the needs issue can be summarized by erm the following points
firstly erm there is significant traffic and environmental problems er being experienced along the a fifty nine and the a sixty one routes in harrogate and knaresborough
these high volumes of traffic pass through UNK built up areas often of high environmental quality and this results in congestion delay and road safety problems
importantly they also UNK affect levels of amenity in both residential and commercial areas
the scope of tackling these problems along the existing routes is extremely limited due to physical and environmental constraints
particularly the existence of conservation areas listed buildings and the UNK of the stray act
and the borough council as agents for the county council has done what they can to offset problems and the scope for further measures is limited
we feel that the prospect is for UNK conditions particularly in view of the level of traffic growth predicted
the real solution therefore is to UNK construct an UNK relief road system so as to reduce traffic flows in the towns and to provide scope for implementation of a balanced package of transportation measures within the urban area
and finally erm i'd like to emphasize that the case for relief roads in and around harrogate and knaresborough is not development led
nor is it the case that large scale development will inevitably follow erm construction of those roads
simply that erm the new roads will remove the constraint of erm access poor access from sites which may otherwise be suitable for development in planning terms
thank you chairman
thank you
mr just a just a general point
er in your UNK statement you talk about the a fifty nine as being the only major trans UNK route to north yorkshire
i think to a certain extent that might be literally true but the northern part of the county you've got UNK into the a sixty six haven't you UNK corner and to the west and you've also got UNK here into the UNK valley and up through to UNK again and further south you can link into the m sixty two can't you as trans UNK
how do you see the a fifty nine UNK as a strategic erm east west route across the county
for example linking york harrogate and beyond
well in terms of er in terms of that particular corridor clearly that is the major er route across the county between york across to scarborough on the east coast york harrogate and across to lancashire
er clearly there are other routes further south but er in terms of traffic er going to and from east west axis in north yorkshire that is the er major route
erm the emphasis really on that has been highlighted in the department of UNK own recent consultation document earlier this year where they looked at er trans UNK routes right from derbyshire up to the er the a sixty six er looking at ways to relieve the pressure on the m sixty two where traffic flows have been in have increased dramatically over the last few years
there are already proposals er to widen sections of the m sixty two to four lanes
er the department's consultants identified that wouldn't be sufficient to cope with traffic flows on the m sixty two er and indeed suggested as an option er that traffic a new a new route could be created er along from the m sixty five at the a fifty six and a fifty nine to UNK er and then pointed a red arrow in the direction of the a fifty nine across to the a one
and further discussions of with them have er has b it's clear that is er or the proposal improvement of the a fifty nine
now the county council is concerned about that in terms of a major improvement of the a fifty nine er from an environmental point of view particularly through the national park
yeah
so the a fifty nine well let me put it let me put another question does the a sixty one serve a similar function to the a fifty nine
if by definition of what you've said the a fifty nine is a major cross county link does the a sixty one serve the same function
well clearly it serves a different function from the from the a fifty nine erm in terms of er its role then er it is a different role i would accept that in that there are other parallel routes er more closely at hand clearly the a one which is to be improved to motorway standard
er so it is a different role than the a fifty nine it is a different er competing routes if you like but nevertheless it's still a key er l strategic link in the county council's or in the north UNK highway network and has been identified as such both in the structure plan er and also in er the transport policies and program document which is reviewed annually by the county council
er it is it has got problems as has already been referred to earlier in that it has a very poor accident record as well as well as passing through harrogate it has a poor accident record to the north of harrogate
er we would like to see that improved indeed part of the proposals for er these schemes before us today we have taken the opportunity for killinghall of extending that original close in bypass to bypass sections indeed some of the poorest sections of the a sixty one to the north of killinghall where we have a very bad accident record those will be UNK by the continuation of this scheme north of killinghall
er we're just recently started the construction of the ripon bypass which is the other er problem on the a sixty one on in north yorkshire
so completion of this scheme the western relief road would complete er the improvements together with improvements between killinghall and er and ripon w would improve complete the UNK of the a sixty one as a key strategic in the county's network
yes
to UNK the a one
can for the purpose of continuing the discussion can we concentrate i think on the a fifty nine UNK otherwise we shall get slightly cross UNK here
can we concentrate on the a fifty nine
can i ask if everyone sitting around the table has now or has had access to plan policy guidance note number twelve
yes
a copy is coming at the relevant bit er for those who don't have it
i should say that the markings on the copy you're receiving are mine they were not made in the context of this discussion
the reason i draw attention to this guidance is that it draws what i think is a crucial distinction for our purposes here today between the need to assess at the structure plan level the need for a road proposal and in paragraph five thirty one a clear statement there that consideration of environmental impacts in relation to where the road goes is a matter for the local plan
that said i appreciate the force of the points mr has been making
can i ask mr leaving aside the question of where it is do you accept that there is a need for an improvement of the a fifty nine
yes
i'm sorry i have to ask you to say who you are before you speak
oh sorry
otherwise our records will get a bit confused
george
the answer to your question is yes i do accept that there is a need for an improvement to a fifty nine
do you think that improvement could be made along the line of the existing road
no
thank you
may i UNK on my answer
er
don't feel constrained to yes or no
right
this is your this is your big chance
i think that er what has been known as an inner northern bypass that is a road which passes between harrogate and knaresborough could act as a very effective relief road for the a fifty nine
i believe it would meet the need which mr has quite properly identified
the reason that UNK parish council are opposed to a road of the type shown in the key diagram is that they do not consider and i do not consider that a road in that position going to the north of knaresborough could effectively meet that need to relieve the a fifty nine
could i ask you why not
certainly
because there are two elements which make the a fifty nine through harrogate and knaresborough such a busy road one is local traffic either having a destination in harrogate or knaresborough or going between various parts of harrogate and knaresborough
that's one component
the other component is genuinely UNK traffic which has both its origin and destination outside the harrogate and knaresborough area
now that genuinely UNK traffic is a minority of the total traffic on the a fifty nine system
if you build a relief road which is fairly tightly in to the built up area that relief road will cater for both the long distance UNK traffic and the local traffic
this was shown in the county council's own UNK in nineteen ninety and nineteen ninety one which showed that an inner northern bypass would be very successful
er in UNK er existing congestion on the a fifty nine
if one built a road a lot further out which is the case with the road shown in the structure plan key diagram use of that road would represent a major diversion for local traffic which would therefore be much less likely to use it
and again this isn't my opinion it is something that is demonstrated by the traffic predictions which have been produced by the county council
they show that er an outer northern route through harrogate itself on most UNK of road would take less than twenty percent of traffic from the existing road
it is true that on other parts of the a fifty nine system particularly through knaresborough er the new road the outer northern bypass could take closer to thirty percent off the existing a fifty nine but the traffic flows on that part of the a fifty nine are very much lower so there is much less need much less environmental need for a bypass there er a relief road i should say there in the first place
so in summary i m in my view the reason why an outer northern bypass is much less successful in UNK the a fifty nine is that it would be UNK to the local traffic
you mean local traffic that wishes to get into the centre of harrogate or into knaresborough
local traffic i use the term local traffic to mean traffic that's coming outside from outside harrogate and knaresborough and having a destination anywhere in harrogate and knaresborough traffic which has an origin in harrogate and knaresborough and is going to a destination outside or traffic which has an origin and destination within harrogate and knaresborough
i call all that sort of traffic local traffic and i think that the outer northern route is less well equipped to deal with those kinds of traffic
thank you mr
mr can i come back to you and in light of what mr has said
mm
your a fifty nine relief road proposal UNK two functions doesn't it
one is to try and pick up UNK traffic and take it away from harrogate and knaresborough
traffic which is
yes that's correct
essentially going east west or west east
it has no has no business in
has no business in the urban area
and you also see the other function of the relief road as a means of distributing local traffic er around the fringe of harrogate er and trying to push it onto other UNK to get into the town centre
as part of
in other words distribute that traffic around the network
now that element of traffic as i read your figures is quite a considerable proportion of the well you're talking about roughly twenty thousand p c us a day
well talked about in excess of twenty thousand vehicles a day on each of the two roads
yes vehicles
in excess of twenty thousand yes
are you talking about vehicles or p c
yes we tend not to use p c us as much as well a few years ago
well that just shows you
what is a vehicle then
anyway doesn't matter
we're talking about in excess of twenty thousand vehicles so you've still got erm a considerable proportion somewhere of the order of at least two thirds which
it depends which relief road we're talking about but i think i would accept i mean i can accept the point that er mr is making about er the relative er benefits in terms of traffic relief afforded by either an inner northern route or an outer northern route
and he's quite correct in pointing those out and i wouldn't disagree with him on that score
erm we and that's one reason why we've brought along the plan which shows the different UNK traffic effects
er of the on the northern route and on indeed the western route
erm it is quite clear from that because the inner routes er are much closer in er to the urban area they do pick up more of the local movements between harrogate and knaresborough er than does the outer route
yeah
erm you know having said that clearly is one factor it's an important factor in assessing the schemes but it is one factor and a number of other things such as the impact clearly of the routes themselves
and the public response to those routes
er now i would expect i don't know whether it's worth talking about the general principle that we're talking about different routes here and as i understand the purpose today was to talk about the need for relief roads and i would expect at some future date at a public enquiry when er i'm defending er the outer blue er the outer northern route to defend why that was chosen as opposed to an inner northern route and not rely upon the key diagram in the structure plan and the stars that are shown on there
er to be the to be the route
no
i'm try i'm i i'm trying to stay with need and purpose
right
right
but you have defined the route in a particular way on the key diagram when there was an alternative way of defining it
and i think in the context of what p g twelve says it is right for this examination to consider the proposal as you have presented it to us
and the need for that as opposed to the alternative
in that context how does an outer northern relief road impact differently in terms of traffic relief on knaresborough as opposed to an inner northern relief road
erm well the detailed figures are shown on the diagram there
i haven't presented those in my in my statements
sorry read those
no right well we'll have to go up and have a look at them
i mean if in terms of the statement in the structure plan it is simply the policy doesn't relate to an outer northern relief road
erm it's only
the reason it's on the diagram it simply reflects the fact in fact w we were UNK almost by events in terms of the structure plan policy in that the county council had move on to t had undertaken public consultation and it had determined a preferred route
er and it was felt appropriate at the time that should be indicated on the t the key diagram to be to be helpful more than nothing else
we have on most of our bypass schemes in fact a all the other bypass schemes shown on the key diagram simply show them by a star on the diagram
in fact the ripon bypass is actually shown on the other s on the on the other side of ripon the bypass is actually er located
so i don't think the stars on the diagram itself are as i see it are particularly important
i mean if it is helpful and mr and i did have this discussion in the pre meeting that we had er certainly if you wish to recommend that the d that the stars on the diagram were to be changed er just simply to show one star instead of a route then i for one would be quite happy with that
if that satisfied mr
it's simply the reason it was done that way was to reflect a county council decision which had been taken fairly recent times on the route of an outer as opposed to an inner
but there's a lot if we were going to talk about the m relative merits of the inner and outer today i think er there's quite a lot in addition to the er the traffic effects within knaresborough which we would have to go into er because i mean in fact we've and that is why i didn't include in certainly in my statement er any defence er in any great detail of choosing an outer route as opposed to an inner route
i'm quite happy to go into that we have all the information here we can do it but it would take some time i suspect
i think we have two alternatives
either we pursue the need for the blue route as opposed to any other route to the north of harrogate or the county council puts on record i e in a letter to the panel that it proposes to amend the key diagram
if it proposes to amend the key diagram such that it does not indicate that the county council UNK to construct a blue route which is what the key diagram indicates to me at the moment then the ball game becomes very different
but as the key diagram stands at the moment because it goes north of knaresborough in its indication of where the route proposal will be i think if that i key diagram is to remain it is right for the examination to consider what the need for that route is as opposed to a route or any other route which goes between harrogate and knaresborough
the choice is yours
the w the western is shown by a single star
it's described in the policy as a fifty nine sixty one relief road
i think the difference there is that we're talking about we're not talking UNK and UNK there we're talking about or certainly in terms of the consultation that we've undertaken on the western route it's been different variations of a western route there isn't an equivalent of a of an inner route for the for the western side
mm
er and so the UNK the stars on the diagram for the western relief road er aren't indicative of er of a particular line or particular option
because here we have looked at four options for the western highway and th and those stars could indicate any of those four options so i think
they could indeed but they do indicate a western relief road
oh yes clearly yes
excuse us one moment
mr you want to come in
yes please sir
and do you want to come in mr as well
shown over there that we haven't seen
alright just a minute mr first
er the interests of my two clients are quite different erm and it would be very helpful to me if the a fifty nine and a erm s sixty one could be treated separately
as far as UNK parish council are concerned i have confirmed my instructions from them and they would be more than satisfied if the county council would agree to amend the key diagram to indicate er a n what is at present shown as a series of stars around the north of harrogate by a single star that would satisfy UNK parish council
i believe the issues about the western road are different but i can say that as far as the northern route is concerned UNK parish council would be more than happy if i the notation on the key diagram could be changed to a single star
thank you for thank mr can we leave your point on one side while we address the a fifty nine
mr do you want to have a ten minute break while you consider this question of whether you would be prepared to advise the panel that you would be a you would accept an amendment to the key diagram to show one star or what ever it is you have used on the key diagram to indicate a fifty nine relief road proposal
yes i'd be grateful for that chairman if that could be arranged thank you
yes we will come back at five to three
have you have you been able to come to a conclusion about the a fifty nine
yes chairman that er we er would be prepared the county council would be prepared to put in a statement to the effect that er it would be w prepared to amend the key diagram to reflect a single er star on the diagram er to reflect the a fifty nine relief road
er similarly we feel it would be more appropriate if that were to be the case er perhaps should point out there are other schemes where we have shown a series of lines stars on the key diagram it's not just on the harrogate
er also there is at york
but er given the er the position in terms of there is a policy statement in the structure plan which refers to the a sixty one and a fifty nine relief roads er if it's going to be helpful then e as well as the er a fifty nine then it would be appropriate to show the western relief road rather than a series of er of arrows to similarly show that i think we'd have to show that as two st two er stars or arrows rather than one because we would need to er indicate both to the north and south of the a fifty nine
but what i'd suggest is that we're actually er will prepare today this afternoon an amended version er of that diagram which we can then er pass to mr and mr for comment
can you beg you pardon
can you refer me to the part of the key diagram which shows the scheme for york to which you referred a moment ago
it's the existing approved er structure plan which shows
ah
york and in fact the southern bypass for harrogate and knaresborough was shown in that fashion
york from the one i'm looking at is a series of triangles
yes
that's correct yeah
as does harrogate knaresborough southern bypass
that's right yes
it's the same way that we've shown the northern and western in the alteration
i don't therefore understand what you're saying about the single star
single triangle rather than star
single triangle
it seems to me that the indication you have given on the key diagram to alteration number three for harrogate knaresborough is exactly the same as for example the indication given for york and for harrogate knaresborough southern on the approved key diagram
what's the change you're offering
well it was to be helpful to the er to mr and UNK parish council that what i was saying was we weren't relying on the key diagram to justify at some future date it being an outer northern relief road that decision would have to be UNK at future enquiry
if it's to be helpful if mr is saying on behalf of the parish council that by showing it in this way on the key diagram he feels is UNK or the parish council's position is UNK at some future date then it's to be helpful to that the county council is saying it is prepared to show it simply as a an arrow and similarly for consistency it would seem to make sense to show the western in the same fashion
can we stick just with the a fifty nine for the time being
er you would indicate somewhere in the harrogate knaresborough are on the key diagram a solid black triangle to illustrate an a fifty nine harrogate knaresborough relief road
that's correct
there would be i think in total there would be three black arrows
er one between the a sixty one and the a fifty nine to the to the east of the a sixty one
this is where the difficulty when we have a sixty north and south and a fifty nine east and west
but between the a sixty one erm running north of harrogate
mm is that the killinghall section
the killinghall section
between there and the a fifty nine to the east we would have one single er arrow or triangle and then we would have another arrow or triangle between the a sixty one and the a fifty nine to the west of harrogate and similarly another arrow between the a fifty nine and the a sixty one south of the a fifty nine down to a sixty one south of harrogate
c can we s sorry to keep coming back to this one but i want to leave the a sixty one for the time being
erm what we would like and i'm taking you at taking your statement er as you made it
er with regard to the a fifty nine and the representation with a single black triangle somewhere in the northern vicinity of harrogate knaresborough somewhere in that vicinity on the key
yes
diagram
er we could you let us have a letter to that effect address it to the panel secretary and really as soon as possible
certainly sir
tomorrow morning
can i be sure that i'm interpreting this correctly
in saying that the county council is not committed to a road which goes north or knaresborough
no i we're not saying that at all that's a different proposition entirely er certainly the county council is at this moment in time committed to an outer northern relief road i don't think there's any question of that
er what we as i was putting was suggesting was in terms of the key diagram and the structure plan we would show it as a single arrow
and we would defend that er de or we would debate that as i understand it as where it should be debated at er the next stage of the planning process which will be an enquiry into a planning application
and that this structure plan was merely indicating the policy of building a relief road and the key diagram was merely indicative as i understand that is its purpose not to show routes but indicative of a location whereabouts in the county is this does this UNK policy relate to
and that's what we are we will be relying upon with er with this change
i think the general feeling of the panel is that if you are committed to a route north of knaresborough then we think it's sufficiently a enough a strategic matter for us to continue the discussion on it
its functions would be different its UNK therefore the need for it would be different
as i understood er mr 's position he would have been on behalf of the parish council who are the only er people who are concerned about this as i understand who raised an objection at this er at this stage they would have been quite happy with the proposition that i've put forward on behalf of the county council
mr your comment please
george
the reason the parish council objected to the structure plan was that they considered that the structure plan itself was beginning to represent a statutory commitment a statutory commitment to a road to the north of knaresborough
now if mr is saying that outside the context of the structure plan entirely which is all i took him to be saying that the members of north yorkshire county council are still determined to build a road to the north of erm
knaresborough
of knaresborough that doesn't seem to be a matter that concerns the structure plan greatly because there are county council elections there are new county councils the reason i am here today is to avoid any sort of statutory commitment in the structure plan
and that's what i want to avoid today and that's my sole objective
my question was to mr was designed to throw light on that point
and the answer was the county council is committed or not prepared to be UNK to a road north of knaresborough
it seems to me there is a UNK argument which says that whether the road the relief road is north or south of knaresborough is a strategic matter
wouldn't indicate that would it er so the a fifty nine relief that the structure plan policy is indicating
there are various ways about that as there are with many road schemes er where there are structure plan policies for a particular scheme and there are arrows on key diagrams there are many ways of getting from a to b er they are not er in terms of outer and inner they are going from the same a to b they start and finish at the same locations it is just a different way of getting from a to b which quite properly as i understand it would be a matter for debate er either at the local plan or if a planning application is made er earlier than that er then at a at a planning enquiry into the specific road proposal
but nevertheless you may have different ways of getting from a to b but those different routes may in actual fact give a different set of benefits or perform different functions or not necessarily meet all the needs as you're setting out to meet
they always do in major highway schemes nearly all options for major highway schemes have certainly have all have different environmental impacts affect er all the factors that we've looked at differently on all our schemes
er traffic effects are different economic effects on agriculture effects on greenbelt land etcetera they all have d depending on which route you take a different impact
and that's the case with inner and outer they are perhaps more fundamentally different er in some respects that than other options for an outer where they go for example on the western where they're totally outside i would accept that
but the way that the structure plan is er is indicating the policy it is it is silent on that
if we amend particularly if we amend the way the diagram is er is indicating it
can i can i ask you a question and then direct the next one to mr
when you say the county council is committed to the northern or the outer relief road route do you mean committed or do you mean that is their preferred option
that is their preferred option which i am instructed er to pursue
they have got to the stage having gone through the consultation having done the assessments looked at the alternatives have declared that as their preferred route which er the next stage would then be as i say the planning process
there is and the county council has indicated that if circumstances change er then it can look at this again
so in terms of commitment er county councils can always look at the route it can always change its mind
er it may indeed deed have to change to change its mind if a future planning enquiry er
yeah
a future inspector recommends it is the wrong route
so situations are reviewed and we do look at monitored traffic flows for example we do look at our UNK and if there are reasons for a change we can go back so it's not UNK by any means that is the current committed preferred route however and i didn't want to give an indication that by changing the diagram we were saying everything's opened up again cos clearly we've reached a stage that the county council's declared it's a preferred route and that's
yes
declared for people who are buying houses and etcetera and it has a certain statutory status but it but it can be looked at again clearly
yes it's a preference
now mr in the light of what mr has said do you understand that if the structure plan key diagram was amended in that way it will still yo leave you and your clients open to challenge or you would have a better chance of challenging er the er preferred option of the county councils at the next stage which is either through the local plan channel or through the er the planning application stage for the highway
yes that's our objective
we have always tried at every stage to erm avoid a commitment of any kind to an outer northern route
we know that we will have further battles in the future to fight but erm we wanted to avoid any statutory commitment in the structure plan and we will be happy if we achieve that today
thank you
before we leave this mr can i please ask you if you accept what mr has said in paragraph three of his statement b three double o two the statement on behalf of the parish council
could you tell me so that i can find the statement
your statement on behalf of the parish council your summary
summary yes
paragraph three
on behalf of UNK
thank you
oh i don't a i don't agree with paragraph three no
i don't accept the UNK that it would achieve limited traffic benefits or indeed would be unlikely to bring significant environmental relief
i certainly i think the percentages there are er are accurate er taken from the diagrams but i wouldn't accept the er the follow on the conclusions which are drawn in that paragraph clearly
you accept the percentages though do you
i accept that those percentages are ones taken from a particular report er showing the changes at certain points on the on the a fifty nine
we've actually summarized that as mr has said in his proof as being showing UNK of between twenty and thirty percent
er and those er those are particular points in the network where er particular figures have been obtained
one of the objectives that the county council has actually set when it declared the when it approved the outer route was to instruct the county surveyor to seek ways and means of trying to increase the relief to harrogate and knaresborough er with an outer northern relief road
and that's work which we will need to do in the future these percentages erm have ob have been obtained from our forecast based upon basically the status quo if you like in a free choice
clearly as we build a package of measures er within the urban areas then we'll be looking for schemes that will encourage use of the outer northern relief road and w attempting to increase the er the flow of traffic on that route
but even having said that er it is still performing in my view or would perform an extremely valuable er service in terms of taking out the a fifty nine through traffic
as you'll see from the diagram in the year of opening in nineteen ninety nine on the central section of the l outer northern relief road there are eight thousand vehicles a day using that road that's eight thousand vehicles a day that won't be wouldn't be passing through knaresborough and through harrogate
and i think that is significant
so can we come back then to er asking you for written confirmation of the
certainly sir
indication of the a fifty nine relief by a single triangle and er let us have that in writing
certainly sir
yeah
thank you
mr
can i say that i hope mr or whoever writes for the county council wouldn't use the form of words but erm although i am instructed by my clients that they would be satisfied with the change to a single triangle erm i don't think that they would be satisfied if you in making that change you UNK by a form of words which said the county council are still committed to building an outer
thank you
that is in practice the position
is it not
what mr said to us
can we do anything in this structure plan forum to change that position
i what i have come here today to do is in the matters that we're discussing to take out any commitment to an outer northern
i do not think that we can achieve more in this forum
if there is more to be achieved in this forum then i think my clients would like to fight for it because we do believe that we would we do believe that logic and technical sense stands against the proposal that's in the structure plan at the moment
well at the moment mr is not in a position to how shall i put it withdraw his UNK commitment or preferred option they have they have made that decision and short of him UNK a UNK a meeting of the highways committee between now and whenever you wo there's no way in which he would be in a position to withdraw that
the only way in which er you could get how shall i put it another view on the issue would be to continue the debate here on whether or not the outer northern UNK the functions and the needs which it pr claims to do compared with the inner routes between knaresborough and harrogate
are you offering me that as an option chairman
i'm suggesting if you want to pursue that i'm prepared to listen to it yes
may i do not need an UNK but may i back away from the microphone to take instruction
yes
the
mr
er george the my clients instruction is not UNK very legally but it's let's go for it so we would sir like to pursue the issue of er our contention is that the outer er northern r route as shown in the structure plan key diagram as it is at present does not meet the need for traffic relief of the a fifty nine a sixty one corridor
do you want to expand on that
yes
give your name again mr
george
my expansion is UNK in paragraph three of the summary statement on behalf of the parish council
that is that the county surveyor chose in september nineteen ninety one to show reductions at six points on the existing road network
that choice of six points is not mine it was the county UNK choice
the reductions at those six points are the figures i have given in paragraph three seventeen percent nineteen percent twenty eight percent twenty three percent ten percent and thirteen percent
they are very low levels of reduction
if one uses the criteria in the department of UNK manual of environmental appraisal to which the county council themselves have referred most of those levels of reduction don't even erm fall at the level where you would normally evaluate their environmental impact
i should say that the figures of seventeen percent nineteen percent twenty eight percent and twenty three percent the first four figures are figures on the a fifty nine
the smaller reductions are on the part of the a fifty nine through harrogate where the flows are much bigger
the reductions the bigger percentage reductions of twenty eight percent and twenty three percent are in the section closer to knaresborough where in fact the flows are substantially smaller er are quite a bit under twenty thousand
i could actually give you the exact figures er or mr but i won't give them at the moment of the top of my head
but those big percentage reductions are taking place at a point on the network where the southern bypass has already reduced the flows so th those parts of the network would be much less in need of relief
the ten percent and thirteen percent figures which are very low indeed re relate to the a six one which following the opening of the southern bypass and er the UNK er i don't know whether it's a UNK or a supermarket on UNK road has very now has very high traffic flows which are comparable to flows on the a fifty nine
the outer northern UNK relief road does nothing to reduce those flows or nothing significant to reduce those flows on UNK road
an inner relief road the one favoured by UNK parish council would be much more successful
and the final thing that i ought to say is that i if i it has a UNK to what's going to be said later today
if an inner northern relief road were built it could take some of the traffic which the western relief road is UNK to deal with
mr the percentages which you have quoted are they taken from the figures which the county surveyors has proposed in his table two attached to his paper
yeah i just want to be clear on wh
no
no
no
er may i tell you where they are taken from
yes please
thank you
if you would turn to my full submission on behalf of UNK parish council
and if you would turn to appendix three to that submission
yes
appendix three er contains two pages taken from the county surveyors report of the sixth of september nineteen ninety one
it's the first of those pages i would direct you to
thank you
the page which is number three
that's right and it's the table in the top half
and it immediately UNK paragraph three point four
thank you
yeah
i think the question follows mr why is county council supporting a proposal which compared with the o other options before it provides least relief
the debate about the inner and outer is a little more complicated than that
i find myself in some difficulty in that the statement i have prepared does not debate the merits of the inner and outer routes but merely the question of is there a need for a relief road er and what are the benefits that the particular relief road er that we are currently promoting which is the outer northern whether that is sufficient to demonstrate that it is meeting a need
i think we're getting into very difficult or er waters when we start talking about the relative comparison with other routes which i haven't er myself included in my statement any reference to
clearly if i had been aware that we were going to be talking about the merits of other routes then i would have prepared a different statement
but having said that given that we do need to go on and talk about it i will do my best to give that information er that i have
clearly the diagram the table in mr 's proof where he refers to the traffic figures th those are taken indeed from our own er committee report er to members which set out er the relief at various points six points on the highway network for the outer route compared er with the inner routes
and you'll see from that er and i accept that er the outer route the relief is approximately half to the a fifty nine at if you look at the a fifty nine knaresborough road harrogate er there is a relief of five thousand vehicles for the er outer blue route as opposed to nine thousand five hundred er for the inner northern routes
er now clearly if the if the members had si had been simply the highways committee had been deciding the preferred route simply on the basis of which gives the greatest traffic relief then on that basis they would have chosen an inner northern
er there are other factors
er we included to members the information on traffic flows we also included the information which you have a copy of in my statement
mhm
which gives a very comprehensive assessment er of er the i in terms of the department of UNK own manual of environmental appraisal sets out er information on all the routes that we that were put to the public as part of the consultation we did in nineteen ninety one
can you direct us to the table please
is this your appendix b
appendix b sir yes
yes
thank you
so these are all factors in here which er the well first of all the general public was provided with a UNK of this if i can put it that way in that the en original consultation leaflet included er UNK from this UNK of it er in the leaflet er and that set out clearly the UNK traffic effects of the outer northern relief road compared with the inner
it also set out the er as you'll see from here well if you look at the detailed information that er was available at the exhibitions you'll see that it runs through er the effect of the routes on first of all the vehicle travellers gives the time savings vehicle operating cost savings value accident savings for each of the options
erm
can i stop you there is you've already explained that the inner routes have a significantly better performance in terms of UNK traffic than the outer one
what's the position with regard to accidents
if you look at the first page of the appendix b er the outer route was called was the blue route so if you look down
yes
at the bottom of that page you'll see that the blue route and there are two sets of figures that is based upon high and UNK you see at the top which are high and low traffic forecasts
yes
yeah
er for high traffic forecast there would be the blue route would save and this is a thirty year thirty year assessment period which is a standard assessment period for major road schemes twenty four UNK under high traffic growth conditions twenty UNK under low traffic growth
two hundred and eighty serious the these are reductions two hundred and eighty re er r serious injury accidents would be reduced on the a fifty nine two thirty with low growth
seven hundred and ninety six er less slight injury accidents on the a fifty nine six hundred and fifty three with low growth
that UNK with the figures you'll see for the inner routes erm which are higher er because of the er greater transfer of traffic from existing roads
so again the inner route performs better
performs better yes
thank you
and in terms of vehicle operating costs savings if i just go back to the top of that page the inner routes again perform well not so not so well or better
which
do they perform better
er in actual fa in actual fact not so not so well in that er there are there are negative benefits er as you'll see in some and less negative on the blue route
yeah
mr
that is not my interpretation of the table
erm i will apologize if i am wrong but my interpretation of the table is that erm could you say chairman wh which of three rows of we're dealing with the top part of the table all vehicle travellers
yes
which of the three rows were you talking about
i was just looking at vehicle operating cost savings
ah the middle one
yes
then
can i can
it seems to me sir that erm the that some of the inner routes at least the red route performs better on operating cost savings than the blue route
yes
are we UNK this table mr
red performs better than blue
not er not my understanding the and i think there is a we may have hit on the perhaps the only the only error in the whole all the figures in this table there should be a minus clearly in front of the three point six seven in that table
but you'll see on the vehicle operating cost savings that they're all negative but the blue route is less negative that purple orange red and pink and therefore erm is marginally better in terms of vehicle operating cost savings
but on the other two criteria either side of vehicle operating cost time savings and
yes it's better on the inner routes yes
accident savings red is better than blue
yes
er red is better than blue yes
i'd accept that yeah
are there any major UNK of this table mr where blue is better than red
well i think what you've got to be careful of and it's always a difficulty when you're looking at er benefits and dis benefits of major road schemes you'll see that we go into a tremendous amount of or collect a tremendous amount of information about the different impacts
some can be UNK in UNK terms and can be looked at UNK others are subjective
erm and those are the ones which are described er UNK put it that way
now it is very difficult clearly to compare UNK er one route with another but if you take an example the effect on greenbelt land which should you look towards the back it's just one that springs to mind but there are no doubt er there will be others which we can go into
er you will see that on in group four which is the top unfortunately these aren't page numbers in this er pa they don't have page numbers in this manual
but under group four under the effect impact on policies erm is that the right one
yeah designation of greenbelt authority of harrogate borough council approximate land take erm you'll see that for the blue route that affects one point four hectares of greenbelt land whereas for the inner routes purple affects seventeen point six hectares orange twenty point two red twenty point five and pink twenty point eight
the other er aspect perhaps is if and again on the consultation leaflet and in the manual effect on houses demolished
er there are no houses demolished with the blue route er there are eight houses demolished with the purple route six with the orange route six with the red route and two with the pink route
the other clear major factor was that a result of public consultation er and clearly this was an important consideration when members came to choose the route that seventy percent of those consulted favoured the outer northern route the blue route
and they were given the information on traffic relief er in the leaflet in more detail at the exhibition
and so they were aware when that er that view was expressed of the UNK effects
would you accept that there is an element of us all UNK something that is further away from us than something that is nearer to
i hesitate to use words
well i mean that is one of the other factors of course
is there an element of that in it
well clearly that is that is er that is one of the elements nevertheless something that is to be ignored lightly
the other factor probably the way to look at that more UNK is to see how many houses are in UNK to each of the routes which is a standard way again in the departments own er manual of environmental appraisal of doing that and that is the information which is contained find it er which is a way of looking at noise effects
er and you'll see that in group two the impact of the various routes on occupiers residential occupiers you'll see that for the blue route and that this is where we have the number of properties demolished by the different routes on the top line er in terms of noise effects adjacent to new road number of houses within a given distance a centre line nought to fifty metres there are only five properties within nought to fifty metres of the blue route whereas there are thirty on the purple twenty er on the orange less on the red four and five on the pink
and so we have again you know set that information out in the in the document
er number of premises adjacent it's similar
but if you look at some of the other factors for example just within all the other routes score better than the blue route
i mean number of premises experiencing experience at least UNK of the present traffic
er
that reflects the traffic forecast that we talked about earlier
i think we r we accepted in the county surveyors report to members er it was clearly pointed out that the traffic benefits of the inner routes are greater than the outer route
and that i'm not UNK that
and that's to that's clearly summarized on the last page of your appendix b isn't it
it is but then er there are many schemes that er we have that don't have as good a rate of return as the blue route that is an extremely healthy economic rate of return for the outer northern blue route
so although it is not as good as the inner routes it is nevertheless an extremely UNK scheme in the department of UNK terms
so why
because it does take out a significant volume of traffic out of harrogate and knaresborough
it's not as much as the other two but it's still a significant amount
so why at the end of the day does the county council feel that the blue route is preferable to the others
because in reaching its decision it takes account not only of the technical merits in terms of traffic relief but also the wider impact er the other factors in terms of the route and also public opinion
if that were not the case then we wouldn't have er public consultation exercise and ask for people's views in terms of which routes they support
and in this case it was an overwhelming support for the blue route
it wasn't a marginal decision the sum total of the inner routes er represent thirty percent of those er expressing a view whereas the one outer route attracted seventy percent of the response in favour
and clearly that had a significant effect on the discussion
and yet on the face of it the inner route seemed to offer a better way of meeting the need than performing the functions that you seek for the relief road to perform in that part of harrogate knaresborough
yes
can you identify any particular factor apart from public opinion which indicate may not be as helpful in this sort of circumstance as in others
any particular factor
well
apart from that on which the county council placed a great deal of weight
because on the evidence before us it seems to me it's hard to understand why they went that way
i've stolen mr 's UNK i think
i find it i find i must say i find it difficult to understand why you find it difficult to understand that they chose that particular route
i'll go through it if you like
clearly there are o there are there are clear reasons in my view why that route was chosen but there are as i say i find th somewhat at a disadvantage because i haven't come prepared to talk about the relative merits in great detail of the two routes
the information certainly there in that t in the manual erm there are other factors
clearly er my recollection at the time there was great concern and it can and it's UNK reflected in the public response about creating a new road passing between harrogate and knaresborough
seen as a vital green wedge between harrogate and knaresborough it's designated as greenbelt land there was a tremendous amount of concern er about passing through there
l some of that land is at the present time is used for the golf course there was an impact of all those routes on the golf course
there was major concern about that
but perhaps more than that was the concern about this e affecting this precious area of land between harrogate and knaresborough
and that came out as a as a as a certainly many people mentioned that to me at the exhibitions that i attended
er there was a worry that well first of all the effect just the appearance of the road passing through that area clearly obviously concerns about development but that can be on any route that can happen
er and that can be UNK
er but simply the fact it was passing through this area of land that was regarded by locals as being sacred and UNK the two communities
but if i'm if i act as UNK advocate the fact that inner route would pass through the greenbelt does not necessarily UNK the purpose of the greenbelt
which is to keep or prevent coalescence i think er probably ask mr to comment on that
surely the primary purpose of the greenbelt in this location is to prevent coalescence between harrogate and knaresborough
or does he believe that is a route is put through there then that would increase development pressures in that sector of the district and the greenbelt notation would then run the risk of having to be reviewed
i shouldn't put words in your mouth
thank you chairman david harrogate borough council
er yes i this is a very sensitive part of the what is the west riding greenbelt the outer edge of the west riding greenbelt
it does have a its prime function is erm protecting the coalescence of harrogate and knaresborough and protecting their special character
erm i don't necessarily think that a road running through that area would increase development pressures and basically because it is greenbelt it's not going to development pressure
very much however depends on the UNK of the road
i think if the road was drawn very closely in to the greenbelt edge then that could have an effect on development pressures and it could lead to pressures for erm some er amendment the greenbelt boundary in the future erm of plan making processes
what are the borough council's views about relative preference to inner and outer
one of the erm i mean i think it has to be said that we erm i support everything that er chris has said about the effect of traffic relief
there is much greater traffic relief provided by the inner relief road er i think our gen
is that a good thing
i sorry
is that a good thing
in itself in providing a greater degree of traffic relief yes it i mean it is a good thing it is a plus point
but i think erm the general point that was made really has to be considered alongside other considerations is the key consideration
