erm our view was that there are erm problems associated with er an inner relief road and one of one of those problems was the amount of traffic that would pass through end at knaresborough there was a lot of concern as we spelt out to members in our er committee report that erm traffic erm along forest lane head towards knaresborough along the a existing a fifty nine corridor would actually increase over the do nothing situation
is that a matter which could be overcome by detailed position
or not
er i don't know if i can answer that i suspect not
sorry does it i put my question very badly does it make any difference to traffic through this particular part or knaresborough where the relief road is
if it were
if it was an inner relief road
yeah
yes
no i don't think it really makes an difference on the detailed UNK of an inner relief road i think it's basically the perception of UNK using er the system in that part of harrogate and knaresborough that it would be quicker to use the existing a fifty nine through knaresborough than you go along one of the UNK routes onto er the inner relief road
so it might the inner relief road whichever UNK if i read you right would actually push more traffic back onto the a fifty nine in knaresborough
along a section of the a fifty nine yes
along a section
yes
a along forest lane head really the bit that passes through the countryside between harrogate and knaresborough
yes
mr
thank you
yes i'd like to m make a it's an important point about end
it does indeed do what mr said but there are two other roads into knaresborough from the harrogate UNK one from the harrogate direction and one from the south east
what the inner northern roads do is encourage people to go into knaresborough via bond end but there is a considerable UNK decrease on the other two roads into knaresborough from the harrogate direction
so if one takes all three roads into knaresborough it does not have it does not increase traffic
it what it tends to do is to encourage more traffic to come into knaresborough on the main road as opposed to the two secondary roads
the second point to make again is that where the a fifty nine comes into knaresborough at bond end it is not as busy as it is e on other parts of its length
yes i don't really want to respond to that other than to say that bond end is d it's still an extremely important consideration it's in the conservation area it's an important part of knaresborough and it was obviously something that members had in mind when they made their decision on the relative merits
but do you and or your members place greater weight on the impact on that particular part of knaresborough as opposed to the impact on knaresborough and harrogate generally
i don't know if i can answer that to be absolutely honest i mean i really feel that erm that would be reading too much into the decision that our members took at that time
your own view
no my own view and it's i don't know if i've come to a view on the relative weight of those sorts of considerations er i i'd need to think about it some more before i could come to a view on that
there are other considerations which come into play for example the golf course between harrogate and knaresborough
erm now that the inner relief road options would have required some UNK of the of the golf course would certainly have UNK erm the golf course and that was undoubtedly a consideration
certainly something that the public erm referred to in their consultation response
just to go back a stage to a comment you made there you did say that the inner relief road on one of the routes on one of those routes would in fact enable environmental benefits to be felt elsewhere in the town simply because you're getting a better distribution of the traffic
i mean there are some dis benefits but do the benefits that arise from an inner route UNK those dis benefits
i mean has that been examined
i it's not been examined sir no
it hasn't been examined
mr do you want to raise anything else
very little
because most of what i have said is fair m most of the case that i wish to put er has come out in the discussion that there has just been
it is also contained in my submission
i will summarize it as follows
the i believe that there is a need for traffic relief to the a fifty nine and to the a six one
an inner northern relief road
that is that is the UNK harrogate road isn't it
it is yes
thank you
the inner an inner northern bypass would provide that relief it would be twice as successful in providing relief as an outer northern route
it is true that if one UNK on can find some aspects in which the outer northern route is preferable to the inner northern route
mr has mentioned the number of houses that would require UNK and the amount of greenbelt that would be taken
about those two things i would say that the number of houses requiring UNK is very small and as has been observed already a road is not an inappropriate use in the greenbelt
we also have one overall environmental assessment of the impact of the inner relief roads
not one of the little piece picking a little piece out but an overall assessment and this was produced for the county council by their environmental consultants and was specifically referred to in the county surveyor and i think county planning officer's joint report and that er assessment said rather than damaging an UNK sensitive landscape as could happen with the other routes the inner northern route could be seen as a means of improving the landscape
so it is not simply that the inner northern route gives far greater traffic relief than the outer northern and therefore far more effectively meets the need but also on environmental criteria the council's own consultants appear to have found that at least in its effect on the landscape that it is preferable
that quote just so we have it for record that quote is taken from eight point nine paragraph eight point nine of your full submission
i'll just check
page twelve
yes
thank you very much mr would you like to come back
just er just briefly sir if i may
erm clearly in terms of er the relative merits of the of the different routes for an a fifty nine relief road there are advantages in traffic terms er of the inner northern relief roads
er i think er the important point to remember is that all of these er benefits and dis benefits were i don't have the
thank you
well just to reiterate i mean we would still like to have that letter from you UNK that
mr
chairman if i could just erm david harrogate borough council
if i could just pick up on one point erm and that was related to the two different types of inner relief road that was proposed
one set had possible links into harrogate and the others didn't
and they actually provide different levels of traffic relief
and certainly it was the case as my understanding of it anyway is that those l er those routes that had links into harrogate provided far greater relief than those that didn't have links
yes
and that when you look to compare the merits of those er without links and the outer northern there's not that much difference
our concern as borough council was with the er inner relief road options that had links into the urban area
we're very concerned about the environmental effects of those links into harrogate
most of which would come onto erm the a fifty nine through the urban area through residential areas or in fact onto the stray
sorry mr but just to pursue that point
those links into harrogate nevertheless are required are they not in order for the relief road to function
they certainly would be required for an inner relief road erm to function UNK as effectively as has been suggested at this e i p
i think what you're saying is we're not comparing like with like
mr
yes two points
first of all i think that it it's difficult to be sure of this because of the way in which the county council prepared their the evidence on which i UNK relied and like mr i didn't come here prepared to talks in detail about the inner northern
but to the best of my knowledge the figures i have quoted on the inner northern are without links
it becomes i do touch on this at one point in my submission it becomes even better if it has links
i think it's twice as effective without links and it becomes even better with links
that's the first point
the se
yeah carry on sorry the second one
right
the second point is about the public consultation exercise
i must choose my words with care as well that my clients and i think that there was very much an effect of people wanting to have a relief road but also wanting to have it as far away from themselves a as they could have it
one could use various UNK terms to describe that which i won't but my clients felt very strongly that there are not very many people living in UNK and it was an easy option to say let's push the road further away
what i think the public did not appreciate and i do not think would have appreciated clearly from the consultation leaflet was quite how big a difference there was between the level of relief afforded by the inner relief roads and the outer relief roads and in that context i think that to say that the outer relief roads afford relief of between twenty and thirty percent is a little misleading in two respects
and i don't mean to employ it's in any way UNK
a little misleading in two respects on is i think the average person doesn't realize that it's very hard to perceive very much of a difference when there's only a twenty to thirty percent reduction
and secondly erm the way the e the quote was made in the leaflet doesn't point out the fact that in the part of the road where it's UNK the part of the a fifty nine where it's UNK and on the a six one that the reduction is in fact less than twenty percent
thank you
finally and then i'd like to go to the a sixty one er a point of information mr the standard that you are talking about for UNK any of these routes is it dual two lane or single two lane
we haven't made that er decision as yet
the
you haven't made a no
public consultation was on the basis of a dual carriageway and it
yes
clearly said that in the
right
in the information so we had to we had to assume one for the purpose of public consultation but we said that the final decision on standards would be taken er in another time
yeah
clearly when we make a planning application we have to er UNK that
thank you can we now move to the a sixty one
you've been very patient mr
interested in that conversation
er mr can i just pursue the general theme
as i see it you have talked about the a sixty one er and the idea of having a western relief road would remove something like seven thousand vehicles from the existing a sixty one
have i read your comments correctly
something of that order
that's right seventy seven thousand which is thirty percent of
yes
seven thousand out of
the actual flows on the bypass are higher than that
well
in certain locations but for reasons which go into
no can i no yes just let just let me pursue the thing the way i would like to at the moment
erm that seven thousand e those seven thousand vehicles is that the through traffic element on the present day a sixty one
or in oth can i put it another way
in fact what is the through traffic element on the existing a sixty one
right
er the a sixty one it varies whether you're looking at the a sixty one south or the a sixty one north as to what percentage and what flow er is through traffic and also between which e elements or which UNK we're talking about because there's a sixty one to a sixty one there's also a sixty one to a fifty nine which is also through traffic
yes
yeah
er but based upon the surveys that we conducted in er nineteen eighty nine which is the basis of the traffic forecasts er on and that is just twelve hour two way flows we have a total flow on the a sixty one north er entering harrogate of sixteen thousand three hundred vehicles
now of that fifty four percent was heading for harrogate and knaresborough
yes
erm
so that's roughly nine thousand ten thousand vehicles
er that's right roughly of that order
yeah well
w eight thousand eight hundred i can give you the precise figure
was local traffic headed for harrogate and knaresborough
erm thirty three percent of that figure was heading south and was through traffic
er eleven percent er was heading west on the a fifty nine
so
which is traffic coming down the a sixty one and heading west on the a fifty nine
er north
coming from the north
it's coming from the north yes
coming from the north yes
yeah
but at the moment that doesn't use the a sixty one it uses the b road that comes through killinghall to join
yes
turning off somewhere killinghall
in the centre of killinghall yes
in the centre of killinghall yeah
erm so that was er that was eleven percent but the total through traffic observed on the a sixty one north was er seven thousand five hundred a day
mhm
so this is why clearly some of that would be taken out of harrogate
yes
and some of it is taken out of killinghall
yes
er because the traffic clearly isn't carrying on down through but nevertheless is through traffic
mm
which is the relief road does UNK
yeah
erm
so but the residual element which would carry on south through harrogate is
yes
just remind me again is how much
eleven was it eleven
well the or residual element er if you take out the i haven't got this figure actually to in this little table i've got here but if you bear with me one moment
did you say twenty three percent
thirty three percent of er
thirty three percent
of sixteen thousand three hundred was
five thousand four hundred yes
roughly five thousand
give or take yes
coming from the leeds direction
right again that's slightly complicated in that we have two roads coming from the leeds direction and the
mhm
surveys were undertaken on both of those the a sixty f five eight and the a sixty one
which is the a six five eight
the a six five eight if you look at the bottom of the two roads it's the one on the left which is going on down off the plan
the a six five eight to leeds
the a sixty one is heading due south
yeah this is the one that goes down to poole isn't it
yes that's right
yes
yeah
mhm
erm if you look at the a six five eight then er seventy five percent of that traffic is heading into harrogate and knaresborough
erm seventeen percent is headed north through traffic
erm a fairly low percentage three percent er travelling east and just one percent are travelling west
mhm
so there's just over two thousand vehicles
er there's an ei total flow of eight thousand two hundred now six thousand one hundred and fifty of that is local traffic two thousand and fifty is passing through
sorry could you repeat the figure for through traffic
two thousand and fifty vehicles
thank you
this is in a twelve hour so for a daily flow we've this was a surveying period about twenty percent for to these for a full day
so am i am i right in thinking that the western relief road is catering for a north south through traffic element but its primary purpose is to provide relief to the main e the present a sixty one which runs through the centre of harrogate and again would seek to distribute traffic around the network and bring it in on other UNK roads from the west for example
well it's got two purposes
yeah
rather than i think differentiate the sort of primary
i think the pr if there has to be a primary purpose it is a actually to take out the traffic which doesn't belong in harrogate
yes
or knaresborough at all which is the primary both routes are part of the primary route network the national network er and feel it's not appropriate for that traffic to be passing through the urban area
now that element there was an element if you're making a note of figures we didn't do the a sixty one south in case you
no yeah
we missed out some traffic through traffic
erm there's the a sixty one south again where there is another two thousand three hundred vehicles heading in which is totally through
yes
harrogate on the a six from the a sixty one
but clearly the it forms two purposes one is to remove the er the through traffic but also it forms a purpose of redistribution of the traffic such that er there are er benefits er of getting er traffic off the a sixty one which for example is headed for the for the northern part of harrogate and that can come in from the south it can go up to the a fifty nine and then come back into the northern part of harrogate without having to pass through the centre of harrogate
and that's a sort of fairly normal function of a of any bypass is to particularly of a larger er urban area as opposed to say a village or a small town is to have UNK connections in er to the to the larger urban area at a number of points
just to spread the traffic
yeah
and to provide benefits er for that local traffic as well as for the through traffic
yeah so you'd anticipate some coming in on the a fifty nine if you went that far north
yes
erm and other traffic would come in from on the b six one six two
that is the only other connection yes
and that
yes
there and perhaps coming on to the residents' association point that made in their proof that our forecasts actually show that on balance er there would be an increase in flow in fact on the on that route as it approaches the a sixty one
that what you get in terms of the effect is that some traffic er will go out to use er the western relief road to head north or south and will no longer use the road to get into harrogate
er particular there is er a commercial business area at harlow c court er located on the western fringe er which clearly at the moment a lot of our traffic will have to use road to get into harrogate and to access to the a sixty one
now a significant part of that traffic will in the future or with such a road er make use of that and would no longer have to use road
er there are major plans as well as i understand it mr can confirm for extension of that or expansion of that area already agreed in the local plan
and clearly that would be of benefit er to road in terms of UNK the pressure from that traffic
there is a plus in that there is extra traffic c would come in and use road to gain access to harrogate
but it's a question of pluses and UNK
the figures that we've produced show that on balance er it it's about a neutral effect on road er through the residential area because of this er reductions due to traffic going out to join the relief road rather than joining the a sixty one
have you UNK the relative costs and benefits of an eastern relief road as opposed to the western relief road
i'm playing UNK advocate again
it seems to me that given that you have a southern bypass there could be an argument for saying if we had a northern inner relief road that northern inner relief road together with a southern bypass could perform some of the functions of the western relief road
yes we're back to the inner northern routes aren't we
erm
have you UNK this option
we did we did evaluate that option er as part of the er early assessments i don't have the results today
er but certainly it wasn't as effective er as a western relief road
er it is er significantly further er via a southern bypass and an inner relief road than it is via a western relief road
and it wasn't as effective but other than that i can't i don't have the sort of the detailed information to er to refer to
when you say it wasn't as effective in what sense wasn't it as effective
i mean wasn't was it less attractive
it was less attractive to traffic
to say the through traffic element erm didn't function as well in terms of distributing traffic around the network which wanted to access
it didn't er it is a difficult for me because i don't have the figures er but er mr er my assistant who er did do the detailed work er tells me that it didn't provide as much traffic relief to the a sixty one as did a western relief
i'm quite happy for mr to comment direct if he wishes
sir alan north yorkshire county council
er during the stages er we did look at ways of er providing relief to the a sixty one erm by er using the southern bypass and then any of the inner northern routes
and in doing so we looked at er other routes than shown on that plan there in order to encourage traffic to use those options
er by effectively where we've got the er combination of colours joining on to the southern bypass we looked at moving that in a UNK direction to encourage that movement
er i honestly can't remember what the breakdown on the figures are but er even by moving that inner route direction er we were unable er within the traffic model to actually er encourage so much re as much relief on the a sixty one what the actual figures were i haven't got them to hand sir at the moment
but we did look at that as er as an option
can you remember for example given the levels of relief you are advocating are acceptable on the blue route how such roads such a link as an alternative to the western link would perform
yeah i ca i haven't got the to hand
i don't think
i'm sorry
i don't think we'd like to er comment on that without
er i think further notice and having a look at the figures
i you have not said it would not meet the department of UNK criteria for financial support for example
no
i don't have that er information to be able to er to give you today
mr do you want to
terry harlow and ash residents' association
er two points at this stage
erm coming back to an original comment made by mr
as part of the er western relief road you said that the a sixty one north of killinghall has in fact a very poor accident record
er and you actually acknowledged my comments about the UNK bends and the crossroads
and is not a fact that in fact the killinghall bypass and the ripon bypass in fact does nothing to in fact i er UNK those particular problems over about a seven mile stretch
and is it not therefore necessary if you're going to justify this western relief road and quote your own words as a key link to the north that will there have to do further work in order to make that road acceptable
otherwise you will be increasing the accident risks by directing traffic in that way
and finally surely at this present moment only four miles east of harrogate and about three miles east of ripon the a s a one is at this very moment in time being lifted to an acceptable standard a motorway standard at this stage and not in the year two thousand which is what you're talking about for this road
and finally mr chairman on this point we did in fact do some checking to see the sense of using what the county planning committee had recommended to the h er highways and transport committee that they should regard the six five eight a five nine one as the correct link to the a one
six of our residents took part in a driving exercise and we demonstrated that clearly and this is for your benefit we'll give it to you although it's three miles longer to the point where the a sixty one joins the a one even with the present state of the a one it is ten minutes quicker to go via the a six five eight a fifty nine a one route
it is much easier and it's much safer and it strikes me to be making the case for a western relief road to provide the relief north to the a one has already been achieved on the six five eight
er that's my first point on that the second point on the same issue of the financial case justification
in the original case that was put forward the basis of the economical assessment and its traffic flows was on the western relief road being the first to be built
the case in fact that was put forward by the north yorkshire county council highways and traffic committee was in fact that the need as so clearly expressed by mr is that it is the a fifty nine that needs the relief more than anything else an therefore the proposal is that the northern relief road be it an inner or an outer be built first
particularly because in your own words the accident relief it will
have you therefore UNK the western relief UNK benefits on the base that y you will have now at that point in time both a southern a fifty nine a one link and a southern northern link if you want it for the a sixty one north of harrogate
now have these figures been UNK at all
thank you mr chairman
the a six five eight includes the i in your terminology includes the er recently opened southern relief road doesn't it
i'm sorry mr chairman i w
the a six five eight is the is also
is the southern bypass
inclusive of the southern bypass
is the southern bypass
yes
yes
erm that's the diagram
yes
there's some more information on the back which i'd like to come to later
that's the actual diagram of the UNK
does he want one i haven't i haven't i haven't
perhaps while mr is studying er that piece of paper i could ask mr a question
you said at the beginning of the debate on this matter you supported an UNK relief road system
can i ask why
yes chairman david harrogate borough council
erm the question of the need for or the need for an UNK route has been put to our members on a number of occasions
er most recently in nineteen ninety nineteen ninety one
the main reason is obviously as i said earlier in my in my erm summary of my statement to reduce congestion reduce delays to reduce accidents and to give scope for environmental improvements within the urban area
if you don't have the full UNK system then you don't get the full scale of relief that we're seeking
but you have less roads and therefore less environmental damage where those roads pass
certainly it's the case that there's a down side if you like with providing the new roads through what is mostly open countryside
we in com in coming to a view on the principle of an UNK system looked at erm those issues in very general terms and clearly erm we'll will through the process of either a planning application or the local plan and i would say at this point that we already have er a member commitment to include the preferred option of the county council within the local plan as we move forward to our consultation draft next year we would obviously look more UNK at the UNK and cons of er particular road schemes
but you think the environmental benefits of the western relief road UNK its dis benefits
the environmental benefits taken together with the reductions in congestion and traffic and accidents UNK the environmental dis benefits yes
thank you
if i could add there subject to the UNK that erm i mentioned earlier that the western relief road is pursued on the basis of a single carriageway road
thank you
mr
yes thank you chairman
er in fact i have now mr has found the er the report which has actually got the traffic assessment e that we've just been referring to which is er no western relief road but with in an inner northern road
and in fact that showed no relief to the a sixty one at all in that it was quicker for traffic to actually pass er through on the a sixty one going to the to the traffic model and the all the assumptions built into it er than it was to use a southern bypass er out to the inner northern route and then back to the a sixty one south of killinghall
and so we didn't actually get any relief to the a sixty one in that particular test
now clearly that you know this is a the model that we have is a daily one it is a twelve hour model
er but we could have run assessments at peak times compared to off peak times probably got slightly different effects at peak times
er i would accept that
er but in the way that we assessed er all of these options and which again is fairly normal for you know major relief road UNK er it was indicating er that it wouldn't provide any relief to the a sixty one
and i'm not saying that's the reason but clearly that is er factor and certainly some of the points we were making about distribution of traffic er on the western side of harrogate er clearly that wouldn't have had the benefits of providing that connection on the western side it would have concentrated all connections between harrogate and knaresborough and given rise to more concentrated local traffic effects in that area than would be the case er with an outer western er relief road
mr first then mr
sorry
all i wanted to know sir was which page mr was on i i'll comment later i just want to know which page it is please
i've got the
we're not on a page
oh
right
yes
er it's a plan rather than a page
right
mr before you that one was a question that but could you pick up the questions which mr raised
yeah certainly sir
the er the first point as i understand is with regard to use of the a six five eight a fifty nine a one as opposed to the er using a western relief road that being er a more appropriate route
in fact erm we have clearly in terms of the of the southern bypass is in place er and also the a one er there are two other schemes we do have in place so in terms of doing travel times and seeing er which is the quickest route we have to some extent er well we rely upon the traffic model
but there are two factors er that come into play one is the a one motorway proposals er the other is the ripon bypass which is currently under construction as well which we're also reviewing
a UNK a significant UNK on the a sixty one increase journey times or reduce journey times on the a sixty one as opposed to southern bypass and a one
but we did recognize that in opening the southern bypass it would have an effect on traffic pattern
er the work that i've referred to earlier in terms of the through traffic was assessed before the southern bypass was open er and so we did put in place er a traffic automatic traffic counters on a number of key routes er to see whether on opening of the southern bypass the actual effects er where the same as we were modelling cos clearly we were concerned that we didn't want to be er UNK our assessments of further relief roads on a false premise
er and so we did we did we did look at the traffic flows and monitor them
we monitored them for a period of about twelve months before we reported to members on the outcome
er and that er in my view anyway demonstrated that we'd got it about right in terms of our assessment of the effects of the southern bypass
er there was very little effect on the a sixty one through the centre of harrogate or to the north of harrogate the sorts of traffic flows that we had prior the southern bypass are still there
there hasn't been a switch from the a using the a sixty one er to get across to the a one using the southern bypass that just hasn't happened in practice
there's a very small difference of two and a half percent which mr refers to in his proof as being a change er in the figures which i would accept
indeed i've included as you'll know in table two to my statement er the effects of the of the southern bypass
there is a very small change on the a sixty one of two and a half percent
that really is within the er the grounds for error in any traffic count
er indeed nationally there has been in the last twelve months a three percent er reduction in traffic flows in any event
erm so that response to using the southern bypass the a one certainly some traffic might find that heading north will find that attractive
but it hasn't been reflected in traffic flows on the a sixty one to date
and some of the traffic of course isn't heading a one north of the a sixty one
there is quite a lot of local traffic er i say local is heading for the area you know north of harrogate er erm to er to the UNK er to ripon er and points between harrogate er and the a one to the north
er on the question of the a sixty one itself erm and the remaining sections that need to be improved which again will make it more attractive compared with the a one
there the ripon bypass which is under construction i mentioned
the killinghall bypass er does bypass some of the severe bends of at the southern ends
i accept that there are then still there is still a section er of six or seven miles between that improvement and ripon
er there is a scheme in fact on our reserve list of major schemes for that section of road
this is the bit going past isn't it
yeah
well the bit just past UNK no will be UNK by the by the killinghall er section
mm
as you'll see from the
yeah
erm well no actually that's it's not the line on the green dots because that's a er an older plan but is in fact it's shown better on the er the aerial photograph where you can see the currently preferred or the preferred route for the northern outer northern route er and the link up to the a sixty one to the north
you can see that now is quite a substantial length of new road er which in fact er does bypass the UNK roundabout er and goes some distance to the north on the a sixty one where it UNK
er but the major UNK programme but has not yet been included arrows e
mr 's second question related to the question of whether rows e
yes we have
er and that showed er in fact when we reported to members in july of this year we were seeking from them er an indication as to the priority of the phasing because prior to that and in fact it's reflected in the structure plan we simply have a scheme for a fifty nine a sixty one relief roads they're not broken down into the two schemes
er as the schemes progressed forward in the programme we need to break those down into UNK packages er to progress them sensibly through the various stages
er and erm we did for that er report er as indeed in fact we had earlier in any event we'd looked at them separately we haven't simply put in an UNK route we had assessed in the traffic model er as separate schemes
er and we found at that earlier stage they acted largely independently
er the one had very little effect on the other
the a fifty nine relief road had very little effect on traffic flows on the a sixty one through harrogate and vice versa the a the western relief has very little effect on traffic flows on the a sixty one through harrogate
and vice versa the a the western relief has very little effect on the a fifty nine
er we did that exercise again er to advise members on which had priority so we did assessments with a southern bypass clearly already there with a northern relief road in place assessed that against the situation with no western relief road
and similarly for the western er and that er report was used to er to advise members on priorities
but there was still you know a substantial it was more or less the same case as we had before in terms of the traffic relief that each afforded and the economic rates of return
we weren't getting er traffic which would otherwise be on the western relief road going along the southern bypass and then round the northern bypass to get back to the a sixty one
clearly it wouldn't do that it's twenty two kilometres further than actually staying on the a sixty one through the centre of harrogate
we would have great difficulty persuading traffic to do it
your northern road was the blue route was it
she said feeling like a terrier attacking a bone
that's right
yes
you didn't do a similar assignment for the inner route north
well cl clearly not in july of this year because
no
as far as the committee was concerned there is they've taken a decision on the preferred route but we did as i've just referred to in the earlier work er we did assess that erm and that showed again er that the traffic wouldn't transfer from the a sixty one onto a southern bypass and a inner northern relief road
well mr sorry
i'd just like to comment on this matter
name please
george
speaking this time for residents' association
i'd like to comment on this matter of the relationship between the western relief road and a possible inner northern relief road
i have tried to e ascertain which particular diagram in this report mr was quote quoting from
i think i i've found the report er the particular map
if i have e i have to say that i don't think that the particular version of the inner northern route had its junction with the southern bypass moved to the west
which would obviously be a necessary change to make if it was going to relieve the western bypass
that's my understanding but it is based on UNK t right
so i think there could be some improvement there
m more importantly the technique which is used for UNK traffic flows which the county council ha have used
u uses what is called an all or nothing assignment
which means that it UNK all the traffic to the shortest route
er the cheapest route i should say it's an UNK of erm travel time and cost
now if it so happened that the a sixty one was seen as a marginally shorter route then the model would have sent all the through traffic along the a s sixty one and none along around the bypass
it wouldn't have taken as mr has pointed out any UNK of the fact that there's difference for different times of the day nor would it have taken any account of the fact that people would perceive the travel times and travel costs in different ways
that brings me onto another point which is made in the panel's submission that people have talked all the time about the limits of traffic management on the a sixty one as if the objective of traffic management was to get through harrogate quicker
now that's not what we are suggesting
if you made it a little more difficult for through traffic to go through harrogate that would encourage traffic to divert to whichever relief road that you had and it would achieve an environmental objective at relatively little cost
what i'm suggesting is that it ought to be possible to design an inner northern relief road with an appropriate junction and with appropriate traffic UNK in the centre of harrogate so that you can encourage a significant proportion of the traffic that would otherwise have used the western relief road to divert to the southern bypass and inner relief road
i cannot prove that but i do not think that the tests which have been carried out by the county council UNK that possibility
any comment mr
mr is correct in saying that er the diagram doesn't show er shows it on that line which clearly was the line was the comment point for all the inner routes at that time but as mr said
we did actually try as part of those tests although not reflected in that particular figure er moving it to see whether we could encourage that er a different effect
er and that wasn't the case
i think i think i go back to this point about i think in concept anyway i'm not happy about er a proposition that er that function is performed or i can see the disadvantages significant disadvantages in having the traffic er for both the a sixty one er and the a fifty nine c and its links into harrogate and knaresborough concentrated on that er on inner northern line
i can see real problems er on the a fifty nine for example of traffic coming back into harrogate or into knaresborough er from that er from that junction on the a fifty nine
it's far better in my view to have a f a more balanced er distribution of the traffic er that you achieve by having er a separate route for the a sixty one to the west
because it does mean then that traffic er on the western side of harrogate can get out to the western relief road as there's no need then to go on the urban roads in harrogate
and that wouldn't be the case er with er with some of the er with the option that's being put forward
i'm not asking for a lesson on highway modelling particularly at half past four in the afternoon but what's your reaction to what mr said about the way in which your model would perform in other words on an all or nothing basis when it's shorter it all goes that way
regardless of how much ongoing that way
yeah
or perceptions of how much time it takes
right
actually change
again in any traffic model there are pluses and UNK the UNK assumption is and it's a common techniques used in traffic models er for schemes of this type er that you do use all or nothing
there are other techniques
er traffic is spread around er in that the area is divided into a number of UNK so when you talk about er shortest route and all traffic being assigned then certainly in terms of the a lot of the local traffic and the through traffic in terms of where it's loaded into the model each individual journey between a and b between each zone a and each zone b is loaded onto its shortest point
but there are a lot of a to bs loaded onto the network
er and therefore the overall effect is a more of spreading the traffic than simply it all appearing on one route
having said that in the case of a of a of a through movement i accept that we are loading at the traffic in at the a sixty one if you like and it's coming out at the a sixty one north
and therefore there can be a more marked effect as a result of this all or nothing technique
er clearly when we have got that situation we don't just simply put the numbers in and press the button and you get the answer out at the end er the people who er did this for us at the time er are professional er transportation consultants er and given that the key er one of the key UNK from this model was the effect of a er a bypass then this is something that we looked at in some detail as well as er the actual effects that the model was putting out
now you know having said that i accept that if we did a peak hour model and an off peak model we would have shown different effects
it's a more broad brush UNK approach
that we that we have to look at these at this stage of the scheme
mr
george s sorry
i want to say er t two things
i think chris and i are in agreement e about the technical issues here
erm i'm simply saying that there is a possibility of a an inner relief road taking some of the traffic an inner northern relief road taking some of the traffic that might otherwise have remained on the a sixty one
and not a technical matter but a policy matter i think that the UNK of it doing that could be er increased by traffic calming measures on the a sixty one to make it take longer to go through harrogate that way
however what i want to emphasize is that residents' UNK case is not does not rely on an inner northern route acting as a an alternative to a western UNK route
the main part of residents' association case is that the amount of relief afforded by any western relief road does not justify the environmental damage which that road will cause
i respect er the view that was put to me in the extract from p g twelve but i nevertheless think that this is a matter of principle because it doesn't apply to a particular res western route it applies to all the western routes
it is the association that all the western routes cause severe environmental damage
mr
terry residents' association
er two points one comes onto environment for mr who says that they are seeking for the environmental benefits to the a sixty one and relates something to the percentages
erm i don't understand and all of that but what we quickly did we assessed the seven thousand er and the actual environmental benefit means instead of a vehicle every three point five seconds on the a sixty one there'll only be one every four point eight seconds
and i would like to ask and if you know anything about the UNK of harrogate the second er most attractive feature of this town after the UNK is in fact
a UNK with a superb wo wood face to is with many footpaths through it
the present road and i don't want to get into the detail of it but relate it to environmental costs against the so called benefits would in fact cut right through there with a UNK and it would actually start of on something like a twenty seven foot UNK er a twenty seven foot high UNK and with a fifty four deep cutting
and what i would like to ask in this environmental age that we live in for a benefit to the people on the a sixty one for a vehicle every four point eight seconds instead of every three point five seconds using your own figures how can you justify and quantify the cost of the environmental damage that will be done to what is regarded as the UNK visual attractive side of harrogate
valley UNK and right next to in fact in this particular line i have to say this next to gardens which is a both an international and national recognized er facility in this er in our UNK in our town which attracts many visitors
and would be seriously undermined by any proposed road that will come in on the western side
and i just don't know mr chairman how they quantify that kind of benefit in traffic flows on the a sixty one which is what they're trying to claim against the environmental impact
notwithstanding we do not believe as we've already said that flows of traffic justify and coming if i may er before mr answers to give him time to think about it to the figures from mr
he quotes that in fact the accuracy of their predictions and forecasts would suggest that they are
and i again don't understand these figures because i take from table two and i see the a sixty one er reading going from twenty four thousand to nineteen thousand on the opening of the bypass
i also find that he's been quoting some twelve hour figures and the only ones i have you may have them er mr chairman are from the h and t c report in july of last year where they UNK four thousand nine hundred on the a six five eight and achieve eight UNK for nineteen ninety six and achieved eight thousand one hundred now
a sixty percent increase of traffic on the a six five eight
those don't seem to UNK with suggestion of the tight close UNK of your figures
in fact finally on the actually opening of the complete phase the er the increase on the six five eight was on the completion at that lower section was in fact a sixty percent increase from six thousand to nine thousand
mr are you going to pick up the first point and then mr
cer certainly chairman david harrogate borough council
clearly it's very difficult to er to be very specific about this sort of thing
after a after all what we're talking about is what er a subjective assessment
erm our members and the county members have come to a judgement and a decision based on all that information all the information that you have just mentioned to this e i p
we we've looked at the implication of a r a western route
we've looked at the benefits that would accrue from providing traffic relief along the a sixty one corridor
w that has all been UNK as best it can through all the various reports and very detailed information that's been provided for members
and they've come to a judgement on those issues and their judgement is that erm they s should support the principle of a western route
i can't really say any more as to how they themselves have come to come to their particular judgement but that is the judgement of the members
mr chairman
yes mr
terry
i take it that you're not UNK then that the change in the traffic flows that i've indicated would actually what would be achieved
well i don't dispute i've no information myself
i'm not i don't necessarily want to dispute them erm all i would say is that we have to look at the implications don't just look at the change in the traffic flows and take them as a as a point you have to look at the implications of those changes in traffic flows
my understanding is that change of traffic flows along the a sixty one through harrogate and knaresborough will or through harrogate anyway will allow significant improvements to the environment to be to be UNK through for example erm pedestrian er UNK on the roads through i er allowing er pedestrian er priority areas
we can look at erm increased public transport use of UNK lanes that sort of thing
so th there is plenty of scope erm to look at improvements for pedestrian cyclists and the im environments in general
very difficult to quantify them at this stage but certainly it's my advice that er there will be distinct improvements in the environment
are you sorry terry residents' association
erm are you saying then that erm you have actually UNK and related that in some way to the damage which has been evident through all of the statements from harrogate borough council to in fact the n y c and acknowledged by the n y c of the environmental impact that this will have
er that all of that has actually been UNK in financial terms to be expressed against the simple value of the gains that you're talking about
and if i may mr chairman something that's happened in the last few days that's er evident that er the been the first satellite survey in this country ever which is now beginning to show to the nation just in fact the damage that roads have been doing and that there's in fact now some suggestion from government that they may be UNK some elements of these roads because the environmental impact has not really been taken into account as effectively before
no i'm saying precisely the opposite david harrogate borough council
it's very difficult to quantify those sorts of effects and er to members and the decision makers have to come to a judgement as best they can given the information that's before them
i take the point mr i don't think you're going to get a different answer from mr on this one
mr do you want to come back on mr 's comment about traffic flows
yes
on the traffic flows yes
i mean i just if i can just add to that er last debate about the effects in terms of er vehicles every so many minutes or seconds
er clearly what we're saying is that there would be a thirty percent reduction on the a sixty one either side of the town centre
that i is a significant reduction in traffic flows
erm one of the points that hasn't been mentioned in terms of the benefits discussed earlier is that the forecasts are that n because of the horrendous accident record of the a sixty one that transfer of thirty percent of the traffic onto a high standard modern and much safer road will result in a reduction in between seven hundred and a thousand people er being injured on the a sixty one during the thirty year er UNK of the western relief road
that is the forecast in the papers
that is a substantial benefit er to the community
and that includes our estimate based on current statistics between fourteen and seventeen UNK
just on the on the figures er sir in terms of table two er that mr refers to the er the figures for the a sixty one i think there perhaps is some confusion here
you'll see that we have attached a diagram er which shows the location of the traffic counts that mr i think is referring to in table two
here is a diagram that shows the locations and you'll see that on the a sixty one we have three er permanent traffic counters recording traffic flows
er five six and seven
five is to the north of killinghall and you'll see from the table attached table two that er prior to the opening of the phase one of the UNK it was opened in two phases between the a sixty one and the six one in the southern half was opened first
and then the final bypass was completed
you'll see that at point five er there was very little change on the in the a sixty one flow er following the opening of the bypass this is some months er afterwards
erm at point six which is in the centre of harrogate again you'll see there was virtually er no change in five hundred vehicles a day in twenty one thousand
er and the point that er mr 's referring to as point seven which is the a sixty one
now the reason for the five thousand reduction there is that there is traffic or there was traffic that previously er came up the a sixty one but then went along UNK road which is the road you'll see on the plan which UNK the southern bypass and that is why up that very short section er there was this reduction er which was heading for points to the east which clearly went on then to the southern bypass
but in terms of the effect of a western relief road it's clearly is more critical is the flows in the centre of harrogate and to the north
as to whether of this longer distance traffic was being diverted around the southern bypass
the other point on the increase in the a six five eight six five eight UNK is at point thirteen er yes there has there was an increase of three thousand vehicles a day er on that road with the opening of the southern bypass
that clearly has proved to be attractive from other routes outside this immediate area with the opening of the southern bypass
so sorry i'm looking at the wrong the UNK that is the southern bypass
yes the flow sorry point thirteen and fourteen thirteen is on the southern bypass i thought mr was referring to another flow which
no
we don't have in this table it's on the a six five eight
you were referring to tw sorry you were referring to twelve hour flows which
mm
part of the documentation i received so i presume you're UNK it from the h and t report of the second of july nineteen ninety two
ninety three rather
which is the only twelve hour you actually quoted the eight thousand figure earlier on
er it was something that you brought in into the discussion so i
about the through traffic er element
no
i was talking about twelve hour because the surveys that we did in eighty nine were
yeah
twelve hour base and were
so that's in
figures i was quoting
sorry
so in response you said that they were for accuracy and i pointed out to you that at site thirteen there was a sixty percent error from your forecast for three years hence nineteen ninety six and what is in fact being achieved at this very moment in time
so it quite clearly there's traffic going on to there that doesn't with what you're saying
er yes we with the prediction phase one we didn't predict the partial opening of the bypass clearly before we did it that was just how it happened in practice
the forecast of there was nine thousand on the er bypass when it was completed fully to the a fifty nine
so it's not the six thousand figure that that's not really relevant as i see it to the debate about the forecast because that was simply a partial opening the bypass
mr chairman er terry again from
er mr has referred to site number five which was the a six one north of killinghall and because we've already had this discussion i would presume the inner relief road would have dramatically changed those figures there
the inner relief road would have changed the figures
erm i'm not sure
well it's north of killinghall and therefore travelling in towards the town seeking to go round is what you're saying
if you had the inner relief road those figures would in fact therefore change quite dramatically in the same way that the a sixty one figures have changed
well the fact that we had certainly at point six which is in the centre of the urban area which is where we clearly we're mainly concerned about is where most of the accidents for example are happening
erm the effect was that er on the assessment we did at the time that it wouldn't have affected flows on the a sixty one in the centre of harrogate
that was the assessment that we that we did it didn't show any effect on that er on the a sixty one critical part through the urban area
i think the point that mr is making if i read him correctly is that is you had an inner relief road in fact it would UNK off traffic from the a sixty one going south from say the killinghall bypass or relief road
and wouldn't w and could be UNK round the network
that's the point isn't it mr
it is indeed mr
i thought we'd covered that one actually mr
i'm sorry
yeah it's alright
er before you come in mr erm i don't know how many more points you want to raise on this to erm we have another session which starts at five thirty
so mr and then mr
thank you
george residents
i want to start by UNK again that er i consider that the amount of traffic relief afforded to the a sixty one would be relatively low
given that it's relatively low the small adjustments that i'm about to talk about assume greater significance
the county council has always said that the western relief road would produce a reduction of thirty one percent in the amount of traffic on the a sixty one immediately north and south of the town centre
however what i have done is to use detailed assignment UNK given to me by the county council it's erm these things here to look at the changes in traffic flow along the whole length of the a sixty one between its southern junction with a proposed western relief road and its northern junction with a western relief road
and i have UNK out the changes over all the various sections of the a sixty one
and i calculate that the average change over the whole length of the a sixty one is a little lower at twenty seven percent it's not a lot though it's a little lower at twenty seven percent
if we then take the effect which the southern bypass appears to have had on the a sixty one a two and a half percent reduction we are then down to something marginally under twenty five percent
i do not intend these figures to be taken as strictly accurate estimates clearly they can't be
they simply give some indication of the level of relief
in other words if there's nothing wrong with the modelling technique even then the level of re relief is perhaps something closer to twenty five percent over the a sixty one as a whole
i would like to in that context i would like to ask both mr and mr as question
in section six of my submission on behalf of residents i refer to the environmental impact of traffic flow changes on existing roads
and i draw on the same manual of environmental appraisal that erm mr has mentioned in his evidence the department of UNK manual
it in many instances it isn't specific about levels of traffic reduction which are significant
but it does mention them in at least two UNK one is when you're measuring noise when it says that changes of twenty five percent should be recorded
i accept that
it's very clear that's right at the bottom end of what they think should be recorded and until this recent manual p was published it changes that low were not recorded
secondly it says that for pedestrian UNK that changes have to be of the degree of thirty percent before they become s significant
now i have had er quite a lot of experience in the environmental analysis of er road proposals and their effect on existing roads
on the basis of that experience i think that the western relief road doesn't achieve very much environmental relief to existing roads
but i wouldn't expect you to take my word for it that's why i'm drawing on the department's manual which UNK my own experience
which seems to indicate that there is a bottom level of something like twenty five to thirty percent before the amount of environmental relief begins to be even slight
that's my reason for saying that i don't think the western relief road gives very much environmental relief to the a sixty one
would both mr and mr like to comment on that
who wants to bat first
mr
i'm very much aware i've not been saying my name each time i've been speaking but probably too late now
erm well the first point probably to make is that this er the manual that er mr refers to was only published in june of this year er and clearly in terms of the information that er has been put in the statement that was based upon the previous way of assessing the impact
having said that as mr 's pointed out in fact the new manual if anything er UNK the benefits more than it did previously because as you said previously it required a fifty percent reduction in traffic to register a one UNK change in noise levels which was s perceived to be significant
er it's now in this latest manual that's just been published is saying twenty five percent and clearly er the road UNK that so there is significant benefit as a result er in that measure of noise
and that's i'm sure to be welcomed
er whether it's er slight moderate or substantial er i is er i say is irrelevant but there certainly is significant benefit as a result of er of thirty percent reduction
er in terms of pedestrian UNK again the new manual er refers to thirty percent and i would certainly argue that er in the significant areas of pedestrian movement we have er we're getting er reductions of that er UNK
er i think er it's easy to talk about taking off two and a half percent here and there i could probably put forward a number of reasons why it could add on two and a half percent five percent to the figures and indeed i'd be very disappointed if at the end of the day we didn't achieve er greater reductions because once you get out long distance through traffic er whose prime purpose is to move from a to b as quickly as possible once you do that it gives you the opportunity then of bringing in the sorts of measures to improve pedestrian safety er to slow traffic down introduce traffic calming which you can't do on primary routes
but that this would no longer be a primary route that status would be on the new road
we would therefore be able to bring in other measures which we haven't UNK so far er but that is also the guidance that you should bring in not only nowadays you should not only look to build a bypass you should look to UNK measures within the urban area
and certainly the county council is committed to this transport package approach er and will be coming forward with measures in harrogate to make sure that the benefits of the bypass are UNK
so as i say i would expect to see these percentages significantly increased erm
i think er that's probably all i want to say
thank you
mr do you want to pick up a point
yes chairman i've not really got an awful lot to add to that
erm i think the key point there that chris brought out was that it does allow the opportunity for further traffic restraint measures in the town centre
and it's a very and these are historic this is a h historic town centre
very important to get the through traffic e and the traffic that's no right to be in the town centre out of the town centre so that you can in incorporate these new measures
just george just to respond to the two points that have just been made
i haven't made any adjustments to the figures to get them lower
the change from thirty one percent to twenty seven percent was just a calculation by using all the information not taking specific points on the network
in fact there are changes considerably lower than that o actually in the town centre
in front of me i can see one link in the town centre where the improvement would only be twenty one percent
the second point that i want to make is i'm not denying that the western relief road would bring some improvement and if the western relief road did not damage did not cause serious environmental damage i would not be arguing against it
i am arguing against it because on the one hand it brings about environmental improvements in the town centre which according to the latest published government information which as mr has himself said i is UNK th than we had published previously
even according to that it only brings about a slight improvement and yet the new road causes b in the words of the county planning officer erm the borough council's own officers and the county council's own environmental consultants causes severe environmental damage
that's the equation that i'm setting i'm setting up
severe damage from the new road against slight benefits on the existing road
thank you mr a point which you've made consistently UNK for the last hour
mr are these two UNK point because i would like to
er they are they are er with our conclusions at the end
erm the north yorkshire county council have made great play and we didn't know it was coming in until we got that information upon the public consultation document
in the consultation document that was first put out to the public in nineteen ninety one the public was only offered the yellow route
simple statement of fact it's there in document as part of your evidence
it wasn't a question of alternative routes the grey routes were wiped out said were not going to be considered
it is the yellow route and it is to provide a bypass
the second document that came out as a consultation document simply led with the evidence that you've pe that you achieve by simply suggesting to people there was only a yellow route
for maybe just a UNK at this moment mr chairman at this time of day it's rather like the carpet salesman saying to the lady which one do you want red blue or green not whether you want one or not
and i'm actually UNK the chief executive of north yorkshire county council there mr when on the two tier government
and i have to say that cos mr can't answer that is how the western community of harrogate felt when they saw the way that this public consultation document was led
and i don't want to wish to ask for them to answer that that's just the view of the whole of our community and it did prompt us and it's not on your records over a thousand signatures were obtained proposing in fact what i'm about to conclude with
on the en on the er environmental issue and the er assessments that have been made we didn't raise the question of development h b c did
they say it's not development led but if i can actually quote from all of these documents very quickly
five one new roads will remove constraints of poor excess on sites which may otherwise be acceptable in planning terms
five summary relieve the pressure for development on more environmentally sensitive sites elsewhere
i would actually ask the harrogate borough council where are these more environmentally sensitive sites in harrogate than the valley the UNK and the UNK
two three the new highway schemes may provide major development opportunities and for the two thousand and six town plan the county will allocate sites which could benefit from new road access
therefore what we are recognizing is that there would be developments on these roads mr chairman i would ask in fact in their assessments of their traffic flows and the environmental impact has any of that element been taken into account
besides just the impact environmentally of the road and besides the traffic flows you could get the generation of traffic that these roads in fact will bring with them development
er i'll do my conclusion at the en very end if want in my UNK
i think we've got there unless mr wants to make a response
erm yes i will i will chairman just very briefly
erm it has to be said that er new roads do o open up opportunities for development
we erm we've been discussing all last week the amount of housing that has to be accommodated in harrogate district and in north yorkshire as a whole
we will have to find erm sites for that new housing
if a new road is UNK proposed we have to look at the opportunities provided by that ro road
what we're not saying is that the development er the road is development led
or the need for the road is development led
we're simply saying is the new road does open up op opportunities within the urban area e even for the release of sites which are constrained by poor access and via the amount of traffic passing along existing road corridors
er there are two examples along the western route corridor of sites which i do refer to in the statement UNK at an army camp which er is expected to be UNK in the near future and queen UNK which has been vacant now for almost two years
erm finding new uses for those built areas is very difficult because of the constraints of access
the western route if provided along that corridor would help in that situation and would mean that er other sites which are perhaps open countryside don't have to be developed
thank you chairman
thank you
mr would you like to sum up
yes mr
er terry residents' association
we believe from the evidence that's been presented today that in fact the justification of a western relief road as a means of a primary route north along the a sixty one to the a one has not been made
we are doubtful that the benefits of the inner distribution onto other roads and into particular the b six one six two which is the only access onto the western relief road as currently proposed between the a fifty nine and sixty one would generate further problems onto a road which is only a two lane b road compared to an a l a road sorry and a three lane road that the environmental damage far UNK in fact the so called benefits that are being claimed which nobody's UNK is only a vehicle every four point eight seconds instead of every three point five seconds
for the UNK of the western side of the town
so it our recommendation that it is premature at this pro frozen moment of time particularly with the additional thoughts of the inner northern relief road to be considering in a structure plan a western relief road
and at this point in time we do not t think it's appropriate that be added in this amendment to the structure plan mr chairman
thank you mr
mr are you anything you feel applies to respond on or you feel you've stated your case
i think er i think the points er in terms of the of the initial statement and summary of the position covers er most of the points that have been made
and perhaps er what has come out that perhaps is not reflected either in my initial statement or in the summary is this point about UNK the benefits of the relief roads er through UNK measures within the urban area
clearly that is very important and will be pursued
er on the UNK environmental aspect i think it's worth UNK because clearly this is the major concern of both UNK and er the residents' association and er that the county council has and perhaps to some extent i think it's certainly the public consultations or the exercises i've been involved in at this stage in a major scheme has done far more work in trying to assess those effects than is normally the case at this stage in a ma major highway scheme
er the county council has employed specialist consultants in terms of landscape impact in terms of UNK effects in terms of archaeology in terms of agriculture
all that work has been done in addition to the traffic studies
er we haven't spent a lot of time talking about some of those things today but it's all been done
that information was made available in summary form to the public in the leaflets in more detail at the exhibitions
er many members of the public took advantage of the offer of the more detailed appraisal er and indeed came in to look at the detailed consultants reports
they were all made available to members er of both the county council and the borough council when they were making their decisions and they were fully aware of the impact these proposals would have
that's not to UNK the fact that there will be an impact clearly there will be
it's this difficult balancing exercise between those effects and the benefits of the road
er simply in terms of the impact there is a lot more work to be done on that and we would do that in t in developing the scheme and bringing it forward to the next stage to UNK the adverse effects er that come about as a result of er construction of new roads
thank you
thank you very much
can i remind you on once more about the please
can i just one final point there is e i did notice in my proof there was in typing there was one line i don't know if you noticed there was one line that was missed off the bottom of one of the pages and if i can er either give that to you
can you give it to the panel secretary
yes i will do yes
can i say from the panel's point of view thank you very much gentlemen for your contribution this afternoon
and mr for his attendance
and contributions
thank you
thank you mr
services
now we've got this year certainly it will succeed in years and pay the interest off that will re result in a any more money your own debt
the s a will be controlled as it is at present
i see us put into on that sort of thing
what we got a result over that
interest rates will go up
in the past when they've gone up under the conservatives we welcomed that thus UNK fourteen per cent money out of the market and as they said two million pounds against eight hundred thousand
that is going to change of course
as money goes up er you can you can negotiate figures
interest
well then that was at a higher level than at present but we're not going to take on at ten per cent interest
that's five or six per cent on the debt
so you're gonna pay more for that
the whole thing reminds me a little bit of each when i had to get my thousand pounds
you're lucky you got one
it says on it you can pay two hundred pounds or over three years or you can pay ten pounds
who decided mr chairman to pay the ten pounds you were lucky really you have to pay the two hundred pounds that'll be the
yeah well thank you chairman i i'm erm er i must admit i'm i am think long and er think deep really about er you know changes such as this but i also er have to run my own businesses and er i just er i think we have experienced a water shed it's UNK to some extent with the change of administration and then during the nineteen eighties we had to a boom in this county we had the opportunity and i never er ever er been against that principle of er of er using our actual receipts we have hidden reserves we talked about the reserves of twenty nine million pounds here for the er erm we have er assets of twenty nine million in an earlier paper
and then we all know that er considerable assets there which are there and we're very grateful for them we are in a very fortunate position
but we have interest rates at the lowest rate they've been well in my memory really in terms of er my time in business and they may even go down a further one per cent
er and that UNK as well with er unfortunate situation where we've erm
we're still in the in the recession
i heard that er parts of the rest of the u k property prices have risen over the last year er but ours have actually not risen at all
in fact they've gone down
lincolnshire and humberside and so er i've no doubt in my mind that there will be opportunities available to us er through further capital receipts in the UNK future
but those won't er if we were to take UNK those in now it would be probably taking half of what we might get for them in the future and from a business proposition there is a time when even if you have money in the bank there are times when it would be very UNK to take long term interest rates at low interest rates and i think er this is er perhaps the best opportunity that we have
er also we don't forget that er we whilst people say to me er we had a good year on the p s g last year and we've had some good settlements perhaps over the year better than average in the east midlands on the p s g but we have so much catching up to do
we're light years behind some of those areas where the spending has been at a much higher level
so we don't want to be any under any UNK about that and the same can be applied to the fact that we have made no real provision for nursery education that we were in trouble over special needs in this county that was a requirement to restore services that were well below the s a on social services and we really all this er this er new administration has done has been brought those up those services up to what would have been regarded as a quite an unacceptable level with most of the authorities in this country
it's been a up in fact you've been living off the people in other words
really in terms of
providing and you've been living off capital in that way and i'm not prepared to do that but i do think there is strong case for borrowing er providing it's kept in that in er under control at this time and borrowing i may feel that we will be able to be in a much better position to take our capital receipts and use them UNK in the future
i have no doubt about it that the government are urging us at this moment er i am concerned about that they are urging us by the er
approvals to do to go down this road
i don't want to go down the road to the same extent that they've done when they put us into debt by fifty er fifty billion o just on one day but i'm sure that there is a strong case to look
and to pursue the options that are available to us and that's what i hope the treasurer will do er and this is all we're UNK at the moment and that an and to find out just what the how the land lies what the best position is what interest rates that we might be able to get and over what period and i er support this er this expense UNK budget
thank you mr chairman
er this is basically about fairness and equality
fairness the people who UNK to UNK now
er to UNK money on a project over that is going to last thirty forty years and expect the people today to pay for it
erm when their paying for it not necessarily with money but in some cases with their lives with misery
these are the things that they're having to pay for it with and the reason being is the social services in this county were a UNK low level and people were definitely suffering from it
the people of this county were suffering from it through crying because of the lack of crime prevention work being done by the previous administration because the money was all going one way
i'd like to ta look round this room
everybody has homes
how many people of the how many of you here today could actually pay for your home out of your income if you waited until you have sufficient income to pay for your home in its entirety the bulk of the people in this room even though there are yes some rich farmers still couldn't afford to have a home
these are the types of things that you have failed to look at
central government is encouraging us to borrow and i was pleased to hear councillor on UNK actually accept that borrowing under f t c was acceptable
i didn't do anything i don't know what you are talking about
how ac you're unsure
i said well if governments daft enough to borrow that's their business i was
mr chairman er the actual words were s t d s t c's are a separate thing when we are borrowing on governments UNK
and that was his exact words
so he supports them borrowing but how many farmers in this country or in this county don't have a loan
i would think very few
we are looking for fairness and that is what we're going to deliver
perhaps i was saying too much
councillor UNK is the UNK price of our councillors with his horror stories
anybody that UNK money for a capital project is in is in the mad house
he should be in the mad house which worries me because i to follow the point that councillor UNK made
i borrowed a modest amount to buy my house that i could easily meet within the finances that i'm getting at the moment
and that's all the same that the county council are going to do
they're going to lend money for long term projects and the people of lincolnshire who benefit through those projects for years to come will be paying UNK for years to come
that way we are providing those front line services that councillor taylor picked upon and councillor UNK mentioned such as social services that had been that literally been UNK by the previous administration to pay for their capital projects
we will put in the front line services such as social services
i hope we will borrow very UNK it'll be affordable we're not UNK we'll be doing what the majority of people in this country do borrow within their limits for the things that they need for the future such as a home or a car something like that
it's nothing to be frightened about it's not something new as been stated
borrowing is does not re is not a new thing for us
we do that in terms of capital control for UNK and computer services and it's interesting to note that we don't class as a debt free authority so what we have is a number of scare stories from UNK over there which is irresponsible
this is a sound tool in our management UNK and i recommend it
good job this meeting's being recorded mr chairman
we should have a play back in four years time
councillor
thank you mr chairman it it's certainly very interesting this morning er listening to the various points that have been put forward by er the new administration
erm all speaking with an air of running business managing finance and er how we haven't managed in the past because this is what our actual
it is really it's a philosophy isn't it over the last how many years you don't have this philosophy about being in fear of long term debt in this authority
i don't think capital not the way the average them that work
better to be in philosophy than have the facilities which has greatly benefited the charge payers and the people who think right across the board
right across the board
i mean i find it i find it quite amusing when some of the er labour people their services
i travelled the country well i've been in other authorities both labour controlled been in to schools been in old peoples homes erm seen their roads or driven over their roads and i can assure you that er in lincolnshire
i think you know lincolnshire has done a dam good job for the people in lincolnshire whether it in roads whether it be old peoples homes or whether it be in schools whether it be in fire stations police stations i admit to where one could say across the board they could compare that they could compare they might compare they might live in one area and work in another
one could go into UNK and some of the various levels of development what they have got
UNK roads and you know very well that they don't compare to lincolnshire roads county boundary
you go into various parts of the er south west where their labour control and you look at the state of their buildings and you think my god what on earth have the elected members been doing when you actually see the level of rates that they have set
and then i mean the amount of long term capital debts they all got
erm it it's a matter of whether you want to spend today and pay later or whether you want to continue a philosophy is mainly in the majority of lincolnshire vote that if you want something you pay for it
if you haven't got the money you go without
now we are providing above average level of services year on year on at below average er average expenditure
for the simple reason that we have no debt to finance we have no debts to finance and if we'd listened to you over the years on our UNK surplus land and property
selling off the family silver
the times that has come out of your mouths
selling off the family silver and look what we're gonna have to do with that year you have UNK those for setting up the various units and giving them target for
you have UNK those for looking after councillor UNK i didn't talk when you were talking and i thought you'd want to listen to what i'm saying because er i think you could learn a lot
er i was hoping you
mr chairman i take to a conclusion
mr chairman if this for UNK of these and if you look at th the papers of the budget this year er because of conservative policies don't improve you haven't actually inherited about ten million pounds coming in to your budget during the year
now you have been spending since may like water
you have UNK you have spent and you actually spent more than we've got in some instances
you make commitments for next year as if money had gonna be no object
you your UNK the government is not giving you as much grant as you would like
you'll have to remember that the that the er increase from last year it's an increase it's not a cut not talking about cuts
there is no reduction from central government from last year to from this year to next year and you have been totally unrealistic the two of you the labour and the liberal parties after may erm we've gotta this we've gotta that
as if money would just come whenever you open your mouths
you are at last UNK the UNK of what you set out to do
and as councillor said
here we are in a matter of what eight to nine months of UNK a well financed a well run an effective efficient organisation with a reasonable amount of na balances
with a capital investment fund and yet here you are trying to have to borrow to be able to manage next year
i think it's an absolute disgrace
i think it's a sad day for in lincolnshire and you know if you start as i think councillor said to er agree with this er proposal today it is it will be the first sod and the last hole which you will be digging and it'll be the charged back to lincolnshire at the end of the day who are happy to on it
thank you for that
right i think er everyone's had a good say from both sides and i would like to sum up and put it to the vote
erm really its a question of do we borrow or don't we borrow
that's what we've been asked this morning
it's also being raised by other conservatives they wouldn't have started from here
and the question i've been asking myself of this is that erm where did we start from
when we took control we inherited an UNK capital programme
now that capital programme was at erm fifty two million i think it was thereabouts
which would be UNK in the pre election year which was for obvious reasons
would you allow me please
you know i've allowed you all to speak and i do expect the courtesy of
i'm sorry councillor UNK i expect the courtesy towards the chair and i am now summing up so please be quiet
what did we inherit i say we inherited that and also we have inherited er an s a to us that you would have inherited the conservative at some ten million short of what we needed
now i want to refer to that because this is fact
the increase in the education s a nationally by one point eight per cent
lincolnshire only receive nought point five per cent increase
that was a loss to lincolnshire county council fact of one point eight million
the area cost adjustment which the er government takes out of the total s a's of some two hundred million has gone to the south east i hope none goes to westminster and that has cost us one point three million
in the distribution of care in the community the money for that with the
s a reduction compared with the amount we received in ninety three ninety four through the special UNK grant we got a reduction there two point two million
this fact
it's been mentioned i think it was councillor mentioned about the he was pleased to see that we got two million pound in interest receipts against the eight hundred thousand that was envisaged
but within the s a the government expected us to have three point nine million receipts
that is a loss of two million
also we've been arguing our claim for the UNK factor in other words the national reduction of one hundred and sixty one million in ninety four ninety five compared to ninety three ninety four for the UNK factor
one point six million
now whether you like it or not and you're not in our position because we er prepared to manage this authority you would have had that same reduction to find and i did hear councillor and he was also referring to capital spend the other day saying he could have found ten million
i've also heard councillor er being er quoted in the press as saying that he could find the money for capital schemes
i think one was out at UNK
so that where we're at this point in time
now councillor refers to whether the time was right and why should we have to borrow
well as you're aware our philosophy our policies are to protect and improve services and a lot of our services when we came in with our initiative we started from a nil base on some of the provision and we are not prepared to stand by and see UNK of any of the services if it is UNK possible
so the decision is whether we borrow to protect those services that's to the elderly to the school children to education and to try and enhance our road system
er then this is a decision we have we want flexibility
the interest rates are low at the present time
the climate is right and we believe it could be sound financial management in a very difficult situation it's been referred to should we borrow
the majority of the county council's in this country borrow money
er i think it was councillor who referred to er looking at your own household budget
i look at my er occasionally i borrowed money over my lifetime and managed to acquire a capital receipt a property
and most of us do that and that is the situation that we're in at the present time
and we're not in doing not intend telling you at the er proposals we will put in the budget but i can give you an assurance at this point in time that we shall be borrowing money
and the er detail of that will come out when the proposals are put to the policy and resources committee
so i support er the recommendation for the change in the er treasury management policy er statement and i formally move this to be adopted by this committee
i second that
i second that
mm
seconded
all those in favour of that please show thank you
one at the back there would you count please
eight chair
and against
six
seven
would you please register that the er conservatives vote against it
do all the conservatives agree with that statement
agree
thank you
thank you
er that is carried
didn't have to answer the questions
i'm sorry i'm moving on to the next paper
questions
i'm sorry that paper is finished with
we're moving on to the next paper
the next er paper
i have to move that under section one hundred a brackets four the local government act nineteen seventy two
the public be excluded from the meeting for the following items on the grounds that they involve the likely UNK of exempt information as defined in paragraphs eight and one of part one of schedule four a of the i so move er paper g and i believe we've got oh i'm sorry morris
thank you chair
this paper that set out the excuse me the paper set out the details of the i t capital code goes on to ninety four five
it's the result of a big process by individual departments erm it is set out on the basis of departments priorities
it is shown in the priority all round the department
the UNK presented in two parts
the first one is the standard format we use on the getting the information through
the second part i thought might be useful to members in explaining in more detail what each of the schemes were about
the general customer paper is to build on the information structures that we've got and to actually make the information more available internally and UNK to the authority and also to make use of new technology wherever that is possible
erm that's all i want to actually say in view of the
you have this paper before us
any questions or observations
erm yes mr chairman
erm certainly it's a most interesting paper and er certainly i think in the county we're doing very much er think ever possible
er a knowledge but erm i would have to move that we cannot accept this recommendation because it's not that we don't er support the scheme within this paper but it's that we cannot accept
and maybe you want to know what
and what would happen to the programme it would be wrong at this point in time to accept the paper before one knows what the is of the county council as a whole will be
erm no
your moving and so that's a direct negative
thank you
any other comments
no
i'll put it to the vote
do you agree with the recommendations on the paper
chair
against
six chair
good
thank you
that is er carried

and secondly a temporary UNK loans for recruitment purposes where an employee moves from another area to accept a post
i call upon the director of legal services

no one will be allowed to stay or return until the building has been checked
i know that members will share my sadness at the death of mister the former managing director of the
mister was associated with the theatre from its very beginning in UNK when on the opening night he was there as a UNK until his retirement in UNK
in the words of general manager of the UNK section without management and dedication the would not have survived to become the major force in british theatre that it is today
i represented the council at mister funeral service
would members please rise and stand in silence in memory of mister thank you
joined the borough council as chief assistant at museum in UNK
at local government reorganisation in UNK he was appointed as the field officer to set up the UNK biological UNK
since that date under his leadership his team have established an outstanding reputation providing an UNK consultancy service to local authorities water th water companies the national coal board and private companies
its work ranges from soil analysis to civil engineering firms to drawing up green plans for local authorities
now UNK advisory service has been recognised in the birthday UNK list by the award of the m b e his service can be UNK up in his own words
it gets me closer to my ultimate goal doing all i can to enhance the environment we live in
mister is here with us today
and i am sure that members would want to join me in extending UNK congratulations to him on his well deserved award
i would like to extend a warm welcome to the two south UNK who are attending UNK today's meeting of council
and are
are on three months' placement with on a three months' placement with the authority until the middle of september as part of a six months' training programme organised by the south african advanced educational project

ha
item five inspection of internal documents
i call on the director of legal services
there've been no complaints against restrictions lord mayor
item six which are petitions
i move the petition to be presented from persons requesting the council to provide facilities for a community centre and youth club at the be received
is there a seconder
all in favour please show
that is carried
will the p UNK please come forward i would welcome you to the meeting
you sp can speak for not more than five minutes
however take your time
please start when you're ready
thank you
lord mayor members of the council
i and my colleague thank you on behalf of the people in for this opportunity of presenting our case for acceptance of this petition
past UNK however make us sceptical about receiving a positive response from a body who on past performance have been UNK in the provision of services and facilities for the community of
contrary to public belief is not a UNK of but an expanding community in its own right UNK of facilities and services afforded to others under your jurisdiction
consequently in the limited time UNK i will endeavour to emphasise how important such facilities and services are to the community
the teenage element of the community have one inadequate youth club which does not have the facilities to provide the required range of activities and no amount of proposed refurbishment will UNK the majority to attend a club which is badly situated and of dubious reputation
has a youth problem
drugs glue UNK under age drinking and the like are very UNK amongst the older teenagers and their influence on others a cause for concern
certain residents are continuously subjected to unnecessary UNK behaviour and areas of the village frequently UNK
complaints go UNK and complaints are
whilst this is obviously a concern it can be acted upon but the influence on others who have nothing else to do far more damaging
the other end of the spectrum is the equally large population of elderly and retired people of the village who quite simply have nothing
the part of the estate purchased by the then village council in nineteen hundred and five for the benefit of the village would provide a home for a community centre and youth club which properly run and organised would be a considerable asset to the village
proper liaison with schools and other groups within the village and the UNK of other premises would enable these problems to be resolved
the premises are currently occupied by the community college who by their UNK of the ideal non political club for gentlemen of the village prompted this action
the local council in nineteen hundred and four had the courtesy to call a rate UNK meeting to discuss the proposed acquisition of the estate and with the approval of the meeting proceeded with their purchase
the college apparently with your approval are proceeding with the UNK of the club against the wishes of the members local parish council community council and the residents of the village
rather than lose a small but integral part of the community the petition was raised to obtain facilities which would be of benefit to the community
we suggest that the UNK is an UNK politically motivated empire building exercise of no benefit to the village
the college have stated that they require the room to UNK the attendance of disabled students and or UNK classes
the facts are UNK classes are not on the syllabus facilities for the disabled are highly UNK but not practical in premises where most classes are held in upstairs locations
the was occupied against the wishes of the village by the college with no improvements to premises considered unsafe and too dangerous to be continued to be used as a public library
the proposed courses for the next term confirm that the college will be only using fifty percent of the available time and space for eight months of the year
would you accept this situation when your village is desperate for facilities and services to enhance community activities and lifestyle
the college cannot justify the use of its facilities let along expand its activities as it has neither the resources or required support facilities
it is highly likely also that the majority of courses will continue to be under UNK
the council should UNK its UNK and without political prejudice serve the best interests of the communities under their charge and take the following action
close the college try and absorb the classes into the adequate facilities or re UNK elsewhere in the village in council owned premises that are more suitable have been extensively UNK and if required UNK the expansion of the college curriculum
two UNK the UNK of the club
three permit the UNK to be used as requested
in conclusion it should be obvious that the people of the village oppose the UNK of its community facilities and that their needs are far greater than that of an UNK empire builder
thank you
thank you

moved lord mayor
is there a seconder
now then we'll move to the speakers
councillor
thank you lord mayor
in UNK at the labour party conference they adopted a motion moved by that gave and i quote the right to all forms of medical attention and treatment to a national health service
this was finally achieved on the fifth of july UNK when the labour government implemented the UNK report
it's worth recording that the conservative opposition voted against a national health service bill in fa february UNK
the birth of the national health service was also the birth of the conservative opposition to a free health service
hear
the only difference between then and now is that in UNK the conservatives were more honest
now they hide their intentions regarding the health service behind the word reform
reform of the health service has been rejected by the british people
every poll every questionnaire has proved this
in a recent questionnaire on a hospital trust in ninety percent of the medical staff the medical staff voted against the implementation of a trust
conservative ministers have explained this by saying that the questions are loaded
however the newspaper asked a simple straight forward question are you in favour of a self governing trust
the response was three to one against
the government know what the people want
they are choosing to ignore it just as they did with the poll tax
hear
the UNK lack of confidence in the national health service is in direct proportion to their lack of confidence in the government's promises
they know that yet another public asset is about to be UNK off with more promises of greater efficiency and better public service
the same things that were promised for the gas electricity and water but in UNK reality the only section to gain are the fat cats at the top who have recently been given it's UNK pay increases
hear
talking of benefits the benefits said to accrue from a trust can be achieved under the present arrangements
those are not my words those are the words of mister who made a presentation to social services on behalf of the trust
in his view it would not happen as easily or as quickly but the key point is it could happen while maintaining the status quo
when mister presented a case for the trust the main point of the proposal seemed to be that the application is only being made to prevent being UNK by the or trust
he freely admitted that if the present government continued would be completely UNK up by UNK
at a time when is moving nearer to UNK the people and UNK decisions the implementation of a self governing trust is moving policy in the opposite direction
it's putting a power into the hands of UNK directors picked by the government just as they pick their friends to head up the UNK national industries
councillor has been very UNK about a select committee
he has said there is no need and his group is against the proposal
well we would expect his group to be against it
his group are against accountability
his group are against area panels and neighbourhood UNK where k people can be heard and their views taken into account
his group are not for listening they're for telling people
something else therefore it's for selling especially public assets and they get two pluses in that
they gain the money but public accountability for those services
once facilities are transferred to a trust the ability of local communities to influence decision making virtually UNK
previously health authorities were required to consult over the closure of any facilities
this g this safeguard UNK once the facilities are managed by a trust
it is that gap that the select committee will fill
we'll not allow these UNK tory supporters to keep the public in the dark
the select committee will be a focal point for patients potential patients and their relatives
as i said at the beginning the national health services was born in UNK through the efforts of the labour party the first comprehensive free health service in the world
for forty three years it has been the UNK in the crown of the labour party legislation and for forty three years the labour party has UNK the national health service against all UNK
by the british people we will continue to fight any attempt to send the health service the same way as the gas electric and water
lord mayor i so move
thank you lord mayor
i suppose i ought to start by saying what's up doc
because i think the first question to ask is just what is this all about
what is this trust status all about
why is it being pursued
what's the reasoning behind it
now if we are talking about community health services let's just examine what those words actually mean
first of all services the last word there
well of course you can make profit from services
the private sector makes a lot of profit from a lot of different services provided but that's not my idea of what public services are or should be
and don't forget we're told time and time again almost ad UNK that this is to remain a public service within the national health service
so just tell us how does that fit in
how does it all tie in when you look at the requirements stated in the document to actually make a profit on the provision of health services
now to make profit on the provision of health services to some people may seem UNK
to me it seems particularly UNK and when you look at the experiences in countries like america where it operates you'll see that we want no part of it in this country
but the return is required it's on page twenty seven of the document and how is it to be achieved
well if you look at the document it refers to the bureaucracy the UNK of the bureaucracy and how is it going to be done
four point nine of the trust submission well it's gonna be limit eliminated because the trust will be accountable to the secretary of state
now he's gonna be a very busy man this person if it is still a man who's going to make sure that all these trusts are acting in an accountable way and UNK all this bureaucracy
if he does it without any help i shall be totally amazed and i think that it's simply a facility to assume that there're gonna be reductions in bureaucracy simply by UNK because the record from the past shows that the reverse is the case
so where else are the savings gonna come from
well if you look in the document again there are some wonderful UNK in here er these changes will be implemented throughout the services page eight and it will result in increased UNK increased flexibility in staffing arrangements and in the general relationship to their employees
now what does that mean to you
i know what it means to me
jobs down the road that's what it means to me
now the next word is health because i've seen no strong reasoning no strong convictions that there's gonna be any advantages in health terms in UNK er as opposed to directly managed units
i am worried that some people will see this as a mental health trust and i am very disappointed that the emphasis has been placed there and not on services such as the district nurse service which gets UNK coverage within the document
but lastly i'd like to come to the word community about which i feel so strongly
one of the advantages so called
did not involve the appropriate bodies like community health councils or the trade unions
it's conclusions we're not subject to consultation but we're instead given wide and extensive publicity in a series of elaborate video UNK with information UNK down
but no notice was taken of information or opinion UNK up
the changes that're taking place whether or not hospitals opt out are changing n h s culture
managers will no longer concentrate on the provision of good quality care but will in will br but will UNK in the nightmare of UNK agreements and a UNK with costs
in those hospitals that opt out there will be even more pressure to drive down costs and with it the loss of quality care to potential loss of employment and poor returns and conditions of employment for those still employed in the trust
the trust makes no commitment to improve the serious levels of low pay
for years local managers have hidden behind a national agreement privately agreeing that pay levels or poor that they have no influence on the decisions made at national level
the staff are now not convinced that with the freedom now offered to managers to negotiate local pay bargain that these historic low levels of pay will improve
instead it is UNK that UNK of conditions may level down and not raise up
the health trust application has no mandate from the public it serves nor from the staff it UNK
the decision was made by senior managers and health authority members none of whom now have any local accountability
about twenty to twenty five percent of the senior cl UNK opposed the application and the percentage figure amongst other disciplines will be far higher and as has been said the main motivation to seek trust status is based upon a financial squeeze on with it's neighbours and also seeking trust status
for to remain as a directly managed unit would place a question mark on it's future
the self interest of the senior managers has promoted the interest in the trust application and not to a commitment to provide and maintain high quality care
reference has been made to planning that er the five to ten year cycle has er proved inadequate
that hasn't been because er authorities recently have been unable to assess medical and clinical needs but through a lack of resources
in future i believe that planning will be worse because there'll be no sort of overview and that it will lead to an over provision of the profitable services and inadequate provision of services like mental illness the elderly and those with learning difficulties
and the trade unions don't regard the n h s as a an employment exchange but what we do expect is consultation and involvement in those changes
and what we do oppose what we do oppose is not UNK but what we do want is quality care
in the recent experience of private contracts in the health service is no doesn't UNK of any great quality in the future
and itself has been a victim of that poor quality when private contracts were employed in the domestic service
so i suppose that really to say that we're not er involved in that we're not against efficiency
choice will be limited in the future as opposed to being better for the patients since UNK agreements will be dictated by the UNK and by the g p fund holders
there's no greater choice for the patients there
just to conclude i share the view expressed already by councillor that just as the issue of the elderly persons homes brought about the loss of control for the conservatives in be sure the health service will bring about the UNK of the conservatives in white hall

ah the poison UNK
what sweet draft
fourteen months ago we were told by all and UNK particularly the media that it would be difficult if not impossible to recover from the despair and the destruction of the era and yet here we sit today with a labour majority of sixteen the biggest labour majority since this council was formed
what a complete UNK of the UNK policies that were attempted to be brought in by the controlling group opposite
we have turned this council round reflecting as closely as possible the values that the community expressed in the local elections of may UNK and may UNK
the five themes that we've adopted in building a better will build on the progress we made in meeting the challenge and making the change
improving the quality of life
this year will see a visible improvement in the quality of life of people in the district
providing UNK shares will see the building blocks of the anti poverty strategy being brought into action
UNK local communities that's what really UNK the tories because what it means is they'll never be able to come back with those UNK and UNK policies that they brought in two years ago
creating positive partnership
the private sector UNK a great UNK of relief when the labour group was returned to power in this city
and supporting the social charter moving towards UNK rejecting the negative approach of the tory government towards social reform within the community
members of council will know that the objective of changing the culture of the council has gone because we've largely done the job
we've won widespread support both within the authority and outside with the voluntary sector with the private sector and with other agencies for our approach to UNK the city
but what of the opposition
UNK they been
what a UNK excuse for an opposite
we understand that was de UNK happy for quite some time and erm i know he's been disappointed recently with the tories losing control of the local council down in the happy UNK down south but the pink gin and pink UNK approach of councillor is becoming a joke
there's clearly there's clearly a no turning back group being formed on the tory back benches with those councillors who feel UNK after the night of the long knives
the opposition though feels nothing more than a tickle with a UNK obviously a pink one
even officers are UNK behind their hands as tory councillors pass by
one because they were UNK by councillor and his attempts to further his own ambitions and two because of the complete lack of direction which they have shown as a group under the leadership of councillor
that UNK approach is UNK in the amendment that we find before us today
stopping to personal attacks my
using information with no relevance to in my liverpool home
all i seek is to be judged on my record and the record of this group
i will deal with problems to the best of my ability and i ev have every respect for all other leaders who try and do the same particularly the leader of
the opposite is so UNK that i'm becoming UNK i'm developing a UNK councillor
i wonder what it could be
it must be the g b h tactics of your parliamentary candidates
despite tory attempts despite tory attempts to UNK the UNK over we have emerged into the UNK with building a better we will build a UNK future and i move the recommendation
councillor
thank you lord mayor
i certainly won't be controversial
i will end up on time
so i drink pink gin
i actually drink UNK bitter if preferred
what i don't do is pretend to be a socialist organise five hundred pound a head er ticket UNK as neil UNK does UNK and then have the UNK next day to go to on the nineteenth of july on the very day when saw what the labour group are doing to this city
when councillor and his party showed the care and concern they have for our staff when sixty members of our staff on that day attended a committee meeting of this council to see the labour leader open it and shut it without any debate whatsoever and walk out of the room
hear
quite UNK and showing what labour party has achieved
i think it was a pathetic UNK and what the papers we have in front of us that the labour party have prepared doesn't say are their achievements i am not surprised they have tried to hide
labour councillors vote for a hundred and seventy four pound per couple increase in community charge one of the biggest in the united kingdom
labour councillors charge community charge payers an extra seventeen pound each for those members of the public that they have UNK not to pay the community charge
hear
the UNK the UNK of a labour councillor in saying his principles mean he won't pay the community charge but his principles do not extend to not claiming over fifteen hundred pounds worth of expenses paid for by those people who are paying the community charge in
labour party say they want to tackle crime in and we have and i hope we will debate later on this agenda the situation where a labour chairman of the police complaints committee turns up a public meeting urging er law breaking and support for people who are not actually gone to trial an a the circumstances of the events really does not concern us but it's the fact that leaflets are now UNK this city printed by our old friends the resource centre urging people to join the defence committee which is supported by the university labour party is supported by the west labour party and is supported by the police complaints committee no less
now councillor thinks that it was just an accident and people will understand
people will not understand that
i am shocked
labour party have UNK
not a vote already
yes councillor will you keep to the subject under discussion and not involving a lot of personal abuse
of course i will lord mayor
i didn't plan to UNK from it at all for the rest of my speech anyway
well you have up to now
not drinking any of my gin lord mayor
labour councillors in have UNK social services have UNK on their promises to the people of when one of the biggest lies we've seen on any political papers in was that they would defend and not close elderly persons homes
labour councillors have set up over a hundred new council committee meetings an extra six hundred meetings a year and the hundreds of thousands of pounds that is gonna cost the people of not the community charge payers not the community charge payers but those people the elderly and the handicapped who are looking for services from this authority which the labour group will say we can't afford to provide cos the government doesn't send us enough money
and so UNK goes to
i'm glad you brought in the subject of the leader of the labour council er in which means i am not UNK and saying that mister and saying that mister is now running a moderate council
last week UNK stopped UNK taking mentally handicapped to schools in
last week adults waiting to go to a school for the adult mentally handicapped were taken there three hundred and fifty and only ten teachers were allowed into the school
at UNK hall which was UNK for two days UNK for two days by this now happy band of labour people in
UNK c councillor
i'm responding to the
no you are not
i am
you're now talking on UNK on a subject of the authority which is nothing whatever to do with us this afternoon
please come back to the sub matter under discussion
i certainly will lord mayor
be UNK sir
a o one tends to get confused lord mayor
if councillor wants to go and get a g b h UNK it tends to confuse us on this side of the er as to exactly what we are debating
councillor says he has turned this council around
the labour group have certainly turned this council around
they've turned it from a council that was determined to tackle the social deprivation in this city was determined to tackle the disadvantaged such as racial disadvantaged by supporting the c t c which gives a unique opportunity to asian children in this city for education
we are pleased to see that at least the labour party now are deciding that they can at last work with the government
the government's new city challenge initiative which we are all hoping will be accepted er on behalf of that they are willing to look at social partnership with firms although we have reservations about some of their proposals er in that area
yes they've turned this city round
yes they've turned the people in this district round from the way they were heading
there is now problems on the streets of there is anger in the outer areas that through your postal code politics people are not getting a fair deal in the outer areas of this city
hear
and what more what more should we expect from a party that is led nationally by a man who in UNK says there are no circumstances in which i would order or permit the firing of a nuclear weapon which leads somebody to say UNK lust for power is so great that he's prepared to ditch any principle to get it
and that's not from a conservative that's from the present chairman of c n d and wasn't a UNK that was last week
and we have a nuclear basement before you stop me what a UNK that was last week
he hasn't even the UNK to announce it public himself
he sends a runner UNK to announce it
that's UNK
that's labour politics
hear

mhm
well councillor
i UNK my right to speak to council members

councillor
hello
lord mayor people with disabilities UNK being UNK
they also UNK being called the handicapped
hear
what is more we hate being used as political UNK by cynical politicians
it's the ultimate insult when that politician belongs to a political party that throughout twelve years of government has washed his hands of any responsibility for the rights and aspirations of people with disabilities
lord mayor i really do not have the time to speculate in detail why councillor has made this mistake
one should say however in fairness to him that he's quite a UNK politician for a tory that is
after all when the waves of UNK threatened to roll up the m one and UNK local government in
all executive directors of the company together we'll answer any questions at the end of this short presentation
first the figures furniture UNK continues to be highly competitive so i am pleased to report that turnover for the twenty eight weeks was through to the twenty million five point five percent better than the same period in the previous year
operating profit for the period was twenty seven point four million compared with a pro UNK level of nineteen point four million last year an increase of forty one per cent
profit before tax which includes nineteen point six million pounds worth of profit from the sale of the group's investment in carpet right was forty four point one compared to a loss of twelve million for the same period last year
an extra share of five p of which two point two p relates to the exceptional period on the sale of carpet right shares giving interest net earnings per share of two point eight p
in a few moments i'd like to tell you briefly about the trading background to the figures and to give you an indication of how business has been since the period ended and particularly since our important sale started on boxing day
but first i'll ask our finance director to go into the figures in a little bit more detail
thank you good morning ladies and gentlemen turnover grew by five point five per cent during the twenty eight weeks the sixth of november to three hundred and twenty million there's been no inflation in our selling prices so all of this growth is from increased volumes particularly in UNK beds appliances and UNK
although the total retail trading area is unchanged at the period end there are in fact two different underlying elements new UNK has been laid down in france but this has been off set by a net reduction in the retail trading area in the u k the sales per square foot which UNK retail sales and is based on the waiting average trading area shows an increase of seven point two percent a low margin of fifty five point six per cent was down from fifty eight point five per cent in the same period last this was mainly due to a drop in house manufacturing participation and adverse exchange rates
gross margin was as we expected broadly level with the second half of last year
the reduction and payroll costs of five million or six point eight per cent reflects the staff reductions which took place last year these are efficiency gains primarily in areas of management and distribution
as a result of tight every day control costs other operating charges at seventy eight point seven million have fallen as the percentage of sales by point nine per cent to twenty four point six per cent and UNK in the period has fallen by two point three million to eight point four million
our sub UNK of surplus retail area has continued in the period and combined with a small programme of retail park developments will enable our retail area grow sorry will enable our UNK income to grow
indeed UNK income will be in excess of nine million pounds for the full year compared to seven million pounds for last year
combined effects of these initiatives has resulted in operating profits rising to twenty seven point four million compared with the pro UNK level of nineteen point four million last year which is an increase of forty one per cent
our net operating margins have risen from six point four per cent to eight point six per cent
there is a net interest charge in the period of three million which is a decrease of two point four million on the same period last year
this reflect the cash from the sale of the group's investment in carpet right together with low interest rates
the profit on ordinary activities with more taxation was forty four point one million compared to a loss last year of twelve million but of course these two figures are not comparable
this year's number includes nineteen point six million profit on the sale of carpet right and last year's number includes twenty four point seven million UNK and buy out costs
a more appropriate comparison is the profit before tax this year of twenty four point five million compared to a profit before tax last year of twelve point seven million an increase of ninety three per cent
the forecast tax charge for the year is thirty four per cent which is below last year's rate of thirty five and we expect this low rate to continue in the future
earnings per share in the period were five p but after taking into account exceptional carpet right gain this is reduced to two point eight p and UNK to last year's pro UNK earnings per share of one point four million which included losses on the closing down of our operations
the cash position at the period end showed net UNK of thirty nine point seven million which UNK to eight two point seven million at the same time twelve months ago
has fallen over this period from seventy eight per cent to twenty eight per cent
during the period net UNK have fallen by twenty one point eight million principally due to the twenty one point four million proceeds from carpet right
m f i traditionally has a stronger second half cash flow and net UNK are expected to fall further in the second half of the year
two other key elements were within our cash flow
first stock levels were increased by nine point three million in preparation for our important winter sale
secondly we UNK available a c t capacity in the group to obtain an early recovery of eleven and a half million of a c t and this would not normally have been recovered until january nineteen ninety five
capital expenditure for the period was fourteen point six million and is likely to be twenty five million for the year
although similar to last year's level of twenty three million you remember that last year's number included the purchase of four UNK properties for nine million pounds
you also know that on page nine of our interest statement we have created a non UNK special reserve against which we are writing off our good will reserve
this has created a capital structure more suitable for a listed company
thank you for your attention i would now like to hand you back to
thanks and i'll just outline the background to the figures that has just presented to you
during the period new kitchen UNK stores UNK and the UNK all manufactured by UNK were introduced into all out stores along with a number of improvements to our bedroom ranges
this will was completed in time for the sale period which began on boxing day
we opened a new store in christ UNK and UNK our north UNK site replacing the m f i store with a completely new one
two more stores will open in cardiff and UNK at the end of next month bringing the total number of u k stores to one hundred and seventy eight
these two stores will trade under the name of UNK and will operate as a testing ground for m f i's UNK business
they've been developed after considerable consumer research and will evaluate new products and new service ideas which if found acceptable will be taken up by the m f i chain
we've continued our programme of improvements to the m f i store design layout and presentation
seven more stores have been completely UNK and a further eighty four thousand square feet of surplus space has been sub UNK to other retailers increasing our UNK income by another half a million pounds
a new generation of a sell system has been successfully introduced into all our stores which UNK which UNK more closely the UNK distribution and manufacturing systems and raises the level of management information and control
our new customer tracking system is giving us detailed information on customer tracking flows and purchasing bands and as a result we're UNK staff working arrangements in all stores with a clear objective of increasing sales and improving customer service
these two important operational developments are now allowing our staff to make more productive use of their time enabling them to concentrate more effectively on serving customers and selling products
i am delighted to announce that we will soon manufacturing UNK at our UNK factory in UNK extending the range of products manufactured in house follows on naturally as m f i's position as the leading ah UNK of built in kitchen appliances
these new appliances will replace products imported from europe and will UNK in our stores from spring nineteen ninety five
finally i have to report that sales in france have increased by thirty per cent with like for like performance of six per cent on the same period last year
we now trade from forty eight locations in france with three more stores due to open in the second half of the financial year
to ensure that everybody's kept informed of our performance at regular intervals throughout the year we will in future announce our interim results in december make a statement in february on the winter sale performance announce final results in early july and give another trading statement at our a g m in september
today we're UNK an interim dividend of one point three per share er compared with the same period this year er sorry let me start that again
today we're UNK an interim dividend of one point three per share compared with one point two five for the same period last year
this decision takes into account the need to rebuild dividend cover whilst ensuring that higher earnings are reflected in increased income to share holders just excuse me one minute current trading
trading in the second has shown a clear improvement and since boxing day sales of fourteen per cent ahead of the previous year
in particular sales of kitchens and bedrooms have shown considerable increases and whilst we're pleased with the response to our new products we remain cautious on the outlook for consumer expenditure
now ladies and gentlemen if you have any questions we'll be happy to answer them for you can you just wait for the microphone because the guys at the back can't hear the question
right erm could you said that your payroll costs had come down by five million that's figure is it
yeah erm
sorry
have you got the figures there
yeah the payroll costs for the first half of last year were seventy three point eight million the payroll costs for the first half of the review were sixty eight point eight
right so it's for the half year sorry beg your pardon five million half year
that's correct yes
fine okay and how many employees do you now have
six thousand
six thousand seven the average number is a six thousand seven hundred and seventy four it's actually erm financial highlights and i'll just check give you the exact figure six seven four
right that's a UNK that's not
it is for equipment
that's equipment right and how's that compared with the previous period last year
well the year we had seven thousand five hundred and seventy nine
sorry could you repeat that again please
seven thousand five hundred and seventy nine and at the same period last year which is november nineteen ninety two we have seven thousand eight hundred and forty three
right erm could i just check something else which was not mentioned er is that is it when you have opened these two UNK shops that you'll be up to a hundred and seventy eight
yes that's
and i was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about these homework how they fit the m f i the plan of shopping
well the reason that we've changed the name on those two stores is that any experiments we want to conduct have got to be conducted outside the normal m f i UNK platform and as we use the national press extensively the only way to do that is to change the name
we had a long series of various pieces of research one of which was actually talk to enormous amount of customers through customer and as a consequence of that we've we decided to form a fairly business to produce a very different pair of stores different in that they won't trade in the traditional way that m f is gone ah they'll carry different UNK different price lines
now what it is actually is a idea that part of our research and development actually UNK the customer so that in the stores it's very difficult to experiment in say half a dozen when the national press is out there every week making an offer that you don't carry by definition like that
so what bits are more up market more down market
what would you say about that
what we're actually doing in terms of the product is we're actually widening the franchise erm i don't like to use words going up market that suggests that we're leaving our core customers behind we will we will add any product that is UNK to our core kitchens but er we'll still be the main stance of the product in these two stores for instance we're going to introduce a house wear department it is something that we've been UNK with before we're going to erm use the opportunity to widen the franchise on appliances we're going to erm use the an experiment on erm UNK to match work tops those kind of developments just to test to see whether the customer reaction is as good as we hoped it would be so that we can then introduce it in the main chain
do they have to be a lot bigger these stores
no they're just two standard stores one's twenty five thousand square feet in UNK which as you will be aware is a market town with a fairly wide catchment area and in cardiff which where we're opposite marks and spencers on an out of town development so they're just two stores virtually picked because they were ready to open
right my final question have you talked to erm do it all about buying in their outfit
we've certainly talked to do it all ha erm yes that's definite yes
thank you
can you tell us a bit more about this
well it's a both a fortunate and unfortunate circumstance as a result of the by out a sorry as a result of the UNK we cut a great many costs which reduced our taxable profits but at the same time we did actually pay some UNK and we've also pay some dividends here in last year anyway
the UNK has been that because last year's trading profits were lower than expected we didn't have any taxable profits against which to claim back this a c t so as this would be the first year in which taxable profits would arise unless we'd not been unless we'd been able to find some other way of dealing with it the a c t which we pay would not have been UNK till january ninety five
what we have done is we have erm been able to UNK some a c t capacity or generate some a c t capacity within one of the UNK within the group um the reason for highlighting it highlighting it is not particularly to make a song and dance about it but is particularly to say that on the cash flow statement there is this in flood and it is a one off in flood we're not going to be seeing that being brought forward every year but basically what it is we have profits in previous elements of the group which enabled us to generate a c t capacity enabled us to off set this a c t which we paid on dividends and bringing forward earlier than we would otherwise have done
oh right
UNK had we had the profits last year which would have generated taxable profits then we wouldn't have needed to have done that so that's one reason why it was not disclosed on UNK at the time and UNK was not regarded as an asset
it's not an asset unless you can use it
right if you can show us erm a main stream corporation last year
yes but not again not one which we're not able to off set this particular payment
i'm not sure you've made it any clearer than it was before but erm
well don't look at me i can't help ya
how do you feel about the erm deal and a
i think a i think that a regional high street UNK will provide a threat to us certainly and it's not clear yet which way they're gonna try that business but yes we are working at it very hard
if the erm UNK experiment is successful could we see many more stores turning over to that format and that or will you consider UNK the whole chain or might you just have a separate chain called UNK
no i don't think either erm the whole emphasis of UNK is to learn things there which we can then bolt on to the main chain i'll be absolutely amazed if in fact UNK manages to drive anywhere near the amount of customers through it that m f i does or the problem we had in UNK is because it is a very rural area a is not having the m f i name above the door so no that is not the intention
i do believe however we'll learn things from it that we can quickly adapt and put into the hundred and seventy six m f i stores
how big sales in france and how big are the sales in france and how do margins compare with the u k
well the total sales in france for this year will be around twenty five million pounds
for the whole year
for the whole year so it's a very small business the stores are much smaller than they are in the u k erm as regards your last point about margins the margins are erm at least equal to the margins that we achieve in the u k
is that
oh sorry erm we are expect the business this year to break even it broke even last year erm and the reason for that is that we have expanded business very rapidly last year we had only thirty five stores this year we'll have fifty and we will probably have a similar sort of expansion programme for next year
the cost of that level of expansion ah were largely written off against revenue or a large part of against revenue with the effect that reduces the business to break even
what proportion of the fourteen per cent sales rise since ah christmas relates directly to mark downs in that period after boxing day when you re opened
none in the conventional sense that i take it that you mean mark down you mean clearing UNK
yeah
yes UNK is something we do all the time it's just that the discounts are different in january and the UNK to which they're applied may be different
we don't have a in our business as many other retailers do where for instance after christmas may be and other such things to clear we don't have that so there isn't any UNK that's been sold since christmas that has been sold because we don't want it to be in the UNK post year end it's just generating trade by being discount price left so therefore to a certain amount your question would be has the post christmas and it was pre christmas no material difference we're very satisfied with the gross margins since christmas we haven't had to take any extraordinary measures to generate this erm this level of sales increase that's being achieved at constant margin a flat margin
i think the ah just to remind you what we have always said is that would improve our gross margin situation would be a change in house manufacturing goods and whilst it's a bit early to tell we are actually saying to you that the sales post boxing day have been in addition
what proportion of is now made in house
it's more than sixty per cent and eight five per cent is made in the u k just about almost
as a matter of interest that's actually would be higher than any other UNK in britain actually that's not commonly known no other UNK who has a UNK of whatever he sells as high as m f i does
could you just repeat the figures for capital expenditure i think you said that this year was going to be higher than last year and explain where the money gonna be invested
well this year's capital expenditure will be around twenty five million and last year's figure was twenty three million the point i was making in the speech was that twenty three million included nine million pounds for the we must have some static in our nine million pounds for the purchase of UNK erm but the capital expenditure this year is spread right across the operation includes introduction of erm re fits in a number of stores includes expansion in france investment in systems and hardware and indeed also includes ah about five million pounds for a retail park development which i also referred to the park development on which we have an interest in the sense that we are developing an m f i store
and of course if you want to include a small element this year a greater element would be for the new open plan
just a couple of detail points erm why have you seen a fall in your UNK charge and an increase in
right i'll deal with UNK
UNK been falling now for two or three years as our capital expenditure of UNK assets has been falling indeed if you look at last year's net of the nine million pounds purchase of the UNK to fourteen million the year before was only sixteen million erm so as the as the UNK as the capital expenditure falls the UNK will also fall that's one reason
the other reason was in the late eighties and early nineties we had a very large expenditure programme indeed in one year UNK to one hundred million pounds now of that are now becoming fully UNK and falling out of the charge
what ah capital expenditure on non UNK assets
erm UNK parks as i said last year we bought nine million pounds worth of UNK now
tended to UNK with all this
not UNK land UNK buildings we've been UNK now for many years
so you know we've actually been doing that is not new as far as we're concerned
okay
no particular reason for the rise its general movements and not a serious movement as far as we're concerned includes the whole element of UNK from ourselves to our wholesale UNK which is our own manufacturing operation where they're selling to outside customers there's nothing particularly significant in that
how many re fitted stores have you got now then how many are you planning to re fit over the next year
we've got in the new format sixty of the new format but what we have been able to do is take elements of the new re fitted stores and put those for instance erm UNK we've managed to take those and re fit them separately but the actual new concept stores sits at about sixty odd stores and currently what we're doing is to check the that we have had a re fits this year erm where we've taken space for other sub lets where put the new concept back to but as far as the go in majority of the chain now we have most of the major elements i e an UNK area bed area UNK representation and indeed the re fit that was discussed in the chairman's statement the kitchen and bedroom re fit erm was applicable to all stores so all of the stores have got new kitchens and bedrooms in
so no further re fitting will substantially
yeah erm i would take a guess that there will be because we still have ambitions to shed a load of space so it would be UNK to re fit to release further space we have another twenty six smaller stores that we haven't done at all yet other than put a so yes we'll have an on going re fit programme i can't give you the exact details because erm how many it's gonna be but there will be certainly an on going re fit programme
what is UNK inflation
UNK is erm an area of the store where we sell our occasional furniture and erm small priced coffee tables hi fi units the occasional furniture that may go erm whereas up until a couple of years ago we use to display this product around the UNK floor part of the new concept stores was that we actually set the same section in the UNK which is very much like a UNK system whereby the stock actually sits on the shelves the customer walks in and it's an easy purchase straight off the trolley erm very much like the supermarket operation so it's the lower priced good value occasional type furniture the cash and carry the kind of things that you don't need sales assistants for the kind of UNK that you would put in your children's bedroom that kind of thing
as part of the what the stores back in the mid eighties were more expensive UNK and so too conflicting we had a fifty or twenty five pound coffee table we sold the two greater mixture so its a methodology of just an ordinary table for exactly without conflict
what were these what was the sales area of the how much sales area did you actually release in the first half and how much do you expect to go in the second
i'll give you the answer to that one just bear with me a moment please i'll try to be precise
right the erm trading area the closing trading area at the end of the november ninety three was six thousand and forty sorry six million forty thousand square feet at the previous year in april ninety three it was six million and thirty six thousand square feet
that includes france does it
that includes france which has seen an increase in UNK of a thirty thousand square feet and we've also got a number of sub lets we've indicated that erm sub lets should pay reduces it
do these figures include or exclude that sub let
they include the sub let space and where we sub let space we UNK that space from the trading area figure
right has it still gone up
yeah because we've opened stores in france and we've also a new store in the u k there's pluses and UNK there's pluses in france pluses in the u k with one new store erm and UNK with the sub lets
sorry just remind us what proportion is a flat pack represents of your total sales
unclear
fifteen something low eighty per cent obviously varies
low eighty
low eighty low eighty it various from season to season as UNK is more popular or less popular as beds are more popular at the
the other question how seriously do you view the likely impact of the new the budget er change come coming into force in the spring on purchases of consumer UNK such as yours bearing in mind your and your customer profile
yeah i mean we did insert actually in the chairman's statement a UNK note about the credit announcement because two years ago we had a similar increase which in fact by the time we got to the end of the year had disappeared so we view it with a lot of caution is the answer if you ask me to be more precise i can't because we've never really had a set of tax increases the like of which we face now any other questions
in fact we oh sorry yes
erm sub lets erm on the sub lets a big package deals with any other retailers and what would be the biggest
oh the erm if there is a sort of major beneficiary that carpet right because of course we owned the in them fairly decent straight throughout UNK and some of the market people UNK erm the sort of spread you'd expect on any retail park you know
i think that part of our business makes it more difficult because ah the purchase of allied carpets by UNK is the space of the market at a fairly speedy rate and i personally believe other retailers will have the policy to sub let surface areas in the next few years so it's something we got on with three years ago and very pleased we did it
thank you very much for your attention gentlemen
part of the panel members is might be classed as partly walking wounded but endeavour to carry on during the course of the day you will find out who's the walking wounded
erm before we embark on the continued discussion on h two er and we are prepared to look at erm the which says should the party include specific plans on location of the new settlement
erm there are a number of matters which need to be picked up by the county council as a result of requests which we made on friday and also you will note that a number of additional papers have been laid on the table
some of which are well will need to be covered as we proceed er with the discussion on h two and i think in particular probably the additional paper produced by will need to be introduced mr
north yorkshire
first of all chairman we have put in this morning erm a paper on commitments which erm i think was asked for by the panel which is this document which should have been circulated er by now
erm if anybody has any questions or queries on that er we'll be pleased to deal with them
erm the second er request was for to work in respect of the greater york area and unfortunately my UNK optimism erm in respect of that has not borne UNK
er as you will be aware chairman the nineteen ninety one census to work with data is not available yet from the census
but there is a body of information held by the county council erm on er journey to work movements in the greater york area collected on erm on going basis largely by consultants erm shared by the county council er and the city council
unfortunately all the o n d information erm on that and that UNK is post code er UNK erm and to extract the data erm in a meaningful sense for greater york will require the UNK of all the basic data and that will take some time
so there s a difficulty on that
but we have got a paper which we produced in nineteen eighty seven which was a review of the greater york area using travel to work statistics from the albeit from the nineteen eighty one erm er census
and that worked did lead to an amendment of the then greater york area to the area that is defined now
and that does include that paper does include er a schedule er of work trips into er york er for the various wards erm around york
and if that would be helpful er we can certainly give this to er erm panel secretary for circulation erm today
i apologize for the difficulties on getting er data out more recent data largely due to the way the model is constructed at the moment
what i think we are looking for in asking for during th was a UNK of the definition of greater york
as i see it in with the board greater york now that the green belt is in a deposited local fund includes only two small areas beyond the green belt
to the north and north west of the city
st structured numbered policy h one as it stands
provides for nine thousand seven hundred dwellings to be within the greater york area
and clearly from our debate the county council propose that shall include a new settlement
it seems to me that the new settlement if my analysis is correct can only be in one of those two areas which doesn't seem to me to be a very sensible way of proceeding
yes i think erm i think that's a fair point and this was touched on erm on erm thursday or friday i can't remember which and er in respect to i think mr raised the issue of the specific wording of the proposed policy h one
er and i think we would all er acknowledge er the precise difficulties of that wording and perhaps a an amendment may need to be considered on the second line following the list of districts
er which refers to provided in relation to the greater york area rather than in the greater york area
something along those lines er maybe a more
acceptable erm recognition of the reality of the boundary of the green belt in the greater york study area
and the wording could be tightened up possibly on that basis chair er chairman
an alternative way of looking at it would perhaps be to say the greater york area is that area within ten miles of the city centre as is indicated by the third of the criteria set out in policy h two
well i think there's a difficulty with that on you then get into a difficulty on housing provision for greater york districts
erm to take the greater york area out to ten miles would not UNK with the calculations and the level of provision which erm have been worked out and which relate to the greater york study area as defined erm in this document
but p up to ten miles that takes you outside the limit and if you have a new settlement for up to fourteen hundred clients that UNK takes you outside the greater york area as defined by your study
yes indeed it does erm
so it must fall within the remain you know eight districts figures
outside the greater york
well on the way that we've instructed erm policy h one part of the provision for the greater york districts is part of the nine thousand seven hundred
now quite clearly the new settlement erm when it if and when it goes ahead will be outside erm the area of the green belt and which by definition is by and large the area of the greater york er study area and i think in response to er mr 's point we've accepted as a need for a er a minor amendment to the wording of policy h one to reflect that er that reality
and i would have thought it could be accommodated with something like in relation to the greater york area
but you c my impression is that you still finish up with a contradiction if you use terminology like in the greater york area when there is and stick to the existing definition of that area
is there a solution to this in the table which erm has ruined mr 's weekend perhaps
oh he's still smiling it obviously it hasn't ruined his weekend
if could the problem be overcome by defining the greater york area in the way i suggested
within ten miles of the city centre and a and make a UNK increase in the nine thousand seven hundred in line one of the third paragraph in policy h one
the table that's before us indicates that there are about sixteen hundred dwellings within the area defined by ten miles
i think to do that erm to chairman to define the greater york area then to ten miles that would of course require a consistent calculation of the housing need requirement both the local need element and the hundred percent migration element which arises within that ten mile er area to be consistent with erm the rest of the policy and of course that calculation erm that consistent calculation er has not been done for that area
i think mr wants to help us out
er well i'm not sure i want to i want to help you out chairman
i in a way i want to back up the point mr has just made
the basis of the housing UNK housing requirement calculation which has submitted both in my evidence and the county's evidence
was based on calculating housing needs within that greater york study area roughly speaking six miles
taking parish members etcetera
if we are now changing the area to ten miles then the basis of the calculation needs to be made differently
mm
it isn't the simple matter of adding on existing commitments to an existing calculated housing need
yep
er it would be a different commitment and would be a different basis
er and therefore er unless we are changing the basis of the calculation of the housing need thereby the basis of which we are thereby judging how we meet the requirement
erm UNK unless we're actually making that change as such then the only way forward it seems to me i is on the lines of which of which mr has indicated which is that erm essentially the needs of greater york are calculated on the current greater york study area and the requirements are made on that basis and the supply is within that area unless it can't be made in that area in that case it goes without that area and therefore it it's part of the justification for the new settlement
is there a compromise which says that rather than increasing the nine thousand seven hundred as suggested a moment ago from the county councils own point of view that nine thousand seven hundred should be decreased on a new settlement
i'm not putting forward that as my position
but that is what i understand is the county council's position
can we just UNK that erm
chair
county council
i mean that is one possible approach of doing it that you instead of taking the figure of nine thousand seven hundred in policy h one you refer to it as being eight thousand three hundred or whatever figure you might happen to come up with
and then make a separate statement on UNK the policy that er a new settlement of approximately x dwellings will be er provided in relation to the greater york area or even round of type of form of dwelling you think is appropriate
and that is one way of doing it
erm it's just this is one alternative yes
but it strikes me that you need to do some critical UNK of that policy h one in order to reflect this situation
if as i suspect from what mr has said that the there is some UNK to start UNK the greater york in quotes figures
yes
then we have to UNK
we have to recognize the situation but erm UNK accordingly
any other comments
thank you for that
can we then come to discussing the outstanding issue of h two
erm before we do that mr do you want to just briefly introduce your additional paper
mm
your invitation erm on friday i've prepared a very brief statement on erm our analysis of the relative erm UNK of each of the sectors around the greater york area to accommodate a new settlement
erm you will see that in section one i've identified six sectors which broadly relate to the main er the primary roots which er cross the greater york area
and also in section one paragraph one point three i have UNK the criteria set out in policy h two plus two additional criteria of my own in what i believe to be in their order of significance in relation to the questions that we're considering
in section three erm i set out erm my basis for the valuation of all those criterion for each of the sectors and basically i've adopted erm a fourth grade evaluation of each of the factors and you'll see on table one which is contained within section two erm the er the summary of that consideration
and basically the UNK i've allowed in respect of the performance of each of the factors
very good performance acceptable performance poor performance and very poor performance
erm i would have liked to have produced some er tables and diagrams to go with this document but you will appreciate within the time that we had available erm that there was insufficient time available to er to prepare that but hopefully that will give you er a basis for considering the relative merits of the various a various erm sectors around york
this is this is only just been laid on the table obviously this morning hasn't it
yes it has sir yes
yes and the county are in the same position as everybody else in not having been able to check it
mr
sir we've only had this for i think for three minutes before the start of the erm of this erm session i'm just wondering if we could have ten minutes to read it
yes fine
we'll have an adjourn we'll adjourn until half past ten so you've all got chance to read this
can we can we now UNK please
erm before we actually get down discussing this er submission can i just say that we do have another issue to talk about at er two o'clock this afternoon and therefore it means that our discussion will on this topic will have to UNK at one o'clock
if we have not got through for what we need to er examine then the proposition is that we should UNK at five thirty this evening
and the hall is available to us this evening but i would like to con i think well i hope you will concur that i would like to conclude on h two today
so with that we proceed into er looking at h two
can i say that we ourselves have also been UNK a set of criteria er taking on board the various points that were made on friday morning
er i also have to UNK again that we have in no way we have made up our minds as to whether or not there should be a new settlement but we have to proceed to discuss the issues as identified
so we were UNK a list of criteria
and equally we were beginning we had also discussed the way in which we would approach it sector by sector
and certainly in terms of the sec the sector approach the one which erm mr has produced is UNK almost UNK with the with the way in which we wanted to look at it
now can i ask first of all are you as we have a paper in front of us are you happy to continue the discussion of the basis of the sector by sector approach and in particular the sectors which have been identified by mr
cos that i must say that was the way in which we would have wished to have proceeded with the discussion
we do have to try to answer this question of whether or not there should be specific guidance about the location
if we are minded to support a policy for a new settlement
and i frankly can see no way of being able to answer that question or attempt to answer that question without going through this form of exercise
any UNK voice on that
no
mr
well erm north yorkshire
i wouldn't say it was a UNK voice chairman erm but er following the discussions on friday erm i UNK to take erm instructions from on this particular issue which i as far as i was able to do i did
and erm the county council position is as erm i stated at the outset of this exercise
that er erm the county council feels that it's not able to move UNK a preferred general location in advance of the detailed assessment of the criteria
that erm the county council is pursuing at this er at this alteration
i er and i put that in solely as er as an update on the on the county council position as i expressed er earlier in the week
yes
er i mean i yes that was your attitude in the
sorry that is the county council's view
it hasn't changed but as we said on friday morning the d of e amongst others have UNK er expressed a view that the panel ought to try to come up with a general location if we can
and i can see no other way of proceeding than that in which we proposed at the moment
we may not be able to come to a conclusion
cos we may not have sufficient information
we don't know yet but let us see how we go
erm s so moving on from that we have a list of UNK
sorry mr
thank you sir er selby district
erm whilst clearly i'll er i'll do my best to er assist your investigation sir
it's still as we said on friday places i think all the districts but certainly puts the selby district in great difficulty in that we've already acknowledged that we feel selby district is an appropriate location for a new settlement and there are indeed two particular road corridors that unclear
yes i we've identified these from your submission
well i i'm in difficulty to help you chose which would be the more appropriate
there are potential areas of search in growth which the local authority has identified as part of the background work to local planning preparation
but clearly i'm not in a position to reveal the results of that work in advance of it put into my memory
well let's see how we go
i mean we could well be the exercise that we embark on could actually eliminate sectors around york
and at least that would be an advance if nothing else
can we come back to the criteria and i probably ought to refer you UNK really to the i know this is set out a little br a s rather UNK fashion
but i think we all know what they mean
there's a slightly different list in the table one produced by mr as from the erm the criteria which are set out from the section in paragraph one three of this paper
and i say that because in one three for example he doesn't make any reference to the need for the settlement to be free standing as avoid coalescence
whereas it does figure as one the factors within his table
if you look at your paragraph one three mr under item eight where you say a bracket equals weight
you have five headings there
and if you look at the table one
you actually have six
yes i'm grateful sir for erm pointing out that UNK
er a reflection of the speed at which it was put together
precisely
now if you take the table one and bearing in mind it it's reflects reasonably well that the factors or the criteria which we discussed on friday morning
are there any others which people feel ought to be added to that list
mr
i'm i i've only just l looked at this like very er like everybody else
but er i'm not certain that the criterion two of edge two is in there anywhere
my erm could it should be under
erm
well i it could be UNK under six
i said it was a UNK way of
yeah
expressing the criteria
yes yeah
i think
i have to say that i i'm not enthusiastic about using this which is so obviously at a report in support of the particular locations to look UNK at the criteria
i would prefer it if er we looked at the criteria and the policy itself but take useful information from this if need be
rather than use this
mm
because it is er let's face
it is er
well le let's put it this way
in the words of the UNK i have a little list of own
creeping little
perhaps we could see that
we can use that
there is one criterion which erm i'm not clear about whether mr has included or not
and then question of beyond two thousand and six
whether we should include as a consideration whether this particular eighth new settlement in this particular sector would have the capacity to expand beyond two thousand and si in saying that i'm conscious that we have UNK because as a panel we have to duck
at the moment the question of how big the settlement should be
part of the
i would be entirely happy to have erm an additional consideration relating to possible expansion beyond two thousand and six and i believe that is an entirely sensible way in which to proceed
mr and mr and then mr
leeds city
i've er a comment which i think in part it relates to miss 's observation
that is the relative importance which are attached to regional and sub regional policies
it seems rather strange to me that something which is UNK strategic should come so far down the list of factors even er below satisfactory access for example
at this stage obviously the observations which can be particular will related to existing regional and su sub regional policies
but at the time that the county council had moved to adopt the policy we may be in the working the context of regional policy to be issued by the secretary of state
and that may introduce new considerations not available to us today
so i would suggest that regional and sub regional policies need to occur much higher up the list and er perhaps i would put them at number one if not number two
w well if it wou if it would help i mean i could produce the list that we have in mind
erm which moves certain things around
i in the way in which in the order of consideration
yeah
go on then
erm in suggesting that we could use mr 's papers as a basis for dis mr 's order of priorities
but simply using his list and any additional items that we have as a check list no more than that
so i think that mr 's point can be covered
obviously in going through each of these lists each of these items we want to know
use participants
a new settlement in this general location would meet that criterion
i don't think we can take the discussion any further than that otherwise we'd
but perhaps a pig in a UNK
do you want to take that in the spirit in which it's er made
alright
we'll move on
now just going back to the sorry mr
yes
we would be very happy to see mr 's paper used as a check list
but i should like to emphasize the point that expansion beyond two thousand and six is regarded by as having considerable relevance
and that it would be UNK in the extreme for allowance not to be made for that feature
yes
yes
mr
york city council
can i just ask a point of clarification
erm the phraseology under seven er which deals about satisfactory access
do i take it to mean that when we come to discuss erm a particular road issue that would be take also to include impact upon the highway network in the area
yes
yes
yeah
well if you turn back to the various sectors
er i have to deal with i say we must er mr has put this in as number two on his list which is local planning authority support
but can i just refer you back to the words of p b g three where it says quite clearly in paragraph thirty three
the proposal is a clear expression of local preference supported by local planning authorities
and that must be the underlying one of the underlying themes i in considering er this in considering this review of the area around york
now in terms of the sectors erm well i sh probably shouldn't say this
but c can we take er start off in the top left hand corner of the clock face which in fact is er mr 's number three where he s he says the a fifty nine the area UNK the a fifty nine and b twelve twenty four within harrogate d district
and then work our way round with the clock in that er in that way
mr
thank you chairman
harrogate borough council
could i seek some clarification from mr on what he means by the area UNK the a fifty nine and the b one two four
because erm by the time those roads have left the green belt
erm in the vicinity of moor UNK and long UNK respectively
er the roads are about four kilometres apart and a valuation would i think be pretty meaningless because conditions er along those two axes do differ in certain respects
mr
erm there was in fact a plan submitted with erm this text
unfortunately because of its size it could not be erm UNK quickly this morning
however erm the area concerned basically is the entire UNK of the ring that is within harrogate district
i've tried to relate the sectors to both the principal transport corridors and also in very broad terms district boundaries
so just so we're absolutely certain then sorry if i if i can just take you back to the l the areas spelt out in paragraph one
little one a nineteen south
that is selby district
right mr
correct sir
selby east we might call that
east of the UNK
the next one is also we'll call that selby west
number three is harrogate district
do you want it split mr or not
or are you happy to take it under this umbrella heading
or happier
i think as long harrogate borough council
as long as long as everyone recognizes that for an area of that size er conditions will vary within it
much significantly as long as that is recognized i'm happy to proceed on that
well if you feel it should be split say so now
erm i think we'll leave it as it is
alright thank you
then a nineteen north number four that is hambledon
mr okay
clear
and the last two they're all as far as i read it mr in ryedale district
thank you
five
runs from hambledon round to the east
six
let's try the a sixty four
how much falls in hambledon and how much falls in selby
on six
mr i turn to you for guidance on that one
again sir
on the ground the division between the b one three six three corridor and a sixty four north must be erm a difficult one but again i for convenience i have used the district boundary to divide the two
so are you saying that the six actually falls in ryedale
yes sir but erm the cu the a sixty four north falls entirely within ryedale
and can be described as ryedale east northeast
northeast
well as there's only one ryedale sector perhaps ryedale east
the implication of what the chairman just said was that area five was also in ryedale
is that not so
that that's not so
of the er
no part of a area five then in ryedale
no
no it's all in hambledon
in very broad terms
so hambledon splits west to east
yes i wonder if it might help you sir if i erm if i submit a copy of the plan
no
no
mr it's i don't think it's helpful to the panel to have these sectors UNK district boundaries
in view of our starting comment on friday morning UNK that mr had some reservations about it was that we had at least aim district
but mr sorry to come in
as i read five
you say the area UNK the b thirteen sixty three broadly between the boundary of hambledon district to the west and to the east so it must be ryedale
yes
if the hambledon boundary is on the west
can't be anywhere else
surely
yes i'm sorry
it's er
i attempted at first to put this into ryedale district
erm and obviously UNK
the intention is that er this b one three six three six corridor lies broadly within the hambledon district and its eastern most boundary is roughly UNK with the ryedale and hambledon boundary
and there is an error in five under the description
chairman
er i wonder if this planning UNK that we've put in with the commitments which has got the district boundaries on may be in fact er more helpful in determining the one three six three
i in fact would very quickly er in orange just ran the an orange pin up along the line of the one three six three as you will see it's is primarily within with primarily within hambledon district
the one three six three goes out through the UNK on forest on forest does it
UNK on forest yeah
well i must confess mr it's difficult if we get into a situation where we've got an area UNK two districts and i don't have to say why in some respects
if i refer you back to p g three
yep yeah
the UNK lines on the plan which you have in front of you erm are only intended to be indicative
erm we have not had a great deal of time to put this together
er and they are merely designed to draw attention to the broad corridors which
yep
i would presume people would interpret to be UNK with the district boundaries where a district boundary UNK that line
yep
how would you describe your area five in district terms please
hambledon north
as opposed to area four which is hambledon
hambledon south
thank you
so are we clear then both four and five four certainly lies within hambledon and five also lies within hambledon
is that the way we are going to bring mo move forward
well yes
yes thank you
is everyone else clear about that
mr
sir from
i'm just having regard to criterion four of policy h two
it says have good access or be able to provide good access to the primary road network
and when i refer to the erm primary road network defined in the t p
i see that the one three six three doesn't form part of the primary road network
and i just wondered if it would ease the discussion if we omitted that particular corridor
well this is why we were trying to relate it to districts
which we have now done
which we have done
alright
mhm
right
can we now go through criteria by criteria
and you've got to try and relate this back to the areas as we have now as we now understand them
the first one identified by mr says avoid the green belt
and there is no doubt that the areas identified do avoid the green belt
they lie outside it
moving to number two on his list and i'm referring to table one
forget the weighting we just run through the check list just run through the check list
local planning authority support and here i refer you back to p g three
these words will be UNK on your heart before we finish today
the proposal is a clear expression of local preference supported by local planning authorities
now mr in his table has identified four double xs
now the question is that correct
because my understanding of the situation is that harrogate have expressed i'll come to you in a moment mr harrogate have expressed support in principal for the idea of a new settlement
but here they are UNK with a double x UNK the a fifty nine
and ryedale again have also expressed support for the idea of a new settlement
but they're UNK with a double x but i'm also aware in the context of the a fifty nine sector and this may well be your point mr that leeds would have to put it UNK a UNK view about a new settlement in that sector because of the fact it may draw off erm regeneration effort in the leeds metropolitan district
is that the point that you wanted to make
yes
yes it is
i think you've assumed the answer to my question which was going to be to addressed to mr
to clarify which local planning authorities would be party to the agreement of the location of a new settlement
whether it be the planning authorities with er UNK boundaries to the location of the new settlement area
or simply those local planning authorities within the county area with whom which the new settlement proposal lay
thank you mr
can i develop that
yes
point as well
and in reference to what it said
north yorkshire in the p g and can i put for erm in the p g could i put forward a scenario to you which i haven't really thought through
that being that the county council and yourselves consider this UNK
clearly the best location ought to be at point eight
which shall we say we are talking about the a fifty nine is along the a fifty nine corridor
erm that quite clear that is the best solution
it could e just as equally be else where
what would happen if the district council didn't support it yet the county council er supported it
and quite clearly the strategic benefits erm justified a new settlement on say the a fifty nine corridor
and really i'm looking to here
what does it mean
does it mean that county and district have got to sign up for it
if it's and district as well
is there not the possibility that er a district that is not happy could er prejudice what is sound strategic planning er policy
that's a fast one at this time of the morning mr
can i perhaps offer to give mr a bit more thinking time and suggest that a local plan which did not contain something which was in the structure plan as a proposal would not be in accord with the structure plan
could i also give mr a bit more thinking time by going off on another angle
i think it's important in considering the question of local authority to support to remember the basis on which the advice in p g three is UNK
and i don't i think it is no accident that the seconds criterion is the second criterion not the first criterion
it is the second criterion because the first step is to reject the alternatives
mm
yeah
and therefore whilst it may be that district councils will have to take some reservations in expressing support
and that may be a bit mild for the position they find themselves in
from our discussion last week it is clear they have rejected the alternative
mr
i shall do my best to answer the questions chairman
but i must say it fills me with UNK
erm as i understand the way p g three was drafted this was in response to the circumstances which had UNK before february ninety two
r right around the country in all sorts of different locations we'd seen applications coming forward on a speculative basis
the one which
can you move the microphone
can you move the mike
yeah move the mike
the one which was highlighted in the h b f paper in nottinghamshire was quite clearly before p g three came out
erm it came as no surprise to me to read the issue of that particular proposal
you notice right at the top of the column of that particular page er when it's highlighting that er that history
it does say they're almost UNK deeply controversial
and in the light of this experience the secretary of state take the view that and then goes on to list all the factors
so it seems to me that these were a set of circumstances trying to overcome the previous bad situation which has applied
now i UNK that the way that's constructed to mean that er when we're say that the tide had turned against new settlements as some districts were doing at the time this came out
we thought what that meant er it'd certainly turn against this speculative proposal
and i think it would now be most unlikely for a speculative proposal that hadn't come through a planning system to succeed
now clearly in saying that i can only er say what we believe
and it wouldn't you would never know for certain until a speculative proposal was actually put to the test
well i certainly i believe that to be the case
now as for the difference between county and district mr 's point is a very valid one
they're the authority charged with producing a strategic plan for the area
in that obviously they have to take on board the views of their constituent districts
and three or four of them like this they have to try and come up with the right solution
so in theory it's possible for the county solution at the end of the day to be not completely in line with what its constituent districts think
aha
the secretary of state i'm sure would obviously have to take on board what was embodied in the final structure plan
but i think in deciding his actions before the actual approval of the plan he would ne need to take on board any difference of opinion between the county and district on an issue of this kind
and i it may be for instance erm that he may even have to intervene at the modification stage if something was going seriously wrong
all i all i think i would say at this stage is let's wait and see whether the county and one district are in line on the question of the new settlement
if that happens i would think there would be a reasonable pro for UNK reasonable prospect for success
and my guess would be and it can only be a guess that if there actually was disagreement between a county and the prospective UNK of a new settlement then i suspect that the secretary of state would not want such proposals to proceed
and that's purely expression of opinion off the top of my head
i simply have no idea of how it would proceed in practice
mm
sorry i can't be more helpful than that
yeah the difficulty is at the moment of course the secretary of state does not is not the erm person responsible for UNK the structure plan
the final the final UNK well the decision will rest with the county council
but the secretary of state ob has obviously got reserved power if he if he feels obliged to step in
mm
mr
yeah er
could i please draw attention er you already chairman have but it's important from where i stand to draw attention to the words of the second criterion of the p g which says that the proposal is a clear expression of local preference supported by the local planning authorities
erm to my knowledge and i'd be corrected if i'm wrong on this
local preference hasn't or local views have not been UNK about these locations that we're now discussing
so the question whether or not there's there is a clear expression to my to my mind cannot be answered
second point i'd make is that in relation to the table one
erm weighting i'm sorry
it it's UNK to the relevant performance in relation to the a nineteen and the a sixty four
er they're both given very good performance
er i presume on the basis that selby district council have expressed a support for them
and i just need to come back to the point that my client certainly doesn't support either of them
er and to that extent as we have set out in our UNK in our submissions
er our client is a local employer of long standing who is concerned about the local environment and erm objects most strongly to these locations
er so to that extent local preference is not satisfied in that case even though selby district council have expressed a preference
but is it not true mr that your client UNK the alternative of expansion of existing settlements
er not necessarily in the way you've expressed it
er my client UNK er UNK the expansion of tadcaster as one of the potential as one possible UNK er settlement yes
mr
ryedale district
i would agree with mr that none of the proposals are a clear expression of local preference because none of them have actually been considered by the local people within each of the districts
however going back to the table the second criteria local planning authorities support
ryedale supports the principal of a new settlement
it has never answered the question whether or not it is appropriate in ryedale
so i don't think that the two crosses which is given on the a sixty four north
can yes can you just UNK the weighting
right
UNK the weighting
just
well i say that at the best i think it it's just a question mark or a dash
put a tick
just put a tick or a cross you know which is what we're trying to do
i think it's neither in UNK case
it supports the principal but not necessarily whether or not it should be in ryedale
because it's
right
never been considered by members
is are you saying then that the best answer to the question of is there a clear expression of local preference is don't know
but reject the option of expansion of existing settlements
i think the question is if it is a clear expression of local preference it certainly isn't don't know
but
it's not
whether it's whether it's well it's don't know because no one 's ever been up no one's ever asked the question of the people in any of the districts as to whether you know a new settlement in their district is appropriate
but they have obviously an the members and the local have as agreed with the principal of a new settlement to meet the assessed development needs of the greater york area
so in UNK in effect that question should be could be divided into two parts
local preference no
local authority er support don't know in UNK case
do you actually know local preference answer no
yeah
no
yeah
i thought i'd only got the flu
erm
suspect i shall need brain surgery by the end of the morning
how d i'm sorry i don't understand how you know the local preference is not for a new settlement
no i don't
i'm not saying that
i'm saying that i don't know what local preference is in terms of where it should go
because no one in any of the north yorkshire area has been UNK as to whether or not they should have a new settlement
but i do know that in s in the sort of southern ryedale area the support was definitely for a new settlement to meet the assessed needs of the greater york area
because it wasn't considered that the level of housing required could be accommodated in that area
so the principal is supported both by the members and by the public
ah
but the location isn't yet
so you have a local you have support both by the local authority and quote the local population for the idea of a for the idea of a new settlement
yes
could or could not be maintained depending on its location
putting words in your mouth
but there is no clear indication that south ryedale or ryedale district should be the UNK
there's no expression of support that ryedale should be the UNK of a new settlement as yet
because that question has not been posed
yes
thank you
yeah
and in fact if er we look along this line at the moment we as i said in my introduction we have two districts or three districts who have expressed support for the principal and of those of those one has given a clear indication that it would this might be too er high a phrase welcome a new settlement within its district
mr that is probably a clear expression of the of selby as a local authority that's a that's a clear expression of their stance isn't it
er yes er it well more or less
er i think perhaps er UNK welcome er
well er don't er don't use the word welcome i have indicated yes alright
i will qualify the general spirit of what was said
and now is that view also an expression of local preference or local support in terms of the public at large in selby district
what has their view been
selby district
erm the public at large in selby district have er been consulted to the same degree that all er districts were involved in the greater york study
so in other words acceptance of the of the principal in preference
yes
to the alternative of expansion of existing settlements
right
but clearly they haven't been consulted on preferred locations
mhm
mr
hambledon district council
there are two points er chairman
yeah
the first relates to er a point made by the senior inspector about the list in er paragraph thirty three of p g three
i don't think that they can be taken to be in any particular order
certainly not in a des UNK order of importance
and i know that they are not UNK by one two three or any other form of indication which would er suggest that they are in any order
erm it's clearly states that a new settlement should be only UNK where and it's my opinion that all those factors need to be met and they are not UNK within that er paragraph
the second point is that UNK position on the new settlement erm is UNK
we have a clear resolution that it objects to the new settlement on the basis that it is not needed and cannot be justified
and the reasons er for that it is not necessary to go into them again we have been through them erm on the erm er previous days
i would say however that it's not been tested whilst and whilst there isn't a clear expression of local preference in terms of the population i think my elected members who represent that particular area would say that they are expressing local views when they have spoken against the new settlement
thank you
is it miss or mrs
can i can i just take mr first and then come to you
mr
UNK harrogate borough council
just briefly to reiterate the borough council's position
harrogate borough council have rejected er the continued expansion of er settlements around its sector of york and villages within the york green belt
we support the principal of a new settlement
erm but my councillors haven't yet taken a view on whether there is a possible site in harrogate district
er the reason for that is as already mentioned that a comprehensive assessment hasn't been done
when that comprehensive assessment is available er my members will take a view
thank you
miss
for
i really just wanted to speak in support of
the point i'd like to make is that we're here representing and a number of the parish councils in the selby area
the fact that they've chosen to have somebody representing them in objection to the new settlement proposal i think is as strong an indication as you can get that the local people don't actually support the council on this point
yes yep
that refers exclusively to parish councillors in selby district
the people i'm representing are but obviously
yep
there are other people around the table saying that for other districts
yes your view relates to parishes in a part of selby district
yes that's right
but it tends to be that
yep
much of the area that would be under consideration for a new
yes
yep
settlement
well it's the sector west of the UNK isn't it
yes it is
it yes
yeah
mr did you want to come back on something
no
well are we in a position now to put UNK or crosses against two on the list in table one
in the light of what we've said
got a lot more than UNK or crosses
sorry
got a lot more than UNK or crosses
want to or then again pardon
no
no alright no ok
can we now move on to item three what criteria three is under table one
located within ten miles of york
well in fact the discussion on friday morning went along the lines that the new settlement should be located within six to eight miles or six to ten miles
so i'm inclined to sort of look at it under those er within those distances and is there any UNK with er mr 's analysis of his sectors that they would fit within that er those general distances
mr
mr
leeds city council
i simply make the observation that ten miles is a rather arbitrary figure
and that the reality of geography is that people will chose to live or develop in accessible locations
some of these roads mentioned as though the focus of the sectors erm have a much higher capacity and much greater speed capability than others and in terms of relative UNK to the centre of york probably you could come further out west on the a sixty four than on perhaps on the b one three six three for example
this could take you into the leeds district as being a suitable location for a settlement which would meet this criterion
and in fact it might be useful for you to know chair that proposals for new settlements have been made on the a sixty four corridor within leeds
yeah
yes well i mean we're aware of that and of course we went through this question of distances on friday
erm and i think there was a general agreement that we would look at this six to eight six to ten miles
was there was there not
i mean there are other factors which come into play we accept that
but this is one of one of which we did agree was a suitable factor to be considered in the er in the analysis
would the districts agree if the area of to eight miles
that there would be areas within those sectors which would be suitable for a new a new settlement
mr
certainly on the a sixty four corridor there is a belt of grade two land that UNK in west to east
er around the eight mile limit
i would prefer it to see it extended to ten miles if that sector was chosen
purely so that the area of land or the area of search could be expanded to possibly avoid areas of high quality agricultural land
so you would say yes to six to ten miles but
yes
question mark six to eight
mr sorry
sorry
so has anybody got any com any other comments about the individual sectors in the light of that
mr
sir
we'll have to give you a new name
just dealing with mr 's point
we have in fact done some detailed agricultural surveys in this area of york
in fact the grade two land tends to be in the eight to ten mile band rather than six to eight
it's a matter of fact rather than rather than rather than a matter what is shown on the one inch map
thank you
before we get on to this next item would it be a suitable place to break for time to break for coffee
er and resume at twenty five to twelve
thank you
we've i will remind you that we've had an expression of view from ryedale about the district factor
any of the other districts want to make comments about that
any one else
mr
selby district
just to briefly say that er i would prefer the ten mile limit because of the greater flexibility that it will give
yeah
thank you yes sorry
are you saying that six to eight miles would not be you would not be able to find a location for a new settlement in
it would
either sector within six to eight miles
it would limit the choice
sorry that wasn't my question
UNK it would limit the choice
is it would it make it impossible
well i i'm sorry i really can't respond to that
you'd lose the flexibility factor
thank you
any one else want to make any comments about this or can i move on to what is headed in mr 's criteria area of no market demand and one in which we had described and it may well be UNK mean the same thing be in a location where people want to live
now who's going to make comments about the various sectors miss
UNK
i just wanted to point out that on this criteria it doesn't appear to be one that the county council has listed
and i think we should look at this in a UNK because erm it doesn't refer specifically to york
i think it should be qualified and say area of no market demand related to york settlement
this particular erm problem with it being market demand possibly from west yorkshire in certain locations
it well i say one it was one of the aspects that was that tha that UNK up in our discussion about the criteria on friday and as far as we're concerned what we are trying to do is not er to exclude anything from the discussion in terms of er trying to locate or find a suitable location
we can't do that at this stage
so we felt it reasonable to put that into the pot for discussion
but i feel it should possibly be tied in with six rather than being considered on its own
aha
can we ask mr how it was that he eliminated three sectors
or put xs i beg his pardon put xs against three sectors
thank you
you anticipated a point i was going to make in fact
and that is i was just a little concerned that you were possibly considering an additional criterion as i've got a note of it here
being in a location where people wish to live
because that's really erm a part of what i mean by this criterion
and i think probably erm there is another issue which is equally important and that is the question that it must be a location where people who develop employment wish to locate and erm and develop enterprises
because i see it is of fundamental importance to achieving the environmental objectives for the new settlement and making it a decent place to live
that there is a real prospect of jobs going to that new settlement
and in my view and i think this is a view shared by the county council
at least it's in one of their statements er on the new settlement issue
erm the areas to the south and west of north that's erm harrogate and the selby sectors erm i think are most able to offer erm a good location
and in that respect i think the a sixty four i is the better of those three sectors because of its existing dual carriageway link
and that is the basis in which i have scored this particular criterion in my table
can you us a bit more explanation as to why you say the first three sectors are better than the last three
in terms of employment
well if i could refer you ma'am to my paragraph three point seven of my supplementary statement erm i do indicate there erm that the factors which make me believe that a location in this sector or these three sectors erm is a better one in far as far as employment is concerned
it's much nearer the strategic road network
the a one the a one m sixty two and m one than any of the other sectors
and erm as i've said before the a sixty four corridor or the a sixty four road is already an existing high quality dual carriageway road
and there is the factor that there is a need to UNK the economy of york generally erm and also erm to ensure that the new settlement has an employment component
both to provide for some self containment and thereby minimize the degree of out commuting
and also as a to form a sort of living erm community where there is opportunity to work locally
mr then mr then mr
michael
in terms of being in the area where people want to live
i d i d from certainly my experience of greater york i don't think there is er i personally feel that all the sectors would be reasonably successful on that basis
erm i d i certainly can see the commercial success of a new settlement in the south east of york or south west of york but that's because it would be attracting UNK from west yorkshire
not because it would be meeting the housing needs of york
certainly we have done marketing studies of a UNK of a set in the north east of york and they show that it would be UNK successful
and it would be attractive to people wanting to live in that area
in terms of the employment in terms of employment the first most important point is of course we are talking about generating employment at a scale appropriate to the new settlement
we're not talking about a major business park for greater york
again we have put in a letter from an agent which quite clearly shows in his professional opinion that a new settlement would be successful
the employment base of a new settlement would be successful
and certainly there is a good deal of empirical evidence to show also that it would be successful
most of the new employment creation around york has been in the northern sector not in the southern sector
it has been UNK successful
UNK airfield is on is the most important example
the a sixty four is capable of generating major employer gen er being attracted to major employers
and i er addressing your attention ma'am to particularly to the erm m a f laboratory which has been established at sand UNK which is a UNK going to be a very major employer located immediately adjacent to well within this particular sector
i'm quite convinced that the a sixty four corridor north east of york would fulfil the criterion which you refer to and i think that in general all the sectors score reasonably well against this against this particular criterion
mr i think
left erm p g twelve and the draft p g thirteen has a thrust of guidance there that erm talks about a closer relationship between the home and the workplace
if you look at appendix five of my statement in which i've identified erm the key employers within the greater york area you'll see that there's a greater concentration in the north and north east as mr has just said
you've got the m a f erm development on the a sixty four corridor
you also have a concentration of retail and leisure development to the north and north east of york in UNK cross your clifton moor and so on and so forth
and clearly i would say that rather than to cross it in that column shown to the a sixty four north that mr shows it should be the UNK and at least a tick if not two
the two sectors being
sorry i i'm
you're
saying to you that the that you should ei that the a sixty four corridor has a close relationship to the existing employment areas
yes
to the north
so you so you would say the a sixty four north would be a favoured one in the context of this criteria
or what we like
absolutely because we've
what we're talking about
that's right because you you've an ability there to locate housing close to existing employment as well as erm leisure facilities and retail facilities and that would in my view would follow on advice in p g twelve and p draft p g thirteen
yeah
