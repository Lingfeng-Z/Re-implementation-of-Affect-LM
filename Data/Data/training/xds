okay fine just for sake because she's going to write the erm minutes from that tape
apologies er virginia and UNK
and so here this rural craft er thing which i wrote for which you asked me which is arriving from the last minutes is i'll read it out to you
all work on display must be british of origin
we appreciate that raw materials may be foreign but it must not exceed thirty five percent of the finished product
this rule is being UNK enforced this year
work outside these limits must be removed
and they say you have to send in some of your product and then they come round to your stand and if it doesn't comply they just take it off your stand which is our whole UNK really
mm
so i think this is a great shame
yes
right well i'm coming back to this subject later on when we talk about er marketing
right that's matters arising from the last minutes any other matters arising from the last minutes
yeah well there's one point on the letter received from the charity commission
yes
can you send them
yes well when you weren't here last time
mm
we have had a letter back and it's exactly the same as i got when i rang them up if they just say it must not exceed a certain amount and they won't be tied down to tell me
there is a letter here
they won't they just said if it UNK a certain margin we recommend that you establish another trading company
and they won't tell you what the safe margin is they just don't
mm copy next meeting that's all
yes well who has got the copy has UNK got it then
i don't know it's just
i think we sent the copy to UNK and UNK i think has the copy
yes and yeah we'll have to give you that copy
can we make a note of that UNK that erm we will need
well it's already in the minutes
a copy
it's in the minutes last time
yes last time we
talked about it
oh i see
but i don't think we have the copy here did we didn't see the letter
no
sorry i
so i think
i think what i'm trying to say is in the minutes that we produced for the last meeting it says that a copy of it will be available for the next meeting
right
that is today
yeah
which UNK isn't here today
ah i see so that's
and she might have she may well be
was going to bring them today
because she only rang up very shortly before the meeting saying that she couldn't come
it's er somebody on business is visiting and they the wife has come and she has to entertain the wife
er something she didn't expect and that's why she couldn't come
so er that has to just wait now until the next meeting
any other things
no shall i go onto the manager's report then
mhm
which they know all about
erm the sixth of the twelve we had radio york here and actually it was very nice because they just introduce our people here you know the craft workers and th you've heard the tape
mm
and they spoke for themselves and i think they promoted us well
and they also three times that day very early in the morning at nine o'clock and at lunch time and always just between the weather forecast and the news i mean when people are switching on
mm
or is it the road conditions or something but peak times
i heard it certainly i heard it just going on in the car
and people have heard it which i think helps us in the long run
but the business we got from it won't be big one lady rang up and said i heard about you on radio york
can i come and buy one UNK
i said of course you can
and when she came she actually bought three
and that's the only customer after all that so i mean
mm
no easy answer
then des and i went to the wine selling party at and at you know made great a great effort and we did very well
sold quite a few boxes of crackers there too
did very well there getting on for five hundred pounds
but everything is harder you know everything is harder
it's not er you have to push for it now
eleventh of the twelfth conservative party fair well that one wasn't much good at all
you know they were sort of they were cheap stalls and the people who came were the bargain hunters
or some people like the s and you know who knew us and had bought already from us
erm i think i sold twenty crackers
lots of gifts
the rest was all gifts
erm then on the seventeenth erm we had our part at my house it was very enjoyable as always but to be honest i almost collapsed i really had it by then
and er mark 's sister and her partner they are professional musicians and they do sort of irish er irish music
and they UNK us and then some carol singers came and we asked them in and they sang carols and the food was nice and everybody really was very happy and that was the start of our christmas holiday
and then i came back on the forth to start off with the UNK which is not on the agenda i think
but let me just tell you we it's all counted it's all written down
one thing pat i still need to know erm what stock we started all the selling
you will know what you made before the christmas fair
mm
yeah that's a figure i need to know
okay
but otherwise everything's written down and we have bought the e of the computer but wendy is UNK herself with it and it's quite hard work
erm and it'll take us a little bit of touch actually now the computer UNK
oh yes er yes and or well i came back and organized the workshop you know did the displays and things like that
and UNK up
and then wendy came back on the wednesday the day after it's just a meeting r
er excuse me please can i have the car keys
you moving your blue car no
no he will take the er the other one
the one in the way
so wendy came on the wednesday and we got going with all the office work here
er mainly the proposal and then everybody came back on the sixth which is quite a long break in christmas but we do need that break till we organize ourselves after christmas
yes i know
i mean things like UNK the boxes and taking it all out of the erm UNK er paper or all that you know just takes time
and then we went to the er pat and i went to the toy fair in harrogate and one little thing has already come
we found a very nice you know we once had this push up horse we now found a push up UNK which is sort of quite nicely coloured and this little spinning top which i think is quite nice
we were going to buy something else but you couldn't do it so i think this is going to be very nice
i mean i feel quite hopeful about our gifts it's always a big problem but i think we'll be all right
erm then er i introduced somebody on the seventeenth for this teaching post for the sewing club which noel UNK told me and donald also rang up and said that we were going to get the money so i i've already employed somebody i haven't got the letter yet
but erm i've told them i haven't got the letter but it should be coming
have you got the money though
i know
but super person we've got unfortunately she might be offered a job at prison to take their sewing on and then she can't do ours
but she's setting it up and she will find us somebody to carry on
and i'm really excited about it and there's lots of interest i think this places are taken up already
it's going to be six people
erm then for of our administration well celia really you should report well you are saying it later on in your report aren't you about the administration skills course
mhm
well i can say it now really four have taken the r s a one exam and did very well though very nervous but er and but they sat there and they did it which was superb i mean we were as nervous as they were sitting in here
mm
erm but we won't get the results till mid march which is a shame
but we think that possibly three passed and maybe and one failed
but we don't know
shirley
we don't know but somebody had a look at it shirley the teacher
er but they did so much better i mean you know nerves really got a bit the better of them didn't it
well that's it's all about exams isn't it
oh yes i mean then er we had the christmas fair meeting of which maybe you want to look at the minutes now
and the minutes were taken by one of the admin students and it was typed
no there
it's part it's part of your pack UNK i gave you papers and you should have in it erm
oh yes
i've got it i've got it
and again just look at the work you know
can i make a point please
yeah
i think you should have a tw a twelfth clause on it appoint a treasurer for the event
and have somebody who deals with all the income all the banking and all the payments out
so you've got the all the cash being handled by one person rather than being UNK together and any other situation where we get
y you mean on the minutes
actually on this
in other words
yes so we'll have that as a point
as a point
i think you need somebody there
i
to deal with it totally
yes
can you
after the meeting dictate that point to celia please
erm
yeah i'll just put it in
appoint treasurer for the event
all aspects
yeah
mhm
could you write that down celia just underneath
detail all receipts and banking
your that we've put that in as a recommendation
yeah
payment of expenses and provision of UNK
yes
i agree with you
it was done by too many people
i agree with you UNK as i really always do yes
can i have a talk to you afterwards
future events erm this saturday a wedding service for jim or the sunday jim
and a wedding for that's UNK cousin
mm
thank you
and er i haven't actually rung her yet
to confirm that
so that's the manager's report
then marketing and advertising
well we've just heard we were had decided to go to the harrogate fair which we can't because our product isn't british enough
erm it will i think leave a bit of a gap
now i have decided and i hope you'll back that up to reduce our UNK production
erm by a bit because we have now moved the monday morning we are going to have the sewing and the people from the monday morning we have put onto the three other days when we make crackers
the people who make crackers on a monday morning we have moved to the other three days so that the monday morning is free for the sewing
the teacher can only come on a monday morning
also it suits me because all the other days weren't always completely full
we are one supervisor short for one day
so now we have a supervisor every day
and er we mightn't produce any less but i would quite like to produce a bit less
i haven't written it completely down here but erm and i want to do more UNK next year
just i'm just talking about you know two hundred less something like that
erm i mean we have some left but i mean they're mainly empty which doesn't matter a lot i mean i'll them for next year
but it's been very hard work selling what we've sold
you know i men sort of you know for very little like the conservative party you know it was hard work UNK all the you know you pack it all up you UNK it all there
and i really and truly when christmas came i the first year i really thought oh i can't do this next year it's getting a bit too much
so i don't want it to depend so much on last minute sales
and what i'm saying is that we make less UNK but with the advertising we're doing at the moment in the magazine and yellow pages and i just want to kind i'm going to talk to you about what other ways of advertising
well let me just start again
we have sold what we did through a lot of physical effort er of a few
you know physical hard work last minute
and i think yes we will do all that but not quite to the extreme and we should try now and sell more during the year and really see how the flow goes
so instead of pushing let's just see how much comes more or less naturally through advertising
there's the figures
the christmas fair account i'm typing now
fine
okay
fine yes
and we have been quite UNK by where's my little list
we've had i think forty five enquiries and definitely one lady wants seventy from sussex or somewhere wants seventy crackers for one wedding
now i'm hoping we get a bit more of that
and what we're doing is if you just look at your pack now everybody who writes to us it doesn't matter what they want whether it's favours of crackers they're getting a brochure which you know our brochure which has the favours and crackers on
ooh i need wendy
wendy that letter we are sending to all new enquiries
erm so they get the brochure which has the er crackers and the favours
and then they get er d i y pack which these two i know you saw that before but this is at the back of it
okay so this is not the price list you're used to this is the d i y price list
and in the d i y price list they can buy here a little pr er trial pack
now on the trial pack we make a bit of money and it would employ somebody you know somebody who's been ill
and people can just buy favours and then the instructions to make the favours are on the reverse side
i don't know how big the UNK is because actually it doesn't make a lot of sense you know it's not that much cheaper
but competitors are doing it
so i think it's a good thing to offer it
and people might actually decide to buy crackers
then we're sending a letter which erm well let me just say we are then also sending now here with the d i y the numbers er UNK here the numbers UNK with the illustrations so if i talk about a certain you have to look at paper one paper two paper three or a b c and you see what they look like
okay
and then as i say they can write off for a pack and they get examples which cost them
and then we are sending this
this is how they can fill crackers themselves
so somewhere there's a big party and o or somebody who wants three or four crackers and put their own gifts in
they can do it this way
and then i'm going to 's on monday they're going to photograph our bridal box and they're going to get a photograph with printed on of our bridal box as well
so everybody gets all that
and then a letter saying you know it's UNK saying dear mrs smith thank you for your enquiry i'm sending you the information you requested and also thought that you might like to have a l a leaflet about our bridal box
favours are given to female guests only crackers could be supplied for your whole wedding party your females guests oh gosh it's UNK
must tell her that
guests or for selected guests only
we can UNK your ow we can UNK your own presents in crackers but you can also choose from the gifts we supply
see brochure
crackers a b c can easily be filled by yourself see UNK instructions
the UNK the charge per UNK is then one pound eighty
erm it is possible to coordinate most crackers in colour and style with favours
you know i'm trying to push more you know
i hope er that you will be able to choose from our wide range of crackers and favours just what you want to enhance your special day
otherwise please send me a colour sample and i will come up with some i was doing it very much i you know the UNK worrying about you
me a colour sample and i will come up with some more design suggestions
i look forward to hearing from you
so they're getting this whole pack which i hope will pay
now do you know could you do me a favour and tell wendy about that UNK because she's just sending them off
now there is another way of advertising and with harrogate not coming off i must say i'm quite keen on this
this is a firm and they've been going for a number of years
they're advertising we'll see them in the yellow pages
all yellow pages all bridal magazines and as you know there are quite a few
and customers of all the pro UNK and UNK shops
the assistants try and make them fill this in
tick services in this area you want
now so we would be here under favours and if we're doing this i think i'm going to say him yes i'll do it if you mention crackers as well
you know tick both
he's quite keen on that hasn't got another favour person
and you can have it is it a two hundred mile radius
er take a hundred
hundred mile radius he says but you can argue with that
and then everything in our area erm no they will send hundred mile area our address to these people and they will tell us that they'll send to these people so we then contact the people as well
and they want the telephone number and he says the best thing is to ring us
and then you can also for the same money which by the way i think is er no i'll let me come to that later
for the same money y they will also tell you of any enquiry in your area because somebody might not have mentioned favours but anybody they know and it's a photographer here as well because they're fundamentally UNK erm they will tell you everybody they know who's going to have er a wedding coming up and then you can write to them
that's in the area
and the shop
i've talked to your cousin she does it with them
yes and she said i can recommend it
our in UNK where we go for our UNK which is an absolutely super place they do it
and they are happy with it
er it's a fifty percent UNK but it co and he says don't you can ch you can just do it for six months of the year
but he's told me the main months
and then you get all these enquiries
now half year costs including v a t two hundred and eleven pound fifty
which i know is all a lot of money and let me just tell you here what we have spent this year on advertising
er UNK and setting up home no that's not the whole year that oh she's just talking what we've spent so far
UNK and setting up home is something like five hundred pounds isn't it
we got funded for that one though
we got funding for one year but next year we're left with it
i think it's something isn't it getting on for five hundred for the whole year wasn't it
i think it was something like that
ah let's ask wendy
yellow pages we pay two hundred and ninety three hundred pounds
bridal fairs i go to we have to pay either a fee for going or put an advert in
er comes easily well we have here two hundred and forty eight but you know say two hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds
so it is a lot of money we're talking about i mean we're five hundred eight hundred if we do this as well we're coming out to one thousand between one thousand three hundred to one thousand four hundred pounds for advertising
yeah well the point is that this is going to generate sales we didn't have up to date
i think that we can
mm but that's weddings i mean that's you're going for weddings
weddings but i'm keen on weddings
yes i know but i mean th ce you're talking about selling the harrogate fair we're losing on christmas
but it doesn't matter does it whether we make christmas crackers or wedding crackers
we don't mind as long as we make i mean i prefer this because it is to order we don't make them to stock
but it is a lot of advertising but then we have to generate the business somehow
we can make in our favour or we can easily make six thousand crackers favours and we've made a thousand
how are you going to evaluate
well erm
cos that's vital you can
yes well quite simply i mean we know all the replies from the bridal magazines i mean we know what we sell at the christmas fair and what we sell christmas UNK wise
mhm
we can easily evaluate erm what we sell through the magazine because we've got all the enquiries and we know how much UNK there was and
but it's there isn't a problem there because you're gonna find out aren't you
if we have the money which really
what doesn't pay you won't do again
you see the problem the problem to generate
you attract so much business that you can't meet
you just say sorry
success is er
yeah but then you
against the advertising say i'm sorry we can't do it
w well
no but i think
success problem
easy thing to cope with yes
it's easier to cope with than failure
would you
dangerous spending far too much on advertising the product won't bear it
yes well there i'd agree with you there
no the favours do bear it
the favours do bear it
well
and ian we haven't got much profit margin on our christmas crackers
mm
but we have a wider profit margin on our wedding crackers
they're differently priced
but i would say to you well the point is this is spending on hope
it's not on something we do at the moment it's wanting to get into a different market increasing
we have the cap we have the capability of producing it
erm we don't so and the way i feel like saying well let's first do the bridal magazine now i've seen how far that goes
another side of me says well let's go for it now
we're all set up we've got it all everything is going let's go for it
got the money
no but
no but you evaluate the return
we what i would say is
could you possibly give ian UNK and me the authority to work that one out
that we sit down with the figures and it might be another thing like we did with the bridal magazines that we go to somebody and say look we would like to do this to increase our turnover will you fund us for half a year
and again like we no we're not paying er personally for our bridal magazine for a year
mm
and get another person to sponsor us for that
how many adverts
that's the one that's the one danger that i see that instead of being led by the turnover of the product we're being led by the funding we can obtain which i think is a is a weakness in the system
it is not really because i was just noel and i just had a chat this morning
i think you have to appreciate here that what we are doing is mainly therapy
and we must make it pay as much as we can
but and we must really work on it but we will have our limits due to the UNK of people due to the UNK
i mean the product might work for you and me and it might not it will work the same for them even if we try our hardest
and but as we were saying earlier on the work in itself is a therapy and that will need funding and we are a charity
and we will always have to be helped
yeah but the point i'm trying to make is that it seems to me that if we're continually spending money on advertising we're creating another problem elsewhere
in other words on we can establish that we yes that's true but we can't necessarily meet it because we are limited on what we can produce
no
no we haven't met that yet
we still have a lot of capacity left
the
that was the point i was making
yeah but the favour we're only touching on what we can do
we have now one girl there once a week
i mean there's a lot more we can do that is fairly profitable the and the whole object of what we're doing here is to get people occupied you know
yeah i'm not i'm not UNK that all i'm saying is the question is whether we're using the monies we're being given to fund it in the right way
no
by spending it on advertising if it's not successful
no
because we would it would be no
no
no
you don't know that do you
no we don't know that
know that so you give it
no but we would this money we spend at the moment er on the bridal magazine was specifically given to test the market by this advertising
mm
and i would again ask to have money given specifically for this you know for this purpose
and not for buying a machine or something
you know it's specific
right
how many times do we advertise in the bridal magazine
twice
twice
the trouble is that we didn't have our leaflets ready because when you d er depend on large firms to help you know they're always just so busy when you need them so it was dragged out
how many enquiries did you have
forty five
and you've got the leaflets out now
the leaflets are out today
how many orders have we had from it
because the leaflets are the enquiries are going to be answered today because only today did the second leaflet come
it's very difficult as well because when
we couldn't answer
you know the thing you do have a wedding in your family you sometimes enquire about these things a year before you actually decide to order six months later
yes
so it's going to be very difficult to
to evaluate it
yeah
i think the
you're quite right
i think the thing that we need to establish is that before you embark on any advertising whatever it is that you have funding for it
oh yes
and then evaluate it from there
but
yes
you cannot embark on an advertising program that isn't being funded by the higher profit made by the product
no
or by funds obtained
no
by grants
so therefore that you need what you need is a clear understanding
yeah
that any advertising must be funded independently
yes
yes
yes
unless with the bridal magazine we've had funding for one year
erm the crunch will come in a year we should you see i'm hoping that i mean the favours are important
and i'm hoping that next year we can afford our advertising
i'm hoping that
but as celia says the trouble is that so many people they will only buy it in a year
they ask now and they buy in a year
but on the other hand a
but you should have i mean you should be able to i would have though in a year
well i've had some telephone enquiries
one as i say for seventy crackers
does that seventy crackers
is she going to follow it up
yes well she's definitely i mean she's ordered
i'll have to
yes she's definitely getting them
and i had three more telephone enquiries e and they were by telephone they're in a hurry you know can you do it until the fifteenth of may or can you do it until february something
you always get that last minute person too don't you
but
well i think most of them will be within the two months of the wedding but there'll be enquiries now perhaps for a wedding at christmas or even next spring
that
wouldn't it make wouldn't it make sense to set aside a figure annually for advertising beyond which you don't go
you agree a figure based on what you
we haven't got the money at the moment we have
well that that's the that this is the real crunch
we haven't got the cash to do that so therefore i think the criteria must be have we got funding before we embark on advertising
the criteria is i think will somebody give us the funding to do this
now i mean i would hate to use the money we've got
we have to get somebody who will pay us this
well then i should let that be your criteria then erm
yes because at the end of the day
but then you also have to evaluate what your priorities are because you can only go to so many people for funding can't you
so you know once you've gone to them no once you've gone to them for advertising you can't go to that person for something else
bits and pieces of equipment
mm so you have you know decide don't you what you want to spend the money on
yes
i know
i know
but there isn't any reason why i suppose if you were looking at the local authority grant it couldn't go into that for advertising
because without advertising
mm
mm
unless you can do it by reputation
well no but that takes
it's too
some time to do
it does yes
it's too slow
you do need to
oh i think it is i think it's essential that you don't take other funds and spend the money on advertising and then
that's right
and then not meet
i think that is fully understood we can't do that
because all our funding is in a way allocated isn't it
erm i mean in another year er hopefully it comes out of the profit margin
i mean eventually sooner or later and it might be later if somebody else will still it has to come out of the profit margin
but it's a chicken and the egg
the business is out there we are set up to do it and i've worked it out and UNK and ian and i of course we have to go through it that eventually we will be able to meet it
but it all stands and falls by it
do you know i mean for so long now we've done it very much on personal effort
and now we're sort of letting it run how a business would
you know if this was my business i would have budgeted for this amount of advertising to be ab i mean you can't sit it by getting at home er you can't get it by sitting at home
erm you need somewhere don't you
mm
mm
and i would have budgeted for that in my own business otherwise it wouldn't come
it's a lot of money for what we're doing
at the same time if we were have a little shop
the christmas fair is the best way of marketing we do but it's limited
you know we will only do so much and we need to do more
so would you give us the authority
it's not worth how much is it to go i'm just thinking of the UNK the cost of advertising
i don't know it's a hundred and fifty or something
ah against
yes that's right i think that's a quite valid point
erm you know if you're going to use your two hundred pounds for your advertising
er granted that's weddings and christmas isn't it you know it's christmas crackers
have we ever
we've never been to
we i have UNK about
but it's always been too expensive you said i think
well it is you see if you want we would need aside no i mean it's a compared with the harrogate one it is not
i doubt you're going to be there for three days though
it's expensive for what you get
i feel again that it's a lot of our actual customers are the same people coming like we had in UNK
yeah well i did wonder about that
that we're not actually and the thing is with advertising here we're selling more than christmas crackers
i mean we hope to sell our erm favours we hope to sell other things
i don't know we could look into that
should we would you like ian UNK and i and does anybody else want to be involved
i think decision has to be made after er consideration and of a few people putting heads together
it's just i'm thinking that you've got your bridal magazine which you're obviously going into and you're going to your bridal sales
erm you are fairly well UNK that specific advertising
i would have thought so myself
er and erm and i just wonder whether you'll get that much more
i mean until you've had a go at the two you can't know
you can't
it is so much easier when the business actually comes through the letter box
well that's right yes
yes i'm sure
and if it comes through the year and we work to order
mhm
much less nerve UNK
i mean this is always dreadful the worry at the end
you know how much have i left and what do i do now
but if but if UNK gets the funding nothing to worry about
no that's true
but we have to see
but i had quite er if you want funding erm there's only so many people out there you better make a success of what you're doing
er if you want to go back to the same people
so even if other people pay for it we will have to be pretty convinced that it will be successful
yes but what you're saying is that if you stay how you are now you're not going to get enough orders
i feel that erm well i think we could cope erm twenty four en enquiries that's two adverts
erm i don't know
i think it needs a bit of discussion to see
what i told UNK though that the other people advertising they're dealing in the wedding dresses so one enquiry could pay for the whole lot for her she's dealing in nothing
i know but then that's our game
well that's just the problem isn't it
that's the problem
it's a very small product
i know i know
it's
it's a lot of money well this is that ian was making in the first place isn't it product actually
can it carry it
yeah can it carry it
but that's the only product
it's tuppence ha'penny UNK really isn't it
we know we can make to that standard
well if we're looking in the wrong UNK if we're looking at general er spread shot advertising i we're in a market which is much UNK than we sometimes appreciate
whereas if we go on the back of something else or somebody else as you were saying on the back of a wedding er brochure or something like that in other words go down a specialized avenue rather than a general one you might achieve something better
but this is
but you see unless you've got first of all as you quite rightly said unless we've tried it we don't know
but th that of itself UNK evaluating the results of what we're doing
and if in fact we haven't got anything and we've advertised in the yellow pages evening press we've advertised in quite a number of other er bridal magazines but have we got information as to the benefits derived from each one of those
and if we haven't we're not really in a strong position to advertise something else
we have
we can evaluate what we have done
the point is that when i go the best thing is wedding fairs where you are seen and talk to people but again that is a lot of effort depends very much
costly
sorry
it's costly too
it's costly but we have to do that as well
but
but is it is it effective that's the main thing
but then there are a lot of wedding fairs and it's in the end you know UNK i mean there can't be any UNK than UNK they just go to extremes in their preparation
and they go to all the wedding fairs
so i if you go to three in the spring the main hotels and three at autumn then very likely all the UNK have seen you
and you can't expand that more
you know there is a limit to how far you get
but all i can say is we people who see us i mean it's not as if everybody has to have favours with their wedding it's still a fairly new thing
we do have you know we sold a thousand favours this way it's not bad
and i just have the feeling w the point is w what that is proving is we're good enough we can compete
now people don't come here and say oh i'll have a look at somebody else they come here and buy
i think it's
very seldom have we had somebody come in
i mean i wonder if we should be spending this much money on another wedding type advertising until we've really had time to evaluate what we're getting from the bridal magazine
well this is this is the this is the point you can make
this is what i wonder
should we not first see how this or should we say look let's go for it now because i mean you know we've been going now some years what another year because
with weddings if you don't do it now you've lost
the time UNK terrific isn't it
this year again you know
and i think it's got to have one year of really high exposure
yes
people get to know your name then as well
i think if you're seen at all the wedding fairs no good just going to one wedding fair
and the same perhaps if you're exposed over a
mm
a in magazines and at wedding fairs you get to be known then
when you're actually get an order do you actually
yes
so if do you have that information on your computer i was think that if you did that consistently over a year
yes well it's mainly wedding fairs
then you just ask the computer at the end of the year and you'll see whether your advertising
i'm telling i'm telling you it's wedding fairs
mainly
there's some yellow pages
but then there's a funny thing yellow pages are some people you get a contact through yellow pages er which is not actually selling crackers but somebody wanted to know about you for something else you know like
but wedding fairs as i say they are at the end of the day limited
you know you'll only you will only get that much for wedding fairs and we are getting that
but at the end of the day
you don't yes
you don't think the other thing is that people who erm you know there is everybody's got wedding fairs in their own area first of all they're going to go to those anyway and buy from their own local person
rather than looking in a magazine and buying something that erm
i was thinking that but the i'm surprised i mean yes
what forty fi well we have a bit more say we have forty eight replies by now
well forty eight people know they wrote away for something
and a lot of people are advertising favours so
but that doesn't mean a thing
no and i can't tell you
doesn't mean anything
they might have ticked it they might write to every
yeah that's quite true
oh i know UNK i'm repeating myself we've just said that
we will not know that in a hurry
i do know though that we've got some definite orders from it already
mm
you know
but
yeah if you follow the sort of logic you were saying though the main business comes from wedding fairs just three in the autumn and three in the winter
it's the around it would it would pay you so what you were saying do six in the autumn and six in the winter and don't do anything else
pay no
one costs fifty to sixty pounds
no because it's the same people
no it's the same people going round
it's the same people who go round six hotels
yeah u
er so you're just
you're not gaining
and costs you money
there is an UNK figure
and it does cost you
you know you can easily spend three hundred pounds er doing that
and i'm all in favour as i say getting more through the letter box it's easier for us and it but i think i mean i'm quite happy to leave this now and just carry on with the bridal but we have to make this pay itself
yes but i
i mean at the end of the year we need to have sold a because these people they need to come for funding purposes
i can't i can't lay off
because that's the whole object they have to come
they're churning out crackers and they're churning them out and they have to be sold
and at the end of the year today in a year we will sit here and we have to have sold it
and we have to get into that market we can't afford too much to hang back
and if i'm saying i really want to do less for the UNK bar now because that was hard pushed
erm then it is though let me just say quickly it is a recognized fact for weddings that you do sell through the magazines
the UNK as i say nothing is too much trouble for them
they read them and yes they send away to several and then you have to score you have to have something better than somebody else
and i think we can compete
but shall we can go on forever shall we leave it for UNK ian and i
i think that's the best thing
to make that decision
and we might very well decide against it but i think one day i would quite like to
yeah but there's a yes but at the same time this way i agree with you i personally would do it if you have the funding and you're going to evaluate it because you cannot lose
but you've got to be strict with yourself
and really make some decisions is it worth
and you've got to know the source of your funds to do it
right so that's that on marketing and
and then the christmas fair accounts if you want to take one
here you go and they've been slightly UNK by ian be for the accountants you know
and i think we still haven't taken the telephone yes we have done now
well yeah i haven't really kept that yet but
no
christmas fair accounts
there are one or two well there are two items in there which haven't really been resolved at this point and that's the i the erm ins er where am i
it's the UNK which is one the twenty one twenty one pounds there
and the telephone calls the forty five ninety two they haven't effectively been paid yet but they are included in the result presumably this hasn't er been finally settled as regards the cash but this is the result
but the UNK have been paid for haven't they we have
have we
that went today
yeah it wasn't included
well in fact it showed it as an outstanding amount
mm yeah
this is why and one of the real problems with this is it's not that i'm UNK it's just that if in fact you've got somebody who was appointed as a treasurer you can in fact get more information out of it instead of having to guess what we got from where and how it came in
at the moment i've had to er shall we say adjust certain figures because in fact er i haven't got the details
but this is the result and i think it's very UNK
what we are not sure is that at the end of the day it doesn't matter all that much what exactly was the raffle and what exactly was the entrance fee because we didn't keep a note of that
erm i have a feeling the entrance fee was
it doesn't change the bottom line
it doesn't change it doesn't matter so much the only thing is it'll be interest how many people came
yeah well that'll have to be adjusted
erm
let's put it that way
yes
well it would have to be very strictly UNK to then next year
yes
somehow
i mean the thing happened the float indeed was just split
well ian is quite UNK it happened because people UNK and UNK got the job on the day and it wasn't quite clearly said my fault not quite clearly said exactly count the money UNK and
yes she was m UNK
it comes with a letter which i can't find you know telling them about us
ah
these are our figures now and then UNK can take over
erm
we're on number six now aren't we
this you should have had you should have had this with the manager's report
they're late
okay this is part of the manager's report
oh you've got one
oh she does she
the one that you were talking about
no this is was part of the manager's report
you've got one are you looking at the christmas fair
no this is late
we've had that now
this is part these are the figures you'd normally have with your
yes
with your erm
oh i've got two
he's got mine then
i've got i've lost everything now
i've lost my
are we still at the erm trading accounts for the christmas fair or have we move on
we have to come back to that in a minute okay
because er we had not my accounts the trading accounts
okay
right well the next one well seven and eight actually are one and the same
what is that i've lost my
it's to do with self employment
yeah just an update and the sewing
should i quickly do that
yeah
erm well as you know noel came and said there's spare money have you got an idea
and i said yes this self employment
now UNK has given me great help and everybody sort of helped er you know i've discussed it with everybody and we've almost finished erm a really good proposal i think
i think it's really well written and i'm very happy about it because i've got it out of my system because when i first started that was my aim
so as soon as it's ready we will sent you a copy and please read it
i will send you a copy before it actually goes off and read it and ring me UNK if there's anything you don't understand or you don't agree with okay
is everyone fully aware of what the self employment
well i explained it last time didn't i
and the sewing course i mentioned earlier we are getting the money and we've discussed that already and it's all set out
erm yeah
you don't want to say anything more on the self employment
no but i just know that i've forgotten something to say
questionnaire to go with that
oh very good questionnaire UNK did and we've almost done it
we'll send you a sample of all that
very well done i think it all erm there was one other thing i thought i would ask
it will hopefully come back to me
right okay
fine
well the next one is er ignore number eight because it's
training for wendy
yes
now wendy is struggling hard with the book keeping
and with the er stock control
it's very hard work for her er you know she has to sort of get a get all the systems she has to you know it's very hard work to get the systems going
now she is g has put herself down no UNK
she has put she's put herself down for one day at the end of her accounts to learn about accountancy and as ian pointed out it's not a lot
er to learn accountancy but
it was a bit a bit m a bit stronger than that but carry on
but she's a very intelligent girl and she's got a head start because ian has taught and she's self taught her through UNK
erm and this man said you know what we are very aware of is trial balance sheets you have she needs to know the exact format
and i think she can learn a lot there and i mean s you know she is she is erm
this is a this is a new item how did this come about
are you saying that the package
the pack the UNK package has arrived
yeah
but it's mainly to erm present it to this committee the trial balance sheet she doesn't quite know how to do that and altogether she feels she just wants she says how she's doing it now at least she wants to check out with somebody is she doing it how they would do it
so she's going for a day there
and i mean this is what self employed people do you know they go and they get taught there and then that's it and then they the rest they have to teach themselves
so i'm very pleased you know i suggested it to wendy and wendy agreed that
what is that costing
it's costing nothing the day
it's just the day it takes you know
right
that's where right fine
and the other thing is i am really asking you to give wendy two more hours a week for the next three months and then review it
because once she has got the disciplines in place she it should l take less time but at the moment she is really UNK
she does work seventeen to nineteen hours here a week and she takes her work home
mm
and she's paid for eleven hours
and she's working very hard i mean wh yesterday she was here at six o'clock so i was long home and wendy rang from here and she was still here
so please will you consider for three months out of our funds which has to be the to pay her that amount of money or else we cannot cope
because i can't take it off her i don't know how to do it
nobody is there who can she has to do it
but she also has to learn it
and it's asking too much at the moment
i was gonna ask is you know that he ha she has to do all these long hours
er these hours th just developed over time or is just the work that's go
the work
increased
oh yeah
are we asking her to do things that we weren't
oh yes
oh yes
i mean we've tried to write down everything she does but it's so varied i mean telephone calls and she has to do telephone calls
at the moment she has typed this proposal for me
you might think well that's not take long
but i mean we've been going over and over that proposal
you know it's not just once typed
you know we've corrected it and gone on about it and discussed it
we have things like appraisals to do she has e i mean i can't tell you all i can is i'm working at the side of her she works all the time she's very fast she's very intelligent
she can't cope with the time she has
but we want to review it after a few months because as i say once she's got herself organized it might be alright
also if we do this self employment i'll ask for more admin time
so you're saying after three months the work will get
easier hopefully
we will have to see
see at the moment she has to learn about UNK you know
she had to learn about accountancy
mm
now she has to learn about stock control
erm but once she's got it in place what do you think ian
i mean hopefully then it will take up less time
well yes i suppose that the thing is if she's having to work extra hours she ought to be paid for them
mm
we can't expect her i mean she's very good UNK
it's as simple as that i mean we can't expect her to do it
mm
and i think she'll still do lots of time on top
but er i think we can't nobody else can do it and it has to be done
is there room for payment from the erm money that we're getting from
no not really er yes already she's already got two hours
she does she does she cos she does work
we've already got to pay her two hours
the money is not specific to any
no exactly
it's overall you know so if we choose to direct some money for
yes but then we are short in the admin course
yeah
or the rest i mean in general
you know er it has to come really out of the christmas fair or sir 's donations something UNK
we have the money
and then we have to review it again and er
well i think as ian says there's no real choice is there
no there isn't a choice no
well are we agreed then
okay
anything else on that's it on the
that's it
so you're saying after three months you want to review it
review it after three months and see how we are coping then
but that'll take up some
she's now eleven that will be thirteen paid hours
also we are hoping to get people from the admin course to help with the
but unless she's got it in place you can't do it
they cannot work on their own
no
and they can only work once
it's properly set out
yeah
it's not helped that
they couldn't come and run the office on their own if somebody else wasn't here not yet
so really the admin course doesn't really make is not going to reduce any hours anyway
it could do depending how much how much they could be delegated
but i don't think they could you couldn't say come here UNK your door you know
right there'll be some work for you to do
like a junior UNK
yes
they'd need erm
but UNK but what i think would happen when we get maybe mike or chris or somebody helping it's not that they're taking work off wendy but that we will do more physical checks do you know what i mean with the stock control
wendy will do the computer bit and they'll do the counting bit
that kind of thing
and erm somebody like mike of chris is perfectly capable of get their bits of paper to check to tick off things like that but wendy will have to check it and put it you know they could do some of the UNK but not yet
no
it has to be ready for that okay
yeah i think any anything that's on the computer needs to have the input prepared beforehand
now some of the inputs been prepared production of crackers the production of sewing material things like that
incoming material for stock movements of stock they can all be done by people on the admin course providing you can set a form up and say go and do this
and then UNK just go to put it in the machine and the list of it
mm
mhm
okay
right you've already covered the sewing ian treasurer's report
well i think there is the only report that i've got is the fact that the financial summary er you've seen at the same time as i have
you see this is what we haven't got at the moment
erm we need erm this er trial balance sheet i recommend every second committee making which makes it every three months
that's normal and that's what wendy has to learn to do or else it's you know it's difficult for somebody else to if ian did it he would have to get all the figures first
so that's what wendy has she's going quite soon
i think the truth of the matter is that what the committee needs is this information that we've got in front of us
mm
it's a question of the format of it
yes
in other words we need to know what we've received what we've spent and where it belongs i within the organization
right and that's what she doesn't know at the moment
and we also need a you know the stocks that we're holding at the end of every month
because in fact if we're holding far too much stock we ought to do something about reducing it because it's all
yes
tying up cash
and it's the cash flow
i would recommend every three months
that we have a trial balance sheet every three months
but you'll naturally have more stock won't you at the beginning of the year
we have times though before er before our christmas fair we have maximum stock
it builds up to that
now we are low on stock
and it builds up
now we're low on stock
mm
but you know the
the most we have is before christmas
can i just quickly erm i know what you mean i know what you mean
sometimes it'll look worse than it is
yes and the committee has to learn to adjust themselves to that to that to not worry
well there's an explanation for it
yes
yeah
but we ought to be aware of what values we're holding in various
yes
because it will be er it will be cut down is the word into finished products and raw stock
so if i before christmas you should have a lot of finished products which won't worry you
mm
mm
because it's just a matter of selling them
can i just go back on this i mean you say this is how we want it does this
no
actually tell me what the cash flow is
no that's just what we're saying
this is some information which is useful for you but we need a trial balance sheet every three months which wendy at the moment
well why do we have wait three months
yes it should be it should be available every time we meet
because that is
the thing is that what we need and what's missing from this is in fact the balance that was available at the time we started this period
in other words over the last six weeks
i know
er and that's what missing and in fact we've now got a balance figure at the end there but er i'm not too sure what it means
no
but if in fact we knew where we were starting from we could see the movement from the last period the period and we've got an explanation of what that means
yes i know
we are very aware of that
that's what we're aiming at and that's what hopefully she will come up with
this is very quickly which i didn't have before my way of doing the trading account and ian was going to UNK because he said there's no need to put exactly but for us it's quite interesting to see that
if you want a quick look at that
that's the christmas fair only and next time i will give you the rest of all the selling parties
i've always done that
these little UNK the go round don't they the
yes we did go round
did you work these back from the stocks in
how did you work them out
well i counted ev this is only the christmas fair okay
yeah
i counted er well tom counted everything going out
but i also counted the crackers going out
er because that was easy there was always full boxes
and er then everything after the fair went to my home and i counted every everything
i wrote it down but i c i did only do that for the christmas fair
erm the rest is going to be more difficult
but so i spent quite some time over that
and it was quite interesting to see
erm tom has a different er starting number of crackers but that is because i filled some more up
but i have a note of that
so what was the overall income on the er
two thousand sixty eight
no there was also income from the doors
oh well yes you were away
oh well you will have a little when you're dealing with little items you do get a difference
no but i mean things broke
and you somebody said you thought you saw somebody steal something
oh yes
i couldn't believe it but
adult or child
pardon
adult or child
pardon
mm
really something of ours
mm yes oh in fact the favours
because that was super light and they took them
er and was it said she saw somebody take a cake
a UNK
a cake
gosh wee UNK it can't get any worse now
right i'm in a hurry can we get on
it's i would like to spend some money can i mention that now then
i'm trying to i'm trying to tie this erm
actually that's something you're gonna have to watch isn't it
mm
theft
you wouldn't think
it'd pay to come in that they would steal
oh
i mean the pound in can't be worth the
UNK unbelievable
mm it just UNK
be a UNK and then you find out
yes
yes
can i just on this christmas fair i know some of the sort of accounting of money was erm well not exactly brilliant
i are you likely through next this coming year set up
no ian has just mentioned that
we have one person in charge of ever
with you and UNK may i say
hassle about
raffle and door
and it is not a serious mistake because all we are not sure about is what was raffle what was door
that's the only thing
er which at the end of the day cause all the money was UNK
erm
it wasn't as though any went missing
and it's either in the raffle money or in the door money
the two together are in correct amount
it's doesn't matter but ian has suggested that next time we appoint a treasurer who has the account
in actual fact there was no mistake made i was just purely asked to bag the money
well i think that's what we were doing
and we did it and we did it jointly for security that we agreed the figure
no mistake was made
because i was never asked to
i mean i was asked to keep my sewing money completely separate
i provided my own float i had nothing to do with any of the money
no
right
and then but then at the end er you know i think you said oh but UNK says it all has to put together
yes
but fortunately i did write down
yes
what mine
because i mean i because she had asked me originally to keep it but i keep mine all separate until you asked me for it
yes
no
it was all UNK together
she was very concerned then
are you trying to tell me it was somebody's fault
no it was nobody's fault
i can believe that
it was it was that everybody needed the money then we and it all went in one pot
ian is correct it was the chairman's fault
so next nest year
he should have known or whoever organized the fair should have known so really it doesn't work unless you make one person responsible for that job
but you i think i think w er well it's no good saying it now but i don't think you can ask one person under the heat of all that to count up separate
no
no
nobody's saying that
i think it could be the individual person
no
no
no
no
no what can i can i just say well i'm what the treasurer of an event like this needs to do is to note down the source of the cash he receives to note where it's coming from different products how much is being received from that
yes but that's i think that UNK quite right what should have happened was just as UNK said to me originally you keep your sewing money separate
yeah
the person doing the raffle should have their money separate
yes fine
the person doing the door
the that's how it should happen and one person is simply in charge of taking that and making a note of their amount
they say is the door
needs to receive all those things
but you wouldn't have time to count each individual pot
well the raffle people certainly wouldn't
with the person
no but
but the person is responsible for their
the person keeps
i was responsible for mine
i counted mine completely
i had
pat had the same as the trading people we knew what we took
yes
so we could give it all to you and you could bank it
yes but it's rather um
and then the person doing the raffle the person in the door should have been the same
but it's rather unfair on the person if he's given all this money
from five different sources and one person makes a mistake of ten pounds which is easy to do
you add it up and there's ten pounds missing
and everybody says well i gave you a hundred i gave him five you
can i please because i have to be off in a few minutes
well i am i am i am quite sure that the person who's actually if you appointed them treasurer has got the authority to be able to say there was ten pounds difference i'm knocking it off the door and that's it
we're going around in circles
all we we've agreed that we're going to need someone to control it at the next fair
yes i think that's fair enough
okay
you'll definitely need somebody to appoint
right erm
ian UNK going to be best at it
i have to be off so soon come on what now
erm sorry to come back again to this financial summary
so are we saying after all these balances are done that statement at the very end of december therefore
therefore the cash flow situation isn't four thousand in trading committee trading account of seven thousand seven hundred in the committee account at this moment
well no we're not saying any such thing we're saying that this format is not very helpful and that wendy is learning is going to learn format that is better
and who is deciding on the format
there is a set formula to do it and she has to learn it
she don't know how to do it
and she has to learn how to do it
basically all we is that the movement from the various accounts should be known
in other words you've got the trading account which is how 's trading the committee account the petty cash and the wages box are part and parcel of the trading but they're kept as separate UNK within the organization
yeah
now then all we're doing what we should have done is that we should have had an opening balance at the UNK or the end of december when the di information was first struck
and then any movement since then is identified either as expenditure or as income
right
and the final balance represents the position at the end of the or should do
that's basically what we're aiming for
now this is the first time i've seen these and i can't say whether they're right wrong bad of UNK all i can say is that this was the intention
so that the committee are aware of the movement of cash from one period to the next
so you haven't had sight of this before today
no it's only just come
okay
oh well okay the other we've got to do is be in the situation where you've had a look at it before we all see it
yeah well why that happened oh i think it was just pressure of work you know she had so much else to do
and it needed to be entered before she knew
okay but all i was just saying is that it would be helpful that before we that ian has seen through these
look every time we've done it that's what we also do it goes out on the manager's report w with the minutes or with the agenda
this was the first time and it was pressure of work that we haven't done it for you to see it earlier this is not normal so just forgive this one time and we needn't spend any more thought on it because next time it going to be different and it always has been different
okay
but this is the format
okay
yes i know
yes
right
erm
last item we wanted
what is it
you wanted to erm propose some purchase
yes but should first celia report on the admin
well erm
and let me just say one thing before celia talks about the admin course and that is
not a lot to say really
let me but let me just say one thing
i really want you to know what a fantastic job UNK done
that admin course is fantastic a re er you know i was in this r building yesterday and i can tell you the attendance is good i mean they have to have a real reason before they don't come
their faces change they're gaining so much they're contributing
the way they react
we've got one chap who's UNK can you imagine and he takes part
we have another chap who's just joined who is so shy i mean UNK knows him and he's contributing and sitting there and typing
i as a result of that exam unless you know the scene you don't know what they have achieved
er and that they sit two hours doing e and exam you know for somebody who can watch at all
because their concentration is so bad
it's been wonderful and it is a lot of we have got two super teachers that they are UNK by celia
and celia comes and she's UNK and she does the admin with them she UNK it and i just personally i'm just so grateful the best thing which has happened to me
and i really want officially to thank celia for what she's done
that's nice of you
it it's a group effort as most things are here and er pat will realize for all the volunteers that come in
can i just say margaret started and she's going to be brilliant
she fits in so well
mm
erm she's doing numeracy power with them at the moment before she gets on to the because i believe she's got to sort out some programs for as yet
and sort out the computers but the thing is she may be able to get some more up to date computers
well strange enough rang me up
oh really
last week or the week before who works at UNK
got this erm phone call
we actually haven't got any erm machines now because all the ones
i didn't know they were coming from she never said she UNK just said i'm just holding out for some
oh well her husband works in the
yeah
ring me up and asking i understand you anyway to cut a long story short he was basically saying well do you know of any computers
and i said well we've already asked before and the ones that we got were the ones that were thrown out
any other ones i've already put in a request through peter and as and when they become available they will be given out
mm
erm but there aren't any specific ones that i'm aware anyway that er
and those were the ones that margaret was after
oh well that's now we know
er well she can work on these but she just thought if we could get some more up to date ones
mm
erm sh because apparently if they do go in an office they'll find these are far slower than anything else they would ever work on
yes
in any other office now
the thing is they are slow you've got to remember to wait and you know you
yeah i mean they're UNK all of the machines at work but what they're doing is instead of throwing them out those who don't use p cs that often are being given the slower machines and those that as part of their job function they need something much faster have been given the UNK machines
so unfortunately there isn't a UNK of redundant p cs
well i mean in a way it would be nice to have one more new one
which possibly
if funding UNK run to it
because when margaret gets going we'll have the good on in the office which super but it would be rather nice to have another one
which er can i possibly carry on from there and if you we have to talk about
now as far as they know their money is coming
er we have sent them you know a as you've said just sent the letter back
we haven't heard since then
er UNK has tried to ring i have tried to ring we have had no you know we never got the person in
i think it'll all go ahead and we'll get the money but meanwhile before we knew about we did do a lot of fund raising and we got some money in er i suppose something like a thousand pounds
and we've written back that we might get money from but can we use it for i e buying chairs and other things or for the general welfare
and they've said yes we can keep the money
and i would like to buy two chairs for the favour room you know chairs to sit on cos at the moment we have to always go and get them from the er UNK room
and so you know we just need to chairs up there
the other thing is that the cars in the yard have been UNK broken into
and that you know is worrying me
i mean our building wasn't touched but i somehow always thought they wouldn't come there because they were so trapped but they did and they spent quite a lot of time trying to get those cars going
when did this happen
over the weekend
this weekend
really
yes
yes
and it worried me to that extent that i almost went without your okay and rang up terry and said please fix those blinds because we have got blinds which cost almost two hundred pounds or something and or a hundred and nineteen pounds and it seems they can't fix them
it seems i keep running them under UNK nose
well what are they for then are they
they are these plastic blinds and they need UNK cutting at the side
they're just UNK
and also i mean i don't want a UNK and i really recommend we get somebody for well i don't want to tom to cut the sides like that with UNK you know it has to be neat
and i'm recommending that we get er terry to fix them
also we do need a shelf you know in the office wendy has a shelf above her at the side above and we really need another shelf underneath to store things
erm and i was thinking or UNK was thinking of a bell in your
internal bell just to frighten them off
because otherwise they could ba
well once they get in here
yes well you mean not an actual alarm
they're home and dry
they'd just smash the whole place up
yeah
but a bell
where you're talking about an alarm
oh no not an alarm it's be too expensive no just an internal bell to frighten the hell out of them
and i think terry would
it wouldn't it wouldn't interfere with the neighbours
so what do you mean by a bell trying to UNK what you mean
yes
well like i mean we all know what a bell is a bell which is set off by a human body coming in
by the lock if possible
oh it's like on the front door
every time somebody walked in
or the best thing is they
yes
what happens if she does it on a weekend will we just have a key
well hopefully with the key because otherwise
yes
the people can't get themselves in
exactly
i would think
the front door key
if you open the front door
the front door key close it and then and then UNK it
and i take it would have to be UNK
you'd have to have a UNK going down the corridor and one in the back because they'd come in the back they wouldn't come through the
yes that's right i just can't think how you'd
erm we have an idea about that
erm we have a burglar alarm
well it's fine as long as you actually tell people
everybody who had a key i mean if there was a number to or something to do they have to know
yes but er can you just
there's nothing to key in
switch that off a minute
can you just switch the machine off
erm
er if it's in the hall er we've got it in our hall and you just plug in and set it on and then if anybody opens a window the alarm bell goes off
it just and it just switches off you know
it's a bit too sophisticated for here
every window to be UNK up
oh no you don't wire anything up
it's just plugged in
i thought you i thought you said if you opened the window
yes but it isn't from that
erm it's just a change in erm atmosphere in the house
but not the front door
no well that's infra red really
what about the door
er well it does it's not connected to anything
all it is it's plugged in the hall and it is just a box a little box about this big and we just er it's just worked on the different
just a movement of air really that's all it is
therefore once you everything UNK and you switch it on at night or in the day anytime as soon as somebody opens the door the bell will go off
it's not UNK to anything that's why we
well how do you stop i mean how do you put it off though when you somebody
well you just switch it it's a switch on the top
but you see it doesn't help us because anybody getting in who knows about the box
will just switch it off
gets in and switches it off
it has to be connected with the front door key
that you need the front door key
because goes for the key
ah but wait a se oh because they wouldn't have the key
what about a pad under the front under both UNK at the
yeah but again people who aren't here too many people would know that it
mm
but again we can go on forever
can i would you give me permission to
but do make it simple
simple
because you could soon run into five or six hundred quid
i know i know
and you mustn't have outside bells mustn't have outside bells here because you'd get so much opposition from those people
because they go off at everything
yeah it wants to be just enough inside here that it UNK them
i agree
and i say let's get terry wilson to do it because you know he's on the
no i well it's oh he has an electrician
yeah
yeah
oh well he most probably
and it's three little jobs and let him do it
get UNK
do you a do you know exactly what it's going to cost you
you'll just have to get them to give you a quote
but i am so worried now that i really would say okay i'll discuss it with UNK but let's not wait until the committee meeting next committee meeting let's do it as soon as we can
and also i think now that that's happened i don't think it'll be long before there'll be another
no
is everything insured
everything's insured but just thing the mess they could make
it's the vandalism
you know
the computers
they are insured
they're all co
i don't think the cheap ones are
our good one is
i though we'd specified that
maybe we have yes
but we need to check
well i mean you have to get them it's the little money you would get for those you'd have a job finding
i mean everything would be in a mess
i mean you want to avoid
don't forget UNK do have it at the back
it's the office and it's those two rear
oh i know i know
rooms
well i will ask you when the time comes
now i'm just thinking so we got a thousand pounds here i would like to spend this money
but what is worrying me is
is talking about a specific period at the moment i hope you realize that the committee is paying all the admin costs in the hope that we are getting the money from
i mean we had a definite offer and it's all paid much later that the money is coming and then the committee will get the money back
er and nothing should happen but we haven't heard but also after that date we are high and dry again so i would quite like to keep as much in the kitty from the money we've raised for the admin course you know the future of the admin course as possible
at the same time this needs spending
where has this thousand pounds come from
we have applied to general accident to erm oh a few people
yeah
i don't know the exact figure a thousand pounds is r it's round about that
and it wasn't earmarked for any specific items
it was earmarked for the admin course we asked will you fund a student for the admin course
and then we wrote back to them and said we are very likely getting funding from in which case can we use your money for other purposes er well one reason specifically said chairs
erm ta we need tables more than chairs
in there they can't get their legs under those tables
oh that is so true
the tables are very erm old fashioned wooden ones and sort of you know how you get your legs under sort of well like a bottom lip
and that really it's all the chairs are good office chairs in there the tables are bad
right
er can you well hopefully in the minutes i need to can somebody make a note we have to fund raise for that
erm we need tables i mean chaps like mike and roger with their big legs they just can't under them
they just can't get their knees in
and we have to do that we must get tables
UNK must have hundreds of tables
the sort of metal tables that have just got the four legs
i would try there
to get the proper computer tables sorted out
except if you got computer tables it just seats one computer on it don't forget we have
we we're really better with bench tables like that then we can put either UNK
anyhow we can go into that
these are these are tables we got from somewhere
oh i wouldn't mind UNK out
no
we needs to look i mean
no
just two like that metal tables but metal with nothing underneath
but celia let us look at tables because i saw some which can take UNK and computers
and there was a track electric track and all that
i think er it's UNK why i say no to that the we tom and i have measured it out and celia
it's very tight to get in what we need to get in and we have to buy just the right tables
so i think for the time being if you allow us we will find out which tables we want and then we will fund raise for them and get the money for them okay
we also sally and i were talking about this last week we said often you know you get you can get bankrupt stock
oh you do
now we need an optimistic accountant can somebody look out for an optimistic accountant
there isn't such a thing
no but celia UNK told me her husband has to do with bankrupt office stock
mm
remind me okay
there's some possibility there
no
so wh are you saying that all this stuff you want for the admin course you're gonna raise money separately or do you want to
well we're just i'm just we might have to ask for some money for it
no the money i want to spend i've partly already written back and said can i use this money as we don't need it can i buy chairs i was specific
cos that was a big amount and they said yes
and others there's money here which we got for the admin course which can spend
all the christmas fair money
but i think this is the big thing we want to fund raise for
and we would very likely get it
i know who's going to give it us we'll get it
we need we need
yeah
the other thing is you know noel came they had some money what do you want actually i could ask them because he also said things
we must make a list but
a long one
the point is
that this will happen people will come to us occasionally and say do you need money for what specific and i think as a committee we must have a future a list for the future of things we might want and also of ideas we have
like now luckily i had these two ideas running in my head anyhow
do you know but you have to be so quick and you have to be precise and you must know that that's what you want
so i think we should learn to plan to have a plan a future plan
sort of things we can tick off as we need them
but didn't we do this
so that when comes up we've always got an answer
well no i mean two years ago when we did this we actually had a list of things that you identified
yes
you wanted
i think perhaps we need to do that as part of the planning for each year's budget
i mean i know in that budget thing that we put together towards the end of last year we didn't really look at it
yeah well we did actually
both those ideas now said were in our future targets
no i'm talking about i'm talking about bits and pieces for the place we did
yeah bits and pieces
yeah
yeah
set aside an amount of money or identified that we would need to spend an amount of money and perhaps we need to do that sooner
yeah we have to we shall do that quite soon i think
and if i may just that's the last thing i need to say is the christmas fair dates somehow were UNK up and somebody put the wrong dates to the day it's wednesday the sixteenth and thursday the seventeenth
okay
sixteenth and seventeenth
can you just give me the name of the person who has the
oh
mr
where is
the
opposite
i'm leaving all my mess here because i'm coming back after my meeting
is there anything else erm you know UNK which we should do or pass on
erm no
well we're not having much joy with these people from i mean i've rung them about four times in the last er week
the lady who i was trying to get hold of who's actually got the contract that er we want amended for some reason i
i did try i was gonna try before i came here but i was
so i'll try again but i think you're gonna have to telephone erm not telephone write to mr directly
we're not you know we're not getting anywhere
it's not moving very quickly is it
no
that's a long time since they said we could have it
oh well it was er this committee meeting er when you were away
before christmas
no er the money had been UNK long time november it was october
ah it was but it was UNK but we had to sign a contract with them
yeah okay
and then the solicitor asked us to advised us to have certain things amended and mr had no problem when i told him over the telephone he just said send it back and we'll just amend it
well it sounded so simple when he said it over the telephone about two months ago
but
and somebody has been er is dealing with it
well they have a contracts department that deals with all these are funding issues
and i presume it's just sitting on someone's desk which is still being processed
it'll be a nice lump sum when we get it won't it
yeah but as i say don't forget we're spending it already
erm
right is that is that all
is that all
right i've put that here because i'm coming back you see
when are we meeting again
oh yeah good question
another six weeks
when is that
of march
oh sh
and thank you so much everybody and mainly for putting up with me
cos you're going away in march aren't you
to germany
i just hope virginia doesn't get ah yes i'm going to germany
you could have one committee meeting without me then
we'd have to have another one
tonight
yes i leave on the eleventh of march so can we have it on the eight of march
is that okay
because i've got now UNK
that's a tuesday the eighth isn't it
oh no wednesday the ninth sorry i got wrong
well yes you can
i will
UNK can't do it on a wednesday any more
no there will be UNK now that i won't be able to come at all
yeah
you can't come on a wednesday
which day can you come
no it's it works every two weeks i have to check it doesn't fall into that
otherwise we have it a week
yeah
well thank you so much
thank you
i know it's a dreadful UNK struggle with us but i it ca it just is that hard
mm
you know
it's probably going to get harder
i'm telling you we work hard i know we can get better organized but we do work very hard and we have to work on so many UNK
well you're running a full blown business with erm
not only is
and a UNK centre
you know and it's erm
and the fund raising all the fund raising
and a college so no wonder it's hard
yes
it's very hard
switch this off shall i
it's still going round
well i have to dash
UNK because when the cuts come it's the special need support that many of these groups need that was the first to go
it was the help with literacy and numeracy it was the help with english as a second language it was the initial training that helped to boost an individual's confidence
these policies have ruined the opportunities and dreams of thousands of people throughout this district and have been carried out with no regard to the drastic effects they have had on people's lives
but wait on the political horizon there comes a general election
panic in tory party central office
what can we do to make it look like we care about the unemployed
what can we do to make it look like we actually care about training
the first thing you do is announce half way through a year that they're gonna put back some but not all of the money they cut from the budget
there is no guarantee that this money will be available next year so training providers are now UNK around trying to work out ways of providing training up to the required standard in six months instead of the full year
this from the party of so sound finance and forward planning
what else do the tories do
they try and hide some of the total mess they have made
they take some of the money they have cut from the training budget and use it to fund employment action
one of the most UNK and UNK pieces of political UNK we have seen for some time
employment action is a scheme that will take people off the dole queue and put them into full time work for benefit plus ten pounds
with the best will in the world no one could refer to it as a training scheme
a confidential department of employment memo states the scheme will have only a minimal training element
even the tech which has UNK the fact that it has pushed hard for a greater training element has only been UNK able to include such elements as health and safety job search an enhancement of skills relevant to the job that is being done
one of the biggest UNK of the whole idea is that the tech proposals talk about using employment action in skill shortage areas
this is totally UNK
if you have a skill that's in short supply you go and work for the proper rate for the job
if you don't have the skill employment action will never give you those skills
UNK for the scheme is defined in such a way as to exclude the very people who've been worst hit by the cuts and to UNK the UNK influence on the unemployment figures
women UNK and those people on disability benefits are excluded from taking part in the scheme even if they wanted to
the timing of the launch means that ther if there is any sort of take up it will have the greatest effect on unemployment figures between march and july
it's no coincidence that this is the likely period of the next general election
the scheme is funded for eighteen months only and this means that the numbers will start to drop in october UNK and that is the only good thing about this scheme because it'll make it easier for the next labour government to abolish it
employment action has no stated aim except to provide the long term unemployed with an up to date reference
unlike the government training schemes funding is not UNK upon people finding jobs or gaining qualifications
there is nothing in it for the participants except the opportunity to work for low or no wages
the effect on those who are employed in the areas of work that employment action will concentrate on will be to increase unemployment and force down wages
participants will not have the same protection as employees and trainees as far as the health and safety at work act is concerned
they will not be covered by the race relations and sex discrimination act
they will not have the right to go to industrial tribunal for legal UNK
do the tories really expect a responsible council to take part in such a scheme
where are these participants gonna come from
who in this room would be willing to work full time for the equivalent of benefit plus ten pounds
the government have painted a picture of willing participants lining up to take part in this scheme
this is pa at least in part due to the glossy advertising that they've launched at a cost of a quarter of a million pounds a week
but if as i believe is the case the scheme fails to attract anybody then what are the government's alternatives
they can either admit they've made a mistake or they can make it compulsory
they had to get rid of a leader before they could bring themselves to admit that the poll tax was a mistake and i can't see john major going before he loses the next election
so it's more likely that they'll make it compulsory
work by another name
we've already seen it happen with the youth training
we're seeing it happening with adult training and this is all from the party that talks about choice
in this district there are hundreds if not thousands of unemployed pe people doing the socially useful work as the tories like to describe it
they are running our tenants and residents associations
they are working in the voluntary sector and they're supporting charities
the problem that the tories have with this is that they still appear on the unemployment figures
employment action was not designed to help the unemployed
it was designed as a desperate attempt by a desperate government to dig itself out of a mess of its own making
it is trying to hide the fact that it's policies have bought pain misery the pain misery and hardship of unemployment to thousands of people in the district and millions throughout the country
we as a council are not willing to take part in this UNK scheme but we'll we will continue to work to provide high q quality real training to the people of the district and to work with business and industry to develop real jobs
norman UNK said unemployment is a price worth paying
come the next general he'll be able to judge the value of that UNK statement himself as he and the rest of his cabinet are replaced by a party that has policies to develop real training and employment opportunities for the people of and for the country and that will be a labour cabinet and a labour government
thank you
councillor
nothing that this council will debate today will show the UNK face of the labour party more than this one
sitting across on the opposite benches it is the labour party who shed UNK tears for the unemployed
if the truth be known the majority of labour councillors just like their socialist friends at westminster show more UNK to the trade unions than to the unemployed
labour like to talk about unemployment but while the conservative government works to bring unemployment down the labour party are UNK policies to put the unemployment rate up
and how they dare to care about the unemployed when they would price people out of work strike people out of work and tax people out of work
hear
how can a group be taken seriously or be considered concerned when it openly UNK co operation with this two hundred and thirty million pound scheme which will very substantially increase the number of opportunities for the unemployed in britain as a whole and in particular
to suggest that employment action is merely to massage the unemployment figures is a UNK excuse for the labour group to it's conscience
a great deal of UNK talk exists around the subject of unemployment and just as there are many different reasons for someone becoming employed there are equally many r different needs that the unemployed have
UNK many younger people have no experience of the work UNK within their homes
labour turning on its back on employment action will in no way help them gain the necessary experience to be UNK or to be equipped for further training for more advanced skills
why deny them the benefit of self respect and a sense of purpose which training on such a scheme would create
we all know the real reason for labour group's UNK of employment action
it has nothing to do with the plight of the unemployed and everything to do with the power and desire for further power of the trade union movement
our labour councillors don't represent their electorate they represent the t u c and the vested interests of their own unions
only the a e u have the courage to stand up against big brother the t u c warning against denying the unemployed a UNK of hope
to UNK d UNK unemployment action claiming it to be work is and at the same time supporting the labour party policy which would make it acceptable to receive benefit without training but illegal to have a job without training is a strange morality
what is wrong with providing tr training through environmentally useful schemes
it has much to commend it
even th your chief supporter the t n a on september the nineteenth agreed that it was far better it was far better to use the UNK human resource than to load the ca th the cost on to the community charge payer
the labour benches had several new members and dare i suggest green councillor with no memory of the disastrous economic policies of the last labour government or the UNK distress that it's huge army of unemployed
the party you support created such chaos that unemployment rose by a hundred and thirty one percent
yes two thousand three hundred people per week is correct but that was week on every week for five and a half years that labour held office
two thousand three hundred per week for five and a half years
UNK inflation excessive public expenditure lack of private investment because of ex excessive tax UNK and to top it all an industrial relations policy that brought this country to its knees making it the subject of UNK throughout the world
they were the labour's disastrous policies for this country
in UNK the conservative government was elected with a clear mandate to tackle the problem of excessive union powers which was destroying the employment and the UNK of thousands of people every week
conservative governments have honoured that commitment in full and as a result continuous strikes the british disease as they are known have been eliminated
the elements of success which have turned our economy round are quite clear
the top priority to re reduce inflation removal of labour imposed barriers to employment such as wage councils increased and improved training
the conservative government since UNK has created three hundred million sorry three million extra jobs
of course you will never hear a word about success and achievement from the benches opposite
about the fact that under conservative our productivity has grown faster than UNK
that our strike record is the best in fifty years
our standard of living has grown faster than italy UNK and UNK
our exports since UNK have increased faster than france germany and america
isn't that the way forward to help the unemployed
this government has spent more money on training than any other government si in our history two and a half times as much in real terms as when labour were in office
fifty new training places for every one under labour
now let's hear something of the policies that labour would support
remember of course that labour and the unions are as thick as UNK so the gr labour group just like its parliamentary UNK is incapable of making a single decision without the union pulling the UNK
more than half labour's m p's are union sponsored a hundred and forty being the highest since UNK and eighteen out of the twenty in the shadow cabinet are also union sponsored and their UNK will expect plenty in return
labour would UNK all sensible union legislation
what about labour's training commitment
well we've had three documents in eighteen months but none with a viable pound sign
labour only UNK of course to er to spend money on pensions and child benefit so the shadow treasury tell us
unless of course you believe john smith whose alternative budget said nothing for pensions but a two hundred and eighty five million for training
who do we believe
labour constantly block help to the unemployed
they have UNK and consistently opposed the first guaranteed yo two year training programme for unemployed school UNK and thirteen labour controlled councils pulled out of employment training
even forced it's skill centre to close
some commitment to the unemployed
an utter disgrace
where to labour stand on training and enterprise councils tries to stress how much they are in favour of them but mister is telling people to ease up
well i'm happy to tell the labour group that tee the t e c's are alive and well and producing results
labour's half baked skills UNK scheme would be a national organisation to direct national training
UNK at every level instead of local UNK dealing with local training needs
labour's o labour's open UNK to employers will do little for business confidence and job creation
mister would impose sanctions on employers who did not follow labour's wishes
the proposed jobs tax would be a contribution by all companies to pay for UNK training funds
back to the bad old days when employers were so busy employing people to push bits of people round and see to inspectors that they didn't have anything to do with training an produced not one single job
remember labour party that no legislative approach has been devised that relates training to business needs
UNK was mentioned by councillor but he's too young to remember that UNK was tried in UNK
councillor UNK was tried in the UNK and UNK
it failed UNK
it led to a climate when employers were forced into inappropriate training by m by numbers and UNK forms to avoid
the most disastrous of all labour's proposed strategy is the national statutory minimum wage and at a modest assumption this proposal would lose seven hundred and fifty thousand jobs
such a policy would undermine the skill differentials which essential to maintain the incentive for individuals to train
a minimum age would be the death UNK of hopes for UNK improving the skills of the british people
labour proved itself incapable of creating a sound economy when in government
when in opposition it has proved it's policies of a minimum wage a jobs tax social charter support and s er strikers charter that they would never learn
as far as this council is concerned if you are unemployed you will get no constructive help from labour
instead they insist that their ideas are simple
if it involves training UNK it
if it UNK strikes fight it and if it creates jobs UNK it
fantastic
councillor
on nineteenth june UNK the secretary of state for employment michael howard announced a new package supposedly to help unemployed people
all this was happening and now this com here comes a tory record
all this was happening at a time of deep recession UNK by the day with unemployment rising to two and a half million redundancies up by forty percent in the first four months of ninety one
UNK including voluntary and er company UNK up by seventy five percent in the first six months of this year
property UNK in the UNK northern region up by forty seven percent in the first six months
to UNK the situation eighty thousand places were cut from employment training
whilst our competitors in europe and elsewhere continued to push their training objectives forward britain remains the only modern western european country which has neither national objectives for training nor a statutory work force and as yet no UNK or progressive system of national qualifications
the failure of government to give a real to training arises from it's UNK with market forces and passion for privatisation
the government is UNK the country of much needed UNK skills and training necessary to UNK the industrial UNK caused by the twelve years of tory control leaving the potential work force not only unemployed but UNK
lord mayor employment action has been thoroughly debated at the previous council committee meetings with all it's UNK brought to light
it is a no wage work scheme designed cynical to the employment figures in the wake of pending general election
we on this side are concerned about the plight of unemployed and are currently running training schemes to help them back into labour market
in e i d for instance we run pre UNK and initial training
both are UNK to help the trainees progress to adult training
employment action is by far from being UNK
it lacks the necessary ingredients of programme with a training element in it
even the UNK have spotted this UNK many of them deciding to UNK it altogether
some scare UNK tactics have been adopted by the tories to UNK us into participating the UNK in employment action
all of a sudden they have become sympathetic to a work force the very people who have been threatened with government's legislation on competitive tendering
lord mayor i therefore support our motion
thank you
councillor
m my lord mayor
thank you my lord mayor
mayor three months ago the e i d sub committee labour members rejected the employment action scheme
a month ago the committee labour members rejected this scheme and i still have an enormous sense of UNK and anger that the local and i express local because it's not a national policy that the local labour group could act in such a UNK and UNK way putting political UNK party political UNK before the needs of the unemployed in the district
and i doubt whether councillor has read the papers
i mean i've read em very thoroughly and i've read the reports of the officers
in these three months there has been nothing but support for this scheme some of it qualified but nevertheless support that it should go ahead
even the t u c only the t u c and the labour party have been completely negative and rejected it out of hand
our council officers and i refer to their report recommended that we applied to run the scheme
they fully considered that there was merit great merit in running it as far as the council was concerned
and if you read the report you can do nothing but agree
councillor has referred to the UNK of the telegraph and UNK
can i just UNK upon that because and quote from it by UNK employment action the council's controlling group seem to have made a bad decision prompted by a desire to score political points in the debating chamber
hear
it is a shame that the local labour party these are the UNK words not mine it is a shame that the local labour party has set its face against the scheme
the telegraph and UNK i quote
well done the t and a
bless president of the a v w engineering union gave a warning to the t u c against denying the unemployed the opportunity to join the scheme
and even the labour national spokesman said to the t u c it is UNK to reject the scheme it is not a good idea to say you will not co operate with it
the local tec board on which i think the leader of the council serves
yes indeed
good
decided to bid to operate the scheme providing there was a stronger training element and moves have been made in that direction
tec plans to use employment action as a pre adult training phase and councillor it UNK to use it for those trainees who need extra help and resource those that you referred to those requiring language training those requiring literacy and numeracy training councillor the very group that you referred to
and council officers say that this is particularly attractive in the situation and i agree
one year unemployment action plus one year adult training would achieve the long term objective for those unemployed with special needs
you referred to those councillor
tec has also indicated that appropriate project work for employment action would fall into such categories as child care you agree with child care presumably energy conservation you agree with energy conservation environmental issues security tourism
our officers say that this fits in perfectly with our plans for existing and new projects and i believe the officers
so why oh why do the labour party reject the scheme when it will cater for those unemployed they UNK to care about when it will cater for those projects of benefit to the community the labour party UNK to care about
i've listened very carefully to councillor and i haven't learnt a thing about the answer to various questions which were raised at e i d and i ask it again why do you really reject the scheme
all i hear by way of reply are vague comments about UNK the unemployment figures
i think we even heard the cry we want a minimum we want a minimum wage and everyone knows what that would do to the unemployment figures
seven hundred and fifty thousand to a million more on unemployment
is that UNK the figures
my lord mayor my lord mayor i started by saying how angry and UNK i was on the twenty fourth of july
three months on i er i'm even mor angry UNK and UNK at the UNK of the members opposite because if they really care about the unemployed why don't they support this scheme
if you really care about the unemployed with special needs if you really care about special projects for which they work upon you should support the scheme
quite frankly you have time to change your minds because if you don't change your minds those unemployed in with special needs will never forgive you and i certainly won't
councillor bring your remarks to a conclusion please
councillor is on his feet

in this authority that one proposition stands to lose some fifty teachers to schools and it's ah worse in many other districts
what's it's essentially about is getting rid of the most experienced teachers in the district
can that be good for education
it can't surely but it's what the government want to do with l m s of course they have a real agenda behind local management which is more to do with market led economy education competition UNK the end of the local authority
and they're using the principle of UNK and delegation of participation and decision making as a vehicle for bringing us about
councillor is on record in fact not long after taking his job that he doesn't care much for state education he UNK grant maintained schools the assisted places scheme which i'm pleased to say lord mayor we don't operate in this district and neither did the tories when they were in power and i applaud them for that
hear
this attack is yet another UNK scheme
but councillor his first public statement was to support all those UNK and to say that he wanted an end to the three tier system in turned his back on all our middle schools
his only interest was bringing back grammar schools that's really what he wanted to do
well lord mayor that's on no one's agenda over here
i'm working hard with colleagues to provide a fair education system throughout the district and i'm pleased to say lord mayor when the tories talk of petty interference it's interpreted by our head teachers and schools as co operation consultation our listening ear yes councillor and councillor they'll listen and if they've got the money they'll assist our schools
lord mayor i support the labour group's er recommendations
i think we have UNK the l m s scheme in and when we get a national labour government we'll be able to make sure that it protects it protects those children with special needs those children from socially deprived UNK in this city and protects our most experienced teachers
lord mayor clearly that is what the tories do not want to happen in

there's nobody appears to be against it so it'll c
my lord mayor members of council
i welcome the new children act which became law earlier this month
it is a new legal framework for child care and came about as a result of lessons learnt from lord enquiry into child abuse in cleveland in UNK
it is a credit to social services officers that many of the new policies for children had already been adopted and you can be proud of the work being done in this area
however there is always room for improvement and i think the public has little idea of the enormous problems that UNK us all of us as the parents of these children in care
the emphasis of the new act and already a policy of this council is to keep children with their natural parents whenever possible
the prime responsibility for bringing up children UNK with parents
this means providing help and support in the home the provision of day centres and family centres and all this we do
on the other hand the needs and welfare of the child must be UNK and if a child is deemed to be in danger or at any particular risk the child must be removed
in the new act parents can appeal against the child's removal after seventy two hours
previously they had to wait twenty eight days before doing so
children who do come in to care are placed with other families where possible and again is fortunate in having an experienced network of foster parents and link carers and we can't thank them enough
in the new act the positive role of relatives and friends is also recognised but it must be obvious to everyone that some children are just so difficult often having been very badly abused and with severe behaviour problems that they cannot be contained in a family and these children are placed in residential homes
let me say at once what a very difficult job the residential staff have often in poor accommodation and with very poor wages and with the most difficult and damaged children
i welcome the labour party's proposals to UNK some of these homes
i just hope it's done quickly
we in the UNK services have known for two years that something more must be done and we must pay our staff more
we have s training schemes with support money from the government
the trouble is that with more training some of the staff quite naturally move to more UNK jobs
in the new act children are then to have a say in what they want and in the plans made for them
given this they m may be more co operative and even if living away from home they have a strength and right of contact with their family
this all seems to make sense to me and i welcome the fact that this act UNK children also have their rights
if all this leads the controlling group to scream for more money from the government and it will inevitably i suggest they start using the money they have more sensibly and not waste it on their more UNK schemes
hear
for instance festival trips abroad more and more committees with more and more UNK hence more paper more UNK work all these neighbourhood UNK liaison groups and area panels all costing a lot talking a lot and doing very little
hear
all the new traffic islands in this city
just a fraction of this just a fraction of this money directed towards our children and their services would help enormously
help our children to grow into good citizens for
ensure a UNK f future for us as well as them
thank you my lord mayor
councillor
thank you lord mayor
mrs er has er actually said that we should be getting some more money and then she spoilt it by saying we should be using the money we haven't got more er better use it and er maybe knocking the traffic li er islands out will save us a problem cos we'll get a few kids knocked down and we won't have to bother with em
that's the only thing i can say cos i can't understand how anybody can talk about traffic islands for er children in need
and what i'd like to do is we do welcome this act cos y'know we're not dog in a UNK when there's a good act well we'll welcome it and we'll say so
but as usual the conservative government have UNK it
they've undermined it by not allocating resources
just to UNK i'd just like to highlight a few of the principles before i comment on this UNK of this government in on the one hand UNK a major piece of legislation and on the other hand doing it in such a way that UNK settle for failure because resources have not been allocated
th what labour would do would be ring fence the money that's what labour would do and i'll come on to that later if you give me a chance
th the one of the main principles is a comprehensive clarification and UNK of child care law probably the biggest we're gonna get this century and basic principles as councillor is that parental responsibility cannot be lost through the process of law
regardless of who's caring for the child both parents are still responsible and should still be involved in any decision making
it requires the local authority to seek alternatives in order to keep the child in the family rather than legal routes for UNK children to care
it UNK the responsibility of authorities to take into account racial and cultural needs when making plans for children
it UNK the children as the major actors in any decision making and ensures that their rights and UNK in decision making are enhanced
it requires local authorities and other agencies to co operate with social services in responding to children in need
all these principles the labour group champion and support
but what about resources
the first resource i wanna talk about is not the resources the local authority resources the resources of the family
the family who has to care for children whether they've got disabilities or not and the whole intention of this act is that children are best cared for by parents and any alternative is second best
yet the basic requirements for a family to do this a decent home a decent job good education services good health services for children with disabilities UNK facilities and support systems in the community
every one of these requirements have been consistently attacked over twelve years by the conservative government
it's fine to pass acts but even a good act are no good if their parents are expected to care for the child without resources
who considers our housing stock adequate and f that it provides a satisfactory environment to give facilities to parents
who considers there are sufficient play and other activities to keep young people out of trouble
i'll give you two examples of the other side of tories doing an act
under the UNK housing and local government act a man living in a thirty thousand pound house with a mortgage
he has three children
he's got six hundred pound a month clear
the middle child is severely disabled and necessary d UNK would cost him three thousand seven hundred that's what he's gotta find and he cannot afford it he can't afford to borrow that
that's one of the acts that works against children in need
and also when handicapped children are placed in foster homes the foster parent is UNK assessed as a UNK which of course the local authority has to pay
we've a case where it cost ten thousand pounds
that ain't helping to do things for children
all these things are what the UNK act is about but it's not presumably what the conservative government is about
the resources of the social services are UNK put last because really we don't wanna be involved
we want the parents to be able to cope
we want the spirit of the act that the parents should be in position to cope to come through but they're certainly not gonna be
at this point i'd just like to comment on virginia UNK contention that she'd give twenty four percent to social services extra in s a to the ac for the act
it were twenty four percent of virtually the same amount so the age old problem of the conservatives UNK peter to pay paul
if you wanna take the money out of education housing and sweeping and cleaning the streets then we could have it in social services
that's what it means
no we didn't get it
that's w that's what it means
it's lies
that's what she's saying
she said she'd give twenty four percent
UNK lies
then it's lies
UNK lies
as a council as councillor says we've done everything we can to prepare for the act
we've worked hard to develop inter directory and inter agency working we've trained a high proportion of the staff and we are recognising that re organising the UNK to provide specialist children's service
they've undertaken pilot schemes in three key areas of the UNK act
definitions of children in need emergency protection orders and accommodation agreements
we've tried to fulfil our responsibilities as good parents
but as a labour group we welcome this motion because it demonstrates the UNK of the conservative government in passing one of the most enlightened pieces of legislation without any of the resources to implement it
lord mayor i move
well done
councillor
made a speech in the council chamber and i've UNK
no hold on and i've turned up with the wrong one
i too could give you a very good speech on traffic island but i'll save that for the transportation highways and engineering sub committee
on the UNK act i just want to say one thing briefly
there's been very little said about the actual content of the UNK act and i think it actually gets all party's support which is which is excellent
what i want to say is one thing about the UNK perception of the political scene at the moment
they are absolutely fed up with political point scoring
er wrong party
and i think er and i think we're gonna get a lot more political point scoring t er further on this evening
we've got a lot more to look forward to
we've tried to frame our motion as carefully as we could t so we could actually get support from everybody
there is concern about funding for the UNK act and it's too important to start scoring political points whether there's a general election or not t and i must admit i was off i was off ill off work during the week of the tory party conference
it was actually something that happened before the tory party conference but it didn't it didn't actually help me recover
and nearly every day nearly every speaker actually attacked local government in some way
what the children act does at least recognise in the conservative government passing the UNK act is the importance of local government
these are very important services and they are placed just like care in the community will be when it eventually is put into practice
they will actually responsibility of local government and er we've tried to put in here something that even conservative councillors could support even though it's attacking conservative ministers cos they must actually believe in local government to actually serve on local government one would think but er but th the problems of under funding are th could be very serious
during the summer we had serious problems report on UNK homes which erm which y'know which pointed out a few things y'know that hadn't been doing well mainly in defence of erm because they did put in a lot of effort
good afternoon
item one on the agenda is the closure UNK of interest
call upon the director of legal services
there are UNK from the secretary of state for the environment for councillors and because either of their own or their UNK employment in the health service
that UNK enables the members to speak during the debate but not to vote me having first recorded a UNK of interest by those members
does any other member or officer wish to UNK an interest in any matters to be dealt with at this meeting
item two in minutes
i move that the minutes of the meeting of the council held on the sixteenth of july be signed as a correct record
is there a seconder
lord mayor
n all those in favour please show
item three on the agenda apologies for absence
er councillors and my lord mayor
are there any other
item four UNK
copies of my announcements have been circulated to all members of the council on the blue seats
however i will read them to you
i have been asked by the building UNK acting on behalf of the fire service to inform you that should the fire alarm sound you are required to leave the building in an UNK fashion by the nearest exit
no one will be allowed to stay or return until the building has been checked
it is my sad duty to inform members that doctor former city treasurer of county borough council and an honorary UNK of the city died in august
i have written to mrs on behalf of the council expressing our sorrow and extending a message of support to her in her and her family at this sad time
i would like to invite members to stand and join me in a few moments silence in memory of doctor
thank you
on behalf of the council i would like to offer UNK congratulations to and for their recent successes in the britain in UNK competition
members may be aware that received the national britain in UNK award for UNK in the town category and as a result were entered in the o UNK a european competition similar to that of britain in UNK
i was very proud to say that finished in second place a very UNK achievement as i am sure members will agree
members may also be aware that won the small town category in the in UNK competition which resulted in entry to the national britain in UNK awards
unfortunately were not successful in winning the small towns category on this occasion but nevertheless i am sure that members would want to congratulate on their considerable success in the regional UNK of this prestigious competition
i have just learnt have recently achieved a cup double being winners of the UNK star UNK cup and the b s p a cup as well as finishing second in the UNK british league their best performance ever
i am sure members will be aware speed UNK received financial assistance from the council a few years ago when they ran into difficulties
it's a great tribute to the that they have managed UNK over UNK and achieved such tremendous results this season and i am sure that members would want me to place on record the council's congratulations on their performance
good that we're doing something good in sport isn't it
item five inspection of internal documents
i call on the director of legal UNK
there've been no complaints against restrictions lord mayor
petitions
first one is about dogs
i move that the petition to be presented from persons about opposing the making of byelaws and supporting of a UNK scheme be received
is there a seconder
seconded lord mayor
all in favour please show
that is carried
will the UNK please come forward
UNK welcome to the meeting you may s you may speak for not more than five minutes
please start when you're ready
thank you
my lord mayor ladies and gentlemen
i represent the recently formed responsible dog ownership group which consists of people from most areas of the metropolitan district both dog owners and non dog owners
on behalf of this group i would like to present to the council a petition containing in excess of two thousand signatures from people throughout the metropolitan district who object to the originally reported suggestion that metropolitan council are proposing to make byelaws requiring that all dogs should be kept on leads at all times in all public places
we are aware that the suggestion relating to all public places has now been changed to on all land owned by metropolitan council but this does not UNK our concern
in fact in our view it would only UNK the situation even further if such a UNK was to be adopted as most people within the district do not know which land is owned by the council and which is not
we do appreciate that it is reasonable to impose restrictions on dogs in such areas as children's UNK flower beds etcetera and we do support the extension of the byelaws relating to dogs UNK and grass UNK and also the byelaws relating to the removal of UNK
however we feel that such measures as those being UNK would only lead to further problems
it is the view of many of the UNK in the district the r s p c a inspectorate and other dog handling professionals that dogs must have adequate natural exercise and they should be given the opportunity to run freely as frequently as possible
failure to provide such opportunities does cause dogs to become more UNK and aggressive and this in turn reduces the level of control experienced by the UNK
a dog constantly UNK is an unhappy dog and an unhappy dog is more likely to become a problem dog
the responsible dog ownership group has received correspondence on this matter from the animal shelter which is the agency currently being used by the government to register pit bull UNK
they also express concern regarding this suggestion
it is their view that such a measure will be very counter productive
to introduce further byelaws with all the attendant costs of application to the home off with all the attendant costs of such things as application to the home office to UNK the UNK the probability of requiring to post notices on all council owned land etcetera so that the public knows which is council owned land would in the opinion of the responsible dog ownership group be a waste of the charge UNK money as we believe that the council already have sufficient powers to deal with any problems arising by reference to the existing pleasure grounds byelaws and or the dangerous dogs act
it should be noted that this view has recently been confirmed by the council successfully UNK a person under the UNK pleasure ground UNK
we understand that there is a dog working party of council officers already established and we would formally request that the responsible dog ownership group be allowed a representative on that working party to ensure that the views of the two thousand plus UNK and over two hundred and fifty persons who have written individual letters on the subject to mister of the recreation division are considered
we would also hope that should there be a need in the future to make a decision in council regarding application for such a UNK you the members will give proper consideration to the views i have expressed on behalf of the ro responsible dog ownership group
in conclusion i'd like to thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to present our petition
thank you
thank you
does any member wish to move that the subject matter be referred to the appropriate member body

all those in favour please show

the second petition is about nursery classes at first school
i move that the petition to be presented from persons requesting the provision of a nursery class at this school be received
seconded lord mayor
all in favour
ok
that is carried
will the UNK please come forward
welcome to the meeting
you must speak for not more than five minutes
please start when you're ready
my lord mayor
this is a petition for a UNK nursery class within the first school
my name is i'm the chair of governors
i'm supported in this application by the chair of the mister deputy chair and mrs and parent governors
is a compact area now isolated by the traffic from the trunk road
the population is around five thousand three hundred
a questionnaire circulated by the friends has identified one hundred and forty children living close to the school whose parents would wish nursery provision for them
only one parent did not wish provision
not all of could be UNK by the questionnaire but comparison with the UNK census figures suggests that the number of children in the catchment area could be over three hundred
of the fifty two children entering the school in september UNK only six percent had received nursery education compared with thirty nine percent from families who have moved in to in the past
to attend nearby UNK involves car transport to or since bus timing is UNK
places in those UNK are now fewer
the only pre school provision within is a UNK which does not have its own premises
they now have only five weekly sessions instead of six to comply with recent legislation
the UNK support this petition and say that they would have a valuable role preparing the children for nursery education feeling that the children at four plus need more than the s UNK can offer
forty six point five percent of the children within the school come from council rented housing well above the thirty eight percent criterion for the school to receive social disadvantage allowance
families in this category are normally without transport and therefore excluded from facilities outside
frequently they are unable to afford the UNK fees and therefore miss all pre school experience
this makes worse the problems of disadvantage and over stretched resources including time demands on working mothers
the school now has an increasing number of UNK with special needs including children with support children with UNK difficulties and children already UNK
if had a nursery all of these children would be able to start their education in their own community without the expense and the disruption of being UNK out through the traffic UNK
from an education viewpoint all the children of would benefit from a natural flow from nursery into reception classes
parents could be involved sooner in the UNK
better behaviour patterns could be established in a familiar place
the school at present has no spare classroom space and no likelihood of the number of children in decreasing
there is however room for a new building an play area
we urge you to consider our request for a nursery to be attached to the first school to give the children a head start in their education
we present our petition of nine hundred and fifty six names
thank you
si sit down a minute love
yes well it's alright
i haven't f i have something to say first
does any member who wish to move the subject matter be referred to the appropriate member body

thank you very much
now the third petition is one to deal with a UNK crossing at avenue
i move the petition to be presented from UNK from persons requesting the provision of a UNK crossing at avenue be received
is there is a seconder
thank you
all in favour
that is carried
will the UNK please come forward
welcome to the meeting
you may speak for not more than five minutes
please start when you're ready
lord mayor parents and staff at first school and local residents are requesting that the council UNK a UNK crossing on the site of the existing zebra crossing
there's been concern over this area for several years but nothing's actually been done
a similar request was approved three years ago but has never been implemented
parents and residents were given the impression that something was going to be done and were very UNK to find that nothing has been done yet hence this petition
there has been one fatal accident on the crossing in recent years which was the tragic death of a young baby
in addition there have been several other accidents where cars have UNK with each others
these are not actually recorded on police statistics but th nevertheless they could have been much more serious than in fact they were
i witnessed an accident where a vehicle UNK into the back of another one pushing it completely across the crossing
at the time there were parents and children waiting to cross over the crossing and it could have been much more serious
the crossing is situated on a very busy dual carriageway where the speed limit is forty miles an hour and i would point th point out this literature which says that at forty miles an hour if children are knocked into most children are killed
but in fact most of the vehicles travel at fifty or sixty miles an hour on this crossing
it's a very busy crossing
some of the children at school went out to do a traffic count recently and there was so much volume of traffic that the children were not able to keep up with th putting the in the to keep up with the volume of traffic
many UNK use the dual carriageway as an extension of the motorway
the dual carriageway is just of the motorway and people are UNK up to go on the motorway
the practice of having zebra UNK on any multi lane road doesn't seem to be very common outside
myself and my family have never seen it in our travels bridges or UNK or UNK would be provided instead
visiting drivers to after a few hours on the motorway are hardly going to be looking for a zebra crossing on such a busy dual carriageway
we believe that the UNK th the current zebra crossing is unfair and dangerous to both UNK and vehicle occupants
heavy vehicles slowing down to allow people to cross are often UNK by cars unaware of the crossing and the reason for the slowing heavy vehicle
a bus stop just before the zebra crossing only UNK the issue further
a vehicle UNK to stop at the zebra crossing can only stop one of the two lanes with no control over the other
i've seen many examples of vehicles further back unaware of the situation switching lanes and UNK
many people feel very strongly about the dangers
one resident i spoke to whose house is immediately on the zebra crossing reports that every day he UNK hearing the UNK of UNK brakes and looking out of his window
another local resident has had a child who's broken he broken his arm on the crossing when a car hit into him
a policeman who works in the area describes avenue as a nightmare of a crossing and i and other parents who have to take children across would entirely agree with this
i cross the crossing eight times a day with my own two children and i would underline how UNK it is
one lane often heavy traffic tends to stop while the other continues to rush past at speed and the UNK view is UNK by the heavy traffic
it's very difficult with a parent with a UNK or a double UNK and other children to bring across
UNK children also cross this crossing and the elderly and they are very vulnerable from vehicles which seem to appear out of nowhere
to conclude the current zebra crossing is unfair to UNK and UNK
a previous request for a UNK crossing was approved in UNK but was never implemented
parents and staff at school and local residents who use the crossing are united in this petition for a UNK crossing to replace the current zebra crossing at the earliest opportunity

michael howard secretary of state for unemployment in UNK employment action in parliament stated this government have placed policies designed to lead to job creation and they will succeed in the future as they have succeeded in the past
with that sort of reference it's no surprise that the government's new plans to fiddle the unemployment figures is treated with UNK and UNK
these policies have pushed unemployment up to two point five million and rising
that's despite thirty changes in the way that the unemployment figures are calculated
the real figure is closer to three and a half million
these policies have UNK manufacturing output and these policies have cut a massive two hundred and forty five million pound from the employment and youth training budgets for this year which has led to a cut of eighty thousand places
when the issue of employment action was discussed at the community and environment committee in september councillor was UNK desperately to her history books
she told us that in UNK unemployment was increasing at the UNK figure of two thousand three hundred a week
i will not seek to justify this any more than i would expect the tories to justify the three day week the UNK crisis or any other element of their UNK history for what we are discussing is a situation facing thousands of people in this district today and what we are gonna do to ensure that they have a future
the situation today is not that two thousand three hundred people are joining the dole UNK every day but that ov every week but over twenty thousand
in there are four hundred and seven jobs registered with the job centre and twenty three thousand five hundred and twenty six registered unemployed
the situation today is that there is not enough training places for the people who want them
the situation today is that many sixteen to eighteen year olds who were unable to get a training place are UNK from getting income support and the situation today is that this country has the lowest level of skilled workers in the european community
and this is the result of government policies that succeed
god help us when they fail
in the cuts in the training budget this year have led to over two hundred trainee places disappearing
one training organisation which had taken a twenty three percent cut in funds in UNK ninety one had to take a further twenty percent cut this year and the people who are worst affected by these cuts were the very people that the tory party had been crying UNK tears over for so long
women UNK the black and asian community people with physical disability and people with learning difficulties
they suffer UNK because when the cuts come it's the special needs support that many of these groups need that was the first to go
it was the help with literacy and numeracy
it was the help with english as a second language
it was the initial training that helped to boost an individual's confidence
these policies have ruined the opportunities and dreams of thousands of people throughout this district and have been carried out with no regard to the drastic effects they have had on people's lives
but wait on the political horizon there comes a general election
panic in tory party central office
what can we do to make it look like we care about the unemployed
what can we do to make it look like we actually care about training
the first thing you do is announce half way through a year that they're gonna put back some but not all of the money they cut from the budget
there is no guarantee that this money will be available next year so training providers are now UNK around trying to work out ways of providing training up to the required standard in six months instead of the full year
those against
yes
that is lost thirty to forty nine
those in favour of the substantive motion incorporating amendment a please show
please show
that is carried forty nine to thirty two
we now move on to item ten on the agenda local management of schools
in accordance with standing order a twelve little c in force at the time councillor of m notice of motion on local management of schools was referred by the council t on twenty third of april UNK to the education committee
the report of the committee is set out in document t referred to on the agenda
at the same time at the same council meeting three amendments to the motion were formally moved by councillor and ex councillor respectively and seconded and were also submitted to the committee
i call upon councillor to move amendment c standing in his name
seconder
seconded lord mayor
my lord mayor the local management of schools scheme er was reviewed first in the light of consultation which went on during its first full year of operation
it was by then already obvious that the schools had overcome their first reservations er about what the scheme had to offer and it was so obvious that they deserved recognition for their efforts that it led to my colleagues councillor and putting down the motion to council in april of this year drawing attention to the continuing success in schools throughout the district of the local management initiative
instead of joining in with my group in recognising this success and UNK the managers the party opposite showed its usual UNK by trying to congratulate themselves for some reason or other
they've shown opposition to the introduction of l m s right from the start and put every UNK possible in the way of its success and its implementation and yet there they were UNK themselves on how well it was working
they tried to cloud the issue even further by mixing the question of l m s with the reforms which my group brought in while we were in control of the council which is in UNK contrast to the true situation
the local management of schools was due to be introduced from UNK and the conservative group in had the UNK to see that if the scheme was given a fair wind and the full support of the council it would come to be recognised as one of the greatest reforms of education
we realised that there could be some difficulties and some apparent UNK might show up but due to great consultative work put in by councillors and mrs often against great UNK and personal attack many per problems were sorted out as they arose but we saw that i in april motions in amendments we see that it takes three full paragraphs of the amended motion to see that they UNK to welcome initiatives which extend participation in decision making to schools governors and parents
but note the UNK of that paragraph which still doesn't give credit to the head teachers and governors for the way in which they've worked and the success which they achieved
then in the final paragraph of their er amendment the attempt to UNK that the labour group has allowed schools to take full l m s when they were ready
what UNK that is that they allowed the schools to take on the full role when over fifty percent of em were already willing and anxious to do so
the arrangement of the local management of schools is one of the best initiatives of the conservative government and it has freed schools from the heavy handed control of local government and in particular that of labour controlled authorities because it's a step into the unknown for some with obviously some doubt at first and many labour groups fed on those doubts with lies and threats but nevertheless it was taken up UNK by many schools
in we were fortunate in that the time of the introduction of l m s UNK with the all too brief period when this group was in control of the council and as the window of opportunity opened to get off to a flying start
hear
so the local authority was in the forefront of efforts to make local management a success
by april UNK every school had a computer system to help with school management
outside london we were the first l e a to realise that this would be necessary
we've invested well over a million pound in micro computers for the teaching of pupils right across the three phases of first middle and upper schools
support for the new governors undertaking the management was without equal
a widespread training programme was carried out to help governors and schools staff to meet their new tasks and obligations
so that some two thousand people were involved in a major training programme
a governor support unit was set up and is still in operation and working well today
the national curriculum was introduced also alongside l m s and we're already able to see the success of that now
testing of pupils has been introduced and is continuing to be improved in the light of experiences of its first year of work in spite of the criticisms which are of method rather than of reason
we can see that it's gonna provide parents and pupils with the continuous necessary information which they need to see how the they're wor working out how they're progressing and the need for further improvement
we're now looking forward to teacher appraisal and the opportunities that this will give s school staff to enhance their own future development
all of these initiatives were made more possible as a result of and parallel to local management of schools and all in spite of the petty opposition of so many labour local government controlling groups who just can't bear the thought that the l e a is at last breaking free of absolute local government control
in spite of the wording of the motion put forward by labour members i would point out that under conservative control has spent three hundred and fifty eight pound per head compared with the metropolitan district who average three hundred and seventeen
i'm still talking about when we were in control
forty one per head more than the average of all comparable authorities
these figures were confirmed even more when we saw when we saw that we spent twenty five pound more a head of population on our schools than the average metropolitan district
this included spending almost twenty six a head more on secondary education and nearly five pound a head more on special education
to complete this numerical picture the average spend per head of further education was almost fifty five pound per head nearly five pound fifty more than the average metropolitan district
so much then for the silly part of the labour resolution of last april which tries to congratulate the labour group on rescuing the l m s scheme
it needed no rescuing
i can assure them and the people as a whole that the l m s scheme had been born was living and progressing well when labour took control of the council
it was already making such good progress that it's been able to grow and improve in spite of so much petty interference as the labour group has been able to put on it
thank goodness that time too is passing and it won't be long now before local management of schools and local financial management is fully implemented and beyond the reach of the vicious labour attacks on it's future
hear
so my lord mayor i am sure that the original resolution of councillor and noting the continuing success of the local management initiative was the right one
the resolution then being UNK out by the amendments of councillor and recognising the work of members of governing bodies given so freely
also the importance which will come to be valued in future of the standard assessment tests
you've only to read the new parents charter which john major is introducing to realise this
it will make it possible to have annual written reports on each child's progress
regular reports will be made by independent inspectors on the strengths and weaknesses of each school and published tables will give parents the ability to compare the performance of local schools
this will then overcome this silly UNK of the labour group in trying to UNK the opted out school in and the college when this charter is in place we'll be able to compare every UNK of education across the district because the results will be published for all to see and these two schools will not be able to be frozen out of that exercise
all of this is coming about as a direct result of the original plan for the local management of schools and it's continuing success in spite of the labour group and not because of it and so i move the amendment my lord mayor
councillor
it i my lord mayor it is indeed UNK cheek and pure UNK on the part of the tory group and particularly on the part of councillor to be putting forward the resolution UNK schools on their success in responding to the introduction of local management when they and the government between them impose such conditions that could only lead to chaos and disorder
the tory group you will all recall imposed l local management on all except small schools in the shortest possible time
and whatever councillor says there was an inadequate period for that essential preparation both within the UNK and for heads and teachers to allow them to come to terms with what local manage of the schools meant
why did they do this
it's clear now if it wasn't clear then that they were willing to sacrifice the well being of schools of their staff and pupils for the glory of their leader and for national recognition of the then councillor as the most UNK of thatcher disciples and ensuring for him another step towards that UNK safe tory seat
for that end for that end you people over there who took a decision to implement local management at the earliest possible time regardless of the state of preparation of each particular school regardless of the resources of staff and equipment and if that was not enough you also introduced a cut of thirteen million pounds in education funding
can anyone wonder that UNK and UNK settled upon many schools in time to give way to anger and protest at the possibility of carrying out tasks that has been imposed on them under impossible conditions
are your memories so short over there or is it that you have deliberately forgotten or ignored the UNK of that time
do you not remember that two hundred head teachers gathered and protested and handed back their budgets
do you not remember that when labour took over
you do in fact remember as c councillor has said that when labour took over and schools were given the chance to change their minds and withdraw at least to change y to change the decision and withdraw from immediate l m s then half of the schools chose to delay it's introduction
surely by that time it had become clear that if the government plans for local management were ill conceived that the plans for local management were ill conceived and had not been properly thought out
surely by that time many of you must have realised that had got you into a right UNK over l m s and that you some of you i believe felt that but none of you spoke out about it
it was left to the labour group on taking over control to find a way out of the UNK that you had created
since then we have UNK plans to ease the burden on schools given recognition to the increased work load for clerical staff and to the importance of the work they do
a great deal of time and energy has gone into dealing with UNK and UNK the formula for funding so that it UNK more fairly on the basis of need
it is much improved but still does not deal satisfactorily with disadvantages that some schools face
many heads have expressed to me their appreciation of what the UNK labour group has done for them to rescue them from the plight that the tories imposed on them
but make m n no mistake make no mistake the situation is still difficult because the government UNK conditions and changes are all so often that the resolution of problems is difficult as you will see from the director of UNK statement
problems over the UNK because the allocation is mainly based on pupil numbers and not on UNK needs by the use of average salaries and not actual salaries by changes in level of grants for support and training and the needs of the school and the children
and we still have l m s to com t to face
schools are indeed to be UNK in what they have done in the face of what you pr prepared for them
only the congratulations are implicit it seems to me in what you have said to the labour group for finding a way out of the problems that you had created
schools recognise this and you too in your hearts will recognise this
only because of labour proposals and actions have schools managed to deal as well as they have with l m s congratulations i say go to the labour group
councillor
thank you lord mayor
on about and i suspect that councillor must be on about
the conservative group do indeed congratulate the government for it's far sighted legislation to make our schools more accountable to the people they serve
hear
local management of schools has been to many of our schools
head teachers and governing bodies under l m s control their own spending and determine their own priorities
the conservative group put forward proposals to give this power to the schools as soon as possible as councillor did say and many of our schools took advantage around fifty percent i believe
despite this the labour group did persuade some schools to delay implementation of the l m s initiative and i rather suspect that some of these schools regret this decision today
the schools who took the challenge are happy to be in control of their own affairs
councillor has said that we have that his group do not believe in the testing of seven year olds
he claims that it will be a waste of time and money
this is a disgrace and wi we will never agree with him on this issue
it would deny our better schools UNK parents on how they were doing
the government's policies have meant more choice sorry and higher standards in educational spending per pupil
this is over forty percent above the level in labour's last year
allowing for inflation the total budget for l e a's this year is around seventeen point five billion pounds nearly sixteen percent more than last year
parents have been given a bigger role than ever before
they can pick and help their schools to which they send their children
they can play a very key part on governing bodies
we welcome these initiatives
labour would cut choice and standards by UNK the c t c's grammar schools and grant maintained schools
what a disgrace
in conclusion lord mayor the conservatives welcome the fact that head teachers now control their own ship
teacher pupils and parents now know who their captain is
the conservatives launched this ship and we will do all in our power to stop the labour group of group from UNK it
my lord mayor
councillor
that's you
i'd just like to remind councillor of one or two things and then spend a little bit of time talking about some of the UNK that the tories have introduced over this past ten years
i'm glad councillor reminded er councillor reminded councillor erm about the introduction of l m s when over two hundred teachers did appear outside to protest about the introduction of it along with cuts in budgets
and erm whilst those schools are still suffering from under funding at least they can er gain some erm UNK from the fact that er the tories seem to be able to replace their chairs opposition UNK of education almost at will
councillor did in fact try to take some credit for one or two things in his speech
he talked of the governor support unit and i'd like to remind councillor and his group that they were responsible for taking over a hundred posts out of the administrative section of
the governor support unit lord mayor did not exist under their structure
councillor talked about er spending levels and he may be interested to know that the n u t have done a recent survey of education spending and found to be sixty first out of a hundred l e a's UNK so that doesn't quite stack up with some of his statistics
of course as councillor rightly pointed out they did take thirteen million pounds out of the budget
as far as the parents charter is concerned that document is gathering dust in many school cupboards as governors including some tory governors refuse to send it out
it means nothing in terms of dealing with the many problems before education today
councillor and councillor mentioned testing and they're dead right i oppose it it's an UNK a complete UNK
what they want is a league table of young children those that pass and those that fail
can i le remind councillor though that five out of six schools in his ward recently sent a letter to the d e s and the education minister opposing testing in schools
lord mayor
can i say lord mayor
can i say lord mayor that i am not i am not a UNK person
but did grammar really expect to get away with including the christmas dinner in their schools meals budget
that is that is the whole truth lord mayor and nothing but the truth
and lord mayor can i mention the disgraceful behaviour of that god father of the city
who
in defending the school against the advice of his own officials who supported in its findings backed by the audit report into those figures on the schools meals budget
if any school in this authority including tries to take more than they deserve tries to be greedy in taking more money from the rest of schools i will oppose it and i hope every member of this council does too
moving on to that other well known UNK that UNK tory UNK up the road called the college
can anyone lord mayor UNK spending seventy nine times more money on the children of that school
you're lying
than the truth councillor nothing but the truth
can anyone UNK that sort of spending when schools are UNK when we're short of teachers books and equipment for the national curriculum
no lord mayor no one with any justice could UNK that sort of spending
i am extremely pleased to be able to say that shortly lord mayor we will be able to consider the future of the t c under a labour government and under a labour controlled council and i can't wait
i can't wait to allow all children to benefit from that eight million pound school up the road
can i just lord mayor point to one or two of the inequalities with the present l m s scheme and in particular the average national teacher costs
it's something that the government have continuously ignored but is a major problem to many schools
in this authority that one proposition stands to lose some fifty teachers to schools and it's far worse in many other districts
what it's essentially about is getting rid of the most experienced teachers in the district
can that be good for education
it can't surely but it's what the government want to do with l m s of course they have a real agenda behind local management which is more to do with market led economy education competition UNK the end of the local authority
and they're using the principle of UNK and delegation of participation in decision making as a vehicle for bringing that about
councillor is on record in fact not long after taking
now look at our country we are absolutely by we want more we want fewer regulations we want to be able to live on an island without being told what to do by the politicians and i support the view that politicians ought to stop telling individuals what to do
and this particular public regulation is all about and protecting us from ourselves and although we do need protection from of the world we don't need protection from ourselves
right thank you
no other no further contributions right we can start
recommendations

recommendations
is that agreed
agreed
agreed
thank you
final item on the agenda
this is a record of the erm UNK that have come into the county council if anyone UNK their mind rapidly down the list you'll see one point five one point five one point five
seem to be almost anywhere except on over the page at the top where it says one point four and that was er local authority fire brigade other than that
right any questions
recommendation is that is it the report be noted
agreed
agreed
that's the end of the item
thanks for your attendance
i declare the meeting closed
five pounds
nobody put five pounds on the table eventually
ah
i didn't i would have i would have accused that jack would actually UNK this as another westminster scandal
right thank you
thank you
what do you want done with this
i don't know have a word with quick word with jim
UNK
to look across at a group wh who would know a cynical opportunity if it hit them in the face
but then again maybe i'm wrong for is this not the same labour group which now UNK to be our cultural UNK who my lord mayor only last year sought in that most UNK of ways to dispose of all of civic UNK in one giant car boot sale
i would say that is a prime example of cynical UNK at its most cynical and most UNK
what utter and unbelievable nonsense it is for the labour group to claim that the conservative group have sought to exploit the needs of people with disabilities in order to gain political advantage
let me remind the UNK opposite that yours is the only group on this council which has voted against our proposals on disability
it says a great deal about our attitude to the role of the opposition that you regard everything that they do as being a little more than attempt to seek a political advantage
both ourselves and the liberals share a concern for the people with disabilities
we want to see employers whether it be the council or private companies taking an active interest in helping solve the practical difficulties associated with disability
that is why we with the support of the liberals put forward our own UNK of the perfect percent for art policy
there is nothing ins UNK long with the concept of percent for art but we saw an opportunity to extend that concept to make sure that the real need of real people in real communities were properly reflected in any scheme
what is the point of having van UNK hanging in a public building if people with disabilities are not provided with proper access facilities
hear
do the labour group want to promote that kind of cultural apartheid
no i am afraid lord mayor that the conservative group would not UNK so low as to exploit disability for mere political advantage
let me remind the members opposite of a conservative group policy document on disability that was produced in UNK
that document clearly stated our concern about the need for UNK in respect of the physical environment in order to ensure necessary access facilities for buildings transport leisure and other facilities
far from seeking to gain political advantage all that my group have tried to do is to continue with a long held policy on disability
it is time that members opposite stopped this petty UNK and sought to join with both ourselves and the liberals in seeking to press for real progress in recognising the specific requirement of people with disabilities
and all too often in the past disability as an issue has been UNK while the council pursued other parts of its equal opportunities policy
today we have lost a marvellous opportunity put that right
councillor
lord mayor
i've never heard so much rubbish in my life and what i'm gonna try and do is speak to the policy of percent for art
there're just one or two minor announcements
the percent for art policy UNK from people
it was presented to parliament by a secretary of state for environment trade and industry health education and science etcetera in september UNK
so the government supports percent for art and i would have hoped that it would have at least done a little bit of er work little bit of homework and i would have hoped that those members that went to the percent for art seminar would have stood up and said something positive about what it's about
councillor community environmental services committee are responsible for the large number of partnerships social partnerships with big business that the labour group are bringing to and the reason the percent for art was on that committee was to link in to that er those UNK proposals
it was the tories that UNK percent for art and brought the issue of disability about
hear
and what they did and you were there and you must've been listening what they did percent for people they moved it up to policy and resources policy and resources percent for people came around councillor spoke
he'd forgotten about the booklet that he put forward on building regulations the forward that he'd put forward so what he was asking to do was already council policy that he initiated but forgot about
i think it's typical on the things that councillor does
he p he UNK to forget about things that he's done in the past but the people of don't forget what you've done in the past
hear
our lord mayor
the real truth not UNK
you're not a UNK
cynical opportunities is far more appropriate
think about it
percent for art
you know has culture no UNK value no medical value
can we imagine living in a world without music
and some are saying that that's already happening
but would it be so absurd for those who sought UNK in UNK or UNK pills to try instead a course of UNK or UNK
is it so fantastic to imagine a future in which doctors w doctors will UNK a visit to the art gallery for people for people with depression
today it's fashionable to be green
parties compete for the UNK
no party is so red or so blue they would not be green
conferences UNK debate the environment but the environment is not just about the north pole or the UNK layer
it's about what's happening in our everyday lives down the street round the corner including and especially including civic art and architecture which above all could relate to the real lives of the community
cities have to have green belts but they should also have green hearts
percentage for art and the people behind it believe it's time th the time has come for art to go on the offensive
art is green
it's UNK relevance to everyday people must be shown in people's UNK combining the convenience of the new with the conservation of the best of the old
good old fashioned local authority planning
accessible accountable and UNK desirable
culture we believe art is an important UNK in the quality of life
and a percent for art policy is only a small step towards that
and we're only seeking up to one percent of development costs
so let's have none of the UNK tears about big business
the problems of big business are not about percent for art they're about your government's interest rate policies about unemployment so don't come crying UNK tears for big business
because they actually welcome percent for art
at the seminar we had a business who wanted to set up a fund to provide the UNK and cultural er facilities for these developments
so percent for art is about people
it's been adopted by a large number of authorities of which is gonna be one of them i hope
it's a true partnership a true partnership between the private and public sector which we know about and you could never achieve
east district is rich in culture because of the UNK multi cultural population that we've got
we've got the cultural attractions already the museum and other UNK attractions
we believe percent for art will be successful with th with the people of
it's not worthy councillor to try and link trivial politics to score points to score points to score points to score points to score points at the attacks on people with disabilities in the trivial way that you did because you couldn't remember the policy
percent for art is a part of our long term promotion to make a city of culture which we will do with the support of people
so stop playing politics cos you don't know how to do it
councillor

what are the council's wishes
lord mayor

clearly carried
councillor
to keep to keep the members of council from their collective tea at this time of the evening but my group feels it is necessary to put forward the people of the acute financial situation of this council a situation which is UNK rapidly and began to UNK in may last year may UNK
in the final accounts to p to policy and resources for UNK ninety one there is a massive two point four million pounds UNK in the education budget
we had previously only be warned to expect an overspend of one and a half million
is this why we ask ourselves the local education authority out of one hundred and thirty teachers it promised extra to employ during this current financial year there are only sixty three visible new teachers and sixty seven of them are UNK imaginary
and will the six percent which the director of education has been instructed to save across all central budgets be enough to cover this years' education overspend
and will the chairman of education awake from his beauty sleep to understand either of those questions
now what is the explanation for the discrepancy in the budgetary machinery
is it perhaps that he controlling group always knew that they would not be able to achieve the original levels of spend but like true UNK did not much care
in referring to the non collection rates of community charge a few weeks ago councillor said the outstanding debt will UNK essential services and i dread to think what effect it will have on our schools social services and the state of the streets
sadly the own reaction his own reaction then was to make a speech to threaten to put more people on to the streets
this mounting crisis is due to ignoring the illegal actions of residents who will happily use council services but refuse to pay for their council services
that is refusing to pay their community charge
a massive twelve point four million pounds is now owed by the non payer to the law UNK citizens of bradford
indeed perhaps the most sensible thing that model of consistency UNK neil UNK has said this year was law makers must not must not be law UNK
and he said this interestingly enough when referring to the m p who's currently enjoying her majesty's UNK
and what of those my lord mayor who although not so full of principle as to refuse payment themselves actually encourage others to break the law
and what of mister and mister
and what indeed councillor is missing of members of the labour group
when is councillor going to condemn their actions
and is councillor k does councillor intend to pay his debts this year
lord mayor i'll tell you a small story
at one of our constituency surgeries a retired widow came in to see us concerning the seventeen pounds extra which she would have to pay extra er to cover the other non payments
she announced her intention to UNK this er this amount from the total and to send the balance
she was told that it was the law to pay the full amount and she must pay it in full and her answer was that it was the law last year that everyone should pay their own bills and what happened to them
nothing happened to them and that is the way institutions and local democracy will be de valued
it's clear lord mayor that the labour group have their own priorities
one of the priorities is a million pounds that's been spent on community consultation structure and about a quarter of a million on a marketing and public relations unit
i guess that the people of will realise at the end of this year that the consultation and communication and public relations of this authority are UNK that the quality of messages sent and received is superb and that the volume of such messages is vast
but will all of it empty a single bin
will it feed a pensioner
will it comfort a single child
we're very concerned lord mayor about the city hall pay awards
we're concerned that the that the local authorities of this land including should have received a demand of twelve a twelve percent minimum for a p t and c and a minimum wage of nine thousand three hundred and thirty a level much higher than the labour party's own national minimum wage and indeed higher than the t u c's definition
national minimum wage of which has said the employment consequences would be little short of disastrous and the society backs estimates that up to eight hundred thousand jobs could be destroyed by the minimum wage and of the a e u described the minimum wage as nonsense and said he was UNK opposed to it's introduction in the private sector
the result the result of such claims will be a rush to restore differentials and a general inflation in local authorities with no increase in value of services for the community and i ask that the labour party should distance itself from this very mis guided proposal for national wage proposals minimum national wage proposals
if this council means what it says about UNK and customer er customer contracts it must begin to see that the over riding need for local divisional pay determination and sub divisional pay determination that relates reward to the volume value and standard of service delivered
and i say to the chief officers of this authority that their that their proposed that their proposed claim of fourteen percent is nothing short of disgraceful
as councillor would have said and i would remind members of council that i believe that the chief officers of this council still have pay related to their performance and i am sure that all members not least the controlling group will take will take note of that
and we do hope that the chief officers of this authority will show the UNK st restraint they normally have
a very small proportion my lord mayor of what affects the UNK financial position is your own car sir which i am delighted to see has been plugged into the controlling group's revenue expenditure this year
it's a relatively modest amount nine thousand pounds a year
we are delighted to endorse the decision delighted to endorse the decision for your car to be er to be provided in proper state and proper style
we are delighted that the council wishes you wishes you to drive around in black
we would we would like to see the controlling group showing equal commitment to keeping all of us in the black
hear
in conclusion my lord member we all remember we all remember the windfall the supposed windfall that councillor said had been produced by the good housekeeping of the joint bodies of
it was of course nothing of the sort
it was that distribution was to prevent a certain labour authority in being charge UNK
it was not money that the joint bodies did not require or need
it was money that the five leaders UNK and the results have been cuts that threaten the closure of household waste sites in and in
is my lord mayor going to have to find extra money to fi to fi to fund those sites independently
if not and if they close will UNK at least three things
it will have three UNK of
it will have councillor it will have an UNK and out of control revenue budget and it will have streets and parks UNK with abandoned UNK household rubbish
councillor
thank you my lord mayor
it is interesting isn't it that er i knew the road to UNK was long but i didn't realise it were that long cos on the second of july the tories moved an amendment at p and r UNK us for spending money on the lord UNK car but i'm glad to see that you've come back to the fold
i think what is interesting though is that if you look at the two amendments which are on the audit paper one deals with speculation er proposed by the tories
what i intend to deal with is the record as it stands because anybody who's going to argue a case against the decline of any kind of system has to put the facts as they are not as they would wish them to be and i would argue that the legacy before we can do that the legacy which we inherited as a controlling group back in UNK is now a matter of record i would accept
but because of the nature because of the nature of our amendment we do need to remind the opposition that er prior to that date was facing major social economic problems as vital services in the local economy fell victim to the consequences of planning thirty million out of the budget in order to bring in a low poll tax
that's where we began
at that particular time er quite right faced with the failing national economy and it's got worse than it was then and an increase in poverty in this controlling group produced its plan for UNK ninety one and in it's UNK packages which are now part of our agenda on council we d we made to UNK one was to change the nature of council and the other was to UNK sources on the process of need and we put four point three million on UNK in the first year four point seven the second year
we had no new monies during last year and consequently we have no growth
now what's important is the philosophical advice on which those packages came from
ours were led on a policy led planning process which was driven by the needs of which are clearly identified in the an anti poverty strategy which is designed to protect the services the jobs to UNK the local economy and make a better place to live and for children to grow up in
area panels which have been so UNK and neighbourhood UNK have since confirmed the wisdom of that process and the UNK of a tory budget process driven not by the needs of the community but the need to deliver the firm UNK message which is still there set a poll tax as low as possible and then work your priorities backwards irrespective of the consequences
i submit my lord mayor that any decline in the council's finances is due primarily to the tories originally looking for electoral success
the electorate rejected them and they put that before the quality services and the social responsibility that we have as councillors not just to ourselves and our wards but to the whole district and the community as councillor continually reminds us
there are two other documents you have to consider in the monetary and evaluation exercise to see how successful we were in UNK ninety one is called a partnership for quality and the other is called UNK shares a programme towards an anti strategy
both these documents came before this council in july UNK
what they were based on and i have to say it though that since poverty in all its forms has proved an UNK enemy to us and given the limited council resources that were available plus the government which has consistently attacked local authorities and made financial constraints upon us almost impossible to operate we have we recognise that to analyse the job in hand first of all we needed an accurate picture of need we needed to share the commitment with the workforce of council and all those in partnership of consultation
we needed imagination UNK and courage and above all we needed a political will to be shared by the controlling group
now if you use any financial monitor that we have and bearing in mind the size of the task any critical analysis will reveal that this council under labour can definitely say that it's met the challenge and it's certainly started to make the change
however i wouldn't want to simply sit back on our achievement because there's no room for UNK
some of the facts that's been put forward today i would remind that you that the financial UNK of the d e at the moment about poll tax levels for this year standing spending assessments the increased capping powers that mister heseltine will bring forward will make it extremely difficult in this year
but the UNK policies that were brought through in the th er in the thatcher era they still are here with us no matter how they try to get shut of them the poll tax which has been referred to by councillor is confusion at its best
it's the worst thing that's ever come from any political party and all associated problems live on and all we have at the moment is one statement after the other from the ministers which blame the very people that it attacks
it UNK the poor it UNK the unemployed it UNK industry and it UNK commerce for the mess that we're in and never says anything about itself
i want to just UNK the myth that has been put forward by councillor about the poll tax cos did this at p and r and i will reiterate what the leader said then and i and quite clearly and UNK that the labour party both nationally and locally and this labour group do not UNK a policy of non payment either as a principle or as a UNK
is that clear
have you got that
thank you
now then and i think that it's important well let me let me just deal with the minor diversion that in s those people who choose not to pay that is a personal choice and they will take the consequences of their actions
however what the poll tax has revealed UNK is that there are poverty UNK in this city entirely due to that particular tax and those people who are in financial difficulty we do understand the problem they have and we will continue to help
now the evidence is very clear
i'll produce the evidence for you
that's not a worry
now if you really wanted to help and you were concerned about that
but let me give you two
er before we start i would like to say that we have received a request er i think it was from longman UNK tories er UNK to have er one of our meetings recorded and er after discussing with the leader of the council er and er we decided that this may be the best committee to record
basically what it is they er want to UNK a collection of some one hundred million words of written and spoken text that can used by dictionary UNK which are there just to study the english language
it is all completely confidential
no individuals will be identified and really it's for the future er so you there may be the opportunity of er new words recorded
so er with your approval er graham has got the er recording aid
there's either one here where else are they graham
that's the only that's the only one
is that the only one
i was assured that it will pick everybody up
erm just to mention also chair it they've asked to deal with the personnel sub committee meeting next week as well
i see
thank you so we've obviously got to behave ourselves this morning and act in a proper manner
shout out
well i'll turn it that way
er so first of all could we have er any apologies or UNK for this meeting
chair there are no apologies for this meeting that i know of
thank you
the er first item on the agenda is the minutes of a meeting fifteenth of october
can i have your approval of those minutes
good
agreed
thank you
the next paper is cash limits and i believe you're going to take this on
yes er thank you chair
i'll say if i knew any UNK i was very tempted to s i would have been very tempted to use it in the lights of the er the dictionary
er the first paper is the er is the beautiful category in the paper allocations from the contingency
there are three erm categories to er the requests for allocations for this meeting erm the balance of the contingency currently is one point seven two nine million pounds
and if the er requests for approval er are indeed a approved the balance er remaining for the contingency will be some four hundred and seventy five thousand pounds
the recommendations on the front page to show the three categories
the first category all relates to er related pay awards
all pay awards are have been settled at one and a half per cent and i don't propose to go into any of the detail
the figures er for each er of the settlements er is shown in the more detailed erm paper
i will make brief comments chair on the two other UNK items and if i may refer members to the more detailed paper and firstly to section three capital accounting by local authorities
best local authority accounting practice is er contained within the code of practice on local authority accounting erm which is er published and maintained by the
erm that is has been revised with effect from the first of april nineteen ninety four to incorporate proposals for a new system of capital accounting
erm the code does have the force of law er and requires local authorities to adopt the new capital accounting system from april nineteen ninety four
preparation for the new accounting capital accounting system required all our assets to be valued
currently the er the county council's assets as shown in the balance sheet have a value of twenty nine million pounds
now that of course is way below the actual value of those assets er but it's still over twenty nine millions because of the previous way in which erm the er capital was accounted for
erm we need to value those assets and the cost of back work being carried out by the london buildings consultancy would be nineteen thousand pounds some twenty pounds per property
there's no budget provision and as a consequence approval is being sought for that some to come from the contingency
the er moving on to section four waste disposal
the contingency originally had provision for some four thousand pounds for waste disposal
that provision was placed in the contingency because it was un felt it was unclear at the time what the effect on costs would be of the sale of link waste
in fact er an estimated one hundred and sixty three six forty pounds is required erm following on from the sale of link waste and of that eighty five thousand pounds wa relates to the legal costs associated with the sale
it seems that there a large figure
it is a large figure but the county council was breaking er new ground in the sale of link waste and it was necessary to engage specialist lawyers erm UNK a firm of er london solicitors er to assist in the in the process and members will recall that in fact the proceeds from the sale of link waste were four point two million pounds initially with potentially another four hundred thousand pounds erm once certain conditions were satisfied
in addition to that another one hundred and eighty thousand pounds is required for the on going maintenance of some closed sites dealing with problems and also to some legal and consultancy fees in connection with a an after care dispute
so the total of the four hundred and fifty thousand pounds that is now being requested it's three hundred and forty three forty
erm and it is erm the waste disposal sub committee did resolve at their meeting erm earlier this month to request the finance sub committee to make er an allocation
if er members approve the three er categories of allocation there will as i said earlier be four hundred and seventy five thousand pounds left in the contingency
thank you chair
any comments
er could we just ask er a couple of questions mr chairman
is that four seventy five likely to survive there be any more calls on it
that's the first question
erm the second question is if you hadn't put inflation in this year
yes the er in answer to the er the first point i do not er expect there to be many additional calls on the remaining on the remainder of the contingency
there may be some but i would expect that this time sum er or close to it will be the final balance and that of course will flow into the general balances of the county council and er a one million pounds was allocated from the contingency that finance sub committee in october to meet the price er to meet a prices inflation
okay
no other comments
you agreed on the recommendations
agreed
agreed
agreed
good
paper b
thank you chair
this paper deals with those er non target area er projects
in other words projects which are not contained within erm service committee targets
there are some seven in total and i'll briefly refer to those
the first one turning over the page relates to er grant maintained schools erm the fact that erm the calculation of the indirect maintenance grant is based on last year's percentages
erm so instead of paying for primary schools eleven point nine per cent which is the actual er amount of er indirect support that is provided within the erm education department and seven that's in relation to primary schools and seven point eight per cent schools
we have to pay the er ninety two three percentages which were fifteen point two per cent and nine point eight per cent so there's an additional element there and also we have to deal with erm the additional cash that goes to grant maintained schools who went grant maintained prior to the first of april nineteen ninety two
they are protected at the cash additions that they had er or originally and they are somewhat higher than the erm actual erm indirect per percentages would be
the estimate for ninety four ninety five is that there will be some one point three eight five million pounds required but i er have to say that we have not as in previous years we have not at this stage received from the d f e er details of how the er indirect element of a n g will be calculated for next year so the requirement may differ er in due time
section three deals with police and fire pensions
erm the revised estimate for police pensions is some hundred and nineteen thousand pounds higher than the original estimate
now that is not as significant an increase as we've had in previous years
there are greater additions to expenditure than that but there that has been in part off set by er a greater er receipt from other authorities in relating to er policemen transferring to lincolnshire
as far as ninety four five is concerned erm the er estimate is some six hundred and eighty one thousand pounds higher than the original estimate for this year and again there is a mix of factors giving rise to that
as far as fire fighters pensions is concerned the revised estimate is really significantly higher than the original estimate
over half a million pounds and there are three factors that make er up that er sum a hundred and eighty thousand pounds for the lump sum payment erm transfers out to other authorities that's fire fighters transferring to other authorities fire services
two hundred and thirty one thousand and we had lower than ex expected receipts from fight fighters transferring in to lincolnshire
in total we estimate that next year police and fire pensions will cost gross nearly seven and a half million pounds
so that is a very significant increase on the fi on the amount that er fairly recently we were having to pay
the next item specific grants deals in main part with specific grant on the police pensions er element
erm but it also deals with erm police claim office grant on c that is charged to the police and repair and maintenance and also related to one or two minor items
some specific grant on the judges UNK the maintenance of that payable by the lord UNK department and so some specific grant on emergency planning
that's spec this is the final year in which specific grant will be payable on emergency planning
the er revised estimate is one hundred and fifty thousand pounds higher than the original estimate and we're expecting over three hundred thousand pounds into the specific grant and ninety four ninety five
the next deals with UNK and the major UNK is that which is paid to the lincolnshire floor defence committee
erm we've got initially some slightly bad news on this but then some really rather encouraging news
the er the UNK is that the way of UNK and contributions to flood defence committees has changed as a result of the introduction of the er of the council tax
previously er our share depended upon er the population of lincolnshire as a proportion of the total area
the basis of UNK which is now the council tax base and we er do lose slightly from that change
section five point two makes reference to the additional a hundred and ten thousand pounds that was approved in october for erm er expected budget pressures in this particular area and in fact we have had an eleven thousand pounds refund from the severn trent er flood defence committee so there's only ninety nine thousand pounds er the revised estimate is ninety nine thousand above the original estimate
now turning to the good news and that is that the lincolnshire flood defence committee was set to increase after ninety four five which is some twenty per cent below the normal three four level
that the UNK there is an increase over the UNK er flood defence UNK and flood defence committee two and a half per cent but that as severn trent is set at a zero increase
so the overall effect on these budgets is that the original estimate is just over seven hundred thousand pounds the original estimate for ninety four five is just over seven hundred thousand pounds below the original estimate for ninety three ninety four
section six deals with mandatory student awards where the county council acts if you like as the UNK on behalf of the government with the payment of student awards
it's expenditure out and then income in from the government
the perhaps the points to make there is that the bigger the ninety four five is er getting on for four million pounds below the ninety three four level and that reflects firstly a reduction in students grants with a corresponding increase in the amount available from student loans and secondly a reduction in the UNK fees payable as part of the mandatory award er in the light of direct higher direct funding of higher education establishments
now this is er also and this is to do with the interest earned and on revenue balances
the UNK estimates for er interest on revenue balances depends upon anticipating cash flows
the cash into the authority the timing of that and the ti the timing of cash going out of the authority
a particular difficulty in trying to estimate the ninety three four er position was erm UNK from er the independence of further education colleges
we were not sure how that would affect the cash flows of the authority and set a very er cautious level for interest on revenue balances and as members can see that has been very well exceeded er its UNK by some one point one million pounds in ninety three four and it's expected to be of a similar level in ninety four ninety five
and finally chair the last section c within committee budget erm this area is where the costs of providing the central department is UNK to other departments
there's a higher revised estimate and a higher original estimate for next year er that is to do with charging c to the probation committee erm which previously was er ex excluded and that is er of course subjected within the probation committee cash limit and eighty per cent grant is payable on any sums within that
as far as the public service units are concerned er where the amount of c is a real charge and can dis UNK er disadvantage them significantly erm the ninety two three charges are reduced by ten per cent erm it it's expected there'll be a further two per cent reduction so there's a twelve per cent reduction in the c charges to the public service units
thank you chairman
the report is for noting
that they're rather interested in the information contained in it
just concerned about you know we don't know really what the er impact of the grant maintained er and how quickly we know what that is er treasurer please
chair i don't know er last year we were in a similar position
yes
the january meeting of this committee we didn't know what the arrangements would be
mm
i think we got to know around mid february
so if the same pattern is followed it would be middle of february before we find out what the arrangements will be
the amount of money that we have to pay out is er obviously UNK from the education budget
on that chair i think erm the protection of the schools that went grant maintained before ninety two i think that will continue
but certainly some progress is being made towards the common funding formula
mm
and the financial incentives er to go grant maintained are rapidly decreasing
councillor
i do hope we're not going to extend our current lawyers who we use in this particular issue erm whatever this amount of money is spent in school and er to that extent i think we should er be well prepared to foot the bill
chairman i think the chair of UNK comments were bias
it has nothing to do with the individual grant maintained schools
what we have to realise it is taking a UNK of money amount of money out of UNK education budget
this is the concern and we all know how tight that UNK is and how much we need to put into education accounts
erm i think that the comments that chair made ar are extremely bias in what she's saying i think is that it looks as if erm the minister is beginning to realise this simply can't go on this UNK funding and that is what is so unfair and i think it does need to make quite clear to grant maintained schools that there is it there is that possibility that will be reduced because they need to know that just as well for balancing their own budgets in the future
any comments
councillor
was not as it were that's the way the treasurer would use balancing you've got another million pounds in the
