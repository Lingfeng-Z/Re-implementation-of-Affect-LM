mind you i did think last year the grant was down too low at eight hundred thousand but that was the amount they put in it was two point eight i think to start with and two million pounds offered in the end
which made our budget er that problem obviously that much more difficult and just showed the problems we live with mr chairman
which can produce the budget within the guide lines as we found with interest rates
pleased you raised that councillor 'cos we're still two million short than the government assessment within the s a
yes that's right
which er you know adds to the doubt you're obviously aware of the
thank you
as i say the er it is it is two million less than what the government has assessed we should be receiving in interest payments
just commenting on the er grant maintained schools
it's not a case of being UNK it's a case of seeking fairness for all the school children and then some of them receiving UNK you know higher er amounts of money then that must be seen to be unfair and i'm certainly well supported in that
are there any other comments on this paper
yeah i just er like to just to welcome the ongoing commitment to the UNK department to keep down the er charges to the public service units through c e c obviously this is to the benefit and gives them the a greater chance of UNK out there in what is a difficult market place
councillor
er thank you mr chairman to me erm this went on from the first paper that chose the effects of the food and management of the er the fire local services whereas carried through and it will be interesting to see next year er what the situation is in order to the position of the as it were this year benefit of everything that has previous administration
well we've already got some information from central government that we're ten million short
on the government
i'm sorry you know you've had your say
any other comments
no
give me er note of the recommendation
paper c is the revenue estimates
i believe you were taking this paul
yes thank you thank you chair
this paper seeks your approval for the revised estimate for the current financial year nineteen ninety three ninety four and the for estimates nineteen ninety four ninety five for the policy commission
it also seeks your approval to the which has been undertaken by respective chief officers during the current financial year in which is why i'm reporting to you now in accordance with the national regulations
the report itself was in the usual format UNK a report by the county treasurer a joint report by the chief executive and county treasurer and then the detailed estimate contained on the blue pages
but let's propose a statement which through the county treasurer's report in any detail today it's already been to all service committees and i'm sure you're very familiar with it's contents
what i will do however is just draw your attention to two key issues within that report which affect the estimates of this committee
having turned then to page a two
starting at page a two paragraph five and nine indicate that there is presently a gap of so of some eleven point four million pounds between the overall spending limits of three hundred and eighty one point four million pounds agreed by the policy committee last november and the provisional cutting limits set by the government of three hundred and seventy million pounds
at it's meeting last november the policy committee did agree to review the overall spending limits in the light of the final revenue support claim settlement
and the outcome of that review will be reported to its next meeting on the eighth of february
should the review require an adjustment to this committee's target a further report will be made at the next meeting of this committee on any amendment to that target
the second matter i would just like to draw your attention to briefly er within the treasurer's report is in paragraph eight
this explains how the target for this committee is being set
as for all other committees the target for this committee for nineteen ninety four ninety five allows fully for the effect of inflation from november nineteen ninety two to november ninety three
that being the price fixed at which the was presented
it allows fully also for known commitments in service
the effect of forward inflation that's inflation which will be incurred during nineteen ninety four ninety five is not incorporated in this estimate
it will be considered by the policy committee again at it's meeting in february
in summary therefore the estimates before you er for the policy committee represent the cost of maintaining existing policies and levels of service
if i could turn now to the joint report of the chief executive and the county treasurer
this is set out on page of b one to b three
page b one covers the er estimate from the chief UNK department
detailed revised budget target of two point one five nine million pounds is set out in paragraph two and you'll note that the main addition to the estimate approved by the county council last february of one point eight nine two
the county hall department are spending from nineteen ninety two ninety three this UNK to a hundred and eighty thousand four hundred and ten pounds
further addition has been made of seventy two thousand pounds for service and negatives introduced by the department bill and approved by the policy committee last june
paragraphs five to seven explain the UNK the nineteen ninety four and ninety five target of tw two point oh one eight million pounds
this again starts with the original estimate for nineteen ninety three ninety four of one point eight nine two million pounds and details of changes agreed by the policy committee last november
this allows for UNK of the budget for november nineteen ninety two to november nineteen ninety three and that sum is shown there as some fifty seven thousand pounds
this includes also an amount of thirteen thousand five hundred er to support the scheme for public questions which was approved by the policy committee last november
if we turn now to page b two this presents the information for the county treasurer's department for the same format
for those of nineteen ninety three ninety four and nineteen ninety four and ninety five
starting with nineteen ninety three ninety four
again the main additions of the original estimate is that the carried forward of two hundred and forty four thousand pounds from nineteen ninety two ninety three
and approval for this was given by this committee last october
paragraph eleven detailed for your approval of from income generated by re charges to internal funds
and this is being used to fund the cost of the risk manager post
again this was reported to you at the last meeting of this committee
erm and also the cost of increased UNK guarantee insurance of eleven thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds and additional suppliers and services costs principally in respect of consultancy costs arising out of the inland revenue audit of twelve thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds
turning to nineteen ninety four ninety five er paragraph thirteen details of budget target of two point five four oh million pounds
the main addition to the original estimate in the in the case of nineteen ninety four ninety five being the cost of UNK from the november ninety two price costs to november nineteen ninety three at seven hundred and one thousand pounds
moving on erm paragraphs fifteen to twenty one com cover a number of UNK budgets under the wing of the policy committee detailed described as other policy
paragraph sixteen explains the revised target of one point one seven million pounds which UNK which makes UNK for the costs in the current year of operating the university company
these costs UNK to some seventy thousand pounds in nineteen ninety three ninety four
it also makes provisions for meeting redundancy costs within public service units in respect of work which they have lost in competition
paragraph eighteen makes reference to the receipt of fifty three thousand pounds of income
this is the county council's share of the expose surplus for nineteen ninety two ninety three
it also points out in the report that this income has been to meet expenditure of thirty two thousand pounds for the number of services and the remainder of this has been with additional insurance costs
paragraph twenty provides details of the nineteen ninety four ninety five budget target policy
yeah
which was reported in paragraph twenty one includes a reduction of two hundred and thirty two thousand two hundred pounds for the cost of the nineteen ninety three county council elections
and this reduction was partially off set by the costs of a hundred and thirty one thousand pounds again the cost this being the cost of operating a university company in nineteen ninety four ninety five
finally chair if i can just ask members to turn briefly to page c one the first blue page
this page UNK the service area under within the policy committee
the original estimate nineteen ninety three ninety four that's shown in column three
it then provides analysis of inflation and other changes leading to both revised estimates for nineteen ninety three ninety four and the estimate for nineteen ninety four ninety five
for this committee therefore severn we've been asked to approve a revised estimate of five point nine five million pounds and an estimate next year of five point four six seven million pounds
details of these estimates is provided in pages c two to c eleven and i don't propose to go through those in any detail
but i'll be quite happy to answer any questions that members have
the recommendations chair that you approve the estimate for the revised estimate for nineteen ninety three ninety four
the estimates for nineteen ninety four ninety five and the guidelines set out in the report for nineteen ninety three ninety four
thank you
do you agree with those
councillor
i wouldn't know
people were coming in with questions on our first little bit UNK debate
this is er a relatively er small revenue er budget compared to er the service committee's recent week
nevertheless it is erm set once again in the er context of the overall county council budget proposal for next year being three hundred and eighty one million pound
that was an overall estimate that erm members on this side UNK very vigorously when it was first put forward in policy and that any budget er proposals put to committees that er based on that false premise erm would also er be UNK and erm opposed by this side
it takes no account of the er government requirements for er this coming year and having said that i must accept that the overall increase proposed for erm ninety four five er is only three point three per cent
erm only three point three per cent
well in my sums that comes to er something like er fifty per cent more than it ought to be
erm and if we look at individual erm items
when we look at the chief executives department the increase there is what six point six per cent overall
that's a factor of something like three hundred per cent than it than it ought to be in terms of inflation and the county treasurer's budget of plus five per cent which is well in excess of two hundred per cent
so i think you can see that erm there is er not a very strong basis there for this er budget to be promoted by this side
we oppose it
you wish to put forward any amendments to the way you have put
i think the amendment will be slope opposite to the er to the recommendations i don't think it requires an amendment
without any information as to where how you would reduce it
i think no
okay fine
the principles UNK document this project are er UNK you would say and for that reason we oppose it
good
mr chairman if we come in now million pounds
oh is that is that proposal seconded first
it is
it has been seconded
yes
now that's stated in the blue paper you might want to talk about
well you've got the opportunity now if you wish
well it's the case of
i'm sorry i'm UNK the meeting
i'm sorry yo you you're not listening to me
i am listening to you
the treasurer has already gone through the report
it is now up to members to make observations ask questions and then an amendment has been put which is er UNK to direct negative over the recommendations
well the treasurer is responsible at the end of the day for reducing the price of overall
so the question that i would like to ask the treasurer and the statement was made by been allowed
has there been any attempt by anybody to real budget or has
there been in the department just put them together their demands and each of them papers
chief exec up six per cent treasurer department the same
no doubt this goes through
education the other day was up about five or six per cent
i mean i'm gonna protest because i'm gonna vote a protest and commitments are area where some will be allowed and some won't be allowed
it depends on what they are organise the things they need
there hasn't been any attempt about savings or reduced commitments or any or everything is here and if it hasn't been attempts perhaps we could have a list of what's actually been removed
did you wish to
yes erm thank you chair
the process that was followed in preparing the which was exactly the same process as being followed in previous years
it started with these exercise in july and august which sought to identify erm commitments required to maintain existing services
it also sought to i identify opportunity to efficiency and effectiveness savings
so exactly the same process was followed
at a UNK subsequent st stage again as has happened in the in the past inflation was added and that was fully to UNK from november ninety two to november ninety three prices
so yet again the budget was reflecting the amount of money necessary to maintain existing services
now th the way in which the budget has been prepared in previous years has been maintain existing services
so in that respect there is no difference in the preparation of this budget er in comparison with the previous years
the result of all the calculations including er commitments er necessary for example for additional pupils erm lead to an overall budget requirement of three hundred and eighty one point four million pounds
to maintain existing levels of service and that was the budget that was approved by the policy committee in november but with the rider that the erm the overall budget would be review reviewed in january in the light of the revenue support grant settlement and that still is the position
thank you
the statement that all commitments has been allowed isn't
commitments
written you say all commitments have been UNK
yes
commitments necessary for the maintenance of existing levels of service
right
well that necessary at least ways to UNK this
no they were saying totally different
i think you've question that far enough
you've had your answer
you asked how would it be prepared
it you've it was be prepared on the same basis as last year in fact the other
we went through it with a fine tooth UNK
we found all the little bits and pieces the er UNK of how it had been prepared previously by yourself
and er we're quite satisfied with the process that has taken place
probably more thorough and more searching than ever
i don't particularly want to go
exactly
all i'm trying to say
sorry that was i'm sorry you've UNK i'm sorry you've spoken i'm just commenting will you be quiet please i'm taking next speaker
well
will you be quiet
you can ya you can come in here later
did you wish to
mm
thank you yeah
i just referred councillor wild to paragraph eleven on page a three because it does say reasonably clearly i think that the policy committee resolved to review the overall level of spending in january nineteen ninety four in the light of the revenue support grant settlement
we had we had to conservative speakers so far erm and councillor UNK seem to me in a sense to be summing up that phrase about knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing because there was the es essential UNK calculation about percentages and savings
no mention about the difficult task that the county council's got in living within a budget a capping level of three hundred and seventy million and it would be reasonable in a in a in a sense that when somebody's proposing opposition to a budget it gives some indication as to what within the budget would have to be cut
it's not really helpful to be able to say that the amount of money is too great to refer to percentage increases which are higher than the figure that would have been included by erm an opposition group
but not actually to say what would be the outcome of the percentage cuts
of course it's quite right and it's in a sense maybe reasonable to oppose a budget but in the past i think it's been erm one of the strengths of the labour group when in opposition to put alternative budgets in for say yes we take a view that's different to the budget that's before us but so far with two conservative speakers we've not had the benefit of knowing which items which levels of spending within this policy committee be it the chief exec
department or the county treasurer's department is not considered to be relevant to the needs of erm the county council the people of lincolnshire and i think it's reasonable to ask that question and to hope that erm future conservatives speakers in this meeting on this paper will give a clear indication as to what will be the effects of a budget reduction
chairman er can i very briefly reply to what councillor UNK has said and then come on to my erm UNK question about our erm i think now is not the time to give a detailed reply to this
no
conservative administration will change the budget obviously you have highlighted in what you have said before that the main crunch will come at the next policy committee
i think that is the time that we would er wish to put forward er a detailed alternative or seek alternatives
so far as to my specific erm question is on b one on the white paper or other target the public question thirteen thousand five hundred pounds of money you do say in the subsequent paragraph this is to provide public question time at council meetings
is that all that thirteen thousand five hundred is targeted for and that is for the four meetings of the county council each year when there will be a public er question time
could i will answer that
if you read further on it does say committee and sub committees to encourage involvement
in that paragraph
have you answered that question
er what councillor UNK just said i would just like to ask for a clarification there if i may
is he UNK to tell us where everyone of the UNK is going to come at the next policy meeting
is it being proposed
well
no
that was easy
mr chairman rapidly respond to councillor UNK you are the administration this is your budget
yeah
this is your budget
had it been in administration we would have put forward to our budget
but i mean you are being totally unrealistic in putting a budget forward of three hundred and eighty one million er for the county council
i mean that is not at all relevant to the policies of the previous authority
these are your policies they're not our policies
and er you know you've got yourself in this mess get yourself out of it
education
yes right
we don't consider we're in a mess
i would remind you that this is the budget for the policy
yeah true
i mean when we was in opposition if er if we had a westminster crisis in lincolnshire and it suddenly kicked all the conservatives off we would have been able to come up with an alternative budget to manage this county
now i think it's only fair and right that the conservatives are doing as er should be doing the same
but they are
will you be quiet please sir
all they are proposing is we're well all they're doing is opposing we oppose this we oppose this we oppose this they're coming up with no information that the people of lincolnshire can judge them on
and i think it's unfair of them i think it's irresponsible of them to just criticise detailed budgets that are well thought out like ours like ours always were
i have nothing and to have nothing to offer the people of lincolnshire as an alternative
it's just rhetoric in a way
irresponsible rhetoric
perhaps they don't know what to do
councillor
yeah i think i UNK on what the er new opposition because i think it does take some time to particularly after you've
been in opposition for the last well for the for the for the UNK future
you should
and er i think that er i i'm quite interested an and really quite UNK if i once gone on proceedings of this council because every time a new initiative has been proposed you have said oh yes we were going to do that
yes
in any case we er and we want er no opposition to it and in fact i was surprised we owned a pack a pack of UNK
in the transportation planning committee yesterday and the one of the question of opposing them it was what was going to block that they wh wha were they members gonna get for their pockets and their own patches and er i think so i mean i asked a councillor well i asked a question on five per cent for me yesterday and my response was yes precisely
now if you're going to er want everything and then at the same time want to reduce the budget then i think you're like the man who wanted a cake an and you'll find that he wanted to eat it so i think you've got to come to terms and be realistic
and so it would be most interesting to see what sort of UNK you can come up with for policy and we'll see just how you'll meet that
i shall have other things to see later on chair
what other information mr chairman he didn't say that at all yesterday
what he said was he was waiting for the government for better
ca can i say
councillor it is not a final information
he's telling lies
i'm sorry and i'd rather we didn't use that sort of language 'cos you remember you are being recorded
he was referring to something that happened yesterday and we're here
we're here today discussing the policy and we'd like to stay with that
that's right an answer the question
very good
he's a
okay you've answered it now
any other questions or comments
councillor
well mr chairman i think er you know it's all right putting forward a budget like this but there's only one person who got paid for it and that's the general public
and er i think that there are people who are a little wet behind the ears if they think that the general public are going to accept the costs of a budget that's coming forward on a long these lines
and er you know i know we're looking at one particular committee
and i would ask you to direct your questions to that because there's an another time and another place when you can talk and er discuss and put forward proposals regarding the councils overall budgets so i would ask you to concentrate on this but
yeah well right
there are there are starting points which we the opposition party would have started from and it is not from er the same er erm
that you have arrived at that we would have arrived at
there are differences within
erm you know for instance as councillor speak UNK has just said that there's
thirteen thousand five hundred
the there are other things which er we
mm
would have presented a very good budget for
and a lot of other commitments
are you opposing the thirteen thousand
i don't mind but i'm opposing as like the rest of us the budget in
i think you mr chairman it would be totally UNK if we did not raise the issue within the within the budget if we did not raise the issue of election members and the expenses of election members
we did at the time when the expenses were incurred we gave it that we were opposed to all the increases that were being made we still maintain that policy and i believe that there is a time when we should be in approval that we in fact UNK money on new active members is wrong when in fact have the cut backs because at the end of the day people of lincolnshire have to pay for these additional expenses incurred to elected members
you've heard
to inform members generally of the level of settlement in the county councillors under the transport e f p grants arranged
overall the level of settlement was disappointing as the summary on the paper UNK
sample
erm grant comes at a rate of fifty per cent that have accepted it as expenditure
it may be in one or two forms erm cash or expected expenditure
erm by the grants of credit approvals either basic or supplementary which is a that UNK a council spending money on the programmes which the d t p have accepted
overall if one UNK those three things the level of settlement for the county was down thirty one per cent on the year compared with a national total which was also in distress of fourteen and a half per cent down
the settlement does reflect some change in government policy and the areas of expenditure which have previously attracted direct grant are now being met through the grant UNK approvals which do ultimately bring cash to the council erm because they UNK into assets aims and the UNK court room mechanism
but over a period of time erm they are not directly equivalent but very nearly so
it is just information chairman that the amounts in the various categories that are recorded within the paper and i think probably
thank you
i realise this information it's very depressing information
i think it was a it was a very bad er announcement for lincolnshire and er on the strength of that er for the benefit of all of us in the county i just like to UNK a few as a minister for roads and traffic er expressing our bitter disappointment really 'cos it's er particularly on the t s g it's a it's a cut of er of forty five per cent against the er national cut of about half of that
and across the board there has been a cut of er of just below fifteen per cent that the that er our cut is forty five per cent and i mean it er it does er create problems there's no doubt about it and that i got the letter from er which er rod instructed to come along to the department to me yesterday in fact i did refer very briefly to it 'cos i'm gonna just before the meeting that er it sets out saying that it was a very generous set settlement for ninety three ninety four
now of course we know that you know that er that even then part of that settlement has gone because they've cut off on the of the western by pass i mean you've still got er
quite a substantial er amount of money which has got to be financed from my own funds on that
and er i did er invite members all members yesterday and i do have a feed back here again that they do write to lobby on behalf of us because i if this is going to be the UNK for the future it's gonna have very serious implications as to what we do in terms of improving the highway infrastructure at lincolnshire
and this is at a time of course when we have other doors opening to us which we shall need match funding objective rural UNK and er for the for the for the budget to be it to have been cut in this way is very serious
the problem is that the present er formula for road pricing UNK as it is called
i think sometimes it would be better to call it UNK because it does seem to have a very er deadly UNK as far as UNK concerned at the moment
er doesn't er is based on congestion and other factors and it doesn't address the er the needs we have er in developing this county and to achieve it's er it's potential
i think there is
we are at
a point at the moment with the life of the county i think that we should great potential and great opportunity available to us and i do hope that all members will er and i've written to all our members of parliament with a copy of my letter er i had i've had er i know it's been the christmas period and that they're only just getting back into things and there's been a lot of UNK at length and i do have a letter from er i heard from er edward er mr edward lee and i still have to hear it from er the rest of them
i have had a message from the stan standard mercury from davis that my a county has been UNK we've talked about being UNK one time this morning
but he
he says we're UNK
well if he lived in the north east er part of this county that great ar area where there is very little in terms of infrastructure perhaps er it's a pity we can't have a few more UNK and we would perhaps get further down the road
thank you chairman
thank you mr chairman erm i'm here to say it's quite true to say that it does vary from year to year on er what our programme is but er we also have to face it that er com compared with some other areas both east midlands and nationally we do not have the traffic and this does go against our for t a er the traffic on our roads
although it's very dense does not compared with the likes of kent and the south
but er yes er i would have been er i think if i'd still been in jim's place er quite rightly so getting all that we can for the town
but it does vary from year to year
thank you mr chairman erm i find this absolutely UNK this settlement
erm over the last few months we've been over our administration attacked saying that we don't care about the rural communities only the conservative party care about the rural communities that's what we've been told
and then we get a conservative central government er cutting the er funding for the most UNK county in the country not by the same as the rest of the country but by thirty one per cent
over double
now something's slightly wrong there erm it shows that there is a lot of UNK within the conservative party er double standards right the way across the board
secondly erm i'd like to ask o ask the question as well erm regarding the transfer from central government grants to s c a's
could it could people please stop UNK a minute er that is actually the government saying that they no longer gonna give grants their going to give us the right to borrow and are actually encouraging us to do it
that is the effects i mean they will still give grant but UNK through the UNK for and it will be UNK but for a number of years you can't be absolutely precise about how long
we note a what a hundred and thirty million pounds worth of road planned for this county
every one of them that they were gonna do next year
every time
no
no
we've had
we get a savage thirty one ke cent thirty one per cent reduction and what do we get a UNK from the previous chairman of the committee
oh well there's reasons for it
and yet i can bet that every time jim has his committee meeting they're gonna be UNK on the door for some by pass or some road scheme that they would have done
yeah that's right that's right
absolutely every one they would have done
that's right
give him the floor
and what are they doing about it
what they doing for the people of lincolnshire
are they gonna go down to see their friends at central government and say come on this thirty one per cent is totally unacceptable
what they gonna do about it
they took u is that it
is that the soul er contribution we're gonna get from this conservative group
well you know we have got haven't got quite the traffic that other places have got
and they're just gonna leave us to deal with it
they're letting the people of lincolnshire down
that's right
well when did we ever ask you the labour and liberal vice to come down to westminster with us mr chairman
that's one of but we but we never did we all went down and sometimes we did and sometimes we didn't part of er was on about is that in ninety five ninety six highways by four million quid
erm and it was so it's obviously as good as it was you know i think you could resign as chairman if actually at all so
a burden of a hundred and thirty million pounds
we would have funded that over ten years
funded
yes i heard you yes i heard you say the other day and also did read in the press where you've been quoted councillor UNK that you would build various by passes and no doubt you will be putting i haven't yet heard any amendments to the capital goal
i did sit in yesterday at transport exec and planning but no doubt they will be forthcoming
mr chairman did i hear correctly that the hundred and thirty million would have been funded over ten years
ridiculous
so can you tell us please where the additional ten million
we only went through
sorry mr chairman where the additional ten million cuts would have been made to fund that
well cuts
need it
yeah i'm pleased that this erm statement i think it was in capital monitoring a few weeks ago by councillor UNK is now out into the public UNK
because capital monitoring was a closed committee
the hundred and thirty pounds that councillor referred to is the are the schemes in UNK
a hundred and thirty million
a hundred and thirty million around the county you know the lincoln relief road the eastern relief road stage one twenty five million the stage two another eight million
boston the list goes on until we get to a total of a hundred and thirty million
councillor said that hundred and thirty million could be funded over a period of ten years at thirteen million pound a year
now that is something that one would find difficult to accept normally erm but seeing as our councillor has been chair of transportation i believe in the past and also leader of the county council that then it does make one wonder about erm UNK budgeting and raising expectations of people around the county unnecessarily
we we've noted the way that every time there is a local issue about a particular road scheme that the conservatives immediately say we would have done that next year
th the will be other new schemes that were not yet come forward because the local media have not erm addressed a particular area but as soon as it does in march or april then the town conservatives would have done that next year
and the and the list goes on
i think that the point has to be made that when we've had a transport supplementary grant decision and settlement as poor as this one then it really is about trying to protect and enhance the people of lincolnshire and the road network rather than just for once party politics because i can't honestly believe that the conservatives would actually feel that this is a fair reasonable settlement
i mean to be quite honest about it it's a it's an unsatisfactory settlement from whichever political party that you come from and it's about time perhaps the conservatives recognised that you can't support a national government policy that does as much damage to the people of lincolnshire as this transport supplementary grant settlement has done
could i just correct you on that i think it was acknowledged by this vote er for transport plan settlement
i yes
i
you know
i would have made an UNK and i would have er tried to achieve a better settlement
that is accepted and in fact we
no i'm sorry no
information
councillor
well councillor very briefly in response to councillor referred the same sort of thing from yourself er chairman on numerous occasions
i think it's about time that you stopped UNK
i think it's about time that you stopped blaming and i think it's about time that you started accepting re le responsibility that you are in it and getting on and making this council
thank you
we shall accept full responsibility for everything we do
it does concern me chairman david councillor UNK has just said i would have made noises and i would have attempted to get a better settlement
why won't he do that for the people of lincolnshire now
i'm not changing my tune councillor UNK knows that in the past i have actually offered to go with them when they've made erm visits to the minister and when he said we tried but we never got anywhere and on various issues i've said well perhaps if we got us an all party delegation at least we could have done no worse
now why now is councillor UNK now saying i would have done it not i will do it
okay
erm just a point of information i think er on the hundred and thirty one million including the lincoln and i think er they would have been you would have been under serious er distress on that because the information i have had from the department of transport is that if the lincoln scheme had gone ahead it would have effectively blocked everything else for the next five years and that wouldn't have done you any good from where you're elected either
so we're looking at it first i think in the end there are schemes that we've got to put on to the back UNK or the until such times lincoln UNK further and there is further development
it needs another twenty thousand people i think if that's going to go ahead
but the fact is that what i my plea to you today and my plea to the committee yesterday is that i don't want this to be in the political arena it is in the political arena but i think we do need to er take it out of the political arena for the benefit of all the people that put us here
mm
in this county
not for the conservative party or the liberal party or the labour party
it is called benefit and the well being of those kids about there that we're UNK them at our own school that they can have jobs and work and if this is going my fear is okay we can live within this s as you say it may that it's just bad settlement for one year
we shall have to live with it because er i don't think that any hope of any UNK next year but the got to be established of a different system of me a different methodology for the UNK years if we're going to get those schemes through that you supported UNK and UNK us and for bringing forward the new road schemes for er the that you so approved so UNK yesterday
well you we can't do those unless we get er more cooperation from central government
i got we we've established a and i'm delighted that the minister is part of that because he controls the purse and the purse UNK
otherwise the forum is just a talking shop
so it is essential that those people that
that control the purse are part of the dialogue and i hope david that you will continue to make your submissions in opposition as i did
the chair
can i come back
er mrs UNK said
she must realise that the conservatives are in opposition
i am not a chairman jill is jill UNK is and the other fact
yesterday it was proposed that a committee be formed to look into speed limits
the conservatives asked to be represented on that committee and they were refused by the ruling groups
we were told that you might have as much effect on that as you're having with central government
what is it you're our chairman mr chairman but i am a little concerned there seems to be two stands this morning
you've already UNK when you said you've already spoken you cannot again
wh wha what comment have you got
i'm saying i'm in the chair
is if you are chairman be consistent
i am consistent
if there's one person speaking
is it do you wish to comment on this paper
i want to s comment on this meeting
well come on then
no well that that's within my UNK and the UNK of the committee who elected me
thank you
if you wish to comment on the paper i give everyone the opportunity and believe you me i'm being as very as fair as i can
but we can only we can talk as many times as we like then mr chairman
if i allow you to yes
right
i think we've had a fair er debate on that
we have the report and it is for noting
unless anybody has any er other amendments to put forward
do you agree with these recommendations
agreed
agreed
thank you
er the next paper is er the external auditors management letter and we have with us today UNK and UNK representatives and i understand max who you're going to er speak to us about
thank you
just remind members by er way of introduction that this is the first occasion when the external auditor has been er invited to answer questions and make points on the management er letter to the full committee
er that's all i want to say and i think er max here has got erm something by way of introduction and then there will be an opportunity to question us
yeah not a form of opening government
do you want to erm well i've come today as the partner responsible for recruiting my men for the audit of the county council together with my colleague stephen UNK who is the partner responsible for the UNK audit the main accounts of the county council accounts
and another senior colleague steve UNK on my right whose primary responsibility is with the value for money work that we undertake on your behalf
and as we set out in the management letter it's a requirement of the audit commissioners code of practice as we do report to areas of all the authorities that we deal with on an annual basis
and indeed erm in the papers summarise really UNK the work that you undertake and including december ninety two to december ninety three
there's the work that we do erm most of the that we undertake actually are erm engaged in providing an opinion on the accounts of the county council
but we do have a responsibility for value for money and UNK issues as well and appendix eight of our paper actually UNK in brief form the work that we've undertaken on your behalf this year
the audit er the accounts your offices will be assigned er as of the twenty third of december of ninety three and but we're not able yet to conclude the audit as i'm considering an objection which has been received from a member on the matter of publicity
erm the local government act nineteen ninety two UNK the auditor to actually advise the council to er matters which we believe that you should consider in full er county erm council meeting and i'm pleased to confirm that for this year there is nothing of that nature that er we would put to you to refer to
lincolnshire has a lot of history of being a well managed authority a proved exercising sound controls on its financial and management affairs and i'm pleased to say that i'm again in a position to confirm that is our view for the conduct of the council's business in the period on which we are reporting
in paragraph one oh nine and one ten th i do actually draw your attention to two areas though i think that members amongst all the issues that we have to deal with erm to bear in mind in particular and indeed the first one probably the most important in the sense of the longer term financial indications to reduce the extension of it is limits that are being imposed upon local government generally and of course here in lincolnshire in particularly in particular
and indeed i think that it is quite clearly the theme there's been money through the meeting this morning
er it is a very difficult climate it's becoming increasingly difficult and indeed it's affecting the work that we do in the sense that the more government
awards monies for specific purposes your offices for specific and confirm the expense of those purposes annual auditors to actually confirm that it has been so spent
and it's increasing the burden of work upon your offices and upon the auditors as well
it is a difficult climate and the announcement before christmas that erm no government expenditure would increase by some two point three per cent generally across england and wales is clearly not erm worked so well for lincolnshire with a capping limit increasing only by one point seven per cent and the s a is increasing by one point two per cent
and quite clearly managing your affairs as you have done in the past within this context becomes more difficult
but i think we see that with the capital programme that quite clearly you're erm having to take into account the fact that capital spend erm cannot be er maintained at the level it has in the past and indeed i believe you are talking about this matter er later on this morning
yes
er but that's an indication of what's happening in that area and indeed the members erm i am pleased to say have taken the right attitude to that recognised that that's the case and er addressing that together with the revenue spend erm in a manner which i find is erm of responsible and approved
in spite of this there has been serious developments and in this year and they'll be fully in place next year
and the process under which that was taking place er reminds you all that you are unhappy with as well
erm the monetary outlook is not going to be easy
the erm any other areas that i've drew particular attention as a as a key issue is on the matter of er UNK and doing work for other bodies which has been an issue here which er as you may recall we mentioned that in the last two or three years
we have done some work with your offices on that and whilst on most of your activities aren't happy with er the scale of such that it does cause me a problem there is one particular area that we are in discussion with the chief executive and your offices relating to doing work for other bodies to and the contract vehicle hire service and er that's something which we will and no doubt will be brought us in the very near future
erm the only other thing i think it remains for me to say is that erm the work will be undertaken on a value for money nature
most of that is presently with your offices and draw up a reports in a moment it was on special education needs and so on
erm we have a programme developing for next year which we will discuss with your offices to ensure that we use the time that we UNK to your audit er in an effective efficient and economic manner
and the UNK work which is what we call the work on the accounts the opinion on the accounts the work seems very well and the timetable that was agreed with er the county treasurer offices
and er which we finished and i would really just like to say that erm thanks very much for the cooperation that we received from the offices generally across the authority
i think it's fair to say that we do not all matters and i hope that nobody's here that would appreciate that the audit role is an independent role
we have considerable rights of inspection search discussion and the right to documents
er your officers have always extremely cooperative in that way and that they're a particular group of officers they don't like to agree with everything that we say and we have to go with UNK discussions
ultimately i believe that er the best interest is leave it to ourselves by that particular process and with that chairman i wish to conclude
thank you very much
anyone wish to councillor
no it's just a general enquiry really i guess erm you you've through you chairman i i've heard about the involvement of officers but i wonder what extent there is involvement of members in the process of preparing those reports and presentations of the report is there any member comment on that
would you like to
certainly erm it has changed this year erm but the arrangements now are that we produce our report across the year with i and as you can appreciate the report UNK various of one thing we done during the with officers around the county round the erm at the at the end of november we commit to writing this report in summary version which we then discuss with the chief executive and the county treasurer in particular they take whatever UNK they wish with other offices and then we agree that letter
at that point once the letter is UNK we then did have a meeting with two members the chairman of this committee that'll be councillor park to just go through it and that happened on monday morning of this week
great long speech
thank you
so our involvement was for it to be presented to us before it came to this meeting
any other queries on this
one question mr chairman er information really er on this section one oh
erm does specific questions relating to er matters that the auditor has brought to you you've mentioned the chief executive but a general opinion really
is he saying i understand sir that you approve of cross border UNK from other local authorities or not
erm may i take the opportunity to say that cross border is a bit of a UNK erm it's the correct term is really doing work for other bodies
it's absolutely clear that the public body should be doing work for private sector organisations and er to my knowledge lincolnshire county council have not been to that particular erm definition although other authorities do and i have had to stop other authorities undertaking contracts where they are er private sector organisations
so far as doing work with public sector bodies erm the business services act of nineteen seventy six came into stand this creates a lot of er which work had been done
erm the main requirement is that where you have resources or applied property to discharge your own functions people come under the then you are at liberty to use those resources where it doesn't increase the capacity to do work for other public bodies but you should neither increase your own capacity to do work with other bodies
nor should you seek to do derive a profit from the services that you provide to i don't know public bodies
does that answer your question
that answers my question yes
councillor UNK
well i'll ask er oh they're not here
oh thank you first of all for this statement
i think it's the longest we've approved and
long may it's costing you
er but the question that i'd like to a ask is erm reducing er it's about capital because er where the capital is being in use and like yesterday reducing capital is always an easy option
requesting when there was fifty million programmes and that it's an option that governments always take
i must admit weak option but its an easy option
UNK capital lively financed from revenue of course grants and property sales etc are sold that money can be transferred into services and money can be borrowed
so it is easy option to borrow and spend that money on services
are rather different if the builder wants us to borrow on their behalf that's one thing whether we should borrow on our behalf is a question that one has to
so would he have any comments to make say next year at this time
or is there an area which you would get into on the question of whether how hard we should struggle before we er do that sort of thing or whether it's purely a matter for the county council
could i be before you answer that question you did ask didn't you ask him to be hypothetical and say what would he say in a year's time and i think what
well i meant i mean it is his job talking to comment on
well i'll ask him
is it is it he can answer that question is it he's job to look in what er happened in a year's time
it is not my job to comment on the policy of the county council
expect only in that it was a danger that you were going to incur expenditure which is of an unlawful n nature pending on the clearly wish to comment
or indeed if the consequences of that particular policy decision is such that the erm the revenue considerations were serious and UNK and in which case you would not be UNK value for money and i most certainly would have a comment to make
johnny would ask you if you did the auditing for westminster but er that's a bit wrong at this stage
i do not wish to discuss
well i seriously mr chairman conservative group for the county council of westminster is a lot better than it is
you'll have to write to lady anyone else wish to comment on
if not
could i thank you very much sir and you're thank you for coming in and the way you presented the report it's a difficult report and we hope that er we're in a similar situation thank you
right erm i'm not too sure paper ten treasury management and i believe this is going to be taken by noel harrison
chair
it's er almost two years ago now that erm and it i'd like you to wait but not entirely as a consequence of b c i's er UNK that UNK published a code of practice to treasury management and a guide to the chief officers who were members of that institution
erm in terms of treasury management
one of the requirements of that particular council guides to the chief officers was that they should bring before the councils a statement that treasury management policy and arrangements and that in fact was done in the autumn of ninety two and the council adopted a particular statement which reflected its circumstances at the time erm and the then policy
by and large that particular go erm statement which is actually embodied in financial regulations also envisage erm a situation where there would be no long term borrowing
erm since that particular time the financial climate has significantly changed and the government policy in relation to certain areas of expenditure which i comment which i commented on earlier erm has also changed in that instead of paying direct grant they are now issuing credit approvals which UNK borrowing to agreed levels within the constraints of the capital control mechanisms that the government have in place the controlling overall levels of UNK of councils
erm whilst those credit approvals do bring UNK to the council over time the equivalent amount to grant in broad terms
what they you do is in fact shift the incidence on cash flow
given that change in circumstances we it was felt that it would be prudent to propose to members a change to the actual statement which was in place so that it would permit consideration of longer term borrowing in particular circumstances and where it's in the interest of the authority and have the flexibility to do so in relating to the prudent UNK of its affairs chairman
i think all those who the statement i don't propose to go through it in detail
i think i could probably stop there
thank you
papers headed erm treasury management but essentially it's about
taking out loans and borrowing and i don't think that this county council ought to be defensive in the slightest about having a tool such as borrowing available to us in terms of financial management
i think i want to start by reminding everybody that borrowing to finance capital spending is the norm for almost all local authorities in this country
i want then to go on to say that if we take a view about fairness and i think that that's an important word that we certainly from our side want to use regularly and practice
if we take a view about fairness then the funding of capital schemes is UNK if the charge and the cost of the those schemes is spread over the life of the asset
because then all the people that use that asset not just now but in the future co make a contribution towards its purchase
in other words that we're spreading out the costs and the charges amongst the people that actually use the services the road the school the particular asset that we erm would be funding
i think it's also easy to argue that if you take money out of government allocation for service delivery greater than the amount that is necessary then actually the people that are getting in the sense of capital schemes the losers are the people that lose out on front line direct services
to give you an example in nineteen ninety three ninety four the capital financing standard spending assessment allocation for lincolnshire was twenty three point seven million
we spent twenty nine point one million which was in excess of five point four million
that five point four million could have been spent on front line social services for example
so in a sense what we're doing by funding and delivering a very high capital programme out of revenue rather than borrowing is we're UNK from our ability to deliver important services
i think it's also reasonable to point out that at the moment the county council does enter into finance lease arrangements to meet the business needs of for example UNK and computer services
it's been accepted that these are credit arrangements under the local government planning and land act so therefore it is not unreasonable to argue that borrowing will not represent a new departure for the county council in terms of being able to control capital spending
we can also recognise as we did at an on an earlier paper that it is national government policy and increasingly so to encourage the development of capital schemes borrowing we noted that in relation to transport and the availability of s c a's i think it's also right to say that the government does set down the level of borrowing which can be entered into in any one year that is the credit approvals are controlled by the government and they do make them available to the county council and to district councils so in a sense the government is both saying that we expect borrowing to be a feature of a budget and also that we want to control and restrict the amount of money that can be borrowed through the amount of credit approvals
final reason is that fo for borrowing is that we could take a view that borrowing in a particular year has to take account of the of the valuable circumstances at that particular time
we could note and i think that it's right and prudent to do so that the current levels of interest rates are at their lowest historically for some twenty years
they may even go lower but there's certainly the clear indications from the city that and from informed sources that interests rates are likely to rise towards the end of this year
if that's the case then we could argue an and will do that now is a good time to borrow on a fixed term basis over a long period
i think to sum up i would be wanting to say that this county council takes a view that it is about the provision of services
important services have to be
given priority
when you realise that we have had one of the most difficult spending erm decisions taken by
national government then the time has got to come at so some stage as to whether you defend a principle of lincolnshire being a de a longer term debt free authority or whether you look around the county and say important services must be protected
we take a view that this is both so sound financial management and delivery quality services to the people of lincolnshire
we think they deserve and want no less
councillor
thank you
well it's erm fairly local incident that this paper has been er borne er to give the er permission for borrowing when the labour liberal er controlling group find themselves in this embarrassing position er of having to find an extra eleven million pounds to maintain their services
they've got themselves into this mess in just nine months
now let me cut through all that science that er councillor UNK has tried to make this issue
erm budgeting whether it's a five
er five hundred million budget or your own household budget er in basic terms is fairly simple
and anyone who has controlled a household budget will well understand that in the present sort of climate that is the real world outside this county council
you have to cut you cloth according to the means
and when wages and inflation are running at less than two per cent you don't go out and increase your spending by four or five per cent
and you certainly don't go out and then start economics of the mad house
what do you do
what do the balance very shortly
erm when i think of you and i do when we're confronted with the challenges in our household budgets
you use your access cards
we look at things that we would like to do and set our priorities
UNK we have to delay some decisions we put off other decisions we look at other alternatives that is the way that you UNK manage budgets
you do not go out and borrow
this county council under this administration are facing identifying simple economic rules of UNK
they operate outside
someone else can pick up the bill
the bottom line is that if you are having to use council enforcement to UNK interest you cannot spend the same council tax UNK in providing services
the customer is the people of lincolnshire that we represent they are going to lose out by this sort of policy and we oppose the principle of borrowing for these sort of reasons
are part of it
thank you chairman i firstly i'm UNK to mr harrison here for a new phrase into the english language as we're being recorded this morning
he used the word shift the incidence of cash flow
in other words that's covers a multitude of sins but basically it means borrowing
and borrowing means pay later
i'm dead against this er on principle i think it's cutting the first sod of the hole that you're preparing to dig yourselves
secondly erm i am UNK to councillor UNK for not being UNK about this
he's saying quite specifically what his political objective is and that is that they can spend more revenue on their political priorities that they choose to spend it on and it is a way of transferring capital monies into revenue and it's as simple as that
and i object to it
yes
er can i ask for a point of clarification
in the past er authorities with er a debt of being limited with the use of their capital receipts
we are we are debt free we've been debt for a long time
and i'm against the er policy of borrowing
i think it's UNK debt
erm i agree with my colleagues for what's been said so i won't say any more about that but it is the point that what happens to the capital receipts in the future
the position with the county council is that while has no long term debt it has never satisfied the tests of central government for the capital control regime
which they class as a debt free authority
that requires two conditions one that you have no long term debt and that under the capital control regime which exists on the legislation you have what is termed a nil or negative credit ceiling
whilst we satisfied one of those conditions the authorities never satisfied both
the fact that one has as a as a council credit approvals it does allow you to set them against capital receipts in further financing new capital works to the extent that you don't use them for other purposes
the government are actually UNK as to whether you borrow and consume your capita er your credit approvals or whether you consume your credit approvals by applying them to capital receipts which will be used to buy further capital assets
because in their terms the object of the control regime is to force down UNK levels of UNK and there are mechanisms wi within which it works which do that
but the county council still has some longer term debt not external but internally that is being paid now and not over time and so the position actually will not change so long as the council continues to have more credit approval than it requires to use the new borrowing
can i can i just come back
on that
wh what level are capital approvals
what are they running at erm you know
in the last year
over the last year something over seventeen million in the forthcoming year there will be a review for about i think from memory of ar of around about fourteen million
i think that's supplementary
including the supplementary credit approvals they're just short of seventeen million
it's about thirteen point four million basic credit approvals and about three point three million supplementary credit approvals
so it's sixteen point seven million in total
councillor
yes thank you
i hold
port erm borrowing and i think some tory members are being UNK to say the least on this issue
it's councillor box said the mess that you are in
this is a direct result of the tory government cutting our late support grant
it's not a mess that we're in it's your tory government are doing this
if you're saying you're not supporting borrowing it's i think you've got a duty to say what services you're going to cut
if you cannot just go along and say no we're not borrowing and live within your budget as you are saying
we're talking about essential services
in education for example we have a rising pupil numbers
we have more children needing

are you UNK councillor
thank you lord mayor
ok
twenty seven please
my lord mayor
steady
this is a subject which affects many people in this city and is another characteristic act by a tory government that acts in a UNK way
on the second of july of this year the home secretary made a statement to parliament on the subject of asylum
by coincidence this had been followed by an UNK campaign in the UNK press UNK up fears about asylum UNK
hear
now this isn't about asylum UNK because on the back of that on the back of that statement without warning the home secretary announced proposals to change the publicly funded arrangements for advice and representation in asylum and immigration cases
in short to remove the entitlement for legal aid for this entire area of work
now as a council and as a group i believe that we should oppose the removal of the green form scheme
this provided initial low cost independent legal advice
the removal of this will mean that thousands of residents will be unable to obtain the legal assistance in matters like arranging family visits or to look into their own circumstances
there is in this city a pool of expertise that is built on local provision provided by local people solicitors law centre and others
it provides a choice of effective and independent advice locally
now why is this happening
well on the face of it we have an UNK with cutting legal aid
the british legal system is already in a bit of a sorry state but this is only part of the story because we are faced with a UNK government bureaucracy that has often been shown by the higher courts to be acting in an illegal and unfair manner
so the government therefore seeks to use its powers to stop people gaining access to the law and getting advice from local sources
in its place they have a very good organisation called the united kingdom immigration advice service and i will quote a fax i have received from them
u k i a s was not consulted about this proposal beforehand and have so far not received any details about it
they are a one hundred percent home office funded organisation
they have not right to take and fund matters to the higher courts to review the decisions of the government the executive in other words and they themselves have no idea how they're meant to fulfil this role that the government sees them as having
this is basically a UNK leaf
we need a comprehensive and effective system of access to advice for this in legal aid
mister obviously when he didn't consult the u k i a s UNK the UNK which UNK most of his behaviour
we're actually talking here about family unit and human rights
we're actually re t talking about reducing the access to justice because if w if these proposals go through your access to justice will depend on the size of your wallet and it is actually a restriction on liberty
people must be able to get the representation they trust and not that prescribed by the government whose in administration you may eventually end up challenging
this proposal sets a dangerous anti democratic precedent
now if we take a look at council this authority that we all know and love so UNK
we rightly have to live in an environment of audits commissions UNK and legal review in the course of our conduct
right
that's quite right and proper and all of us would support that
now just imagine the UNK if council had the power to close down every organisation stop funding every organisation that UNK it and reviewed its actions
because that is exactly what the government is seeking to do with this legal aid proposal
it's transferring a limited provision of legal aid into a grant to an UNK to an organisation which it controls and funds which is not allowed to do the work that is currently done under the legal aid scheme
it is the characteristic of the kind of governments that have just been turned over beyond the line in europe
so what i'm hoping that this council will do is send a message up to white hall that this is an abuse of executive power to UNK the challenges of t to the authority
it's UNK
if extended this means that talk of a citizens charter is utter nonsense
what kind of citizens charter is introduced on the back of denying you the right to even challenge the people who are providing the services or could restrict the right of your family to be together or the right for you to travel to the country where you've been living
it UNK the much UNK and now UNK british system of justice
how can you defend a system of justice that prevents you getting anywhere near it unless you have a large wallet
so on this side we actually believe in positive rights
no talk of the UNK of erm the citizens charter that gets UNK down one day and becomes something else the other day and you might get a free train ticket out of it some time
we're not about UNK access to justice with a cynical UNK of restrictions cut and UNK cynical regard for the rights of people who're often in a vulnerable position
in opposing this motion the amend that you're about to hear about is actually supporting restrictions on justice
this council has now committed itself to a equality of opportunity and social justice
it is only natural that when we get back to power this cynical measure from the lord chancellor will be abolished
i look forward to that day
councillor
my lord mayor i must confess to being quite surprised by the incredible UNK and complete lack of understanding that's obviously UNK on the benches opposite with most of the items we've dealt with today
i suggest that in future councillors and concentrate on UNK their brains before they start putting pen to paper
hear
and coming up with a UNK like this that UNK as a motion to the council
the next time they feel it necessary to UNK off in such an ill informed ill advised and half UNK manner over the issue of immigration perhaps councillors and should remind themselves that some of the most severe immigration laws were actually introduced by a labour home secretary
where then with their pathetic UNK of UNK or don't you go back as far as er
quite simply what the government intend to achieve through the proposed legislation is the introduction of new measures designed to s to halt the systematic abuse of immigration procedures by people who UNK claim asylum in britain
the effect of these new measures will be to allow a substantial acceleration and UNK which everybody's been calling for of decision making in asylum and immigration cases
the government's aim is to decide all cases within a matter of months so that all those affected do not have to wait an UNK length of time to ascertain their legal status in the u k it's obvious to everyone not too blind to see that such changes are vital to the mounting pressures on the existing system
hear
the number of people seeking asylum in the united kingdom has risen UNK from five thousand a year in UNK to over thirty thousand in UNK
from january to may this year twenty one thousand applications were received
these figures if projected forward indicate fifty thousand applications for asylum could be received during UNK
in may UNK three thousand eight hundred and four new asylum applications were received
the majority of these three thousand one hundred and twenty three were made by applicants already in the u k who presented themselves at united kingdom immigration UNK offices to request asylum
there is clearly UNK evidence to suggest that the great majority as many as seventy five percent of all such cases are not genuine
in only twenty five percent of united kingdom cases do applicants have a well founded fear of UNK
the criteria for seeking UNK status is based on the UNK united nations convention on refugees
UNK applicants wish to remain in the united kingdom for economic reasons and use asylum seeking to UNK normal immigration procedures
this has resulted in an immense backlog
there are currently fifty thousand UNK cases and the backlog is growing at over three thousand cases a month
the average decision time is already over sixteen months and getting worse
action is needed now to both tackle the backlog and UNK more UNK applications coming in
that action has now been proposed by the home secretary
it includes the employing of up to five hundred extra staff to help speed up the initial determination of claims
it also includes plans to withdraw advice and assistance under legal aid green form scheme in asylum and other immigration cases
necessary legal advice and assistance will be available from the united kingdom immigration advisory service whose grant will be substantially increased
controls at entry ports will be UNK to improve identification of applicants who arrive from safe countries
carriers bringing passengers from abroad without valid documentation will be charged at double the current rate
improved document checks abroad and better screening procedures for identifying UNK asylum UNK will be introduced
none of these measures will prevent the entry into the united kingdom of the genuine UNK or asylum UNK
these are the very people who will most benefit from the proposed changes
the genuine people
they are precisely the ones who will gain from the UNK handling of clearly UNK cases
the home secretary has made it absolutely clear that he remains committed to meeting our obligation to genuine refugees
asylum procedures exist to ensure the protection of those genuinely at risk but they are in danger of being undermined by those who see them as an alternative channel for immigration
the many UNK it for the few yet again
lord mayor it is clear that this country cannot sustain the present numbers of applicants seeking asylum
we simply cannot allow immigration control to become optional
nor must we let the institution of asylum be undermined by abuse
thank you lord mayor
lord mayor under standing orders a fifteen b i move the vote now be put
seconded my lord mayor
those in favour
seven
mhm
eh
is there forty seven just walking back
yeah forty eight
against
carried fourteen to thirty two
that's carried forty eight to thirty two
so we move to those in favour of amendment m moved by councillor please show poll tax cos did this at p and r and i will reiterate what the leader said then and i and quite clearly and UNK that the labour party both nationally and locally and this labour group do not UNK a policy of non payment either as a principle or as a UNK
is that clear
have you got that
thank you
now then and i think that it's important well let me let me just deal with the minor diversion that in s those people who choose not to pay that is a personal choice and they will take the consequences of their actions
however what the poll tax has revealed UNK is that there are poverty UNK in this city entirely due to that particular tax and those people who are in financial difficulty we do understand the problem they have and we will continue to help
now the evidence is very clear
i'll produce the evidence for you
that's not a worry
now if you really wanted to help and you were concerned about that
but let me give you two concrete things you could do
number one you could lobby the government to remove the twenty percent
now that would in fact help the poor
it would also ensure that we were much more financially secure
now the control of the audit commission is on record as stating quite clearly that it is not possible to account the equation
it costs us more to collect it than we actually get in
the second thing we need to do is to lobby for the UNK of the UNK of the safety net
the further twenty five pounds that will have to go on the poll tax this year will cost this council eight point one million
now it's UNK for a so called government that's in power with all the financial expertise to talk about getting shut of it and leave it in to cause misery to people
let me turn quickly to the out turn figures that were in p and r the capital programme is already on line although it was UNK
in terms of the revenue output it's a hundred and forty three thousand below the estimates and it was agreed that any variations would be carried over into next year
i accept that as a reasonable thing to do
the latter is a is a direct result of setting a poll tax which was clearly and UNK an under provision to provide decent services in this city
there is one other point i'd just like because yo you've been on about labour controlled councils
there's a very interesting table which is now produced by the d of e not by labour weekly or anybody else which lays out the amounts of money that are set aside in order for the collection
conservative in three times that for which we put on for and let me remind you again that out of that seventeen pounds you put eleven on not us you put it on
you put eleven pounds that's the addition of we accepted that and we
no problem i stand i stand as i did before and i accept that that's extra
as regards to the non payment we are fifty four pounds goes on in forty three pounds goes on in thirty seven pounds goes on in and all of them greater than that which we have put on simply in order to recollect the poll tax
so let the tories talk about a UNK tax
they've no idea
now what else did i want
ah yes i've said that
that's great
now then
now i wanna just deal finally then
pardon
that's right
in conclusion my lord mayor i think the controlling group seriously has quite UNK demonstrated its ability to manage an economy both effectively and UNK
that's very important
and in spite of the major UNK in education and planned services arrangements no jobs have been lost and they're at it again on this amendment lies absolute lies and you cannot stand you UNK in p and r and you're lying now on a speculative business about people's
we will continue we will continue you've UNK before and you'll lie again and we will continue to consult widely with the electorate and the trade unions on local economy on the local economy that brings in financial matters which affect them
we can live we can live and demonstrate that there is an equation where services quality service area UNK and job protection can be achieved within difficult resources
there's a simple message from today's council if you vote tory you're voting yourself out of work
so i would say to this council when they were in power they set UNK competitive tendering that sent thirteen hundred people down the road
now that is evidence that's the kind of situation you've got while tories are in power
everybody in the council should know that
i move my lord mayor with great pride that this amendment be supported and final and finally we will to the electorate as we did last year and we will win and we'll have more success next year than we had this year
i so move

excuse me can i ask a question
can i assist here the motion that has been UNK and the amendment has been proposed the amendment has been accepted the question now is whether what the motion has been made and uh it is a matter for you to go to your suggested that certain members be allowed to speak at the end of the day it is a matter for you to decide uh control of the who is allowed to speak on that particular motion as amended of course
here
is that a the wish of the committee
thirteen minutes and is it specifically other members
not each just go into the debate don't waste all the time
right ah may i call on the first person to whom this is going to be i believe you speak on the
thank you um it will be quick ah one of the things which caused distress last year was the reduction in the for sixth UNK and i was sorry to see that it wouldn't be restored this time
but the next best thing is for more money towards fourteen to nineteen education so that's very welcome at least and was widely supported in the various versions we saw this morning my concern is with the way in which this money is to got from the centre to the school and i'd like to speak very strongly in favour of what if i got what you're is education so that we aim to assist schools to build on their own interests and not have it UNK out by some central authority which is and which a UNK of this is an area of great relevance to schools
okay ron there are thanks for coming over for a start there are you've got all the er the brochure and the er obviously the application form
the first time i've had a chance to have a look through this so could i erm
yes by all
ask you to while i read this the six companies where we market our brochures or product
okay
are represented there
er for your background there's a there's obviously a ha an obvious group but er those are the six companies
if i can just er read through this
that company we bought erm in june last year so it's er a fairly UNK launch for us but they're
i've an idea myself for the golf er
mhm
and that was erm supplying them with a complete mar tee marker board with a plan of the hole and an advert on that particular hole
oh you oh you mean up on the board or
on the board
yes okay
advertise sell that hole and er just basically supply the tee UNK free of charge
yes all the er UNK on our my own my own course are er sponsored by local businesses
well that's what i was going to personally
that's individual eighteen holes mind you know
yeah
what i was going to do was erm just get a good quality joiner have he gives me a price for doing that and then i basically sell the advertising
okay
yeah that he we've just completed up here and one or two others er so we're getting some big boys in now
but you've not you've not done that particular idea UNK
no we've we're we are er UNK printers that's where our background is
that's where we've been for the last twenty years so erm this company er that was already doing it and we bought it into the er into the fold
okay
er can i just pick up on one or two points er ron
erm at present you are employed by and you you've got own you've got a company car
have you got your own car
er no but that's no problem to buy a car
well if you think it's no problem fine
so rather than have er two cars plus a company car i just sold my car
well i understand that i mean a lot of people do that
erm however erm a company er a car is needed to do this job so i home in on that
er when we have erm when you come down for you know if we decide that this is for you er when you come down for a training course they expect to see a car
you know in other words
will help me driving
in other words erm they won't allocate an assignment unless you have er have a car
it's as simple as that cos we could send you off to st andrews or something like that to er to well i'm just i'm UNK in on the erm on the golf on the basis that i you you're er you're representative for a company that does is involved with golf equipment
yep
erm sports or just golf industry
mhm
oh i've seen there in fact my wife's got a set of UNK so
has she
is that the
yes
yeah
erm you've been with them since august
er what why are you er
well quite simply er my reason is that erm i'll read the letter to you that i dictated to the sales manager a week ago
right
it says to mr sales and marketing direct
dear graham further to our recent conversation by telephone i now wish to put on paper my complaints regarding you and the company
you employed me in august nineteen ninety three at to join sports u k on their behalf
your offer of employment was accepted on the terms of the contract agreed that if my figures UNK would reach your targets i could earn twenty five thousand per annum minimum
the salary would base as my basic salary plus commission plus bonuses on a monthly basis and most importantly the promise that because the basic wage was so low the lowest in the golf industry by your own words er that there was to be a rise of approximately four thousand in january nineteen ninety four
which you repeated many times to the sales reps and that you also would be have er would get us new cars
the cars were honoured as agreed
i also took on the position UNK of the bad reputation in scotland of sports to the trade regarding hotel sales of your equipment but was promised that this practice would be cut out
it never did and you continued to supply a person who to this date continues to do these hotel sales
i have also complained to you continually about the loss of orders i have taken from my customers UNK back orders which get lost on the computer or they are not delivered due to the lack of stock
the customer gives up after a few months waiting
in the past few months the complaints from my area from my customers that they are UNK with the service they have received from sports
er at least thirty percent of my business erm have either stopped their accounts or reached the limit of their patience
with regards to my salary increase of january ninety four recently you have now stated my increase with be take place in april ninety four
another promise broken
even though i have reached my monthly target i still receive no bonuses but you tell me i am on target for the large bonus in april
er and i have put in brackets what a month this could be
i have also found that rep the reps are all on different basic wages
when challenged about this you replied yes but you have the least experience in the golf industry
and i have replied er who in the past six months has reached their targets percentage targets above mine in the last six months
yeah okay
i think i've got your drift
basically what i'm doing is
can i can i just go back hotel sales is that where they supply er
they are they er are doing a practice which is the only golf company in industry who are supplying a friend of a friend who is going round scotland doing hotel sales cheap
oh yeah all right
there are so many clubs they should
i think i think i've been to one or two in york
well they're selling them cheaper than i can supply my customers
are your customers mainly
pro professionals
on clubs or
yes
and shops golf shops
yes
so basically they've broken their contract with me and he's not even responded to that letter
so
but his response is likely to be well part company is that it
i anticipating that is what response will be because i have er basically called him and er
okay
if that's his case then i'll take him for breach of contract
okay
on the basis of that you're actively looking around
yes
okay
now my colleague john spoke with you and he outlined as much as he possibly can on the on the space on the telephone
erm and his interests in you was UNK
first of all he heard the voice was okay
yes
because he would have told you i hope that er we sell advertising space into well you've seen some samples over there
er i'm going to step sorry before i go into a bit more detail in your c on your er application form three things will be decided here today ron and that's first of all whether you and i think that er is a UNK a launch pad for you to earn erm er some good money
yes
and er i'm sure john will have told you how good the money can be if we
we didn't get to depth and
all right
i we're only talking ever UNK and on target earnings
we don't promise or guarantee anything
what we do say is that we will give you an opportunity erm er if you like a platform for er for earning good money
yes
and er it is all down to the UNK er an individual puts into it
the only reason er top earners are top earners in our company is they don't sit back and take one deal a day
that's right
they feel comfortable
er if there if there's a part there i've dis i think i've answered that question in er personal at the end
over here
yep
erm i think just i've answered that just probably the way you put it
yep
i er in fact you've wrapped it up in one sentence
that's the only way that any i believe anybody even when they're on a salary
because salary company car UNK and all that is only commission in another form and they can take it away and not give it to you just the same as any other company
erm well okay so we'll decide today er you and me whether we feel 's the right er space for you to be
erm and you realize of course that it's self employed commission only hence the need for the car
er secondly if we get a if we if we get round that er corner then the other two are fairly easily UNK and that is er where you and i also think erm your UNK and your even your desire to be environmentally that's the environment you work in erm most er suitable
there are six companies there er five of which erm i can recruit for
i'm in the UNK position of not just saying that one person comes in here for one job
yes
erm i have four or five people i can take on for any one of those companies so nobody's in competition with
yes
each other today
and secondly erm because we're rather keen for people to er carry on the momentum we actually say to you when can you start and if it's next week wonderful
if it's the week after fine
the further out of course it's a bit a bit messy
and so we are we look for that sort of commitment before people leave er the room today
and i would tell you ninety nine percent of the time we get it and you know we s we s we do agree a date
er that depends entirely on which company you go in because erm er some of the courses start at different er times
if we've agreed all those three things er we also erm er recognize the need to erm advise people or guide people on how UNK sold
i see from your application form that you've sold space er for three or four years which
well i have been er involved in various projects
erm i had a company called and advertising erm where i went along to a company and would UNK promotion for them
was that your own company
yes
yes
and i would build a package to suit their company
er if it was a double glazing company or a kitchen company i would UNK a promotion
er there's one thing i was involved which er unfortunately turned out er was quite national it was a promotion
what the disastrous one
yes
er well the one i got involved with er was the free flights to er europe
all right
which was very successful and er i was one of the UNK of that promotion
er but
so everybody else can blame you for this
well not really
the pen to paper i put the con er the package basically together with another two or three people
aha
and erm it was then up to decide what company was going to handle the promotion
er their mistake was that they chose a company which was down market and basically didn't go into er depth of that company
well that was their fault
the concept of the promotion was absolutely brilliant and it could be handled from europe
mm
erm and it was so successful that they asked us again to do one from the united states
right
which we says no because it couldn't be possibly done
we believed
UNK we thought that the should may be too high
what are you saying that you were the UNK the company who were originally asked to do the
my company was involved with er the people who put the promotion together
right
and er quite simply that if they'd left it alone on a european side because obviously you can get flight from london gatwick for approximately forty nine pounds
yeah right
and we UNK that the redemption would be no more than twenty percent which was pretty high for a promotion
right
erm as long as long as the customer went through the channels and the procedures there'd no more than twenty percent
so much so that we took out insurance er if it went over twenty percent we were covered
but then what happened it was so successful for and i think got so greedy on it they decided to go an american
mm
er promotion
but there were two separate companies who set up the both UNK
so as you know the american one collapsed and of course were thirty million pounds
yeah and there are some people are still fighting to get their er flights right
yes
now aren't they
and i erm i had various er UNK
i had er put a promotion together with a few travel agents in scotland where i gave out holiday spending money
it was quite simply we were taking the business away from the high street erm glossy type travel agents and giving it to the back street travel agents
and as long as he was prepared to give the spending money UNK in the form of a voucher er we were taking away the market share away from etcetera of this world
right
and that worked very successfully
okay this is all part of the promotion and advertising
yes
time
yes
okay
because the rest of your er your application form i mean er gives us a span of er twelve thirteen years in sales
particularly in direct sales
UNK is that UNK
yes
cleaners
yes
cleaning machine was an american machine
right yes i think i've heard of them
yes
erm very successful priced basically out of the price the market eventually
erm they're still in the market today but er you're talking about
are we talking UNK type things or
no
you're talking about a home care system
that is a UNK cleaner that's one of the functions it does
yeah
but it done approximately thirty odd UNK different
oh well UNK carpets okay and i suppose er UNK of furniture and things
i had the sales force who called in and done a demonstration in a person's home
all right
so i had to take it from the UNK side to get the appointment to get in the door to do a demonstration and then to do the after sales
right okay
erm
you cut your teeth there didn't you
i erm i was
if not before
i was a european top salesman with er that company and then moved on as a franchise
right
you seem to erm er you UNK into erm after into electrical appliances again
er yes because obviously i was in that type of field
er i was in the market and we came out with a machine that produced UNK from top tap worker
that's still going isn't it
yes
and you just poured the water in top press a button and you get UNK and they have now produced i believe er it was network marketing and i wasn't involved i didn't want involved in network marketing and it now produces gin and tonic UNK
well it's been on er consumer selling
yes
very good product
excellent product but er the f the network marketing is not my side and you could not direct selling
all right
it's all done okay
you had to bring someone into the business and they brought someone into the business and that was their form of selling
well that's big business nowadays
yes
in fact in the state i think twenty percent of er all products are sold through network marketing now
that's right
in fact the institute of directors of which i'm a member er said er that network UNK a thing of the future
yes definitely
i mean it started
yeah if you're if you're happy to get into that
can cost you some money but it's er it's prefer it's preferable to er UNK selling which of course is UNK now
the reason i went to erm sports
mhm
erm which quite simply i had some money of my own and i wasn't that hungry er to jump in to any job at all
so i wanted to get into something i enjoyed doing
and i'm a very keen UNK and i had built up a reputation erm by playing in open tour open UNK and meeting professionals and
UNK
so i had a lot of contacts and i enjoyed it
erm but it unfortunately things have not worked out with er this particular company
well no it doesn't sound by that er letter you wrote
i think you f you felt
i have done my job
my targets er have been broken every month
i had a hundred and twenty seven percent er sorry twenty seven percent above target er for the quarter and most of my other com my sales reps er the other sales reps in the business didn't even reach a hundred percent
well how do you feel i mean a lot of a lot if not all of your work here has been done face to face
now
yes
john will have told you the way we operate er we er we
telephone
only sell on the telephone
that's what people
well erm you know we've had a lot of people come to us and say we've qualified sales by telephone i don't present that a problem with that but we have discovered people have not listened to what we've been saying even on the training course when they go out there to sell the space they keep making appointments to go and see people to talk about advertising
that is not the game
and as long as somebody realizes that that's our top people erm do that
they don't make appointments to go and see people
what i mean where do you see yourself fitting into that after
if i if it was sat trying to make an appointment with you for example er and i don't know too much about the product we're just getting
no fine
well there i mean there's the product there's
well give me i'll give you an example
if i was phoning you from publishing and i phoned up g a
aha
and i says good afternoon could i speak to the person that does advertising etcetera and i get through to that particular person and i said how would you like to save money by us printing all your UNK free of charge high quality er UNK it wouldn't cost you a penny
right let me stop you there because i think you've got maybe the wrong end of the stick
all right
we don't sell that product to anybody
no you give that product away free
okay but we don't your the responsibility of the sales consultant here is not to approach the estate agent or the golf to sell that somebody else does that
oh i thought i had to get the estate agent first and then get the space
no we the assignments that are that's why i stopped you there
oh i see
just in case there's any confusion
right okay
that product there already either exists or we're going to do it for the first time for an estate agent
right okay
and that has been done by a marketing exec who goes round the country contracting with those clients
oh right
this is our client
so that's the job there
that's the job for our consultant
so okay
now let's say mr UNK
so you're talking to mr UNK and you don't even mention our company name
okay
you are representing g a
g a
at that er so and so
okay
er good afternoon mr smith i'm phoning er from g a general property services in such and such
okay
now you live in the catchment area of that particular company how would you like to er how would you like to participating in that particular company's brochure which is handed out to all the people in your catchment area
whereas if a house is being sold your name is going to be seen on that particular product
all right
now i'll stop you there ron because you've got the you've got the drift of it because when we get down to deciding people come on a course then they have
training
we speak for two days at least in UNK a script
and that script has been built up over twenty years experience
but you've certainly the idea of what it is
UNK er telephone erm i have sold products obviously without the customer even seeing me i've sold them over the phone
i am confident on the phone
mhm
and
i don't think you'd have any problem doing this job i'll be quite frank with you
er i
not with this background here
i mean it's such a variety and it's involved both face to face and direct sales that er i know i stopped you right in the middle of your UNK there
now what you would say to mr UNK this is this is the whole deal this is what it would cost you
you see in traditional sales we don't tell people the price until the last minute
at that particular time i wouldn't tell them anything all my all at that particular time is waiting for an appointment to see them
now that's what we don't do ron
oh you don't go out and see them
absolutely that's what exactly i'm asking you to listen about
the reason i'm asking you about that is erm i had er i had when i had my own business i was approached and we've got an estate agent in the UNK called
oh yes big one
and i had a phone call
big one in UNK here too
i had a phone call from somebody who was obviously be doing exactly the same thing and he actually just was booking an appointment to come in and see me
yeah
well in fact it i would be very surprised a if he was one of ours and b if he was successful
because quite honestly we tell them absolutely everything on the phone before we go
we don't make appointments and chase our tail
mhm
and i'll tell you from experience
my first week our there i did that and i didn't earn anything
right
i got to the appoint yes come round rod i'd like to talk to about it have a cup of coffee
and i just spent three quarters of an hour to an hour with him and he said well i've had a look at this erm no thanks not for me
mm
i had wasted
so you phoned
my journey there
oh yes all of those people would have committed on the phone to taking that advertising space
okay
see why i want i wanted to be
yes
absolutely certain
because that's exactly what traditional sales people would do including
yes
this boy who'd been doing it a few years
okay
so and they will te they will tell you that
now that's what the company UNK
there are going to be one or two occasions of course when it is likely
come round i want to i'll i want to see the product
in the main we tell them exactly
okay
what what's going on
but you you've got the drift and as long as i persuade people to listen to the people who've been doing it for so long
obviously
they know it's successful
they know that you don't make appointments and chase your tail
because one of the commitments i hope john er may have told you on the phone one of the parts of the contract we have with g a is that they provide a list of businesses
yes
that's obviously that's i would
yeah now that i'll come on to that in a minute
but er that is half the battle
okay
on the basis that i don't think you've got any problem doing this and nor do you you're confident enough to do this job especially with your background
erm if i was to give you an option a choice of which market area you think you would be most happy with where do you think
where is the market areas what is the choices
well the choices are estate agents and there are two companies there that's one you're holding there and then the folders at the top
there's medical practice areas that's working in medical centres and surgeries
er schools universities and colleges
area health authorities up here which we're not looking for at the moment and er because the government is UNK them around and we're a bit uncertain in that area
and of course golf clubs
well golf clubs erm i mean it's a bit limited advertising in a in a market er on this particular thing to look at
you've got five you've got probably somewhere in the region of four thousand pounds worth of advertising there
what in this
mhm
okay so they're paying approximately what
nine hundred pound for a nine hundred pound for a full page
per annum
per annum for two years
okay
er and you're only needing approximately two or three you only need two or three
well the fact that we've got three there that's how many we got on that card and we were quite happy about that
but the card and the UNK sold together
right can i ask you then
so you're s you're saying the plan of the course er when
we call it planners that the UNK chart in fact
there's also another thing that a golf course has is a where you want a distance marker
if you go along to a good quality golf course they have the score card a planner but they also have a little script that tells you about the hole
well no we don't go into that
that's fi quite expensive to produce
right okay so
that's a UNK that would be what you would call a stroke UNK
we would call that there's that and the ca and the score card
so if i had if i had one course to go along and find approximately how many adverts for it
well we're talking about ten
ten adverts
that's five on each
er and of course nine hundred pounds to advertise
well that's if they UNK if they all took full pages
because there're there are facilities to split the pages and there are small strips
if you where your hand is now if you look down the bottom no on the on the other side there are two strips
okay
two hundred and fifty pound each those are
now the question is how much can i earn for doing that
right well i will go into that if that
if i were to make my decision obviously
no
because
well the same earning ability is across all those products
the same earning
doesn't matter which company you go into you have the same er percentage you have the same thirty percent or thirty five percent depending on how far away it is and you have the same bonus structures
they all come into being at the same time
so whichever company or environment we agree is suitable for you
well i mean
the natural place would be of course golf clubs
but you said you were a keen UNK
where do you think i see the dangers in that
i'm captain of my club this year right
i wouldn't trust me on the golf club scene
you wouldn't trust yourself
why
i could kill the advertising simple
probably because you would want to go and play
aha
erm
so i'll tell you what if we put a keen UNK out and we have we've put one or two UNK
if i
if we put a keen UNK on that it's even bigger er position of trust
well can i say something to you in that case then
yes sure
i visit approximately about thirty golf clubs on a weekly basis
yeah
i have never played golf time
you haven't got time have you
you haven't got time
here we're talking about UNK yourself for three weeks on that same golf course
aha
doing erm two or three dozen phone calls
yes
and getting nowhere and you're saying i think i'm UNK thoroughly annoyed about all this
and i'm going to get nowhere if i get on the golf course
yeah that's right
no i don't think that worry would be there
i have to say that we i we just we just see that we point out to people it's an even bigger po position of trust
but it would be natural for me to put you in the golf club area
er well i don't think i'd be i don't think i'd be going out to play golf if i hadn't earned any money
that's right
er
well
i'd go UNK
so are we are we talking er do you see this as a as a as a launch pad
how well have you done on the golf courses
well the one those since june we're doing quite well
mhm
we did we've just completed we've done three or four others
but i don't i have to keep in touch of course with all companies how we're doing
so i don't go specifically into that
yeah
next question is
aha
the golf course is no problem because you're getting it done free of charge
that that's easy for you to get a golf course
yeah we have no problem with that
is that an up market golf or is it just
no
any type of golf course
any golf course that wants those providing they can tell us that there's erm there's going to be a useful amount of sponsorship you know er advertising available for us to approach
mhm
but it would be no good to them and say well you know right in the middle of nowhere cow er sheep or cow country there are a number of courses we wouldn't touch because we wouldn't be able to get enough UNK er you know even with five erm major businesses
there i have to say there'd be very few
right
can i approach my own golf clubs or is that going to be done through you
no you must not do that yourself
it's got to be done by you
yeah if you know of one because we have UNK you know we have circulated and we have a sales exec that goes out
yes
to the courses
erm that doesn't mean to say that you can't mention it
mhm
but you see you will be so busy
just i know the UNK probably better than erm
oh sure
the person that's doing it just er no UNK but he's probably coming from over the border
no they're all scots people up here
ah right
okay
we're only having two or three up here anyway for the for the
and you're saying that one golf course i could be there for two or three weeks
two to three weeks
we have to get off after three weeks
what is my earning potential in that golf course for that two or three weeks
right well i'll go through that in detail so we're talking about that
okay i'll show you the details
well looking at that i wouldn't i'd like to leave it a wee while my options open because in the in the
sorry how d'ya how d'ya mean
because i feel there's also a possibility that in erm private er homes etcetera there's a big market erm for producing your private
and in scotland just now there's an awful lot of erm private homes open now
private residential you mean nursing
yes
well that comes under the medical side
yes well that again is a
but you cannot do one you only do one you can't do both
right okay
erm so i think i would be between the golf and erm the medical side
right the medical side erm we are producing medical practice booklets all right
the only the only approach to residential homes and nursing homes is as advertisers in those medical books
mhm
what do you think in your opinion or in your experience would the best avenue be for me to follow
i think you have an option in both
i mean the UNK more expensive in that but er erm it depends on how good you think you are
well it's
you know the golf
nine hundred pounds to me erm if it's an up market company anyway erm nine hundred pounds for a year's advertising isn't that expensive
well it's not really
not when you compare it with what they might advertise in golf monthly or something like that where
that's right
where they will be seen once and it's dumped
that's right i mean this card is carried with them and looked at all every basically everybody will look at that erm because the good quality
if i was to tell you that given a perfect world that has the highest earning potential of all our companies
well let's decide and look at that then
yeah
because er there are two there are two products
yes
and remember we UNK every two years
okay
and i take it erm the commission structure is just the same if i am continuing a contract on for the following year
let me let me just let me get this pack out for you to take away
is this is this an area where you think you might earn some money
yes
all right we can give you the we can give you the platform
yes
what we have to decide here is that you think is a is a
i think is a very blue chip company
i've look at er your own presentations
it's a blue chip brochure that
and it's a blue chip brochure and i think obviously what i needing now after by the experience i've had with is to get behind a company who will give me the backing
right
well there's er one thing i can tell you right now that i would not personally be involved with a company that did not have erm a backing
there are
all right
plenty of companies that er this these er these can be printed by most printing companies what they don't have is the infrastructure and the backup er
yes
back in head office to do that with
yes
and when we when we ask people to go out we it is er a total trust self employed but they are quote employed unquote
because one things we one thing we don't have is people running other businesses alongside what we give them
so in other words if you're there for two to three weeks you're UNK for
there isn't er there is no people have gone because they've been doing other things other than er
but it's a full time commitment
as long as the earning UNK there then get a hundred percent
right
and that's all we ask because we'll give it a hundred percent
these are some samples for you to take away okay
but let me show you exactly what we i'll bring in to being the list of businesses which we invite the golf club to forward to us
when the sales er marketing exec goes round to the golf club to sign them up in the contract with the contract we will print one or other or both
the contract will state whether they have both or not
all right
that means that if they only take the score card then you're in there fairly quickly do the advertising sales and come out and on to another site
so you don't expect there to be two to three weeks work there
if you're doing both then of course you're looking to offer the options to er
yeah if you can do it in a week all the better
some advertisers go on both by the way
they want to be on both
rod can i ask you a question
yes sure
how many contracts you're UNK them on two to three weeks
let's say that erm i was these contracts within the first ten days
how many contracts am i going to get in a year
well you work it out
it depends on how much time you want off
no how many contracts can i physically get if i want
you can have as many as you want
the way the company operates is that we will UNK you to a golf course
mhm
we have in our contract that more or less we will get out after three weeks
you know what whatever the situation is we done it by then but er we do they are UNK to supply us with an office and telephone facility for up to three weeks
okay maximum
maximum
right
erm or fifteen working days
i mean if there are two or three days off during that or one day off you take for instance as long as it's fifteen working days
erm and that is to do er one or the other or both
they might extend it if we have to do both
so will you will you
so you can if you took if you took one week off every three assignments
aha
all right
you can work out that over a period of time you would have somewhere in the region of fifteen assignments during the year guaranteed
we guarantee continuity of assignment
how many erm are already signed up at this present day for someone to follow on to now
i suppose i could only use the word tons
tons of them right
so there are basically a waiting list
oh yes
okay
on all of our products
we have six hundred assignments alone on the medical side
because we're UNK
we haven't got to the UNK stage with these yet because we've been going about six months so the first UNK is eighteen months away
okay
but we've got so many new courses so worry about that er that doesn't present a problem
erm the timing for golf courses
obviously these cards
mhm
have got to be ready for the season starting
not always
er we go in and sell the advertising if they er we'll take over as soon as the current supply runs out we we'll start offering er and supply it for them
that doesn't present a problem to us
okay
more so on schools because they're closed for
yeah that's right
the summer holidays sometimes
but even that we're we have special arrangements for
we don't worry about the seasonal er aspects
okay
they ju er you know people hear er the sales consultants doing courses right now erm you know find that we'll print them and we'll probably print them in by may although they'll have needed some cards
so that
do you give the customer UNK supplies of these
er it's agreed by the er
executive that's doing it
by the by the er s the sa sales the marketing executive and the golf club agreed a number
okay
all right
we will know somewhere how much we need definitely
to print
to make sure of the print
okay
because the second year where no costs come out of the second year's er payment that's our that's where we make our money
yes
the first year we
because the plates have already been set up etcetera
absolutely yes
all the costs your commissions marketing UNK commission right
now we ask er the club to supply er in between us signing them up for to do the cards to them to the consultant erm er getting there getting there to do the assignment could be five or six months
we don't you know we've got clubs still waiting that we signed up last year
mhm
er we make that quite plain to them all right that there might be a delay
okay
all right until their number comes up as it were
er in the meantime we leave them erm er a list or a sheet like or something similar to this i haven't got one for at the moment erm asking them to list out all those business with which they have some er may be some link up
you just have to look round a lot of UNK cabinets and you can see a lot of locally sponsored cups and UNK in there
plus a lot a members have their own business
plus yes and especially if i went we went to and i think it was er from the membership
yes
i would imagine a lot of it could be
and these are very typical er advertisers and erm whether you agree with it or not these are
whoever supplies the bar
mhm
it may be this any of the suppliers
so there's a lot of scope a lot more scope on these to be more direct because they're quality ads and they're quality product
my particular er my particular club has about approximately thirty businessmen in various varying from double glazing kitchens
yes
what a what prestige
who would love to be involved in their own club
absolutely yes
absolutely
so we've you know that's why i believe that this is this is gonna be our real launch pad for the future
this will be easy for me
aha
put that in quotes will you
i mean
i well if you've got that confidence fine
and when that when the when the assignment comes up when ron is assigned to x club wherever that is erm that will be the sheet the sheet will be provided
for me
for you to work on
now one of the most important things that we've established erm is that er you need to sit down still with the secretary of the club and say right now you've got this list of businesses tell me more about them
yes
it's not simple
you should not just say oh there's good i'll phone him now because you need some valuable information
so we make but all that is UNK is
yes
directed on the course
so that's going to be very useful and you will get information about all these firms it could be that member has already been advised and he's willing
could be little notes here already notified us that he's happy to go on
he wants to go ahead with it
he wants to go ahead
wonderful
that's how quickly you can you can speed up the operation
erm now to give you and there would be other details by the way er other er information concerning that assignment like how many cards we're printing like what the target is
the average target across all of our products is somewhere in the region of six thousand
but i'm going to show you a bit more detail for
first of all let's give you an idea of what the prices are we've talked about prices
now we talk full pages most of the time
if we can get full pages fine but sometimes it's better for us to get these
it could be that there's more money UNK
yes
okay
you can you can work that out for yourself
but erm a full cover is nine hundred pounds full front cover
now what happens there some particularly motor companies will ask permission if they can put some cars in front of the club house if there's a photograph of the UNK and have them photographed
mhm
that's considered to be a full page
mhm
full front cover
now some clubs are quite happy for an ad to be there and for the golf club name to be there
it
yes
really depends on the choice of
yes
the individual
that and then front cover strip down the bottom here that one there is six hundred pounds
so that you can you can see there's a some options here
my mention on the planner that the strips oops those strips all these prices are identified here and when you take this away you can have a look at it
okay
erm and er there you will see how the volume is made up
if you have filled all the spaces available those are the two totals
you're looking for five thousand three hundred and eighty
and four thousand seven hundred and sixty
let's have a look which is more important to you
let's have a look at how your money is made up
okay
score card has always a target of four thousand pound
now that's an internal target for us to work on and for you to have fixed in your mind because everything above four thousand pound you will get forty five percent commission instead of thirty
mhm
yes
and that's made up of thirty percent and tha that's the total revenue you can get on sell all that card and that's the total revenue you can get
thirty percent of that equals that
mhm
the bonuses will be or the bonus will be that and your total on the card therefore is eighteen twenty one
mhm
if you're doing the planner at the same time thirty percent and that's the that's the total amount you can get on a planner but the target there is thirty two hundred
that target is really star is for the bonus purposes
in other words after that we start paying another fifteen percent
what's the percentage for er both doing the score card and the course planner for a cou er a golf course
well you would treat them as a separate entity
you mean in terms of bonus or
no what is the percentage wise of taking both er the golf course when both done
i can't answer that i really don't know
because it's there's if i'm there for three weeks and they only want a score card done then my potential earnings er total earnings are that but i'm there anyway so if i'm getting both of them done then i can earn a lot more money
oh you can earn a lot more money certainly
but you'll if you're only doing the card you'll do that much quicker
yes and then
and then you're straight on to the next job
i'd be out of the door quicker
you'd be out of the door quicker
so it's it is UNK and roundabouts there
yes
if you're doing both then that's your total income and if you did that in three weeks i would think you'd be very happy with that
oh yes
er
that's a thousand pound or plus a week
yep
erm
and i believe that with your background and knowledge then sure that that's achievable
i wouldn't i would like to think i could
because if that if you had if you had a perfect year it is that
mhm
then of course if you want to take time off and things like that
i'm being honest er rod if i can earn myself twenty five thirty thousand i'm not i'm not looking for you know UNK
i'm looking for a decent income with the right company
right well you twenty five thousand a year is about the minimum the company er you wouldn't be doing the job if you were below that
i mean net i mean net
i tax
okay right
in that case you're looking for thirty five thirty six thousand which would be mister average in our company
right okay
i don't want to be mister average so we'll go for the fifty five
we'll go for the fifty five
well if you have that attitude then you'll do it
we'll go for it
all right
okay well that's erm every assignment to you always have and this is being this had been updated we haven't got the new one yet but you will have what we call a blank
and you will go around er using this to show people well i've sold that and that's mister so and so or that's such and such business that's gone so that you can show people that you've actually sold these
in other words that's your work horse
can i can i honestly make a suggestion
i mean there's
well if it's to do with anything you've seen here please make it in the right quarters not at me
no the suggestion is we're in the golf club and we're doing a planner we're not doing a score card
yes
and i know it's not erm your business to be doing tee UNK
plea please can i ask you if you bring in any other ideas of business you'll be considered to be
no i'm talking about the company doing it
yeah but forget it for now
right okay
they are not of any interest to us
they are they do not they're not printed
mhm
but they would be printed
yeah but they're not they're not part of our range now
because if you start getting if you get UNK down with discussing people about other products they'll think you're either gonna be doing them
okay
as a side
it's some once as a customer you can do it later stage
all right
because you start talking too many other businesses and this is a bit of advice for you
mhm
if you start talking any other business about wha except what you're doing there then they'll think that you're doing that as an as a side
and they'll take they'll take everything away from you no messing around
are very strict on that
oh no there are no intentions whatsoever the only thought was that er if you're into that type of advertising there's another eighteen spaces for the company
yeah
we're not into that advertising
there are plenty of other companies doing that
is there
but we are only interested in this particular product
right okay
okay
this is this is fairly new to us we bought the company because it was doing exactly what we were doing on other products
yes
but we are not interested at this stage in tee UNK and if you keep mentioning them ron they'll think hello
well could you tell me er how many
sorry that's just a bit of advice
that's no problem i thought it was just erm a thought for yourself maybe you could give out
oh they will have in fact the guy who's who owned this company who's now general manager of the company within the group
mhm
erm has been has had his erm er his UNK out for all sorts of advertising
because even tee UNK is not the end of the story
where is the golf company based
there're all based at head office
okay
but you work from the clients premises at all at all times
will that be in scotland
well it's in it we have enough assignments up here to consider that that's probably right
but we've just had somebody from glasgow go down to do my own course in humberside
aha
now that was er more or less a favour to me
aha
but er what we say is that we will pay thirty percent up to a hundred miles away from home
aha
okay above that we will pay thirty five percent
and that's one way by the way not a fifty mile round trip and all we say to everybody whichever company they go into we say to everybody who sits in your position there
can i refuse an assignment then
you can discuss an assignment
okay
but if that's your only opportunity to earn money that week
obviously then i'm going to take that
or that time you'll take it
yes
erm the guy down who's just done my club earned himself eighteen hundred pound in one week and he paid about a hundred a twenty quid out for bed and breakfast
and probably forty pounds worth of petrol there and back
so his expenses are his own
aha
yes
but if we were to send people consistently glasgow to humberside i don't think we'd have them very long
and there are enough golf courses up in scotland
yes
and that guy has just been transferred to another group so you know we're now one short well in fact we're three or four short up in scotland so
how many people er in this particular erm assignment would you have in scotland just the one off
aha
at the moment
that's why i'm very keen about to get about four up here because that means at the moment we've got several golf clubs waiting
okay
quite a number in fact
okay
because this is a the UNK of the golf club industry
so those are the if you like the financial details and any questions you have about that then er
no i'm very happy with
in terms of paying commissions we pay them all the following week
i think john will have told you that
and certainly we have kept the UNK the amount of administration down to a bear minimum if i can show you
we have the same contract for all of our products whichever company the only difference is that they're slightly colour coded
if you're colour blind tough
yes
all right they're colour coded
er there's not a one there yet
and what we in fact the reason we tell people everything on the phone ron is that there are some things that pen i did have one here
here you go
that's all right no i've got one over here somewhere
it's some day it's turned out
wow i think we'll get that on the tape recorder
the things that we make sure people know before we get there is the price all right i've already mentioned that
the fact that we need a thirty five percent deposit cheque
the fact that er we take the balance of the first year's payment through a banker's order
mhm
if you don't tell them about the deposit cheque if you don't tell them about the banker's order they will say well just a minute ron you didn't tell me that on the phone
i don't deal with
i like the idea of thirty five percent up front and
well that's the only way we can pay you your money then the following week
mhm
because in fact when you go to a client you're picking up your own deposit cheque
it will be made out to us and we pay you the following week
is this a two year contract
it is and wherever you quote nine hundred pound you quote them nine hundred pound per year
per annum
for a minimum of two years
okay
even though the cards are UNK every year it's still
so you really need some sound businesses you don't need your
you don't need your penny
no
you will not get your local er UNK er on these
you're looking for high UNK and even car firms can go bust the second year
track record
so you have to tell people all about
hello i wonder if you'd mind asking him to wait and i'll er be with him in about ten minutes
oh can you offer him a coffee
please thank you
right
yep you need some sound businesses
yes
there's no doubt about it
erm and they will want the prestige of being on the golf club and quite honestly the golf club card and quite honestly so does the golf club want
yes
prestigious
that's why their list will be erm if you like pre UNK you know
they have they have the right of UNK on whoever goes on there
however it's in their interests of course to allow you to get on and do your job
mhm
but if you don't tell them about things like banker's order about the signature particularly if two s two erm signatures are wanted on the cheque and the banker's order if the other guy's not there you don't go round until he's available
of course
if you've left that contract with them you'd never see it again
the other aspects of erm that's the contract you've already got the contract and the cheque
the other thing that we want from the client advertising client to make it a full deal so that we can pay you the thirty percent commission is copy
now this is the only product we have where it's full four colour
mhm
so it's very important to know before you go round if they've got copy
you say that i need to discuss copy when i've got there if you've got copy if they've had full colour before then they will have UNK and UNK and things like
yes
that
they will probably be using an agency
mhm
and at the training school ron they will tell you exactly how we deal with those
yes okay
there is a form which once again will UNK be explained at the er on the training course
yes
but that's the form
if they've never advertised before which is unlikely if we're going for high UNK you know high UNK
yes
companies that's the space down there
but i'm not going to er sit here teach you or show you how to do that because that's the training course responsibility
this is probably the most important form
and that is the commission form
all right
we c there once again all of these forms are colour coded there's your one
all right so you can see that they're the same form
advertising position the advertiser this will be the golf club that will be the town full and approved contract of what i've just described
there are a number of companies that we have across our erm all of our products which are what we call approved
mhm
and in fact you will have seen on those cards over there a UNK hospital
mhm
those are covered by a special arrangement where we don't have to collect a cheque we don't have a banker's order but it's done through a erm a company invoice
yes
all right
the difference there is instead of the cheque and the banker's order you have to pick up an official order from the UNK hospital
yes
and UNK hospitals although they're very common of course on the medical side are going to be obviously popular on the golf club side
mm
they're going to be popular on the golf club
oh yes
there's one if you pick up one there i think one of those cards there has got one on the planner and one on the erm
oh yes i see yes
one thing about advertising ron is er is the danger of UNK who will and who will not come into our product
and we've proven that er some people have said oh well he won't come on he can't either afford it or he doesn't want to
and we've turned it round
i've found that many times in sales
okay now erm the only question mark we have at the moment ron is the car
question mark for me or the car
well if you can give me some reassurance
oh no problem
okay
i mean
right because i have to put that on my notes you see and i
i the car i had before i gave up the company car was a UNK sports s l
oh right
but i'm not to obviously going to buy a UNK sports s l necessarily at this stage
yes
all we all we say we need
is a reasonable
i a bit worried about my pen
okay yeah
erm right well when you've got on your form here on your er you need to give a couple of week's notice
well what i'm looking for there rod obviously is a response to this letter i have sent to
if they don't respond to me in the next forty eight hours i'm going to send them a second letter er UNK
basically what i am doing is i want them to reply
i have only written the truth in my letter to them
they have got to respond to it
all right
er and if
i mean what happens if they give you everything you want and er
no
no i will not want for this company again
all right
i am out of
doesn't matter what
well the way you've approached it there i guess you're not going to be er sales director
it's not it's not the point of the money it's the fact is that they've UNK to me erm and really i want em
what actually happened was my a friend of mine or really was a friend of mine for a short time he was in the company when i joined and er after two months he told me he was leaving
and i said why are you leaving
because i hadn't experienced all this
mhm
and he's ron you're going to experience a lot of things that you're not going be happy about he says but i'll let you find out for yourself
well may be you shouldn't have done if he was a friend
so he left
suddenly he got another job in the golf industry and he left
and when he was told to bring in his car the next day and his company stock
he says no problem
he went down to his car and down to his company stock and he says now what the money's due to me you'll get them in the post
and he says they told him to get out the building
mhm
and give him a rough time and he was the longest serving rep with
well of course i mean the point there is
you get you get your money first before you hand over your car and the stock
right
now this is what happened
they sent him away and he's waited four months and he has not had a penny
he's written to them numerous times and they say what money
all right
so he is now in a position he can either take them to court or he's forgetting it
because he's still in the golf industry he's forgetting it
now it's something like eighteen hundred pounds
now what i want to do is i want them to respond first
if they don't respond i will say the next letter will be okay i am now UNK and your car and your stock won't be returned to you er but i'm holding them in UNK
yes okay
towards money due to me
what but what we're talking about timing here because we won't we won't er we won't for ever and ever you see
okay

er four weeks from now
or

okay good bye
ta sorry i had to drag you out here on this weather
long UNK of UNK and i thought the UNK
i now it's putting it on
i thought the long UNK of man should was a lovely expression
where was that you said that
isle of
isle of oh
isle of and they sh what she went on to say is erm i hope to UNK this in the shortly in other words she's shortly going to but i must say i like the expression long UNK you know bloody idle you know
mm
so you haven't got it back
no she said she's gonna UNK the balance very shortly
erm when i find my glasses i
now i've got to leave at three thirty
okay well we'll
okay kath right
erm let me just see if i've got a i made a whole page of notes here dunno whether any of its important
erm i've got the observer ghost story winners we can leave that for another week
erm the talks erm UNK is gonna speak to us on the UNK of february just to remind you and i've actually prepared some notes on play writing which we can fit in some time during this sort of session
erm homework i'm
come and sit down janet
ann
hello
well let me just say quickly we're being recorded there's someone er who's gotta er a project organisation by the oxford university press who's interested in our spoken word
right
and he's going to ask each of us to sign a permission form in the end because we have our we all own the copy right you know our own spoken word and er in order that this man can use what we actually speak today is showing to want us individually to sign a form
i don't think there's any sort of danger in it it's in fact for use in UNK a dictionary really
erm so it's they're really interested in our use of language
erm i told you about that chap michael bell who wrote to me about using my book as play i'll read you his letter some other week
erm john's dream the national UNK network actually wrote back to me and said they're quite happy to read your plays for a fee erm but i intend to re write that before i put it in er for a reading erm oh i sent a poem called pleasure to woman's weekly in june last year and i suspect they were actually planning to use it but they've had a new year's clear out and i got it back yesterday
erm foxes in the garden with the r s p c a photos i had rejected yesterday as well so that was a good day
erm i brought in the old UNK tape i UNK i've taped i taped our when you've read my play for me i erm i taped it and i made a copy for dave i you know erm UNK makes a good effort in that so eventually i'll lend you the tape
yeah that's eventually i'll lend you the tape for that erm we can pass it round
erm mr parish i mentioned sorry your name is jim
jim
jim did you say
jim and he's proposing to listen to the group today with the views to joining
jim has written like myself his background is in technical writing for a living and he's gotta particular interest in american writers and the use of american language er i gather
right well i'll start today if you don't mind and we'll go round in the normal way erm when we come to pat
pat has got five thousand odd words to read to us so if we can UNK round fairly quickly today
well we'll leave him till last if he's got
yeah well that's what i was
like that yeah
in other words you know you
what i was pat is five thousand words is really too bit a bite you know if you really want people to criticism off it you wanna break it down into sort of two thousand word UNK really
i couldn't get to the first part again and yeah that's right
even though you feel it's off your back you've written you can still read it out
i could go er that wouldn't be a bad idea because part of it would make sense to finish
yeah well if you like
yeah
you know five thousand
it is quite a lot to read i mean i read a short story last week
two seven
it was two seven and that even seems quite long you know to
that's right
it's quite long in the reading
five thousand is as
yeah
as UNK mentioned you know i mean if we want to criticise your first ten words it comes a bit hard up to five thousand you know
something that makes sense to carry on
mm
okay
can i just mention that nobody's read that but you'll see the last sentence says that whatever you put on that tape the dictionary keep the copyright you see and that's all right when you're on conversations but if you were to read in an and it was a short story if that's you know i if they reserve
very UNK yes
but jim makes the point he said that if when you sign a declaration you say
er yeah exclude your short story otherwise it could mean on you know it could be taken out and sold somewhere and then in interest you would sell your own for selling your own word you know that could be a possibility
well nobody's really saying in case when any of us sign it we must sign excluding the written work
yes yeah
read out and if you exclude it i think if all us do that
the best thing is to read something we've already had published
well
i think it's something like that
oh the one that keeps up to date and UNK the oxford english
yeah i think even so i think as david says it would probably be wise to exclude your exclude your written work
i mean by the piece i'm reading you today i've already submitted to the b c and if i sell it
if it's something that's
if they take it then i've sold the copyright to the b c and i'm not in a position to offer it to anybody else anyway erm
so will the tape last for the whole two hours
yes apparently
b c
yes
i don't want any of your bad language janet
right well let me just
surely
this is i i'll start off as i say i've written a covering letter to
bank and UNK of the b c and i thought i'd read you the letter as well because the letter does what we've often said about setting the block plan
erm i say i UNK a short story for your consideration
in this story the principal character is a UNK old house with a UNK sense of humour
it is newly occupied by a young couple
in the first conflict situation the house UNK a minor attack on the wife whilst possibly saving the husband from real harm
the couple settle in
minor conflicts occur with the couple trying to UNK her this continues up to a black moment when the house UNK and saves them and then i say and this is important i think when you write for a radio i have marked one paragraph with red brackets
this paragraph is optional depending on the reading speed
without it my version occupied a few seconds under fifteen minutes
the play is written for a hertfordshire accent or similar and then you know i UNK and i say return if you don't like it
incidentally janet did your piece ever come back or erm
yes
oh it's come back
came back
oh
oh was it the black dog
no that came back after all that time erm no this was the call called the birthday it was about a split in the future where she erm
oh yes
was a little girl on her fifteenth birthday and has it it's like an m o t certificate only it's an m o l certificate for life that you have to do after your sixty five
well i sent it to the b c i sent it to duncan but i also sent it to the lady a shorter version to the lady their competition and i said their competition was gonna be on the eighteenth in their issue they would give the names of the of the winners but i had looked in the lady yesterday in UNK and there was none of nothing about it but i don't think i've won anyway because it said you'd be notified by post so
that they run late on
yes it does
i've had one away five months to but i
no but this has been published it's been published december the fourteenth and i haven't had my copy yet which was in central england
oh central england
yes
yours was sent to sent on to the charity work
oh you did do it and i didn't
very important
right i'll read you this piece and you'll have to forgive my UNK of a herts accent
home sweet home my roy UNK
we fell in love with the cottage at first sight
it was UNK the january day we moved in
the cottage was old and UNK she didn't make us welcome
cottage means small house
this house was large and had four bedrooms
she didn't like her name she didn't like anything
i was a young man i was UNK and UNK
she didn't like me
i well remember our first night with the aid of father in law we spent a long day moving ourselves in
he was in a van and two estate cars we made many short journeys
we'd loaded and UNK furniture tools books and UNK the contents of house and garage greenhouse garden and shed
the cottage had solid brick walls none of your modern self UNK
the ancient boiler had sat in UNK silence for ten days a drifting UNK under a mountain would have offered more comfort
the rooms were too UNK for the youngsters so we left with mother in law
i bought some coal and lit the UNK boiler
four hours later the cottage had allowed the temperature to rise a degree above freezing
we made a last cup of tea on the camping stove and retired midnight
we lay awake all night UNK by strange sounds
we was too cold to sleep to exhausted to search out extra blankets from UNK tea UNK
holding each other close we wondered if this was a UNK move from a tiny UNK semi
in the morning the fire was cold and the cottage once more below freezing she burst a boiler
while i was making some tea there was a tremendous crash
me wife UNK
i flew up the stairs to find a huge hole in the ceiling at the foot of the bed covered with plaster and ice
water ran from the hole
of course at that time we didn't realise she'd done it on purpose
we had just finished finding the wife some dry clothes when there was an explosion downstairs
the camping stove had blown up
at least i was upstairs when it happened no one was hurt
we waited tea less all day for the gas man to connect the cooker
we had fish and chips from the local UNK for lunch dinner and supper
the fire had a good UNK too in the cold we burnt exactly one ton of UNK in that freezing january
life got back to normal we picked up our bearings
the back of the house faces south an avenue of giant UNK and a few old UNK lay over that way
the house on our western side had been empty for years
it's back garden was a jungle
among lots of small trees was seven fifty foot black it's front garden held two UNK
i loved the trees but having this forest next door made sure our garden only saw the sun as he moves from east to west early in the morning
the rest of the day we never saw him
we loved our home in the woods down in the lane
she didn't love us
outside the cottage walls were a horrible UNK grey the woodwork was depression brown
the interior was dull and UNK with lots of layers of ancient wallpaper
my wife and i loved a challenge in those days and we could see what it might become with hard work but it was a real challenge no mistake
we tackled the house UNK enough we started with the UNK bedrooms
next we did the kitchen and breakfast room where we fits an efficient gas boiler
we battles on in dining and sitting rooms
we found out that the sitting room had a timber UNK ceiling which had been UNK over and given lots of coats of whitewash
father in law and me UNK six weeks to restore it looks now
we UNK and painted two big bedrooms bathroom and toilet
we installed bigger UNK everywhere we went
we began to win the temperature battle
lastly worst of all the landing hall and stairs all those doors all that white paint
several times the cottage tried to throw me from the UNK boards one night she succeeded i got a badly twisted UNK
i told her you won't defeat me
next year my wife starts in UNK on the gardens driving back to UNK and UNK while i experiments with the outside colour scheme
all the walls i gives three coats of brilliant white stone paint easier to say than to do
black and white seemed a suitable work the front door was painted long yellow
as i say the back of the house faces south the summer sun was on the upper frames all the time
he soon UNK the glass in black
with a fight the frames were changed to white and yellow which reflects the heat rather than absorb it
time passed we improved the house
i hoped she'd begin to feel grateful
we fitted new carpets lamps and staircase
one summer i changed both sets of french windows for doors with UNK frames
i give myself one hundred and twenty new UNK to UNK round who says we grows UNK as we grows old
the house UNK
the owner of the near ruined house next door came and had his forest UNK to sell the property
we gained a sunny outlook and some neighbours to enjoy
the house smiled
the let in some afternoon sun which burnt the still black paint on the front paint work
i saw what she'd been smiling at
we settled for yellow and white all round
the two boys shared a bedroom the spare room was our office the boys were six years apart in age
in a few years their needs were very different the young one needed to be in bed and the older one wanted to play music with his friends
then my wife had her brain wave
there was a wide space beside the staircase the stairs rose up to the boys' bedroom wall then turned left to join the landing
on the landing the first door on the left opened up a walk in cupboard
why not my wife says knock a hole through the boys' bedroom wall pinch a three foot six strip off it and make a new landing passage and extend the walk in cupboard forward to take up the old landing and sideways to build a space out to the main part of the stairs
it was brilliant
when the work started the house was UNK she put every possible UNK in the way of the builders and arranged for it to rain as soon as the slates come off
she made sure all the UNK and wiring was in the path of progress
every hole UNK in the walls met a stone she UNK every tool
when everything was finished the younger boy moved in
for weeks we UNK into strange doors whilst making our way to bathroom and toilet in the dark
the house UNK
at last to UNK her we fitted a new bathroom
that magnificent cottage suite with gold UNK fittings should have pleased her
she showed no sign
to prevent her playing nasty tricks on us we had all the old lead and iron pipes taken out and the rust UNK tanks replaced with UNK burst proof UNK
we UNK up the UNK in the loft to UNK the midnight sound of her dropping chips of UNK on our bedroom ceiling
at last i thinks i seeks her problem
in the dead of night i UNK down to the breakfast room the nerve centre
listen house i says you are not a small house the cottage never was suitable
we are going to change your name we are going to call you the
UNK remember christopher robin his wise old house spelt his name UNK we're going to name you for the UNK at the foot of the garden
in a fit of temper she arranged for all the surrounding UNK to catch dutch elm disease and quickly died
this drove out the UNK
she could be a nasty devil in those days
suddenly i was struck down by an illness
when i was at me lowest me wife beat me she UNK herself and managed UNK when the family's happiness depended on it
i went blind in me right eye overnight
at first i could find no cause i UNK if i could go blind in one eye without a cause perhaps i could go blind in the other
i could become a burden to me wife and family not only that if i couldn't pay the mortgage they might throw us out of the cottage
i started two schemes first i increases the monthly payment on the mortgage then i starts a separate savings account
gradually the mortgage comes down and the savings goes up but there's still a gap
then bugger i down dead if she didn't get me
i was painting the back of the house one saturday when she UNK me off the ladder i got a compound UNK on me left leg
well i'd had so much time on the sick they put me on half pay
i couldn't pay the mortgage
things got very black indeed
the bank was hard they said they would UNK if things didn't improve shortly
at last the house UNK
as i lay in me bed each night i heard an UNK sound from overhead
on the third night i woke the wife she couldn't hear it
the boys never heard it either
when they was all out at work on monday i could stand it no longer i pulled down the loft ladder and dragged meself up it plaster and all
on thursday my brother dick the doctor visits me
we did ya this copper kettle he asked i've not seen that before
oh i've been hearing strange noises up in the loft lately and i got up there to see what it was
do you remember granny used say copper UNK was lucky
well i found an old brown paper parcel UNK right away in the corner where the noise was a coming from but i couldn't find what was making the noise i opened the parcel and found this old kettle
all black it was i spent two days cleaning it up
see the kettle is copper and the stand is brass
look it's got a lovely little spirit stove underneath it's got a UNK hunt UNK right round the middle
let me have a close look at it says dick putting on his glasses
dick is my next youngest brother he's been the village doctor round her for twenty years and a keen collector of UNK since he was married
i passed the kettle to him
he UNK the lid and UNK the whole thing closely
he UNK and UNK a bit then studies the UNK the smooth stove with its little lid on a chain
you've got a fine here he says
don't you know a list of every time is marked w f s in a diamond
yes i did see that i says
does it mean anything important
yes i think it does he says
if i'm not UNK it means it was made by w f smith of UNK in about seventeen hundred
it was always an UNK it was never meant to be used as an every day kettle
it would pay you to run this up to UNK for evaluation they've got a man there who UNK in things like this
thanks dick i says to him taking it from him and passing the bottle perhaps i will i'd no idea it might be valuable i just like copper and brass bits and pieces
well of course you can guess the rest i took it up and had it valued and then put in an UNK
we got nine thousand five hundred for it
i bought did dick a bottle of and paid off the mortgage
we're sitting pretty now
at last the house has made our peace with us and UNK on to her slates in the gardens
having got the kettle was certainly lucky for me
the funny thing is i never heard that noise again
fred thomson has been reading home sweet home by roy UNK
yes it's struggle in accent
yeah i wrote the thing as you remember about eighteen months ago but it had no conflict in it you know we're all the same and stories must have conflict so i got the house to burst the ceiling on the wife
yes
and then while he was upstairs seeing and helping his wife then the stove blew up downstairs now that might have been the house saving from a real disaster whilst attacking his wife in a minor way or it might have been pure coincidence
but er
hertfordshire where they
the other the black moment you know th the bit where i put in the bit where the he broke his leg and the mortgage was gonna be UNK on him i mean that builds up to the black moment which is a necessary part of the story and then he got out of it erm because the house UNK and showed him where the copper kettle was that was worth the money
use the word black seems to be getting very black
there is consensus out there of some people who their self politically correct and they do not like the word
there was a man being interviewed on UNK the other night he said that these people are trying to destroy the english language by their
i won't be changing it
how many words does that write
it's i've i was telling david outside that i've absolutely UNK it and i it's erm two thousand one hundred and sixty
as i
two thousand one hundred and sixty now
yeah
oh
why does it seem longer
t frankly yes it did but i mean you were reading it pretty well correctly the way they read i mean most of us read things i know i do myself one reads things quicker than perhaps some would if we were reading them on a radio or something
well i've been practising this
and erm if you listen to things on the radio they have at the end of a sentence or at the end of some sentence quite a pause for a second before they go on
well as i've taped that i taped it at home
mm
but as i wrote this and you know put in the UNK th the conflict it came up to two thousand five hundred words and i taped it and timed it and i've been UNK it and cutting out all the really nice little sentences and the nice sentences and i've got it down to two one sixty and now with that announcement on the end as i've got it taped it's fourteen minutes fifty nine seconds for a fifteen minute slot so it's about as precise as you're gonna get it
yes
erm and i may have UNK down a little today i don't know i should have timed it again
what
it's fiction kath stop worrying
i know
a kettle
there was one though on the antique road show where there's erm er girl brought in a kettle and they've been using it just every day and it was pottery and it was actually to buy her own house
showed it the following week
yeah well we've got a little antique box a jewellery box and it's UNK the pattern round it and the pattern round it is a UNK hunt and it's beautiful there's a little UNK galloping his heart out with UNK after him with UNK and he's all the way round the box and i thought of adding him on to the copper kettle you know as UNK all round the outside
i've got no idea of what it might fetch but as i say it is fiction kath don't worry about it
no i was just UNK
absolutely
well i was watching one of those antique road shows quite recently and i found a chap got one of those little sort of two inch diameter one inch high chamber pots and he said and where did you get this and she said er at a car boot sale and he said and how much did you pay and she said twenty five p
he said well you're very lucky he said by my UNK that's worth four thousand pounds
i was i was thinking cos i've got an old copper kettle
right well the time's passing we will have to push on
have you got anything peter
yes
a certain no dialogue today or anything like that
this is one of my film articles which i mean it's of the things that i've sent of and i know it will be published because i belong to the cinema UNK cinema and television UNK and they have this quarterly magazine and almost certainly you know it will be published in there there's no
there's confidence that's what i like to see
well i mean you don't get paid for it or anything
oh
there's no money in it
oh well that's a bit of a UNK peter
yeah no well
did you send your other one in
yes i have i posted it off during the week to my weekly because i thought because the it was about a girl in all trouble i think it
you're telling avoid that
like perhaps appeals to UNK magazines more than the other stuff but i know that i mean it's not UNK in that way is it's not a UNK
no
oh
yes
this is
right peter
this is called the men who called action
in the past the british film industry has produced many great directors sir reed michael UNK david lee to name but three
these top directors will not be forgotten in the future for apart from their films much has also been about them
at the same time as these directors were making their UNK films there were many other directors churning out the cinema of UNK entertaining pictures
it is to these directors many of whom the industry forgot in their later years that i wish to pay tribute
one such director was UNK who was born in UNK
in the early thirties he was employed as an editor for UNK at british and UNK films at UNK
it was at b and d in UNK that he directed his first film the UNK nest UNK sydney howard
he continued throughout the thirties making mostly low budget UNK that were made to fulfil UNK requirements
during the UNK he directed many films for and british national
i envisage and this is what i believe to be his last film not a hope in hell early in UNK
although mainly a director of low budget UNK he told me that before the war he concerned it a poor year if he did not earn six thousand pounds quite a sum for those days
the last time i saw him was at UNK a few months before they closed down and the was he was doing he said he was unable to get a film to direct so he was going to be UNK first assistant director on his forthcoming production
unfortunately this film was never made
another director also born just before the turn of the century was john harlow
in his early years he appeared in concert parties
he was also a musical UNK and also acted on the dramatic stage
he entered the film industry in UNK as an assistant director
UNK was the first film he directed in UNK
it was a low budget production but drew a certain amount of attention as it attempted to explore UNK
derek UNK was the leading UNK
john harlow directed a series of films for british national but probably his biggest success was while i live which UNK the very popular music the dream of
in the UNK he was finding work hard to come by
in UNK he was employed for one week by douglas UNK limited at UNK as a cover director british cover director on a t v film that was being directed by an american
he spent the week sitting in an office at the studio where in the past he had directed at least six feature films
UNK morris born UNK started in the business as a trainee on the construction side at UNK lime grove UNK
he later transferred to the production department as an assistant director
his opportunity to direct came from the UNK brothers he directed many of their t v series and second feature films
in UNK they made their last t v series richard the UNK
ernie directed all the thirty nine half hour UNK just two second features without a break
he continued to direct films for UNK and others but when the market for supporting films came to an end he found it hard going
he would have been quite happy to have been employed as a production manager an or as an assistant director of which he was first class but the work did not come his way
he ended his li his work in life as a UNK
robert UNK brother of camera man jack UNK was born in UNK
he entered the industry as an assistant director in UNK
over the years he became one of the top first assistant directors in the country
he began directing in UNK with follow a star a norman wisdom film
it was a success and he went on to direct five mor wisdom UNK
he also directed a UNK and wise film and co produced and directed with his brother she'll have a go
he also directed a number of UNK of various t v series but then the same old story little work
he would also have been happy to have found work as a production manager or an assistant director
the last time i saw him was at UNK er was at on the as t v series at UNK where he was acting second unit director
he was a very UNK man
i will mention two other directors who sometimes made slightly higher budget films UNK comfort UNK to UNK his many films included and temptation harbour and lawrence huntingdon UNK to UNK
his films include the UNK glass and the franchise affair
both these directors UNK much better than the other i have mentioned UNK as they were working right up until their death
the directors i have mentioned i knew personally
there were many others of equal merit who deserve to be remembered perhaps someone else would care to write about
i mean it's you know it's just to people in the film industry and obviously it has little interest reading it to
there was one which you said UNK morris was born in UNK
fifteen
oh fifteen
yes
i thought he said fifty as well
oh no fifteen
i was gonna say you s i thought you said UNK and you said he was directing in UNK you know i
the ordinary cinema UNK sees a lot of UNK in directing and producing and god knows what else but you really UNK
no well he was he i knew him quite well because i lived in at that time when i w was on that t v series i lived at UNK
he also lived at UNK and erm then the work dried up and he first of all he did work was a UNK at christmas time you know just as a thing and then he started you know then he became full time you know
were there no jobs sort of in between the director and the
well there were the jobs tha that i mentioned really production manager or assistant director and now he would have been quite happy i know to have done those because i remember talking about it you know er and he would have been very good at either of them but erm er he didn't get well he was a slightly UNK man he his erm i think in a way erm he was a director who could who was not really a very good film director he could get things done very quickly and that's why he worked for bash getting through everything quickly
he didn't have much UNK to do the things but erm and i think he used to sh he although i got on all right with him but some of the people working on the floor like the wardrobe people and that he used to they used to dislike him because he was but i would but you do find s i think perhaps he was a bit unsure of himself because i don't think he was somebody who'd had a had a tremendous education otherwise he probably wouldn't have gone in on the on the construction side which was being a UNK or something at UNK bush and so you know you often find people like that they have a bit of a chip on their shoulders don't they you know you know
plus i learned that you know from our group reading of my play the other week i learned what the function of a director was because you know obviously i shouldn't have given you all your parts to read for a week to sort of work out what the UNK should have been
yeah because
they've just given you a first read
you don't realise how many UNK are possible in one word and every important word the wrong UNK was used you know
i thought ah now that's what a director sorts out you know i mean that was that was er very useful
that castle was that the story by a j
yeah
yeah a really good book that i've got that at home
right janet your go
oh she's got a b c letter
refusal oh yes
er do y it's er printed it's nothing er i enjoyed reading your material this is b c
mm
or you won't
i enjoyed reading your material but after consideration i'm afraid to say that i cannot make use of short stories
we receive up to a hundred and forty week
oh
and while we do consider each one cannot offer individual reports or criticisms of every script that arrives
many of the stories selected for short story are from published UNK established authors some are commissioned specifically for the slot
we do use new writers but they have to compete with these other sources
briefly the requirements for short story are for UNK based er UNK based scripts of two thousand one hundred to two thousand three hundred words do not use a factual accounts or anything longer or shorter on this nor can we consider UNK writers monthly
no
well
i get it but i don't read it
something about a novel you know
janet not what you write what you said b c
yeah
well it's very much an but i mean it's my ambition to break into it
you know
yeah but you know i mean you gotta keep
thi this really everything in life doesn't it
yeah
or nearly everything
yes
i mean if you're
yes if you've got the right name
if you've got the right name if you've a number of or something coming in to for a part and of them you've seen on television and done a lot equally or as good or better but you're gonna be go for that one probably
that's right
an and everything they be architects or something you're gonna pick one who's who said well i did that building at london airport or something like that
next thing next one i'll send in i'm gonna sign it anonymous because my name may UNK you
oh it's a shame because that piece was brilliant i'm surprised they didn't take that was very good
yeah i'm very surprised about that i really thought i i'm
or i was
but i really thought
particularly the length of time that was away i was really sure that had got on to incidentally it's worth saying that the b c re they do they use professional readers who make a report on every piece they receive and they file them
so if ever you read work UNK and re submit it you must change the title because if you send it in they look up to see if they've seen that title before if it was rejected before it will be rejected automatically
so if we do a work you must change the title
do magazines do they same
i don't know
but certainly the b c do
it was
it was UNK was it
yeah i i've well that makes a change you know i mean some of my UNK come back from them and i've wondered whether they've read it
yes i've noticed that with magazines but this was erm sort of er you know
no it looks as though
do you think janet should send it to one of the other regions like manchester or somewhere
why don't you why don't you send it to erm let me see what's her name erm UNK
gill UNK yeah
UNK of radio manchester
they're very keen on new UNK
yeah but not UNK accents
yeah well give it a try give it a try
she tries all sorts of accents
i mean th there's a competition for a UNK for wales but who wants i mean
ah well give it a go
understand all these
well give it a go i mean a UNK is a UNK they're not saying a welsh UNK are they
no
well give it i didn't know that i'm er
yeah they assess in writers monthly
oh well that
or was it in erm perhaps it was in the that you got
yes variety
variety
you see the piece i just read is a UNK and if i'd known there was a competition for it i'd have sent it there rather than to
yeah and this is writers er erm
magazine
magazine writing magazine
oh i don't have that one
which is part of writers erm
writers weekly i would have thought writers news
well
writers news
oh writers news
yeah the other one
writers news
which i might do when this er present year runs out
well i buy writers monthly but i never read the damn thing you know so i
well this is and i noticed erm sort of do my in this particular one she said she's interested in north american indians
oh
yeah
and she said something about through her interest in north american indians she'd written this novel
she didn't say what it was or who published it or anything but it made me you know think you know so i wrote to her care of writers something and erm asked her what's the name of it i would like to read it because i had also written something about the er american indians and erm er who's the UNK or what's it called i'd like to read it
i mentioned just about and i got this erm letter from her
oh good
it's erm letter of passed on to me by
i am pleased you're enjoying my series of articles on writing a novel hope you gained something from the rest there should be seven in all
my interest in north UNK people in UNK to UNK which is about the same period for the you know UNK goes back many years to my pre writing days
the novel mentioned in the second article is a winter man mills and UNK
really
mm
oh well you know where to try then
well i've ordered it at the library because they didn't have they used to but it's gone
erm and as you will probably be able to UNK from the UNK is a an historical UNK
it was published in eighty six eighty seven although it's no longer available in shops it can still be obtained through the library service if you care to request it which i have
i'm afraid i haven't a spare copy to forward to you even on a loan basis one never allows for the UNK which arise
regarding your own story you state that this is a fantasy but you don't give details market juvenile adult fantasy UNK horror
as a publish writer yourself i told her i've been published articles you will understand the need for market targeting and as you mention at twenty thousand words is not full length though this could be if was aimed at children
if it is your first work of fiction of any great length i think you are doing the right thing putting it forward for appraisal by the eastern arts board you are lucky in your part of the country to have this
comments you could consider entering it or part of it in one of the many fiction competitions or UNK it in total to a which takes fiction
if it is your first work of fiction you should also look at it as part of your UNK which although it may never see the light of publication is of great benefit to you as a writer
a UNK does not college n b UNK he needs to build his first house and first novel and immediately becoming an international best UNK
okay occasionally it happens but i for one am a and i have the UNK in a UNK to prove it
i wish you well with your writing remember talent is very useful and UNK is a necessity
that's very good
mm
isn't it
yeah
that's very nice of her to write that
i think erm what she's really saying to you is that UNK not an art writing is a science bloody hard work
yes
you know getting on with it
yes
see i didn't write asking sort of advice telling her
no that's very nice of her no that's very good
so er
that's very nice of her to write
yes
and is there anywhere now
oh yeah i see it yeah
well when you said something like that it's not just one person who's gonna have a look is there
is it
so i mean you have to send one copy unless they take the bother of the copy they have received may gone to somebody else
no
yes
i mean what really your hope in looking after that is they will come up with some idea of publishing
well if it's UNK they
oh that was she was supposed to come today but she phoned up last week erm she is gonna come but i don't think that a date has been arranged yet
these are some of the extras standing around on UNK
oh
it was on wasn't it
yes
yeah it was repeated or something
oh it's brilliant you know i mean er i've telling him what i've doing this week
yeah
i've erm
nice photographs
they are letter and i've read
i look at the first enjoyed it
i mean what the strange thing is that i was reading about
the writers
is that UNK at the beginning she did it in class
well a word processor is much better to use because it's so easy to you've gotta change everything that follows whereas you know with a with a word processor you can add paragraphs about words in change words
a word processor is so much more power than a typewriter you wouldn't believe it
physiotherapy sort of exercises and that
yeah you've got to go what time
three thirty
okay well do you mind if we take kath
no not at all
you lost them
you can borrow mine
try mine
no it's all right
you put them in you
right
right now kath you can start us off
you wanna okay janet you're on
am i
with the glasses
it's not in there
help
nobody's
did you drop them on the floor
put them in your pocket
you read that last piece without glasses thinking about it
no you did have them on no you did have them
yeah you did have them
there's a pair on there
they're mine
leave the room
can we erm can we let ann have a go then
the UNK
yes
because the UNK on
well i don't know whether it's good enough for a recorder but erm i the ends a little bit because i was rushed to get her so
is this your er chapter of your story
no it's a short story really
oh fine good
but it's not brilliant i mean art to regain his breath as he stepped through
hang on a second what's the title
i'm sorry i didn't actually give it one
now ann i keep telling you
oh yes i know i'm sorry
well shall i call it
a short story
works
spring and autumn or something like that art to regain his breath as he stepped through the swing doors into the ordered UNK
shutting his eyes he stopped and was there the one he always remembered from his childhood polish dust though not so much now as the smell of books
he UNK at the counter struggling with the UNK of his shopping bag as he laid his self regulated three weekly books on the counter
she was new medium height dark with a shiny fringe and big brown eyes
he caught his breath
mary no it couldn't be
good morning
she looked straight into his UNK blue eyes as he UNK his books towards her
the smile was exactly the same but the voice was different it had a soft fur UNK was it
he couldn't be sure
thank you he said absent UNK and went through to the natural history
from here he could get a good view of the counter desk
yes she looked almost exactly the same unbelievable
he picked up a huge book h he picked up a large book with a huge green UNK on the front
strange he thought there seems to be a current UNK around about UNK there was one on top of a bottle of bath oil one of his UNK had given to him for christmas and another was UNK on the handle of a nail brush in the bathroom
UNK had a pencil with a blue one on the end it its UNK tail UNK around the pencil and the head was UNK down the neck could be used as a rubber
odd looking things he said himself quietly
it all happened years ago can't understand why they brought them up again now
mrs UNK moving carefully around natural history in search of something to help an UNK nine year old with his holidays
he's on a holiday project her talking to himself
she smiled over here is her remarks and hoping all was well
morning mrs dear how are you
fine mrs UNK and yourself
art UNK
he liked mrs UNK one of the old school always addressed by name a caring sort good morning mrs b over the years their relationship has developed so that art now called her mrs b he had once served at a library committee but that was when her husband was alive many years ago
didn't know you were interested in UNK she smiled gently UNK him
their seem to be a lot around at the moment
really she laughed
well you know what i mean knew very well and UNK
did you enjoy your holiday with the family she asked gently knowing that art lived alone now and welcomed the UNK from his eldest son UNK and his wife lynn
yes thank you it's great fun there and the two UNK have got these things everywhere he indicated the dust jacket where a green UNK monster UNK at both of them
it's pointed teeth remind him of some giant cheese UNK with a mind of it's own face smiling ready to strike
they were on the UNK in the garden even in the bathroom
it was yo UNK in my time yo UNK and UNK
i always think a woman looks pretty good under a UNK even better under a pretty hat his eyes looked distant
daphne laughed i'll see you in a moment she said kindly
art raised his eyes to the receiving desk she was standing she was standing talking to a young man
my how like is mary she looked so very pretty
the UNK were UNK as he replaced the book
he hadn't wanted to learn more about them not really ugly things after all and it was a long time ago
he moved into fiction checking his favourite UNK author
he always put a very tiny pencil mark on the end papers at the back of every book he read his very own secret sign
he knew he ought not to mark the books really but it was only a tiny mark in pencil and no one could UNK him of UNK library property not really it wouldn't do for an ex library committee member to be caught UNK library property now would it
art has served his country town well this country town well he lived he all his life all in a small cottage down by the river
he'd won a UNK to a local grammar school when he was eleven and then gone on to an apprenticeship with an engineering firm which employed a quarter of the UNK local UNK
that has sadly gone now another victim of the recession
art had always tried to give back what he had gained in life he felt grateful for what he felt he had to be given some said he'd achieved a great deal but in his heart he felt fate had dealt him with him gently and you have to make the most of the lo of the card life deals you
he as content and his worry was his younger son if only he would settle down like UNK and lynn find a nice girl make a home
art checked his books there were a lot of little marks on the end papers other readers marking their patch no doubt UNK as UNK have UNK other less fortunate in the past no doubt
he thought of them somehow communicating to ea to each of the UNK through their own little secret signs and UNK their flight of fancy
he moved to the counter you're new aren't you he said
my son's looking for a wife
he stopped it wasn't his normal behaviour to speak to the staff in so familiar a way after all he had his dignity
the girl UNK slightly and then laughed well we're a public library not a marriage bureau
he UNK still looking at her
how like mary she was incredible
out through the swing doors he made to the UNK coffee house
daphne was already there at her regular table
i like the new girl he observed UNK
daphne studied the menu a new one a friendly UNK down the side holding the printed menu between its UNK
damn things keep UNK up everywhere art observed UNK
she's right nice just qualified now to college from UNK you know daphne says steering the conversation in the way she wanted it to go
it's only here temporarily she's only here temporarily she added
why has she come here for goodness sake ar art UNK mentally choosing UNK up UNK and a roll of butter
what are you having
UNK daphne said and coffee
the UNK appeared for their order jacket sir she UNK as art placed the order for both of them
jacket potatoes yes please art replied
how's steve daphne well knew the UNK younger son caused him
as well as i'll ever know he replied UNK
i'm retiring in a few months daphne said quietly
retiring shouldn't have thought you were old enough art was brought up with a UNK
what will you do
i've decided to move
really
art was surprised
where are you going
UNK
art could not speak he had become so used to meeting daphne for lunch once a week it was part of his life he felt shocked strange UNK
UNK was where steven lived where the lovely young girl in library he looked across at daphne she was looking at him UNK her eyes questioning
i'll be sixty five in two months time art it's time for a move they'll be a lot of time on my hands
sixty five burst out art i didn't think you were anything near that anywhere near that age
well i am
UNK look was UNK
but that's not so far off as i am i thought you were much younger than i
UNK and took her hand she did not take it away
it puts a different light on things
does it art
UNK and lynn live in UNK art observed and UNK nearby daphne added
suddenly the future looked very bright indeed
there you go announced the UNK setting two hot plates before them
art UNK at the vocabulary it was a current phrase he most UNK
daphne UNK as he UNK his hands
there you go she said
what time did you ring me
well yes i know i tried to pick her up
well yes
this one describes at the end er you UNK over yourself she did not take er
her hand away you know if you imagine she if you make it she didn't take her hand away
oh yes
it'll be easier to say
okay fine
but otherwise
yes
it was only that you UNK over it
right
very good
it was excellent
oh i always wonder about that i never know whether it's correct i mean it certainly sounds better as you said she didn't take her hand away but i always find that when i'm writing something down i'm torn if it's dialogue i want to say they didn't couldn't and all things come in
when you're writing it you know
UNK
UNK i always wonder whether you should not or
well it depends on the context of the piece i think i mean if you're dealing with UNK old people you know who speak you know very precisely then obviously you'd keep it the one
if you're talking about youngsters and in a modern i in then in fact UNK like that are quite commonly used now in UNK and dialogue and of course in dialogue i mean
well in dialogue it's fine you can use almost any
sort of a figure of speech but with UNK it's it was always understood that the words would be UNK out more
words would be UNK out more yes
and if you used UNK like he'd h e apostrophe d that was in that was UNK in the thought process
yes
as though you know erm after all head known all about it this is the to himself and by doing that then UNK then that's when the reader was supposed to take it as a thought process rather than a
yeah
er it was i the only thing that brought it to mind was ann herself UNK over it as she said it you know UNK
well i wonder if it's
i wonder if it's one of those things that i mean she's reading the story UNK i wonder if you were reading that story as well
yeah as well
you read it very quickly and it would almost he had it would be he'd or whatever it is that the word was you know that y you
yes that doesn't flow does it
yeah
mm
sorry i've got to go
oh
shame
are you going
medical
are you going now
yeah
i mean you'll come back
what is this thing
march i can't remember the exact date erm
can you get me the date round then
yeah i will do
all
no
er see you all
okay bye
bye
bye
cheerio
bye
bye kath
how long did that take you ann
ten minutes
was it
i find that absolutely because you know my stories i can only write so much and then i stop and think about then and then i write some more
it's so difficult to add up the hours but i mean it's a number of days of course it's not working UNK you know maybe only for an up an hour or an hour
well once i've got you know once i've got the shape of the story in my mind i can it down in an hour or so every time you know it's in long hand then it takes me hours to type it but er you know the actual once i've got the idea i find it necessary to get it all down you know in long hand as quickly as possible
right the other thing ann you really must get given you pieces of titles you know because that should steer you into it you know the title should be the first UNK you hang your hat on that's the first thing
i suppose i could it spring and to UNK rather than spring and autumn
yes or something like that yeah
right UNK your go
UNK found her glasses
oh sorry janet
okay janet
pass me over
our great minds thought UNK today
what's that
well there's this david thomas charitable trust in writers news for a story of s between sixteen and eighteen hundred words with the theme pride goes before a fall
oh yeah
so i UNK out something i've done eleven hundred words re wrote it and it's now seventeen hundred words about the house
yeah
the UNK objects have been UNK the life into by it's called for sale
UNK and impressive detached residence with large well UNK garden running down to the river said the card in the window of the UNK estate agent
the house was indeed UNK and certainly impressive but had an air of UNK
the UNK by stopped to admire her from the large UNK iron gates at the bottom of the drive
she UNK the UNK all and above the windows like UNK and all three UNK brick style UNK with pride
the house had been empty for some time now and beginning to feel lonely
prospective buyers had been shown around but the house had quickly made up her mind that they were not suitable for such as she
she would know at once when the right people entered the from the moment she looked upon them at the top of the wide staircase
she UNK for the time i've just got two in my UNK
so far though the UNK had not been at all suitable
some had children that are at an age where there might be a tendency towards vandalism one of whom had been UNK dealt with by her when he attempted to slide down the oak UNK kicking her as he went down
he was UNK off the end at great speed and the viewing had to end there and then
a fast exit to the hospital for that lot
she would have no with UNK either
not
UNK it's UNK
UNK yeah
UNK
i spelt it wrong that's why i spelt it spanish UNK either
no here
they would probably knock her UNK about to fit in a UNK or the like not to mention all night parties and UNK guests filling every room
no peace and quiet what a thought
but then she would UNK an atmosphere the house could breath evil through her walls if she concentrated hard enough and the UNK would be wiped off the faces of those to whom money was no object
when one of these UNK had the UNK to kick her wood UNK walls in the study i put library in the to see if they were sound she'd breath such UNK through the wall that his wife UNK and pulled her fur coat tightly around her UNK out of the room saying i wouldn't sleep under this roof for a million
yes she would know when to use her UNK and warmth she would know how to use her will power right UNK when they appear
in the meantime she would continue to give off the appropriate UNK to the UNK
one more summer term to winter still the house had not looked upon anyone she saw as suitable enough to take on a satisfactory residence within her proud walls if only she was
virginia had UNK up to her several times trying to be friendly but each time the house UNK her advances don't you dare to come near me with those nasty UNK little fingers she smiled preventing the new young UNK finding a hold on her walls
poor virginia finally collapsed upon herself and quietly died
the flowers of the garden UNK for virginia UNK with nobody to UNK them the flowers had left their beds and were running riot
you've killed her they cried how could you
how could people admire my form and grace my naked UNK with that UNK and climbing all over me
UNK she doesn't even make flowers and even if she did she should keep her place in the garden with you lot
the flowers were hurt by these words
what you be without us they UNK
the house UNK down on them from her windows i don't need you
just you wait until somebody falls in love with me and comes to live here then it will be off with your heads your stupid UNK heads she UNK
as winter frost covered the sleeping flowers the cold silent house was UNK by wind and damp by driving rain
soon the rain began to UNK into a hole in the roof where the wind had UNK removed a couple of slates
she was now damp and depressed UNK for spring to arrive and have someone to talk to again
a wandering tramp UNK into an UNK ground floor window for a nights sleep out of the UNK wind
but the house UNK her floor boards and UNK her windows UNK with the wind till he picked up his bum and UNK into the night shaking with fear as he imagined UNK
one has one's pride said the house let him sleep somewhere less grand he's only a tramp
eventually the house UNK a excitement of spring in the air the earth was coming alive again with UNK green shoots UNK through searching for the warm rays of sunshine
she felt her heart UNK as a car came up the drive and stopped in front of her
this looks UNK a UNK chauffeur driven car
she UNK up now
the men that stepped out of the car looked suitable enough at first glance
they stood looking up at her
at last she UNK happily at such a class
she knew she wasn't looking her best at the moment but they looked the type to know quality when they saw it she thought as she UNK he UNK at them UNK now UNK and torn by the wind
the men turned and entered her paint UNK front door
she was UNK with pride and excitement warm and friendly atmosphere as the men UNK from room to room listening the agent UNK the possibilities of the property
where are you all off too
we're all running down to the river like you said they may not find us down there
tell the others when they awake and they can follow us
goodbye house
seeing there was an empty space where the flowers had been oh dear me who can i talk to now i've been abandoned left in the UNK not even a bird to talk to or call my friend
birds have long since given up trying to nest in her UNK
the space where the flowers had been soon became a thriving mass of weeds
UNK was the first to reach her walls unlike little virginia she wasn't having any nonsense from the proud house
UNK slowly up the walls before the house had even noticed she was there
the UNK were UNK they UNK marched right up to her very door bringing their friends the docks with them
soon the UNK came all they cared about was blooming getting their white UNK and blowing their babies far away
they ignored the threats of the house and from everything else it was just a place to grow
just you wait and see what's going to happen to you said the UNK house UNK for the lot of you that's what
my people will soon be moving in here
after a few months of UNK with the strong weeds the house was delighted to see activity in the grounds
men and machinery arrived with a great deal of noise and UNK
they've started to restore my beauty at last she signed with relief
well dressed men were once again looking up at her there was also some UNK ones she noticed but decided to ignore them
she drew herself up and began UNK her UNK like an old UNK living in her past glory
so intent was she on making a good impression she failed to see a crane coming towards her
a great UNK went through the old house as with a UNK crunch the weight hit her front wall
with a UNK of pain and surprise she doubled up
the UNK impressive residence fought to retain her dignity and slowly collapsed upon herself
there was a UNK a sign and then silence
the old houses give you the UNK don't they bill
yeah did you hear that noise hey
makes you feel like a UNK sometimes this job don't it
yeah gives you the UNK
come on then let's get the rest of it down before we start going daft
before they could start again there was a sound of breaking glass
one of the young labourers had thrown a brick through a window the part of the house still standing
UNK you can pack that UNK in bill was UNK
the young lad looked up at them and laughed what's up with you it's gotta come down innit
yeah but give the old girl a bit of respect son
the boy tipped back his yellow UNK and UNK his head
you've been in this job too long mate you're going UNK
bill laughed come on harry let's get this lot down
they UNK looked at each other a bit UNK and bill UNK away just a little less harder than before
