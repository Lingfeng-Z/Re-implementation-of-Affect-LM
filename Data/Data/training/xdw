and having said that they recognize the difficulties of the moment it's the question of the alternatives and there needs to be some work done on that
in the papers there doesn't seem to be that
no in actual fact it was circulated to all members the v p c report of the of the time
yes
rather than the last meeting it was just a couple of days after the last meeting so rather than wait until now i circulated all the papers i'd got
i think chairman it is of particular interest of shropshire isn't it really
if anything shropshire must have more sheep than almost any other county
i think we ought to look at not necessarily with the agencies our own delegation might well be able to do something
well chairman i'm grateful for that information what it says is that er everybody else is just as confused as i am
no really and er so i don't feel quite such a fool as i did when i started to speak
but er i think the advice that erm mr is giving us about who we talk to and when to talk to them how we get to get together and present a united face to government is a is a good suggestion and i'd like to propose that er we accept that
yes
i i'm very concerned erm about this because er i used to deliver this dip and i i'm concerned er about my staff and there's been lots of cases that have claimed that this er dip has affected people
there's any amount of farmers farm workers er going sick because of this dip there was last year
whether it's genuine or not i don't know but er i think it was it is dangerous stuff and erm it is time surely we do it our scientists can find something better and cheaper
because i mean that it costs the earth anyway that damn stuff it really does with it and it's a well i did it on about eight hundred sheep so you know my men are stuck in this for a day or two
it's er it's not pleasant for them and they're doing it in wet UNK but i mean whatever erm i find for them you know to wear i mean time after time they get their feet down and slip and get them in
in fact i've known people to go right in so it it's not a simple job you know and they do take a great deal of risk with this and i do i mean it's much more serious than i think than the government find it should really work hard to try to try to find something else
we never had this problem years ago i mean it's only do UNK who stopped the stuff we used to use years ago which was a reasonable price who's caused all these problems
you you're saying there is already an alternative
erm a bit of
in your opinion
well yes but i mean it's before this erm this lot came out and er that used to work alright and that didn't er the do UNK decided it was affecting our meat
you're only expressing a personal opinion councillor
well i don't know about that it seems to be a general opinion for farmers
well why does the farmers union support anyway we won't go into an argument about that but i mean the m f u support the UNK and er with due respect it's a personal opinion
well sir they're we support UNK because it's already been stated to note that we make most of the money for shropshire from farming and sheep is one of the big things which we sell all over the country but unless we can guarantee our sheep are clear of er disease people aren't going to come here and buy meat and stuff are they
and that's the important point
yes
are you agreeing that some action should be taken
oh yes i'm all favour of UNK but i want a safer dip for the operators
well you've heard the motion
if mr accepts that can i er call a meeting with perhaps a member from each of the groups and an m f u and c l a
i doubt mr can be included in that because he's on the a c aren't you on the a c committee for this
no not on this particular committee services
no alright sorry alright
okay are you all agreed
yes
any other points on the on this report
erm only one chairman on eight under UNK
making inspections on cattle on page four erm one thousand one hundred and forty two UNK and five hundred and twenty three bred
is one thousand one hundred and forty two incorrect UNK or whatever correct isn't that very high
yes it's the failure to keep UNK identification breed re records by two or three far farmers and it's one of those things where if you've got a lot of animals and you haven't marked them then you get a lot of UNK and that's why we've got to go through it
so it's just two or three people and not
yes
erm the situation in shropshire as far as records are concerned is erm relatively good
it would be even better now we've got these systematic
what
okay i expect everybody's noticed seven and noticed the legal proceedings that followed that
right we'll move on
fire and rescue quarterly report
fire officer paper f and i think you've had a something additional put on your table because you've had with that paper a
oh
it's against statistics for july to UNK july to september
i think it's worth er noting chairman the high incidence of er chip pans which are domestic chip pans not chip shops quite a high incidence still of domestic fires caused by domestic chip pans
chairman can i also say that the er the false alarms situation seems to have gone down
erm i think we ought to make it very clear again that we can now trace calls and er i hope the press are noting that and making as much as they can of it because that's the sort of thing that helps to remove UNK calls which go which cost a lot of money and a lot of time and also put somebody else's life in danger when an appliance has been called out to something that it's not required for
so that's er that's a very UNK er statistic if i may say so and er i reinforce again we can now check and find out where false calls come from
thank you chairman
chairman on the front of page under over the border calls i don't know whether people saw the erm local news last night about the cuts in UNK and UNK and apparently there's just one appliance will be in UNK erm will that mean we'll have more over the border calls because they won't be able to get appliances
i no well the answer is no as far as the chief fire officer is concerned
do you want to speak on this er
no chief hasn't set any questions erm the other change to this has been to remove the UNK special interest and we've put in as a separate paper so that we can bring them up to date
UNK you've always received them three six months in arrears
what we're trying to do is get it reasonably up to date and these are of course then photographs for the album as well
yes there are photographs going round by the way
yes councillor
yes could i just raise a point on two on the analysis of fire calls
erm the heading doubtful UNK
there seems to be quite an increase over the year erm virtually double
erm are they actually in particular areas grouped and particular age groups which may be causing these incidents
yes very much so in fact and in this sort of thing the local trend is similar to the national trend
people who set fires tend to be young males there are very few female UNK and there are not that many in the sort of later age group
they tend to be young and they tend to be male
that's not always the case but it's that's the tendency
erm there is an increase nationally we've got a similar increase locally although the figures that we've shown there are probably distorted slightly
i mean it's not anything like as dramatic as that but it's because it UNK in different quarters in the area in different towns
but yes the trend is the same as the national one there is an increase in UNK possibly that's also influenced by the fact that we're better at UNK and we're becoming increasingly more so as the years go by and calls that would have been recorded as unknown in the past would now be recorded as this
were you referring or asking whether these occurred in areas of shropshire or
no i wa i was actually referring to the nature of and the whether if shropshire was the same as the national
chairman having detected the UNK i wonder if the chief officer knew whether a study had ever been done on the background of those people generally nationally who er caused that scene and whether any steps would be f if they were confined to certain people with certain UNK or certain part of UNK whether anything could be brought to bear
yes erm a great deal of work has been done in the united states on this trend in particular by juvenile fire UNK as they refer to them
there's been a more limited but still a fairly substantial amount of work done in this country and there has been nothing at all we've had done locally
recently i met with er the probation people from social services to discuss exactly what major has asked about which is follow up on juvenile fire UNK and find out if there's any way in which we can modify their behaviour
and in the past the nearest we've got to that is taking them along to a fire station and telling them what sort of people we are that has been proved in many cases to be UNK because it's actually an incentive if you wish to set fires from other districts than this
so what we're trying to do is approach this in a professional way and we're drawing on the national and the international experience and working together with social services to try and determine a sensible policy
and i have to say that we're talking about a limited number of people that even if you UNK half a dozen young fire UNK in a year you'd probably made a fairly substantial impact in shropshire
so we're at that very early stage that we are working directly with social services and also in another area with education for the same reason
yes okay could we ask mr chairman on this particular thing on this UNK business in one thing that we did express concern of were a number of years that are invariably are started we've called in to do the research into this and the investigation so ar does this add now the fact that you're more sophisticated does it now mean that your having more staff er devoted to this because this was a question that whether we should do it or whether the police should be doing it
is it er having an impact on us on our standing
yes i think the answer to that has to be certainly it does
really to investigate even to analyze the statistics takes time
to produce these statistics in the way we now produce them takes time
to break them down into calls by type of station or something as simple as that
yes i accept that but it
to analyze the statistics and look for meaningful trends obviously takes staff time
but this won't be a er UNK staff this will be i presume difference between UNK staff and building staff
no they input that the UNK come by from non UNK staff but the analysis is always done by UNK staff who are able to identify the trends and who understand what the figures mean
so yes it does have an impact and if we investigate fires to a level which would allow us to identify trends and patterns then that will
okay move on paper g sorry no am i right no we're not
fire service s a five point four
no we haven't done that yet
no i'm sorry in view sorry i'm
keep is it my fault
paper g UNK special interest
on page two on the twenty sixth of november i don't think er it does it doesn't tell the full story does it
nor does the picture book that's just passed by
page three
the child the child was the child was dead
what
what which one are we looking at
we're looking at paper g chairman
but page you said page two
page three i said item on the twenty sixth of november
page three
ninety three
yes
i just asked in to give it in a note actually
i understand what major is saying
is he saying that this is incorrect
you located the child on the first floor
no exactly
and then UNK to hospital
i haven't got a clue
well res rescue does rescue does er UNK up in the mind that the person rescued was alive
but the fire service don't declare who's dead and alive and they've got very good personnel
alright i'm just telling you then
perhaps this is something i was just going to say that until someone is actually UNK dead by your doctor they're not regarded as dead and so that's what what's happened
well i think the committee should note that there was a UNK at that at that incident
can we note that mr chairman
yes we'll note it erm the UNK w when they are incoming it could happen any time after six months after twelve months
any other point
it's fairly up to date sixteenth of december paper h road traffic accidents
i couldn't understand this one chairman
no it takes a bit of UNK out yes
yes
oh your computer played up yes george
i must apologize for this one it's hard for me sometimes to understand it as well
erm the one two three and four refer to quarters it seems a strange way to do it and i apologize for that
the three columns below actually relate to the categories persons UNK services omitted and services
so if you move the key up alongside those three columns does it make sense
but as i say i do apologize for that it's unnecessarily complicated
there the graph UNK what's in the table below
stick to the graph itself if you ignore the rest of it the UNK actually good
what do no services mean
well it's where we're called out probably with the initial belief that somebody is trapped and the person's either released before we arrive there or you know
so we do nothing but turn back and go back
well very often what is we do is make the vehicle safe er by UNK the battery and so on we may warn about petrol
but in general it just means that we've arrived we've discovered that nobody's trapped and we go away
but where then can you explain what the difference is with people UNK in the r t a services only then
well services only is walking down the road UNK the battery or something similar
so we have three categories we don't do anything at all we do something fairly UNK like washing away petrol or UNK batteries or we rescue people
thank you
yes councillor
er chairman yes i wanted to make a comment and ask a question
and i'll i think i can i have it on this right and road traffic accidents may perhaps cover any traffic accidents namely if a plane UNK in the other night erm last saturday night
yes
a plane crash
the plane UNK completely
erm i would like to particularly compliment the fire service on the magnificent job they were doing there in the most appalling conditions
it was very difficult for them they had to come and they had to find the actual crash and it was an appalling position to get to erm the efficiency was splendid
erm my question particularly is does this also come under sort of traffic accidents
well we don't get any extra money out of standard spending assessment
because it's absolutely disgraceful
i mean it was a very big operation there could have been people alive in that plane but er as it happened i think UNK they were both dead but i mean but people didn't know that
erm and i think it's quite beyond belief that these sort of accidents as well as the major road accidents aren't taken into consideration for our s a and particularly in a county like shropshire where there's very little but grain in a lot of places and that erm money has to be found but i would i would really like to hear what the officer
yes it's very unfortunate there is an item on that on five point four you know re regarding that er
yes i saw that there was on this the s a
i saw that afterwards i rather wanted to hang it on this so's i could put in my comment about the plane
yes that's right i appreciate it yes
an aircraft is classified as a road traffic accident
well it's traffic
well i mean the UNK is if you look in the UNK statistics chart the one that's attached to that one the aeroplane crash would come under special service calls other so it's a UNK column so it's not even a road accident it's some other
and this one
like opening a lock of a door of somebody's house they can't get in
we have some photographs by the way of the er aircraft that can be sent round er
care carefully UNK
yes erm
yes mr chairman i er mrs qui quite rightly said we can congratulate the fire service on the way they dealt with that plane crash and er we're all sorry that it happened
erm could i sort of use that as a lever to remind people on the yellow sheets that we forgot about and that was the last one the sixteenth of december and er i think that's an element of personal er commitment to the fire service which is so divided
which er which we all who went to the particular er occasion when we went past it on our way from the church to the reception we saw it going on
we all know what was happening and er and we i personally would like to make sure that er fire fighter UNK is UNK in this committee too because there was extreme UNK on that occasion
hear
i've no doubt in time that report will be coming before the committee regarding that
i also intend to recommend for a you know a non fire service UNK award
at least that was something that was done out with the normal course of duty so like i think
yes colonel
i don't think we should pass too lightly over what mrs has said it does seem extraordinary in that er someone who's locked out of their house and the fire service comes along and opens the door for them comes under office and mains and UNK and then a major er a plane crash is also classified like that
i don't know if we can work with mr through the a c that his UNK it's a more major incident than some of the some that are shown
and i there ought to be another column really within this for these for these sort of things and it certainly should be er included for the er standard spending assessment for the erm
if somebody had put a match to it up there you see it would then come under s a
some sorry
somebody would've put a match to it and set it on fire we would have got money for going to deal with it
yes so i wondered whether if i think we should take that up er it does seem extraordinary that a big thing like that is sort of put in the odds and ends column
yes it is a crazy situation
can i just ask would it be different if it had been a military aircraft
it would have been a great deal more difficult because military aircraft use more UNK fuel and they tend to be armed they tend to be carrying things that civil aircraft don't normally carry so yes it would've been much more difficult
of course the speeds would've been higher as well
and you probably wouldn't have been allowed to get near part of it
yes but would it have still have been something which we wouldn't have got any money for
oh absolutely yes unless it had gone on fire
if it had gone on fire we'd have rescued it
it probably would've military aircraft tend to burst into flames more easily than civil aircraft it is true to say
can we keep UNK at this chairman can a letter be written to say that we're rather concerned about this methodology and psychology of this
we are UNK we're constantly UNK we UNK at the last time and councillor on our behalf has UNK at it as well erm a report erm
yes we i mean we have
well can we go again because and use this as an as an example
it will take quite big headed advice that is as well as familiar
well can we go again because by we're having a UNK perhaps one day we'll get through to somebody
yes and i've no doubt that our representative on the a c will take it up as well again
well he wants to let
and let us well that's right i mean that's partly covered by erm by in the sense that whilst as far as this year's concerned erm it's too late for that but then if the government have agreed to look at look at special service calls again for next year
because i think incidents such as this we move to help bring pressure to bear on er
but mr wants a letter before to UNK his way beforehand the UNK to go to the appropriate people on the board meeting
i think it's probably worth mentioning on that similar context following mr 's comments about the false alarms that the more successful we are at reducing those the more that impacts on our budget because they take out for s a unlike road accidents
so the more successful that we're reducing them and road accidents then we automatically reduce our s a
it's a crazy method isn't it
well can a letter be written on this chairman
yes so that mr will have some backup
UNK are you taking five four eight for this behind
well i'll we'll come to it yes it it's immediately after this
we erm we have some photographs of w which are rather horrendous actually of r t as
now i've discussed with the chief fire officer whether members of this committee should be allowed to look at them
i mean i think that it's erm a good idea for members to see what firemen and i'm thinking in particular really of fire fight fighters i shouldn't say firemen fire fighters we've got ladies erm who are retained and can be at their du place of work one minute and twenty minutes afterwards they've got to face up to ho horrendous UNK erm it must have a tr traumatic effect on them
er and i think it's a good idea that you if you want to have a look at these photographs look at them if you're UNK at all don't look at them
erm the chief fire officer will UNK on what i've been saying
erm if i could say that we show you lots and lots of photographs of bits of UNK metal that doesn't actually mean very much and i think mr more than anybody round here will with that
the impact that it has on these people particularly as the chair said the retained service can be quite profound because they unlike the whole time firemen can be UNK from being a joiner one minute into being a rescue operator the next minute
and road accidents we talk about them a lot and we've discussed about charging for them or whether we shouldn't and all the rest of it they aren't about bits of UNK metal they're about people
and these picture they're two or three incidents that we've had recently they are fairly horrible
if you've got any UNK at all don't look at them please but if you wish to they'll give you an indication of the kind of thing that your fire fighters have been facing over the last three or four months
these are all recent incidents so i mean i really would reinforce that don't look at them if you're in any way UNK because they're not they're quite unpleasant
they're not meant to be crude or UNK they give you an idea of the kind of thing that your fire fighters face on a regular basis
right we'll move on to five point four
fire service s a which we've talked to at some length already
councillor
can i ju just raise a point where it refers to the fact that the s a is going to be looked at again next year
erm the agency has considered a paper on this as is referred to in the final paragraph what it's basically suggesting to the department of the environment and the home office is that a formula is based upon the supply factors er such as the number of fire stations and standard crew levels etcetera
now with any i freely admit as i'm sure we all do that there's no formula in this that's going to be perfect but having seen some preliminary information on the work the a c is pushing at the moment it does unfortunately have a detrimental impact on our own situation here in shropshire
with the report erm i have circulated copies to each of the group's UNK there was a couple of charts which indicate what the current situation is with er spending as against s a and if the home office move to er a fir what they call a fire station based s a what the position would be
and on the basis of those graphs it does look as if our situation UNK
so i think we've got to be very careful erm and i want to know which way to go with this
but i'm very concerned obviously as a representative of shropshire on that committee i don't really want to support something which at the end of the day is going to have a detrimental impact on our own service here
now i'm wondering how easy or whether there's any mileage in actually having a report coming to our next committee to actually build on that so that we've actually got something to pull on figures to consider erm and if and it is going to UNK impact upon us to a greater or lesser extent then obviously it's helpful to me
but i think it's also useful for the committee to UNK comments on where it sees areas to be looked at like special service calls so on and so forth
i don't think anybody can agree there is there is perhaps a better way of looking at the current formula but i'm just a little bit concerned having read this report and seen the purpose about the way that er the a c are pressing for the
we
i we're just about the middle of the road with it er
yes i mean this year with the formula obviously because the number of fire calls has dropped it impacts upon er as i say that i don't know whether the actual the cost the differential between the number of calls that have dropped and the drop in the s a whether it's comparable and i don't suppose they've got a measure of the drop in s a terms it's far greater than the actual marginal costs of er not attending those er extra fire calls
and it yes it hits and i mean that's purely off the top of my head that it certainly is we haven't UNK any detail
it's probably the simplest illustration is to say that over the last three or four years we've moved from being well below s a to nine point four percent above s a now nothing's changed other than that we've got a slight decrease in the number of calls over this last two years
our brigade hasn't got dramatically larger nothing dramatic has changed
all that's changed is the way the UNK been applied and the number of calls that counts towards the formula
so one minute we're by s a terms a UNK authority and now we're a bit of a substantial UNK
the UNK to be welcomed in the fact that we're actually attending er less and less calls
but obviously er as the chief says it has impacts on our s a so really we need in money terms to be able to give er a relatively high value of call out
that's not to add that the existing formula is at fault
the difficulty is if we move to something er which is supply based as is being suggested then it could impact even greater and so there's no perfect er system for this but there's got to be a better way
yes it's possibly worth mentioning on that as well that in comparison with the supply based i mean the existing system is demand based which is silly because we have to have fire stations there even if they never go out if they go out twice a year we still have to have a fire station in UNK but with the demand based model that's illustrated in a c based initiative it's based on existing supply and this authority has a fairly UNK level of supply in comparison with some other authorities so what happens is that if you apply it to existing supply then we come out quite badly
and i think until reviews of the standards of fire cover are applied on a uniform basis across the country the more uniform basis than they currently are then the figures will always be the problem
okay th we will present them
the next meeting at branch to try and er get of er what potentially we're looking at
okay
yep
we move on
fire service pension scheme five point five
okay chair that's just a note that it er it's a matter we've raised with this committee on several occasions in the past and getting close i think to being able to present some detailed figures as to the likely costs in future of UNK pension sch scheme to shropshire county council
it's a bit worrying isn't it
very
what happened to the reorganization
no well i should think we've got to think about it
yes
speaking entirely UNK it's extremely worrying
the police have a similar problem erm but not as bad as we have
oh no it's a lot bigger it's a lot worse well there's a lot more of them
well there's a lot more here
it's early retirement now i suppose
i beg your pardon
it's early retirement
well yes that does
it has had an effect on us but it's relatively limited
but the basic but the basic problem is the way it was set up in the first place
an UNK scheme
it's an UNK scheme it just simply has ongoing revenue on an annual basis
that's right
and if you have an increase in one year and the situation then throws it all out of UNK
it doesn't have enough money coming in to pay for it
it's as simple as that
it was a wonderful scheme for thirty years it's got lots and lots of money but we never seem to put any in
for thirty years onwards it's a dreadful scheme
as mr is UNK on the paper
i mean unfortunately the authority in days gone by has benefited from the scheme in the sense that the extra money in service in truth the revenue was there erm the chickens have come home to UNK in the sense that it's the tables have turned the other way and i mean gone are the days where when we're least worried out that impact that much more of our er of our budget
the financial UNK of those days were probably the people who taught the ones who have been professional schemes
okay
right sorry that was a nasty remark
in UNK to the first thirty years as the man says
five point seven sorry five point six paper i review of fire safety yes please if you would erm
right chair p a g asked for two reports to be produced as part of the budget process looking in more detail at the budget and the two specific reports that were asked for were fire safety and UNK
we've looked very closely at fire safety as it's currently existing and within out current statutory and UNK responsibilities
and we've attempted to cost out the work that's done against the resources
the UNK that we've put against the whole report is that there are something in the region of half a dozen major government initiated reviews into fire safety in this country
by the national audit office the audit commission itself the home office the d t i under deregulation and all the rest of it
there are likely to be very substantial changes in the legislation itself and the way in which it's enforced
so in the medium term the short to medium term i think we need to base what we're doing very much on existing establishments and existing UNK
that's not to say that we stop looking at it and we'll be looking in more and more detail at the UNK matched up against the resources as we get better information
this brigade is probably if not the only conservative one of a tiny number in the country that don't UNK their information systems for fire safety
we never had them and we've been criticized recently by the inspector because of that
we're now attempting to install or produce those systems so that we have better information
because as you can imagine in fire stations there's a great deal of number UNK there's a lot of inspections there's a lot of work that's done
it's very difficult to analyze that using manual systems
erm so looking though it the kind of the only really important points i think are that er to carry out statutory and non statutory work
most of non statutory work is giving advice to people like control and others which may not be purely statutory in the sense that is but the major difference is there's a time when it's imposed on when we have to do it
whereas the fire precautions act just says we have to do it but it doesn't say when
and that creates fairly major problems for us
erm looking through the rest of the paper there's a mistake in paragraph three where it says cost of inspections was six hundred and fifty hundred that should be six hundred and fifty thousand
er looking through the officer workload ratios in paragraph four it shows that using what are in honesty fairly crude home office measures we're really quite well to the national average that we carry out approximately four hundred and thirty three inspections per officer in a year as opposed to the expected four hundred and eighty two
erm again we utilize ninety one point nine two percent of the available UNK time for inspections rather than the national average of eighty four point three nine percent
i mean i they look reasonable
all i can say to you they're fairly crude measurements anyway
er looking on w there's a slight warning i think there about th the decision talks about possible reductions by increasing intra
that means that we are locked into issuing fire certificates since we rely on the and it UNK a marked official erm performance target on us we can't afford to let the numbers of inspections of supported defences drop so that means that we've got to find money from elsewhere in the budget
looking to i've referred to the possible changes and the recommendations really say that at present there's insufficient information and it's against a background of very dramatic future changes in fire safety
and i would say to you that really there's little point in making any major changes there until you you're able to assess it properly
major you UNK
thank you chairman i've got three questions chairman for the chief fire officer
they refer to the appendix a attached
firstly on the second page number fifty eight the education act in the middle of page one nine four refers to schools used and maintained by the local authority
does that exempt schools that are not maintained by the local authority
that's the first one
yes it's covered by the note underneath where it says that independent schools receive inspections and advice as and when requested by the d o e
i see you are requested by the d o e
yes
second question chairman er and several of the of the acts er they provide er advisory to the licensing authorities advisory to district councils with example pet shops advisory to district councils does that mean that they on i can only er reckon that they think that places probably expect it if they're asked to do it by the district council
effectively yes there is
if the district council were UNK and didn't ask them to do it we have no guarantee that er that the premises that i'm in are safe
yes effectively
the best illustration is the building acts
erm when an application is received for building approval by a district council they consult the fire authority but there's no specific obligation on us to give detailed advice
in the past we gave very detailed advice and the legislation has now been changed to say that we merely identify any UNK or UNK in the application
that's purely advisory
but the thing is that there's time limits imposed on the building application so that time limit is therefore transferred to us
yes
so but basically the answer to your question is if we weren't asked then there's no requirement for us to give the information
no so we don't know we're really safe in some premises because the district council may not have asked
the final question chairman there's a lot of er facts here with no remarks against them under the premises and involvement like here on page three number fifty nine mental health act the national assistance act health and safety at work act it doesn't tell us the type of premises or what in so i say well what involvement do we have with the mental heath act for example
yes
very varied
erm purely non specific
under the mental health act and off the top of my head i'd say we certainly cover places like UNK hospitals erm residential institutions and all the rest of it
and again it's on the basis of giving advice as to what standards of fire safety are recommended
so our so our safety in outside premises does not only we cannot blame it on our fire service we can blame it on another agencies if something ever went wrong
oh indeed i mean a great many of them we have no responsibility at all for we merely give advice when requested
the health and safety at work act that's one line with nothing decided that covers a vast UNK of tenants and individuals and regulations
and having given that advice to the pet shop does it have to be UNK with
no it's purely advisory it depends depending on which piece of legislation it depends upon the regulatory bodies and in most cases that tends to be the district councils but it's
things are not as safe as i thought they were
well registration of children's homes
we give advice on suitable UNK it's not up to us to make sure that they're enforced
it's up to social services and social services may choose although i have got to say it's unlikely to register a children's or an elderly person's home despite the fact that we've given advice that they shouldn't
but i think we'll update not so much is over public authorities would probably take your advice but i'm thinking of people who are not public authorities who might in a way suffer that your advice may cause them some expense and they might choose to delay it and well i am guilty we can't afford to do that this year so it never gets done
no but i mean let's be fair about these though be fair to them and in the erm to see that they carry out your suggestions or advice is with the area local authorities
it arrange to say that in our homes it's the responsibility of the county council or the social services department so really you're working together
councillor
yes thank you chair i just wanted to add
your royal highness ladies and gentlemen my name's rod i normally UNK as the chief racing coach for the royal UNK association but i'm not here in that capacity this afternoon but the coordinator rather a grand title for the year of youth sailing and i've been asked to give you a short ten minutes or so briefing on where we're up to with th this project this year erm i know there are many familiar faces around so i apologize to those of you that may know some of this information already
we're already eleven weeks into the year and er so my UNK gonna centre on what we've done so far and what we expect to happen
the idea came in nineteen ninety two the early part of nineteen ninety two er from doctor frank er who was er sitting on the race training committee who approached it from the point of view we need to obviously UNK the triangle on the competitive side
and very quickly talking about it amongst the staff and er the other committees it would seem that it ought to have a far broader remit than just on the racing side so the first thing that i'd like to emphasise is that this year of youth sailing is involves all the outgoing grass roots divisions of the r y a that is UNK racing training and the development divisions and the regions and the clubs and the recognized teaching establishments so it really is an all UNK er scheme
all types of sailing boats as well i know that it's easy to think of that we're only dealing in UNK and UNK er but all types of sailing boats and all abilities both disabled youngsters and all types of organizations
the aims which i put up there i won't go through each one i think are hopefully fairly self explanatory the some of those are going well and some of them still need a hard push a hard push from us and a hard push from the clubs and the teaching establishments
those of you that have children or er are involved in education in any way at the moment will be well aware of the cut and problems that are going on er within reorganization within education in this country at the moment and i learnt to sail through the national school sailing association a long time ago er and thousands and thousands of youngsters have done that over the years
that association in common with UNK education centres are under severe pressure
my view is and it's a widely held view within the association and the informed clubs is that if we let that situation go on and do nothing about it we will have a decreasing er number of people going and number of people going sailing
not now not next year but in the next twenty years so there are a problem with schools there are problems i think with changing leisure habits er people the way that people take their leisure has changed over the last twenty years and not always have clubs organizations and sailing schools taken account of that in their programme especially with youngsters and i have to say i also believe there is UNK in some clubs and other organizations not every club has an active youth sailing scheme and i believe that any club that doesn't either must be extremely popular because of its er prices of beer or some other reason or it may not exist perhaps in twenty years' time so i think it's an UNK extremely important topic brought about by the maybe without being UNK some of the stuff that we're reading in the papers about youngsters these days but looking at it from a purely selfish sailing point of view if we're to get more youngsters into the sport even if we're to hold our ground we've got to make a big effort over this year and it's important make sure that it runs on for future years
okay how we're going how have we attempted to deliver the goods to the population at large
as you can see so far six hundred organizations have registered with us and what we've done is put them in a rather flash booklet and the idea is that youngsters their parents teachers youth leaders UNK leaders anybody gets hold of one of these booklets and in it tells them how to go sailing
there is one basic thing that they need to do they or their parents that is pick up the telephone and ring a contact that's all they have to do because within here there are people ready to receive those er t telephone enquiries and get the youngsters on the water
many of them free but not all
there are different clubs have different policies and we haven't laid down what way they should go
we've got the erm we've got the six hundred organizations running so far about three thousand events probably a few more if you count every single er course that some of the training schools are running but in terms of key events i'm very confident in being able to say there are three thousand events running around the country about half of which are new and that's the important thing so about fifteen hundred new and UNK events that didn't go on last year or the year before UNK the r y a public relations officer has been coordinating the public relations campaign and these days to get the young pe young people and those young people whose parents don't sail because it's to get at the people whose parents do sail you've actually got to get in the media and er we've been on blue peter we've been on going live another children's programme on a saturday morning and
and we have done other things that you see up there already and we aim to do more and get into specialist magazines like the young telegraph
the probe problem is having had a big initial launch the reality is that we're now going to drip feed the p r throughout the year and there are several good stories coming up which i'm not gonna tell you er that we hope the national and local press will pick up on
it's obviously very important that some stories are big enough to break if you're lucky in the national media but more important each of the clubs and sailing schools can get it in their local events because they're only too happy to take er provide the stories
ha the information that we've put out so far were our second UNK of the er of the black booklet of which there'll be twelve thousand they are quite an expensive item and but our feeling was that er in order to sell the thing you've got to do it properly and er spending money doesn't come easily but er in order to market the thing er thought that was the way to go and we've done other things stickers and UNK and posters and so on and so forth the normal sort of things but we've really tried to spread these around the country and get the message that it's a UNK young er interesting fun thing to be involved in for young people
we tested this out by taking it around the office and the people in the office thought it was a bit boring we er thought it was great for the youngsters who probably like it so er erm and the UNK we've actually we've made up certain things t shirts and UNK items that again er relate to young people so that they get into the theme of the thing and the whole year carries forward on a on a certain colour theme and so on so er we've done our best as sailing coaches not only learning to be UNK again the money where's the money come from
well we were lucky in that we've been able to do have a very good relationship with a company called well known in the marine side and they put in forty five thousand pounds into er the scheme and promised that before christmas and that was reading the paper one day in november the robert the national heritage minister saying that they may be may if you're lucky going to put some money into sport and er so we contacted them and we were one of the first sports to get had money doubled as they say in the UNK hall so we er we now have ninety thousand pounds and which i wh has been distributed or will be distributed in the in the following way so that's how we're gonna spend it and er these er the administration represent we were basically overwhelmed with enquiries and s we took on a person in order to do it the normal r y a staff had already got enough on so we took on a girl called UNK who answers all the queries on the year of youth UNK and erm we are also running the boat shows the four or five n b l challenge which is the UNK event for our UNK which is er i won't go into the details but is a talent fight talent spotting event for under sixteen year olds around the country and it provided fleet of UNK the prize for which is a UNK which is not a bad prize i think you'll agree
information and promotion i have spoken to you about and the most important thing probably for the users besides us being able to promote what they're doing for nothing and that is grants so we are about to write and er you will be able to UNK it back to your clubs if they are already registered
we are about to write to every club that's registered with us tough on those that haven't er that to er to come and er fill in a form and get grant aid
we're talking about hundreds not thousands here because there are six hundred clubs so we're talking but i think though we hope to be able to give significant amounts of money to pay for perhaps safety boats perhaps UNK perhaps rescue boat fuel enough to kick start these courses off which is important and those forms are going out at the end of the week and when the money's gone we'll stop giving the grants out
okay
so what's the message we're trying to get across what's the message you're trying to get across
cos that's the important thing i think
so often we at the national authority seen to be selling something which may or may not be you and the clubs er and the class associations round the country thinks important
i hope you think that this is important more important to you as it were than it is to us because you the clubs and the sailing schools really must take these sorts of messages on board not perhaps all of that list there but i would pick out erm that the message that we want to get across to young people i would pick out the words fun the words challenging the words safe alright
many people who have not been sailing before many parents are worried about their youngsters think that it's dangerous and whatever and we have all this information we have all these checks we have a wonderful education scheme er within our own organization in this country and we should go out and sell that and i think we a lot of it's going on already and i don't UNK that and we need to just market that a little better to get more youngsters on the water because once we get more youngsters on the water the UNK gets wider the building gets higher so that's an important issue
well okay well just to wind up i mean i've been involved in this and people within the r y a and the office for a good six months now and we fell well down the line the reality is hardly any courses have started yet and there's hardly any youngsters been on the water
i thought driving up today would have been a good day but the reality is that it is not going to start until easter time
we've done a profile of the courses and guess what they all happen in the school holidays so this isn't this isn't over yet in fact for all the user groups for you the clubs and the organizations it really does need a push from you must by and large are the UNK decision makers the club officers and i would ask you urgently whether or whether or not your clubs already got its name on the list to actually support the people within your club that are laying these things on
if there isn't anything being laid on chase it and perhaps get something laid on this summer in the holidays and whatever
erm i think it's i hope you'll agree that it's absolutely essential and i hope that you your reward will be the smiling faces of the youngsters when they come off the water during the year
thank you very much
UNK ladies and gentlemen before we commence the business of the annual general meeting i'd like to remind members of the very great honour that was UNK upon the association at the end of last year when we were granted the right to wear the red UNK with the crown
this is a quite unique privilege as the list of clubs and organizations granted the right to wear special UNK was closed several years ago
the secretary of state for defence UNK a list as an exception to allow the association to mark the UNK anniversary of the UNK of her UNK the queen our UNK to the UNK
the UNK is flown at r y a house and can be worn by vessels directly employed on r y a business
i would now ask her royal highness as our president to mark this very special award by UNK our UNK to you the members of the r y a at this a g m
your royal highness
thank you ma'am
well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen i am delighted to welcome you to the r y a's annual general meeting if i may call the meeting to order and may i propose that for those who's UNK the meeting printed on the front page of the annual report and accounts ninety one ninety two to be taken as read
thank you
during the course of er this meeting you will hear from the chairman and the honorary treasurer and we may well cover an enormous amount of the grounds that is relevant to you as UNK members and officers of the association and it might be worth i am going to avoid what he's trying to avoid most of that area because i believe they cover it in greater detail and give you more of an opportunity to find out precisely what's been going on
this of course is post UNK year
now there are occasionally criticisms from members that there is too much concentration on the UNK end of sport in the sports federation in this instance the r y a but what is important about the is an effort to produce a very high standard as a finished product so to speak to go to the UNK but it also helps to concentrate minds on the bit that is missing before and help to UNK everybody's concentration into the training area and rod has just been talking about the year of youth and of course it follows on very naturally in a post UNK year to launch that year of youth
not all of those people by a long way have any UNK ambitions but is nonetheless an important part of the perspective and indeed at the triangle that we need to support
that's the overall and rather special context of this year in the year of the youth but every year is an important from the point of view of UNK and clubs and the amount of work that ac goes on the ground through supporting causes and the effort to recruit membership and it's in that rather UNK day to day part of r y a membership that i would like to congratulate you first i think all of you have worked extremely hard and the reports reflect the success achieved and i would particularly highlight the increase in membership now that obviously hasn't been easy and this does require a huge effort of a consistent effort and it's not something you can just apply every now and again
members don't tend to respond very well from that basis
this is a continuity and causing support for your members and that increase reflects enormous credit
i'll come back to that in a moment because we still only UNK a rather tiny proportion of those active in our sport but to go back to the point about training
can i also highlight the fact that over a hundred thousand people attended r y a training courses of one sort or another last year
now it is something that you could find out for yourself but on the other hand it is there and i would like to highlight it and bring it to your attention
the other thing that tends to happen in post UNK years is people look at rule books and different types of competition and there is a sort of atmosphere of i think we ought to change things
well change is fine as long as it's done UNK and actually has some purpose
erm it's a difficult balance change is very rarely popular and quite often it's only ever talked about but sometimes it happens and even then it's not popular but a balanced and open mind is required to approach change but perhaps more important and this isn't always mentioned suggestions about change tend to come from rather specific areas and there are rather specific interest groups which may start the process of change
the point about membership is that you ought to be able to comment on those suggestions of change and get involved with them on a broad basis
er those sort of reactions if we don't get them changes might happen anyway and you won't like them
it is very necessary to exercise membership particularly in those areas change can just as easily be motivated from your members not just special interest groups and it is important to look at it in the broader sense
your officers has members from all over the country will try to apply a broad view but there are changes that will be necessary but they will attempt to do them in the most sympathetic and most broadly based way
competitions are an important part of club activity obviously
for your younger members often very important but competition is part of the process
it is also part of the process of learning because it again UNK their mind on what they need to do better fine
take it on past the sort of club competitions to major UNK and you come up against sponsorship
this in turn creates its own difficulties
at a local level UNK so often are involved in the club on a more direct way but it isn't always seen as a problem and can be enormously beneficial to both parties
sponsorship on a wider basis is much more difficult to manage
sponsorship should of course be the UNK on the cake there should be enough in competition in UNK and themselves but people are interested enough to go and to support and that sponsorship actually allows you to do things that you wouldn't have been able to do otherwise
the danger of course is that sponsorship for itself in itself becomes more important than the actual UNK
th we must be able to learn from this period particularly a partial UNK mm but these events are sound events in themselves and that we're not just doing it for the sake of the sponsor or attracting a sponsor and that it's not in itself completely necessary to have a sponsor otherwise the competition wouldn't exist
this is a difficult balance
it's going to be difficult for everybody but i believe that this is a period when again it rather highlights er the priorities in terms of what clubs and members actually want and what they are prepared to work for
on a slightly different theme left to our own devices and left to the UNK devices this association and membership have always been very proud of our own record of UNK and not UNK and that we have an ability er to UNK in people a need to gain information and training along the way
from further UNK there are going to be pressures to change that situation particularly from europe in either actual or proposed legislation
th that for most of us would be very sad and it is your association and it is the only substantial body that there's representing you as individual UNK but is attempting to fight off that unnecessary legislation
i need hardly say that that's not going to be done with courtesy of the odd telephone call
this requires real attention to detail and some concentration on that problem with experts who know how to deal with lobbying process in brussels
there are a few people who claim even to know about the lobbying process in brussels
i would have think it's probably still UNK
but it does highlight a need and i'm not going to UNK on the treasurer's toes in this instant but certainly that will add to the financial burden of running the association but if its to increasing its lobbying power and authority over those in positions of influence then above all we do need a very large membership
er it has been brought to my attention that the r s p b erm which i think you all know that for one reason or another can call upon the membership of eight hundred and seventy thousand individuals and our sport was something between two point five to three million active participants slightly depending on the definition has only about two percent as personal members of the r y a contributing directly
i mention those figures the need for a large membership is self evident and i know that you are making tremendous efforts to increase that membership
some suggestions a that membership should be mandatory for those holding r y a positions and appointments well that is certainly up for future debate but i do look forward to the day when our membership is truly representative at the individual level as it is currently at the club level and we w shouldn't forget that the r y a is its membership
well it doesn't exist by itself
can i close by thanking rod our chief racing coach for what i thought was a very excellent presentation of the r y a ye year of youth sailing and i have great pleasure in launching that initiative for UNK er this year's UNK court boat show again it seems UNK self evident that it's only through increasing the involvement of the young that we assure thriving clubs and associations and classes for the future but nobody up here is going to say that it's easy and i believe though that the work that the official the officers and the r y a put together will make it easier than it once was and i hope that the literature that they have put together and the programme that they have put together will be a help to all of you so please make use of it
that is one of the roles of your association and it is what your membership fees go towards and it is there to be used and they've done their best so i hope it will come in very useful for you for this year and i wish you a very good year
well item one is the minutes of the a g m nineteen ninety two if there are any queries may i have them now or i will take them as read and sign them
thank you
to receive the report for the council for the year ended thirtieth september nineteen ninety two
can i ask peter as chairman of the council to propose a doctrine of the report
thank you ma'am
your royal highness UNK and members of the association may i begin my report by thanking you ma'am for the time you have given to our sport for being with us at our annual general meeting and for the address you have just delivered
we have a president who is UNK gracious and what is more important to me a fellow UNK
we are indeed fortunate
hear
ladies and gentlemen i will not waste your time by UNK repeating my printed annual report to the association which is on page four of your agenda papers
if you haven't read it you will have ample chance to read it at a later date and if you have you would know what i was going to say
our president has covered one or two major issues that concern us now and which will continue to concern us over the next few years
i can only emphasise the point that her royal highness has already made on the requirements for us to have a much larger membership to allow us to speak with strong voice in the many debates we find ourselves involved on behalf of our sport whether it be UNK offshore sailing craft motor UNK racing anything that virtually goes on the water we look after
this must be the major object of the association during my UNK is to increase our individual membership which we need so much to re to our representation at a high level
her royal highness has also highlighted the r y a year of youth sailing which she launched at the UNK court boat show
the youngsters are our sea call of the future and we must grasp the initiative with both hands
as my hair turns grey and falls out i must also put in a plug for senior sailors with earlier retirement
alleged increased time and UNK it UNK us to pay attention to this influential body of citizens perhaps next year rod can organize a year of UNK sailors
our sport is for all this is not a UNK statement of jargon but a fact thanks to our boats sailors of all ages and all UNK can participate
many people never race just enjoy themselves UNK
we must look after not all of the sport the high UNK the starters the UNK and those who just go out for enjoyment and potter
your council occasionally suffers comments about the age of some of its members but the fact remains that to a man or woman your council members are current sailors or actively involved in the sport and this must be good for sport
over the past twelve months it has been my great privilege to become more closely involved with those with disabilities i have seen the enormous efforts being made to encourage participation at a very high competitive level as well as tremendous UNK being made at many clubs to bring disabled people into sailing at all levels
this is an area where we can make much more progress and i'm delighted to see the advances that have already taken place
those of you who have not yet started the programme for the handicapped please join in and spread our sailing skills to all
mention of sport for all reminds me of the tremendous debt owed for the volunteers of our sport
over three hundred individuals give their time freely to support the r y a where they are experienced on one central committee or another
at least a similar number give the same service to the sport in our thirteen regions nationwide
if one then UNK adds the volunteers who man and manage the clubs organized UNK and ordinary races the UNK the rescue crews the and other sailing schools and instruction that goes on all o all over place the end the list is endless
the UNK of our sport upon these expert volunteers is clear for all to see
i would like to thank you all at this time on behalf of the association and the sport we represent for all your efforts you make for us in an UNK capacity and time given voluntary to all
may th the UNK spirit continue in our sport for many days to come
our president has referred to many of the problems we currently face and will continue to come up against in the future
i will not dwell upon them but will re emphasise what has already been said and ask you to give us all your support
we need an UNK sport there have been a few occasions sadly when clubs and associations have followed marginally UNK lines as we attempt to represent the sport similar bodies which does not help our cause
we also need a large membership to further and strengthen already a very effective lobby within government europe and the sport
may i close by thanking her royal highness my colleagues on council all my friends in our sport and our association as well as our very loyal and UNK permanent staff for all their efforts on behalf of the sport
before i propose the adoption of my report willing to take any important questions or comments
as there seems to be no questions ma'am may i propose the adoption of the report
your royal highness ladies and gentlemen i have much pleasure not only seconding the adoption of the report but UNK council on an excellent which i did read
the equivalent meeting
hear
anyone against
thank you
right item three which is to receive the accounts for the year ending thirtieth september nineteen ninety two and report of the auditors
so before this motion is proposed may i ask mr john of to read the UNK formal report
your royal highness mr chairman ladies and gentlemen
UNK report to the members of royal UNK association
we have audited the accounts set out on pages eight to fourteen in accordance with auditing standards
in our opinion the accounts give a true and fair view of the UNK affairs at the thirtieth of september nineteen ninety two and of the surplus and cash flows for the year ended on that date and have been properly prepared in accordance with the companies act nineteen eighty five and that report has been signed chartered accountants registered auditor
thanks very much indeed
so may i call upon chris the honorary treasurer to move the adoption of the accounts
thank you ma'am
er your royal highness chairman UNK ladies and gentlemen the accounts have been circulated and they are to be found on pages eight to fourteen with the report and there are copies around the room
i believe that the accounts whilst UNK as john has just told us with the companies act do give i hope as full and an informative picture as possible and therefore i don't intend to talk about them in detail
the incoming expenditure account on page eight contains good news and bad news
the good news is that the surplus of a hundred and ninety three thousand six hundred and eighty seven pounds after tax is the largest ever in the UNK history
the bad news is that there were two hundred and thirteen thousand UNK worth of non recurring income items to reach that and this means that the UNK routine activities ran at a deficit of twenty thousand pounds or thereabouts
this is a small amount in relation to our subscriptions which reached one million pounds for the first time but it does pose problems
firstly there is an extremely long lead time before a subscription increase works its way through to our income and expenditure account
if there was a resolution on the agenda today to increase the subscription and i UNK to add there isn't but if there was then that increase by convention would take effect on the first of january nineteen ninety four but the full value of the increase would not reach our income and expenditure account until the year nineteen ninety five to ninety six and this means that we are not well placed to respond to short term financial problems
the chancellor yesterday very kindly did not put v a t on books and UNK but had he done so that would have the effect of taking more than one hundred thousand pounds out of our accounts in the current year without us being able to do anything about it and it does seem to me that we should be considering asking the members in general meeting to pass to the council of the association the right to set and increase subscriptions and having properly advised the members UNK to fix the effective date of such increases otherwise we are very badly placed to respond to short term problems
however the major problem and you ma'am have already touched upon this as well as the chairman and i am sorry to be UNK but we do serve all UNK two and a half to three million of them whilst being financially supported by only sixty five thousand of them
the only satisfactory long term solution must be to secure a UNK increased membership of the association
the r y a doesn't need an enormous subscription income and so if we could increase personal membership to say four hundred and eighty thousand which happens to be the UNK membership of our member clubs this could be at a very much lower individual subscription and this in turn would UNK selling membership to the nearly two million UNK persons who are not members of clubs
i believe that we have got to go for this strategy if we are continue to fight the UNK which are the root of our UNK
the alternative of higher personal subscriptions does not i believe hold out the likelihood of sufficient income to meet the mounting costs of protecting UNK and their rights
coming back to reality ma'am and the balance sheet
the r y a is financially strong following from the good results of last year the reserves passed one million pounds for the first time and those will enable us to continue with our work for UNK while we deal with the problems that i have touched upon
there is no need for any concern at the present time but the problems have got to be addressed because they won't go away
so ma'am i have pleasure in UNK the adoption of the accounts and i'll endeavour to answer any answer any questions on them
right thank you very much er chris fo and the proposal is from th the treasurer can i have a seconder please
ma'am may i have er pleasure to second the adoption of the accounts
may i have the approval of the meeting
anyone against
thank you
report to you
ma'am
UNK members i have a great announcement to make there have been no other nominations for president of the association
i am pleased to say therefore i would like to propose that her royal highness be re elected with UNK president of the royal UNK association
thank you very much chairman and thank you all very much and i do hope your members realize what you are doing up here
it's your fault
no it's i might i would take this opportunity to say how much i appreciate your UNK when i have the opportunity to visit the clubs er it d they are always very enjoyable occasions and i much look forward to them
as you realize six hundred clubs the chances of my getting round all of them ha
five hundred
yes ar are not that good but i'm working at it on a sort of regional basis erm but you may have to keep me here for a very long time in order to achieve it
i don't suggest that i think i should keep going on a year by year basis
thank you
item five erm i'm also pleased to say that er chris was the only person nominated to be honorary treasurer and it would give me great pleasure er to propose that he be elected honorary treasurer and may i have a seconder for that proposal please
your royal highness south west region
it gives me the greatest pleasure to second the nomination of chris as the honorary treasurer
thank you very much
may i have the approval of the meeting please
thank you
item six is the announcement of the results er the council election and i will ask the secretary general to announce those
ma'am the four elected by the life members of the order mr p j p a l m and m
er in the UNK east midland region there was an election and mr UNK was elected as the representative for the year
er the remainder of the regional representatives are in the agenda and i suggest they can be seen there and not repeated here and if i may then go on ma'am council asked that we would in fact announce the results of the UNK committee election at the a g m and again in UNK order a mr and miss bill north west region
i have pleasure in proposing that UNK be appointed auditors and the authority is delegated to the council to fix the remuneration of the auditors
thank you and a seconder
dr frank UNK sailing club i would like to second the proposition that UNK continue in office
thank you
thank you can i have the approval of the meeting
anyone against
thank you and may i add my thanks to for their work very much appreciated and i know the treasurer would agree thank you
item eight may i ask richard the chairman of the develop divisional committee to introduce and put the resolution to the a g m
thank you your royal highness
your royal highness mr chairman UNK ladies and gentlemen i am not absolutely sure whether this microphone system will work if i stand what i do know is however that i would be a larger target for you and under the circumstance i will if i may remain seated
historically the minimum subscription UNK organizations and clubs has been set that twice the personal UNK subscription and after a period of two years' grace it's the council's wish that this balance is re established so that the UNK returns to that which existed prior to the increase in subscriptions that was proposed at the a g m in nineteen ninety one
are there any questions of this erm resolution before i put it to the meeting
thank you very much then i would ask and would put the ordinary resolution that the minimum annual subscription for member clubs past associations and other UNK organizations be increased from twenty four to thirty two pounds
thank you ma'am
can i have a seconder
ma'am i would like to erm second that resolution i believe that the traditional two to one relationship is a reasonable reflection of the costs and that it would be sensible to restore the balance to that which it was before
may i have the approval of the meeting
anyone against
thank you very much
now
right as you know presentation of the r y a awards
is that in the way i'll just move it out of the way
a UNK for an r y a award major tom
the name of tom has been UNK with sailing in UNK longer than he might wish to remember

ma'am philip
right my item ten of course is any other business
is there any other business
i have to i have to make it er perfectly clear that it is not part of the official business of the meeting
you're welcome to bring up wh c
your royal highness bob blackpool sailing club
i think my question will make it clear that i do understand that
what i wanted to say was that when i read the annual report i was rather surprised to find that there is no reference to the er report of the committee under the UNK of bob on the organization of the r y a and then i realized that it probably didn't come to the council till after the end of the year that we have under consideration but it did seem to me that it has some contentious and some very interesting and rather good points in it and i wonder if we could be told how the consideration of it is getting on
thank you
your royal highness it follows to me er council have debated the riding report er a lot of it they did not accept many of the ideas were referred back for further UNK and that is in the hands of the central management committee at the moment and we are proposing to develop the ideas and come back to council and the wh whole report is not forgotten
in the meantime organization changes of a management kind have been put into action at UNK so that certain changes very quickly can be made which reflect the spirit of the report for improved management but your officers and council are still considering the items that they feel n er should be UNK and developed
i don't the membership will want a revolution but what we do require is that evolution considered carefully so we don't stand still and keep our head in the UNK and i give you insurance that is what is happening
thank you
who was that
geoff suffolk water sports association probably manage is that better
you'll be on the record that way geoff
oh dear
i'm into this not famous er rubbish
er ma'am i think it would be helpful to pick up a point you made in relation to the r royal society of birds royal UNK r s p b
i think many of us in the hall here er realize that we're probably the second largest users of the waters after the UNK variety and it's very encouraging to realize that er there are some may i say green members of council and its committees er who are very UNK
at a recent meeting of the i believe the first of the UNK management committee meetings for the UNK and the UNK i was approached by the r s p b representative and was delighted to be asked how soon is the UNK that we're jointly publishing coming out and i said oh that's a jolly good idea what's happening and he tells me that the r y a's name is to be published with the r s p b and this can do nothing but help our image as we will all appreciate in here perhaps we need to remember that the gun clubs call themselves the gun and UNK conservation societies the wide wise wild UNK call themselves the wild UNK and conservation societies perhaps we should be the royal UNK and conservation society and join in with that r s p b publication for i believe quite a very small sum relative to the total UNK
thank you ma'am
thank you
so do
no send i think chairman and erm
UNK general purposes
UNK general purposes may have
thank you ma'am i did er put this with this request before council and it is going through the er proper channels shall we say and we'll be going ahead
thank you
your royal highness it is it is it is interesting that when i attended the annual general meeting last year of the boats organization the fact that i said that UNK was a con conservation body as well surprised them and since that time we have having UNK with them er more and more and this is to be welcomed because we all want to sail in nice UNK
hear
roger UNK mud club and i kid you not erm
we are a group of beach UNK
it's following on from what geoff was saying er and i think it's perhaps worth mentioning something about coastal zone management and estuary management
erm in the last year or so erm one has been confronted with this idea which has been promoted from certain quarters that the water space is entirely UNK
all these people that tear about on the water on a sunday don't know what they're doing and are in desperate need of someone to manage them
i have however pointed out that there are things like UNK charts UNK systems harbour regulations etcetera which is a form of management albeit self management
i will give you an example of what one might be confronted with in the future from a piece from the environment committee in the house of UNK report on coastal zone planning and management and it says here we fail to see what is UNK about treating the UNK as UNK land an opinion shared by the royal town planning institute no less and if planning authorities can deal with issues like public rights of way UNK multiple use on land they should be able to cope with rights of navigation and UNK of sea
now i have considerable respect for the house of UNK environment committee but i think on this occasion they must have been tired and emotional when they wrote that
the point of issue is that estuary and coastal zone management is a reality and what seems to be happening is all sorts of different plans are popping up on various UNK and geoff knows them well now because he's been involved with the one on the UNK and UNK and what is happening is that these are starting at local level so the first contact with sailors may be from a local authority or someone at local level
so it may be the regional association or perhaps the local estuary er sailing association is first contacted and what will happen er when one is contacted is that you will come into contact with UNK and UNK and not all UNK and UNK are quite as af UNK and UNK as i am some can be quite UNK and therefore there will be the need for a considerable amount of lip UNK and self restraint
er in fact i think john perhaps ought to introduce a course of self restraint for estuary management UNK erm so that they can have er some pre training before they go into this forum
i of course will be available to er UNK abuse at these people
so that they are fully trained and ready to handle the problems that might arise erm there is however cause for some er optimism and i refer specifically to the UNK page from the UNK consultation document from english nature and in one of their er proposals and objectives they say encouraging self regulation and UNK of code of practice by local clubs and groups to avoid UNK conflict with and or UNK to other users including nature conservation interests
now if that is really saying to the water users that it's down to you there are genuine concerns of conservation and i think they are there is a real problem in some areas
the important thing is for people to listen to the genuine concerns sort out the real issues from the power politics and then hopefully go forward in a in a manner of UNK
perhaps in closing erm i would just er repeat with your permission ma'am er a piece from your nineteen ninety er presidential address and it says as UNK we must care for the environment it is fair to say that most do but images are created by the bad news
people who have grown up with the sport when the pressures were not too great perhaps do not always think of others
our craft are mostly environmentally friendly and those with craft that are less so will have to think seriously about improving them
i feel that if we are not careful outside pressures with no understanding of people's responsibility in their own areas would get involved which would be a shame from everyone's viewpoint
i think that's extremely true and extremely sound advice and i hope we can go away today bearing that in mind
thank you
the questions
was there a question
i was rather UNK that anyone had paid any attention to what i had said
excuse me for that er actually erm and i am grateful to you for pointing out really an area which is always going to cause erm a degree of difficulty
i rather like your idea of a course
i think it would come in useful for people in all sorts of areas
erm particularly with planners but there is no doubt and i and this is no joking matter that there are an awful lot of agencies of one sort or another who are finding that they are actually having to get on with other agencies
in some areas this is called multi disciplinary which is a good word but it it's a bit formal but it does it's just as difficult for them everybody's been used to w UNK in their own little areas under their own headings not least of course the UNK who are particularly good at it because it makes life easier
the exercise of UNK with the other people even though they're in the same relative area than in this case it may be use of facilities for leisure is not very easy and there may be a very good cause to have a proper course in how to get on with other people in these sort of cooperative UNK so thank you for drawing our attention to it is an UNK would be an interesting exercise to
was there another hand up over
your royal highness chairman UNK members i'd like if i may to say a few words on behalf of the r y a UNK foundation
now this is your charity it's called the r y a UNK foundation and it does have close links with the r y a but it is independent and is d is dependent upon raising money from donations and other sources like that
we have had a very good year thanks to the UNK bugs sitting behind me who is either fitting the boats out or going to new UNK to win races or taking guide dogs for the blind sponsored trips round greek UNK er everything comes to him readily
we have had a wonderful year
in new UNK er our team got a gold and a silver UNK in the world blind sailing competition and if you think of what that is in that was involved in achieving that er it is a very great matter
much thanks to john and many others in the r y a who helped with training and preparing er that er UNK and then in the world disabled UNK in UNK kevin who has one of our UNK in which he's been national champion seven times
he won the gold UNK there thanks to and a rather curious operation of the rules
i think it's fair to say he's the first one to acknowledge that but he did win the gold UNK and as a result he became UNK of the year and at a time when there is very a much UNK interest in the problems of disabled and people with visual UNK it was a real boost for sailors who have those problems that we did so well during the year
another very important factor was that at the boat show the r y a announced that it was taking responsibility for the national coordination of all activities er for sailors with special needs that's blind deaf disabled and there are many organizations who are working in this field but the r y a is the coordinator
now the trouble is that we have been the victim of those successes
the charitable world as a whole as i'm sure many of you know has been severely hit by the recession er our donations received this year are dramatically down on last year's and we operate on a UNK but the provision of teams to go round the world the provision of training even with all the help we get from the r y a still costs a lot of money
it would be absolutely disastrous if after the excellent work that's been done this year we were not able to maintain that
so what we have done is we have started something called UNK which is a word that bugs made up erm and what it is it's an attempt to get UNK clubs sailing clubs all round the country to do something themselves for the sea mission foundation
we don't mind what it is it might be a parent race it might be a UNK it might be an UNK
i hope it will be in all your club bars one of our bottles we have distributed special bottles er UNK proof bottles i hope they are er which you put money in er very simply without any UNK and i do hope that all clubs will use those bottles and gather lots of money
now we've distributed to over a thousand clubs
we don't need all that much from each club to keep us UNK but if we don't get your help i am very concerned that in the present recession we shall not be able to keep up our work and in conclusion your royal highness perhaps i could just say that the UNK foundation is very grateful to the r y a to the treasurer chris and particularly to the senior managers who have done everything they can to help the foundation thank you
thank you very much well it's always a pleasure to hear of about the UNK foundation and i'm sure that as you might be saying and er the need for the UNK will be rather UNK this year as a result of last year's drop but i'm equally sure that you will get a tremendous amount of support from the members and on that note which i think is er also is an important method of concentrating our priorities and on the basis of we're extremely lucky to be able to pursue a really very enjoyable UNK with relatively few problems and that if we can get those opportunities to many more who would otherwise not be able to enjoy and in fact frequently don't get to enjoy any other UNK we should endeavour to do so and consider ourselves lucky that we can
thank you
there are no more questions
your royal highness sorry your royal highness er before we ask you to close this meeting i would like to ask our members to show their appreciation for the wonderful way you have UNK this annual general meeting for your presence here and the gracious way you support the sport throughout the season
will you join me with UNK for our president
thank you all very much indeed and thank you particularly for making an effort to come and join us at the a g m apart from the fact that it would be UNK in the extreme to look at an empty room i do understand
that it's easy and it's never quite the right time for everybody and this is er tremendously widespread
we do appreciate the efforts you make to come to the meeting and in case you were worried the bar will be open in the oak room now
erm it's an UNK and it gives you a sense of freedom
i don't want to do anything too UNK i just like erm the sound of the water on the boat wind in the UNK
you can be as serious about it as you want to be
it stops you sitting on the beach and just doing nothing all summer
and i've been out of there for three hours and loved every minute of it
you can go from being a total UNK to someone who's got a reasonably good idea by the end of one week
when you're on your own you will UNK in it it's a really good feeling
all these people have discovered a passion for one of the most popular UNK sports sailing and as you can see you can take it up at any age
now sailing UNK sailing and ocean UNK and if you've got millions of pounds to spend you can enter the UNK or the UNK cup but whatever level or whatever part of sailing you want to take up the basic techniques are best learnt in a UNK or sail boat because it's less expensive and a lot more simple to operate and that's the purpose of this video to learn the most basic techniques as quickly as possible and to be at one with the wind
now since i take to water like a duck does to orange UNK i UNK the help of suzanne here because if there's any UNK in the water to be done i'd rather she did it and not me
that's alright by you isn't it suzanne
well it seems just a little bit unfair but i'm sure i could put up with it
well we're in the fabulous UNK of UNK and as well as being a wonderful holiday resort it's also recognized by the royal UNK association as a training centre
now since i've just about learnt the difference between the sharp end and the UNK end of a boat i've decided to go straight to the top and get some expert advice from the r y a and who better than the r y a's national coach john hi john
hi
first of all what exactly is the role of the r y a
well the r y a is britain's national authority for the sport of sailing simple as that we look after every aspect of sailing and UNK but our particular role in training is to set the UNK pre to the courses to train the UNK and to make sure the standard of teaching in every centre is up to scratch
that beautiful white sail belongs to a topper doesn't it
now why do the r y a specifically recommend these sail boats
well we know that a lot of UNK are put off by the complexity of larger boats and one great advantage of the topper is that it's so quick to raise and easy to sail so great for UNK
the second point is that the UNK hull is made of UNK which is remarkably tough and UNK
now that's important for sailing schools dealing with a lot of UNK
it's also important for the first time buyer
right i'm convinced such a good breed and you very kindly UNK this topper up for me so well you won't mind if i take it for a spin will you
just hang on a minute
i know i said it's easy but it's not that easy
before you go out there are some important safety considerations we should talk about and the first one is personal preparation
i think you're having me on now john
this is the UNK so why am i squeezed into this number
well in really warm weather a t shirt and UNK may be enough but as it gets UNK so you need to add layers of UNK trousers and top the whole thing up with a wind and UNK spray suit but all that can make you a little UNK so the answer for most british sailors is a UNK like the ones that you and suzanne are wearing
but why is mine slightly different to UNK
you're wearing the summer UNK for greater freedom of movement for your arms and legs but UNK got the full suit for more protection in UNK weather but they both work on the same principle
when the suit is wet it UNK a thin layer of water between the body and the suit and your body quickly UNK that up to a comfortable working temperature but if you fall in when the suit is dry the cold water can be quite a shock and so a good trick in cold weather is to put the wet suit on in a hot shower and then over the top you wear a spray suit again to keep off the wind and to protect the UNK
right so exactly what are you wearing
well if you take this i'll explain
the dry suit is great for winter sailing because you can wear lots of warm layers underneath and the suit keeps them completely dry by means of UNK seals at the UNK and the neck but you mustn't forget about the UNK either
in summer you'll need a sun hat to keep the sun off and in winter don't forget that about a third of body heat is lost through the head so a warm UNK hat is great
bare feet are asking for trouble and so you need a pair of soft UNK shoes which don't slip on the boat
is wearing one of these suits going to help me stay UNK in the water
no you should always wear personal UNK when going UNK in a small sail boat
for larger boats a life jacket like this one is fine particularly if you are going further offshore but it's too UNK to wear in a small sail boat like the topper and so we prefer the UNK aid like this one
so it's probably just as well that i didn't leap off in your boat because er even in this climate i could have ended up pretty cold and miserable especially if i'd fallen in
well the thing is howard i don't think you'd have got very far if you hadn't understood how we put the boat together and so i think it's important that we look now into more detail at how to rig the topper
it seems have done that john's intent on making us a nation of master UNK and under these circumstances i think i'll adopt the old UNK women and children first so i'll it back john can show you how to rig one of these things alright come on
right suzanne now we're going to look at the various parts of the topper and how they fit together
right
we'll start with the hull
mm
one piece UNK all ready to go in the water
right
and we've got the files the rudder and the daggerboard
right then i know steer the boat i'm not quite sure what the UNK are for
that slots down into a hole in the middle of the boat but that just stops us drifting sideways
oh
then we've got the rig the mast comes in two parts the boom the sail and all the ropes to put them together
and you're gonna show me exactly how it's been fixed together are you
that's next
first of all we slide the top and the bottom of the mast together lining up the red dots and then we touch the UNK
the end of the UNK goes through the end goes through the end fitting and then we tie a little UNK knot in the end then we bring the other end of the UNK down and make it up tight on this UNK at the bottom of the mast
that holds the two halves of the mast together
yes
while we UNK it into the sail
okay suzanne keep on feeding it through
fine now we're ready to tie the top of the UNK to the top of the sail
there are a few knots that we need to learn when we're sailing
this particular one is called a rail turn and two half UNK it needs to be tight so that it doesn't come UNK when we're out there
okay suzanne now you had to UNK off the UNK to let me tie that last knot so if you could UNK it up again that will pull the sail up to the top of the mast
that's fine now all we've got to do is to tidy up this end of the UNK and tuck it out of the way
you will see that most sailors are tidy around the boat particularly with loose ends of rope and there is a very good safety reason
if you leave them lying around then you're liable to trip over them
fair enough
now before we step the mast we need to turn the boat more or less into the wind and that's a good chance for us to start thinking about where the UNK coming from
where's it coming from today
at the moment it's coming from over there
that's right so we need to turn the boat round and line it up like this
right
let's go
okay
it is nice isn't it
now your next feature of the topper is this special mast gate
we open it up like that slide the mast in slide it shut again put the UNK in
a little knot here just so there's no risk of it coming out and off we go
right
so that's how it works open it up and get the mast
you will probably find it easiest to slide the mast in at an angle like this until the collar fits neatly underneath the mast gate
at the moment the sail is only attached down its needed edge but before we can use it we've got to control it properly and that means to tuck it in the boot the UNK clip on here the down haul UNK on to the sail and is UNK through the UNK before we make it up on the UNK the position of the boom and hence the sail relative to the wind is controlled by this rope the mainsheet
the next thing to attach is the kicking strap or boom bang
this is used to control the twist in the sail and to stop the boom riding too high
at this stage you simply clip it on and leave it UNK
this other UNK is for UNK the out haul we'll come on to that in a moment
to attach the sail to the boom we have two UNK one simply holds the sail down to the boom whilst the other one the out haul is used to bury the tension on the foot of the sail
the rudder and tiller assembly simply slot on to the back of the boat but the important thing to remember is that the tiller must go underneath the rope force before the rudder is UNK on
otherwise the mainsheet won't be able to slide over freely
the kick up design at the top of the rudder means that it's particularly easy to fit on the beach
right that's it the UNK ready
so let's go UNK to look at how the basic boat controls work
okay suzanne before you go for your first sail there are a few things you need to learn about basic boat controls
the most important control is you the UNK are always set facing the sail
yeah
and so if you sit just a little bit further forward that's fine
now you steer a boat with a tiller here at the back and you always hold that in the hand nearest it
then if we hold this rope in the other hand and effectively that's our UNK
that's what pulls in the sail and makes you faster
now today because it's a little UNK we've rolled up some of the sail out of the way to make it easier for you
yeah
and so you could pull it in just until it stops flapping and then you'd be able to sail away and we'd never see you again
so before i let you go i think you ought to learn how to turn the boat around we call that UNK
it's quite a complex manoeuvre and so we'll break it down into the different parts that changing hands turning the boat around and changing sides
now we'll get the changing hand out of the way first because it's easier that way and so what we do is to bring the rope hand towards the tiller hand and then you can tuck it under your thumb pick up the tiller with the other hand now that's fine
now we UNK the turn by pushing the tiller away and the next thing to do is wait
this takes quite a long time and slowly the boat turns around
when the boom comes over the top of the boat then you can change sides sit on the new side UNK up the tiller and you're sailing away again
oh that sounds better
well we'll try that once more and then we'll let you go
okay
so the first thing we do is to change hands that's good push wait change sides UNK up the tiller look where you're going that's fine
great
you're ready to go for your first sail
oh
now it's only going to be a short one just out towards that UNK and when i call you can turn round okay
okay
okay come back to me now
alright let everything go fine you've become a UNK
now all we've got to do is teach you how to sail
this is our stable starting position UNK on the
the wind is blowing directly across the boat it's known as the basic two position
the sail is just flapping and there's no drive in it
it's flapping freely
to start sailing we simply pull in the rope that controls the sail that's the mainsheet
then we can sail off on a reach in either direction just as we saw suzanne doing
now let's watch that again
from the basic two position we pull in the mainsheet we start sailing away on a reach the wind is blowing directly across the boat and we UNK away
now to start sailing closer towards the wind we need to pull in the mainsheet pop the daggerboard down and then turn the boat gently towards the wind we reach the point where even with the sail UNK in tightly the front edge the UNK of the sail is still flapping that's as close to the wind as we can get and so we maintain a course to keep the sail full
now we're sailing at about forty five degrees to the wind
we're on the edge of what we call a no go area if we try to sail any closer to the wind the boat will come UNK the sail will flap and we'll slow down and stop and so the best we can make either side of the no go area is known as a beat
let's look at that again in practice
sailing along at forty five degrees to the wind the sail is in tightly and it needs constant adjustment on the tiller to stay on that right course because the wind is never totally steady
keep a look out for where you are going and watch the UNK of the sail
now we cross to the other side of the no go area but turning is called UNK and so to make ground for wind width we have to go in a series of UNK each time turning for about ninety degrees and see that the sail is kept full most of the time only flapping UNK as the boat turns directly through the eye of the wind
now let's look at the manoeuvre and UNK in more detail you will remember it's a sequence which involves changing hands pushing changing sides and then UNK up again
so the first thing we do is to change hands then push wait until the boom comes across and change sides and UNK up
sailing UNK is hard work so don't waste effort by letting the mainsheet out
keep the sail driving for as long as you can through the UNK
now watch this as we go through the tack the sail is driving for most of the time just flapping briefly as the sail turns through the wind
the whole thing becomes one fluid manoeuvre with power on for the maximum possible time
change hands push wait change sides UNK up and off you go
now what can go wrong
the most common fault is to be stuck halfway through the tack head to wind the UNK right in the middle of the no go zone and the UNK flapping
simply push the tiller away from you push the boom out and the boat will sail backwards and then pull the tiller pull the mainsheet and sail off again
if you get stuck remember push then pull
from the reach let's now look at sailing UNK
the first thing to remember is that as you turn the boat away from the wind you let out the mainsheet the sail only works properly at one angle to the wind and so it's essential to let out the mainsheet as you bear away
sailing away from the wind is known as running and you've got great freedom of choice in the exact course you pick you can even sail dead UNK
what we need to look at though is how we change course if that means moving the position of the sail across the boat
here we're sailing UNK and we want to turn left effectively so that means moving the sail across the boat without changing the course of the boat too much
there that manoeuvre is known as UNK but really it's as simple as that sailing UNK you don't have to change course very often unlike when we're sailing UNK with UNK but we need to show you a few more demonstrations about it in quick succession
like UNK a manoeuvre consists of a series of related movements change hands push change sides and UNK up again but the difference is in the tiller movement where you move the tiller towards where you were sitting so let's watch that again change hands push the tiller to where you were sitting watch the boom as it UNK across UNK up the tiller and settle on the new side
again change hands push the tiller to where you were sitting watch for the boom as it UNK across UNK up and sit down on the new side
in stronger winds the manoeuvre becomes a bit more lively and here it's a good idea to UNK the mainsheet to help the boom come across
there's lots of power in the sail all the time and so you will have to remain UNK
change hands push to where you were sitting UNK in the middle of the boat and UNK up on the new course
two last points before we leave UNK
always check the area you are sailing into to allow for the time when you will be facing UNK but when you UNK in the middle of the boat do keep an eye on the boom or you'll end up with a nasty bump on the head
by the time you've UNK you can sail in almost any direction and so it's now time to look at the five UNK for sailing well
sail trips maximum driving power from your route
boat balance keep the hull flat for maximum speed
before and after trip keep the hull level don't make waves
daggerboard position get the right compromise between drive and drag course wave good the shortest or UNK distance between two points
sail trim isn't simply a question of pulling everything in and forgetting about it as the sail works at its maximum at any one angle to the wind
on a beat that is with the sheet pulled in tightly but as we turn on to a UNK you'll see that we have to ease the sheet out so that the sail stays at the same angle for the wind
again moving from a reach towards a rung the boat effectively turns underneath the rig and the sail stays at that same angle
boat balance is simply a question of matching the UNK effect of the wind and the sail with your body weight
as the wind tries to tip the boat over so you counter that effect by sitting out
the aim is to keep the boat flat at all times so that it UNK over the water
in light weather you either keep the boat UNK or heel it very slightly away from the wind so that gravity helps to fill the sail
when the boat has UNK too far it tries to turn up into the wind and a lot of rudder movement is needed to keep it straight
that rudder movement equals UNK and so it's slowing you down it may look impressive being UNK over like this but i'd sail a lot faster if the boat were flat
let's look at that again when the UNK over that rudder movement causes a lot of UNK and that's just slowing you down
for an off trip is much the same the idea is to keep the boat flat with the bow UNK slowly across the water without too much bow wave and the water leaving the UNK very UNK
again without too much UNK
the most common UNK mistake is to sit too far UNK in the boat and that causes a great wrist a tail of to come up from the trunk
a far less common problem but one which is much more dramatic is if you put your weight too far forward
not only will this make the boat difficult to steer but if you try doing it too far you'll start sailing straight under water
now for the daggerboard position
the purpose of the daggerboard is to stop the boat drifting sideways
when we're sailing UNK the wind is simply pushing the boat forward and there's no sideways force so we don't need the daggerboard
we could lift it right out but it's easier just to lift it until it's just below the level of the boom so that it doesn't foul it when we're UNK
when beating the sideways force of the wind is at a maximum and so we need the daggerboard right down to get a good grip on the water and stop the boat drifting sideways
when reaching it's a compromise between those two extremes halfway up and halfway down
now to see just how effective a daggerboard is let's look at these two boats beating
the one on the left raises the daggerboard and immediately starts to UNK off away from the wind
he is still trying to sail the same course but the boat is just sliding sideways across the water
course made good means sailing where you want to go as effectively as possible
the first thing is to remember is that no daggerboard is completely efficient and so if you try aiming for a goal point you'll actually end up slightly UNK because the boat would have UNK sideways
the way to overcome this is to sail slightly high of your intended course and you'll end up in the right place
this effect is most pronounced when you're beating
sailing UNK involves UNK and here you have a wide choice of routes to reach your UNK goal point
you could reach it in two UNK or in many more
the route you actually take will be influenced by things like the tide UNK like shallow water or other boats and by wind shifts and wind UNK from the land
all other things being equal the most direct route is the best
sailing UNK it seems most logical to head straight for your goal point but in fact particularly in stronger winds sailing UNK can be slightly uncomfortable
it's better to sail two UNK courses to get down there but this if you choose where to UNK to reach your goal point
launching with an offshore wind is a straightforward process
first simply lift the boat into the water but don't let go at this point because you'll find that the boat will drift faster than you can swim after it then you lift the daggerboard here halfway down because you'll be sailing off wind
then lower the rudder for control when you're sailing away and gather the tiller and mainsheet in one hand
step in gently and push the boom out to help the boat turn away from the wind
as the boat picks up speed so you can settle gently into the boat to gain control
that's it you're away into deep water and sailing happily
returning in an offshore wind is slightly more complicated as you have to beat back towards the beach
look ahead to choose where you want to land and try to judge the depth of water raising the daggerboard as you come into UNK water
make allowance for the fact that you'll be drifting sideways more with the daggerboard up but as you come into shallow water then you can raise the rudder and step ashore
then you can lift the rudder completely take the daggerboard out and lift not drag the boat ashore
taking it far enough up the beach so that it doesn't blow away again
launching with an UNK wind demands a positive approach
walk the boat out until the water is deep enough for you to put the daggerboard down far enough so that you'll be able to sail away
push the rudder down prepare everything because if you get it wrong you'll be straight back on the beach again and then climb in and sail away
choose the tack which takes you most directly offshore and when you're clear and only then it's time to worry about the technique by getting the daggerboard the rest of the way down and sailing efficiently
returning with an UNK wind is potentially the most spectacular of the lot
if you don't do something you'll sail straight up the beach and rip the bottom out of the boat
so as you come in raise the daggerboard lift the rudder and then when you come into shallow water turn the boat up towards the wind to lose power for the sail and stop before you hit those rocks
then as before step out to the shallow water lift out the daggerboard raise the rudder completely and lift the boat ashore
now we've covered the basic techniques of sailing the best way of putting them into practice is by sailing round the UNK course and so i've laid out these three marks
we'll start down at the far end of what we call the UNK mark and from there you'll have to tack all the way up to this closest one the UNK mark
from there it's a reach out to the far end to the wind mark drive there and back to the beginning again
great
we'll try it a few times just to put it all into practice
okay let's go
that's fine
okay
okay howard this should be a good test to see how much she's learnt
over she goes
no she's let out the mainsheet to UNK wind and now she's under control again
it's quite a steady tack around the UNK mark now that she's reaching she should have raised the daggerboard a little
now ready for the UNK
no i don't think she's ready quite yet she's got a few things to sort out first and that's definitely not right she wants to raise the daggerboard not lower it bit of confusion there about which way to turn the tiller but she's round safely she should be looking where she's going now instead of sorting out all the string
okay now she's off really quickly on a reach but she's UNK she's got too much power there she's UNK the sail in instead of UNK it out until it UNK and then just pulling it in a little
should suzanne have let the sail out like that
no by letting the sheet go she lost power
after the tack she'll have to put it all in again to UNK away
now sitting out to balance the wind
that tack looked okay
yes but she doesn't need that bundle of mainsheet in her hand
for this part of the course she should have the daggerboard right down and she could be sailing in slightly UNK towards us
whoops
what happened there
well she let the boat heel so far before UNK out that the boom hit the water and wouldn't go any further
she recovered by leaning out more
UNK got a good sense of balance which is always useful when you're sailing now let's look at this UNK to see if it's any UNK
oh yes that's much better
wow she's really taking off now
yes the wind is stronger out there
considering she's only been sailing for a couple of days she's doing very well
if she were more nervous we'd have reached the topper
she's still a little unsure on those UNK she's UNK out the mainsheet as she goes round
it's not dangerous but she loses power
at least she's got the daggerboard down there
i see she's sailing more efficiently to UNK
well it looks as if suzanne is beginning to relax and enjoy it more now
she certainly is after only a couple of circuits her confidence is growing
she's acting more naturally to the UNK leaning out and then UNK out the sheet
it's all becoming a more natural process
well how was that
it felt absolutely
you did very well
oh thank you very much
UNK
this is the part of sailing which every UNK
the UNK on its side in the water and you're nowhere to be seen but in fact it's all quite straightforward neither the boat nor you can sink and it's simply a question of pulling the boat back UNK again and carrying on sailing
a deliberate UNK is part of every UNK course
once you've tried it you'll lose all its fear for you
this is the easiest way of turning the boat over to tack without moving
swim clear of all the ropes swim around to the back of the boat pull the daggerboard down and then simply flip the boat UNK again
with the topper you'll find that there's very little water in the UNK and so you can start sailing almost immediately
with a little more confidence you barely need to get your feet wet
if the boat UNK because it's UNK simply UNK into the high side until you end up standing on the daggerboard
then lever the hull UNK again and UNK back in it's as simple as that
the worst thing that can happen is for the boat to become totally inverted and here you need to slide the daggerboard quickly out before it drops through the hull
now the accent is on patience
just think of the resistance to the sail dragging through the water
you have to pull very slowly and carefully try to UNK it and you'll bend or possibly break something
once the UNK breaks through the surface everything happens far more quickly you UNK in and you're ready to sail again
if things go UNK wrong and you're a long way from home and need to call for help the most effective way is with an orange smoke UNK
if you see one of these from the shore phone the UNK
even if you're UNK you might need to call for assistance
perhaps you're exhausted where you've had a gear problem
while you're waiting roll the sail up round the mast
that will reduce your rate of drift and avoid the risk of further UNK
so you tie it up neatly out of the way
then you can signal for help in the approved method raising and UNK your arms slowly
it may be UNK but keep UNK until you're absolutely certain that somebody has seen you and is on their way
as the rescue boat approaches prepare to be UNK by taking the daggerboard out and get your UNK ready to pass to the rescue boat
this is more my kind of sailing rescuing UNK in distress
rescue boats are extremely important
good sailing centres will have at least one and certainly the r y a ones do and they're important because if UNK get into difficulties out on the water you need to be able to get to them as quickly as possible and it also gives them a sense of security to have one of these things around
are you alright like that
the get her into shore
so you've shown us all the basic techniques of sailing and more importantly how to get yourself rescued should things get out of hand but apart from the dubious pleasure of UNK are there any other ways of getting thoroughly wet
as with any other sport howard the real UNK of sailing comes when you're going faster and that can certainly mean getting wet
in our case the wind is the driving force so let's now look at strong wind technique
in strong winds we don't want UNK to be UNK and so we reduce the sail area that's known as UNK
okay so how do you do that on this
on a topper it's very simple
you simply ease off the out haul take the UNK off completely and then we rotate the mast then just wind the sail up
when we've finished we tension the out haul and put the kitty strap back on
well that thing's pretty easy if you're doing it on the beach but what if you're out in the water and it suddenly UNK up
just how easy is it to do that
well it's always better to reef ashore if you can but if you do get caught out you can reef UNK just the same
i remember the time i was out there struggling in a strong wind the boat was definitely UNK
i had to use a lot of rudder to keep sailing on a straight course
if a boat UNK right over it's not good for the boat and it UNK you down it is far better to reef the technique is just the same UNK as it was ashore
roll the sail around the mast until it's reduced in area
in these conditions i wanted to get rid of about a third of the original sail area and so that's it now i'm sailing much more happily instead of struggling against the boat i'm sailing in harmony again
the excess sail is rolled up neatly around the mast out of the way and still i've good a good sail shape
that means i can sail happily UNK or UNK in perfect control the whole time
that's to an expert UNK to reef wasn't it because of course the stronger the wind the more exciting the sailing
absolutely so if we move over from UNK boat over to mine we'll see some of the fittings which make the boat go faster
okay
right so what have we got here
well this UNK fitted with the race pack which gives it a lot of the extra controls that you'd expect on a larger sail boat
first of all we've got the kicking strap three to one purchase the down haul has a three to one purchase and the out haul that's got a four to one purchase
it all sounds a lot more complicated now aren't you just making extra work for yourself
no in fact it makes life easier
three to one four to one that simply means that it's that much easier to pull everything in
the scale along the boom there one to ten what does that mean
well that's for consistency of sail setting
if you know that for your particular weight and the certain wind strength you want the block next to number four you keep it like that all the time
you can always go straight through it would be right every time
yes
in your enthusiasm to get UNK in a good UNK it's easy to forget about getting the right sail shape and the effect can be dreadful
just look at this the sail is far too full for the conditions the foot is UNK out and the UNK is UNK which has got too much power there it's a bag of wind
the general rule is if it looks bad it probably is bad so let's get it right
first we tension the foot and then the UNK until we get a properly shaped UNK
another classic mistake is to forget to UNK the UNK strap for boom bang
when you're beating it doesn't matter because the boom is held down by the mainsheet
if you don't tension the boom bang when you're sailing off wind the boom will just lift the sail roll twist and you'll get bags of UNK power
the way to UNK it is when you're on a beat just pull it in as the tension is taken by the mainsheet
what are so special about these racing birds of a
the other thing we've got is a UNK block on the UNK
what does that mean
i'll tell you
hear that noise
aha
that's a UNK the sheets so all the load is taken by the block and i'm just holding it
that means that you can sail for longer
strong winds without getting tired so it's a lot more fun
it's also pretty wet but with the UNK block taking the strain out of controlling the sail i can concentrate on technique and having fun and respond to the UNK by UNK in or UNK out if i'm UNK and moving UNK in or out to suit the
even with the boat sailing flat a certain amount of spray goes aboard so get the UNK down to drain the UNK
the daggerboard is raised slightly from the same position in lighter winds because the UNK sailing faster
if the wind drops a bit then you can sit UNK more to keep the boat flat
this is what sailing is really all about
it's not a struggle you're UNK the elements and having fun
sailing UNK works the boat over the waves gently
well it really looks as if you're having a lot of fun out there john but you are an expert
now i'm sure that screaming along with fifteen knot in a force six is really exciting but for a UNK like myself it's certainly not on
as i suspect it's not for many of the people here
well sailing is what you want it to be
for some of us it's UNK our strength against the elements for others it's UNK our UNK against other people by going racing and yet other people seek UNK by exploring new sailing areas and the beauty of a small sail boat like the topper is that you can do all of these
in UNK waters like the channel islands you must find out what the UNK are doing
that means looking up the tide tables to see the times of high and low water and the UNK stream list to find the maximum rates
in tide free waters like the UNK we don't have the same problem but we still need to consult a chart to find out a suitable location for sailing
that may be affected by the UNK wind and we'll have to find a suitable launching site
well this is a beautiful boat
presumably we can just go and load rig up and away we go can we
well almost in this particular bay it's fine we know it's a public beach we've checked on the map
it's a different matter if you're sailing inland because most inland water is owned by somebody
what about the er winds here
well here we've got an UNK wind that's perfect because we know that if we get into trouble just get blown back ashore
it's different if the UNK offshore because then it can be UNK close into the shore and further out bigger waves and if you get into trouble you're lost out to sea
right well we're all set
fancy a sail round here suzanne
i think it sounds pretty good fun i think we should go for it
right
let's go
let's go
fun
doesn't actually seem to be a lot up there are you sure we've brought everything
yes that's the beauty of the topper we've got the sail in the bowels of the boot and everything else is on the roof
in fact when i keep my topper at home over the winter they just lift the whole thing up into the roof of the garage keeps it right out of the way
so all we've got to do now is to UNK everything and go sailing
now that you've learnt to sail on your own the next step is to sail with other people
that probably means buy a boat and joining a club
if you are of a competitive nature most clubs provide the opportunity for you to start racing and there's no faster way into a pretty good technique than by sailing against more experienced people
if you have no intention of racing every sailing club offers a safer and UNK area to continue your sailing
having learnt to sail in a sail boat like the topper you can move on to more complex boats with confidence or continue to exploit the UNK and convenience of this single UNK which has become the best selling sail boat in britain the one design nature of the topper due to its injection UNK hull is perfect for racing and UNK values remain high
like every other lively class the topper has an UNK association which UNK open meetings national and international UNK
i'm beginning to realize why perfectly UNK people pitch themselves at the mercy of the elements miles from the security of UNK has provided the perfect resort for our first events of the
thanks to the excellent facilities here at UNK sailing
thanks also to the r y a and particularly to john
the r y a UNK course has certainly got suzanne here sailing with confidence in no time at all
it certainly has
well you look as if you're UNK to go and show us what you can do so i'll give you a push up and away you go
bye
i haven't managed to escape there i'm glad just to get on the pitch
now erm i haven't been to a match lately but these pictures i've seen there's still all these UNK around to stop people doing that
erm what is the situation in our own UNK
well we don't have UNK but erm we are the regulatory authority but the county council are the regulatory authority for the sports UNK
the fire service have the delegated authority for them and the situation in our local sports events is quite adequate
there's work that needs to be done in most of the major sports grounds but that's proceeding and there's if you can imagine that there's in shrewsbury for example a lot of the work which we would want to be done on the grounds have been less than enthusiastic about doing because they're likely not to be there for very long
but and i have no concerns about sports ground sale we've regulated the numbers because they had some concerns about the and that itself has caused 's fellow supporters some problems but we've actually restricted the number of people who can use the sports ground
right so they're game heavy you think
i wonder if it's free to them
only people that the gate can know the christian names of are allowed in
i have here a comments that there wasn't any point in really restricting the numbers
i think they'd have three now as well as david
councillor
i'll i was just going to say chairman i too am very concerned really about the number of premises where it is advisory to the district councils or advisory to
bearing in mind the number of private nursing homes that spring up and erm er i mean the sort of privately run places er presumably the local authorities have to give them a licence to run but is there no way that it can the fire service can our officers go and make an inspection
clearly they have no power to do so even if somebody asks them to somebody from outside for instance erm and also when they do get a fire certificate is there a display for it
or stuck in the back of an office or could they have something sort of glossy like the half kingdom tourist board stars that they can put on their windows to let people know that at least that particular nursing home or whatever establishment it is has been duly UNK by our fire services
i mean otherwise one assumes simply that people don't know
mm well th the answer to the first question is that no we don't have any authority to enter premises like that where we haven't been invited unless somebody has identified a potentially dangerous condition
section ten of the fire precautions act gives me the power to inspect any premises where we believe there is a threat to life other than domestic premises
and there are certain circumstances in which we can do that
it also gives me the power to UNK or restrict the use of those premises until those conditions are UNK
in that document there is a very strong reference to the fact that power should be either restrictive or removed and that there should be a right of appeal against it which would effectively prevent us from using it
in terms of nursing homes we don't issue fire certificates anyway we only issue certificates to offices shops building premises because they were under the act hotels and factories
so a nursing home hospital and school residential or otherwise is never UNK and any advice that we give is exactly that
it's not mandatory
that surely is of quite concern to people in some way UNK whether a place is considered safe or not
it's through social services or the area health authority
that is there responsibility
to keep the place from the fire authority as from others
yes mm
yes but they've got to have a you you've got to have a you've got
leaving aside their er ob sorry chairman
yes i'll come back to you sorry
just mention what i've heard the only statutory job he could do is apply his licence in
is the fire officer given every individual case where they apply for a licence over an old people's home and er this sort of thing
oh yes
and can't you keep it keep the fire officer when the UNK licence er if they don't carry out statutory duties as required
we i suppose it'd be like two levels that in the majority of cases we could say we recommend that you do not issue a licence
social services are really a help we could choose to ignore that i have to say that i'm not aware of that happening and i think it's very unlikely
because it would be a very dangerous thing for someone to do
the other element is that the county's are so dangerous and that's actually quite unusual they're so dangerous that we consider they present a risk and it has to be me that considers it presents a risk to life and i can either restrict the use of premises but i can UNK the use entirely
but as i say this says that an that's a relatively new and certainly UNK power and it's recommended in this document that it's removed
please
yes colonel
is this all these wonderful protection of animals dogs and horses and so on and pet shops and so on do does the chief fire officer think in his local knowledge that most of these have been UNK by his officers or does he get the feeling there that sometimes the district councils are not asking for these inspections
it varies a great deal depending on the district council
what i have to say really is that most of those premises present very little risk at all and i think that any change in the implementation of fire safety legislation should be based in UNK
now that's something that's difficult for us to do because the more dangerous the more erm the premises should present the greatest life risk are not necessarily the ones over which we have strict legislative control
i mean for example hospitals and nursing homes we have a purely UNK control over whereas we have a very rigid control over a signal box on a railway
now a signal box on a railway presents a fairly limited risk to life and a nursing home presents a fairly dramatic risk
yes jim or
chairman if someone doesn't come under the regulations and is operating a business or something of that sort is there the facility for that body either the management body or the business to ask UNK for you to inspect with a view to issue a er erm a certificate er erm of er safety
there's no
if anybody wants a fire certificate and we had a recent case where a UNK local solicitor asked us to issue a fire certificate and we refused because his premises does not require one or did not at that point require a fire certificate
then he subsequently moved one person from the ground floor onto the first floor which meant that he did require a fire certificate
but if it's not required by law then i cannot issue and if people ask for advice we are obliged under fire services the fire services act to give that advice but what i'm really saying is that with the pressure of work on the fire safety department it's likely that if it's a fairly low risk to life we'll never get round to it and that's the honest truth
that's on your statutory requirement
yes
so what you're saying is that if people er if people's UNK state i ought to try and do this but i'm not required by statute to do the chances is that a that you can't do it anyway but b you wouldn't have the facilities to do it anyway as well
we will normally get round to people
we do inspect
but we probably don't inspect and give advice to people who'd like us to because they're not a priority and we don't have the resources to do that
a lot of interesting points come out there haven't they
cap
if i could summarize if you could bear with me by saying that there is no UNK legislation which covers fire safety and there is no legislation which actually UNK it
what we have is picking up a UNK of stable door legislation that came out of other acts and that's why we have offices shops and railway premises from the UNK acts which were neatly UNK in the back of UNK act
hotels which were in the first days of making order and factories which came from the old factories act
and the cost or the potential cost of UNK particular like hospitals and similar premises is so UNK that the government has chosen never to implement the UNK orders for them
and i UNK to say it governments of all UNK assume it must be being done
someone move the recommendation
i will
yes
five point seven paper j fire and rescue service training
different board is the outcome of the p a g inspection
yes it seems it
i don't know mr chairman i think you've always been very keen on this trend and supported it fully
and i will support this number seven with recommendations
thank you there
we are moving on reasonably well on this issue
yes well we've got to
reasonably well yes reasonably well
then i hesitate to say that there's probably a more complex issue now even than the fire station erm the figures which are given incidentally are the original estimate there because that was what was available to us at the time
they have now been varied slightly but they make very little difference
a question that's already been asked of me on appendix c up at employee at the largest single figure there is a hundred and thirty seven thousand eight hundred
that's not a way of UNK some other cost the retained fire fighters are UNK when we provide training for them because they normally have to lose work or whatever
they are very expensive to train because of that
we train whole time fire fighters cheaply but we pay the retained people compensation for loss of earnings
that figure is the majority the majority of that figure is compensation for loss of earnings
that's the trouble you get cheap service from retained personnel but they're incredibly expensive to train
but absolutely essential
that's the only time you pay loss of earnings
yes
if they've taken off for a fire two days or something
they're going to get paid then
we pay them for attending fires
the only other time they're paid compensation for loss of earnings is when they're sick as a result of an injury received on duty you know fire brigade duty
well this UNK been moved seconded
yes
five point eight emergency planning are you going to speak on it or not
the UNK here
chair here
we move
there is one thing and i think i did take it with you erm mr chairman i'm with the erm i've forgotten what the question on UNK the thing that is concentrating many of our minds quite some but the er would the chief fire officer like to
yes well he s he did take it up with me as a er i mean you did take it up
i didn't complain i didn't complain i suggested it
no but what i'm what i mean what i said such as emergency services
now the emergency services are police fire and erm and ambulance
there's a fourth one actually but everyone knows who they are
so those do cover the police
i mean if the police and the ambulance service
could that just be UNK perhaps in by UNK it slightly to emphasise that because i think that
i think we all know what emergency services are
we know but
you don't i see
we do but there's no harm in view of our knowledge and experiences just to put that phraseology in a little bit UNK
i think mr chairman what i think i explained to you what my concern was that we have cases where there's a serious road accident and erm and the road is stopped we have no real authority to turn traffic or divert traffic but the police are the only ones that can and if we want to get down in into an emergency very quickly
i mean it's only by the good will of the police that we can get down there and that this is this is my concern mr chairman in theory what i would like if there was a serious emergency you'd get a senior officer in here straight away and i mean he would UNK to the police we have no authority over them only cooperate with the police
and that's my concern
well i
i mean they're you i mean they're very good but they do er a lot are UNK a law unto
oh i think all it wants is that paragraph UNK and with more strongly emphasis but on the lines on with that
that's all i think chairman i don't suppose that er you'll disagree with that will you
well i wouldn't disagree with it but i but i the description is perfectly plain to ensure that effective arrangements are established from liaison between the various departments of the county council and the appropriate organizations such as the emergency services
i know what the emergency service is i'm sure everybody else does
there's a fourth one that keeps UNK up on television but i mean we don't take that into consideration
but it's just police fire and ambulance services those are the emergency services
i can't see what the objection is to me making the paragraph stronger
no and i can't see wh no well i we made it i'm not against making it stronger but i can't understand why this suggestion has been made
well because of past experiences chairman that's all
let's make it strong i'm not UNK anybody just make it stronger
chairman i i'm really confused now i mean they've got me they've got me talking about semantics here which is ridiculous
what we're talking about is the emergency services that sh that UNK to the needs of those who are in difficulty or in distress
that's what we're doing and i can't see anything here that prevents er total cooperation between a the police b the ambulance service and c the fire services
i agree with you entirely
i think this is er semantics and simple UNK
the police have never i mean the fire officer will tell me has there ever been an occasion when the police have not UNK with the fire service in an emergency situation
no
no there's always room for improvement in liaison
come on we're talking about the job the job description really they're there to please er this is written by one man and er or one woman and we're just saying that the wording could be improved in that one little phraseology that's all
on the job description
it was put together by it was put together by the chief fire officer and the chief executive er not just the chief fire officer
right
i'm saying it could be improved i'm sorry
yes colonel
er most officers would have accepted it and moved on to the next subject
paragraph two was current solution to see the sort the place where the advertisers as widely as possible presumably based on the job description
here there's no salaries attached to it at the moment
erm do we know how big the department's going to be because that UNK the salary
where are we in relation to the sort of catch twenty two situation on this
the salary is stated
i i'd rather finish with the other question or the made by the major in the press question are you do you want to follow up the i mean have a vote on this if you want to
no
or is or do you think the wording is suitable or do you not
the UNK suitable
yes
i i'm dead easy i mean really it's a bit UNK being pathetic
leave it as it is leave it as it is
leave as it is and move on
right now c yes sorry well we'll go back now
the post is currently graded at p o five not p o six
after the exclusion of the public
can we discuss after the exclusion of the public
thank you sir
yes
clearly er it's er again in paragraph four under future budget of er the services is going to be critical if you've seen the last couple of years that are defined in the pay and that's going to continue
as far as the short term is concerned er part of the budget package in the current year er the retirement and the now proposal was to help up the side as regards that
now it's referred in item one of the introductory paragraph in the introduction about additional funding and i just wonder where is the total for this additional funding
is it from within the public protection committee's overall budget or is from elsewhere
if so no
well if we're going to start to go into funding i'd rather this went into the pink paper session and that we have our chief executives down here to explain that situation
i don't want to discuss this in open committee
agreed
yes
we'll put it as the last item
you have the situation
personnel five point one sorry five point one three is that right so
er five point nine i think chair
five point nine optimistic i'm getting terrible these days
just a little bit optimistic straight through to that
yes avoiding oh yes sorry
avoiding now what future for local emergency planning national conference
now i'm i might have been UNK on this but we had to do this in a hurry erm to get names in and but it's been suggested by erm the leader of the er conservative group on this committee that erm a member from each should major group should go and er i'm quite i'm quite UNK in favour of this if we can get erm bookings there now
i'm you know
my feeling is mr chairman it is an UNK er erm we're going
oh yes
into a new ground and er i think it would be very useful if we
yes i'm quite happy providing we can get the erm
erm i think i yes chairman if you're prepared to attend that if you're saying that
providing that they're not all taken
no well that's UNK and all but
you know it's yes
i don't know where it is
okay are you all agreed
yes agreed
are you going
who's on transport
i don't believe this gentleman
we'll check we'll find out before the end of the meeting
thank you for our er
i've got a better one than those
five point one oh annual inspection am i right now
yes ten
we know that mr chairman
five point ten yes
erm you're all aware of that
five point eleven fire safety week well that's gone past
it's quite useful
we played on a different part
five point one twelve brigade festival at UNK an absolutely superb evening in my opinion but somebody said it was bloody awful
er
well i think it was a marvellous evening
i think it was
i can think of one c comment chairman
the they ran out of er of carol sheets
we didn't expect c
it i had the initiative in getting a prayer book er a hymn book from the back which er after some concentration with the index or something to er
if you would pardon me on the sheet it's a shame mr 's not here because that was his decision because of the imposed cut in stationery from last year we ran out of it
come on come on
good for him
so he was UNK in a corner was he
yes
another criticism that i had was that it was far too elaborate and expensive programme i thought it was a very cheap one
we printed it ourselves
yes
the first one was
yes councillor
in spite of a lack of er sort of er carol sheets for some of us it really was as you say a very enjoyable evening and i was particularly erm keen on the introduction of saint UNK and it certainly got smaller children i think it was er fantastic and i certainly haven't enjoyed so er i'll be back
we UNK them out of er christmas presents which surprised me
but some of the children there erm somebody must have been very optimistic because we put a lot a lot of presents in there but anyway i think it was a superb night and the meeting of er to get together in the fire station afterwards quite in the price room was very good
okay
five point one three five thirteen fire brigade long service and public UNK ceremony
once again a very enjoyable evening erm i pushed into something that er i don't think she really wanted to do initially but she thoroughly enjoyed it at the end
chairman she did it er erm very nicely from the local
that's right that's right
the ladies concerned i think were very pleased er erm i do i think it's a very good idea erm to give a wife's UNK and er with all the UNK and we ought to provide money for them the amount of waiting about they have to do
a very good evening
and they never know when
yes
it was a nice gesture
a well organized evening
and where the beer did agree eventually i mean under slight pressure
there's a photograph of her and i'm quite sure we can give joan to give to vera one of those
yes thank you
i would like to see erm i don't know whether this is done but erm when the official photographs are taken they're done by erm newspaper area so that you get of the lord lieutenant the chief officer and the man from that area and that is sent to the local paper whether ah
in fact the local paper actually took photographs on that basis and they grouped them by
yes but erm but chairman er i don't think i should come up and make myself clear some local papers were not represented there
could they in future be sent
could the photograph the fire the fire fighter probably won't think of it could we think it for him or her
yes we're lucky with the photographer actually he's not a fire fighter er
he is now
he is now okay
er five fourteen paper l
don has erm been seconded to the home office for a period of two years
so i think we ought to congratulate him on that
yes
hear
and the other is the retirement of er divisional officer
could we just
twenty nine year service is a long time
can i be as could we be associated with that
oh yes well i this is a committee i'm talking about not just myself the whole committee
erm when i speak i speak on behalf of the whole committee
a letter will be written to both on that
yes oh yes
okay
chair in respect of what erm it's obviously it's er good for the authority that mr is er obviously but what will happen to his post right away and what will there be someone employed to actually fill in i know there will probably be some moving up er
yes we're interviewing so we're interviewing on friday for somebody to fill that post
on the dates that you've anticipated if mr comes back by that time we'll be able to absorb the post but it's likely that he may move on from this because it's a fairly substantial move up
in his next work when he leaves here he's going to be the fire service at the houses of parliament and i'm serious that will be one of his first major jobs
not to mention things as trivial as UNK castle and so forth
you don't sail that far down
will they listen to him i hope
you're next authority
chairman he won't have to it's like this he won't have to worry as they did when the UNK which caused the last fire in the house of commons i mean set fire to them and er caused that one
it's quite er it's quite a recommendation to de brigade though isn't it mr chairman
and quite an honour to the brigade
pardon
it's very prestigious it's very prestigious
yes and i think i thought of a personal note that because we do get some good appointments
as bad as we are
okay we'll move on
no i think it is well done
six quarterly report of chief trading standards erm paper marked m
yes
do you want to s UNK on it mr
no
no
no you're alright chairman
can we note this mr chairman
there's quite a lot of useful information in here
i hope you've all read it
yes
i have item paragraph one mr chairman is right to do with the work that has to be done
pardon
pardon
item one on m mr chairman the right of you with the amount of work that has to be done and the amount of they're asked for
oh yes okay
in growing demand or
six point two deregulation
chairman if i could just er erm some words that aren't included in this pa paper i understand that the deregulation bill is published on the eighteenth erm and presented to parliament for the first reading erm it's still far from clear what's going to be said in it but erm it's still widely expected that in fact on major contentious issues will in fact be the suggestion that sections of acts of parliament will could be revealed by UNK order rather than go through the parliamentary process again
so it's an important issue er of principle
the aspect to it is as i've made clear in the report i hope th they'd want to treat each erm one that comes out of government on it's me merits
er i make the point i think that erm we should oppose the er deregulation bill if it's based on providing deregulation by ministers because i think that's a constitutional point that is of great import but the rest of it erm are really sets of principles that i hope you'd agree to subject to amen amendment and dis discussion because the information that we got is that the consultation period is going to be very tight indeed and that it might not be able to go through the normal committee procedures in order to put things through erm with er proposals in that er in that respect
if they're relatively technical then i then i'd be grateful if they can be left to the officers but obviously if there's anything that erm is political in anyway big p or small p then at least we can get in touch with the er p a g and if necessary call a meeting in respect chair
but things are going to move on UNK and we need to a set of principles the officers can work to and i've put these down as a broad list erm for your consideration
i propose that mr chairman
all in agreement
yes
to the recommendations
yes
paper o
that's purely for information chairman
paper p UNK modified foods
i think the case is here is that er could have serious effects
that er chairman if i could say the thing that UNK me here is that it always has done about food is that we should be keeping up to date with information all these decisions and all this advice
that seems to me a basic requirement of er of all the sale of food
er it's been coming in gradually over the years but there's been an awful lot of er resistance by some manufacturers on what they say on their labels and what they say about what they're selling us and er if they're gonna do this and i'm getting a slight suspicion and i think mr is that it's got to be done eventually and we have to be able as a buying public to understand exactly what we're buying before we actually get it home
a chance to read and be informed as to what we're buying when we buy it
chairman it's always been this committee's policy over the twenty years the twenty odd years that i've been here back here UNK runner that erm so far as the food side is concerned er we should be our policy should be based on the information the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and letting people make up their own minds
it's not been for us to tell people what they should or shouldn't eat or do anything with because the in one respect that's a UNK attitude from er whether it's the UNK saying we're not going to approve the right legislation so that you have that information but on the other hand by manufacturers and others saying you trust us
well in the cases we've taken over the odd twenty years against some of the biggest companies in the world indicate that isn't the er position
so as far as the erm report is concerned er if i've got to make a recommendation because obviously people have got different views on this one it would be in fact that we go for total er information so that people can make up their own minds and if and it might be wrong but they can exercise their own prejudices
and if they want to exercise those prejudices that's a matter for them
erm so that that's the line that er from a personal point of view i would erm i would take but i would obviously want members' views on that one
the other one could i just correct something on the last line of er comment at the bottom of the bottom of page two
it says stock lives it should be stock lines
but they are also trying to include the stock live aren't they in some cases
not their lives
no it talks about the life as it's lying in store for instance
yes oh yes indeed
yes
anybody wish to speak or are you do you accept the recommendations
a question if i may
in the er appendix attached
yes
er there's talk about the er government waiting for the recommendations from the food advisory committee when are they due
it's come out too chairman that erm there's been an they dis they discussed that the minutes came out and erm what the committee decided shortly was the committee felt strongly that if the criteria for labelling were met the requirement for labelling declaration should be a statutory one
they did not consider that this could be satisfactorily achieved by other means such as non statutory UNK such as non statutory guidelines
er based on the evidence which the public consultation produced the committee considered that the primary concern of consumers was to be able to identify when a gene likely to be a cause of concern to a significant proportion of the population was present in UNK
this was reflected in the criteria which the committee recommended should trigger a labelling declaration
as far as the form of labelling was concerned they believed that what was required was a simple declaration such as contains copies of x genes in single UNK foods and foods sold loose they believe a declaration should form part of or UNK the name under which food is offered for sale
for pre packed foods which contain ingredients that contain copied genes it recommended that a statement should be required to UNK the name of the UNK in a list of ingredients
if a copied gene is present in an UNK which was under current rules it did not need to be listed the declaration about its presence should nevertheless be made either in the ingredients list or next to the name of the er food
and they went on then to consider lack of understanding of consumers about g m technology as a whole and made recommendations for erm er better labelling and for a erm information campaign to be launched as well
but they didn't actually recommend that it should be statutory labelling
yes
the point i'd make is that the difficulty of enforcement in that respect
it's one thing UNK it's a completely different ball game when you are erm trying to UNK enforce it and especially when you're trying to enforce it with ingredients imported from abroad
well when i say abroad i mean from the e c as well
erm you can look after your own factories in this country and you source ingredients but you won't be able to do that for anything coming ov coming overseas
and the major manufacturers erm there is a major trade in ingredients between the multi UNK as they pass things across
so the theory might not well work out in UNK practice
but i honestly can't come up with any solution in that respect because er until you've got er multi national enforcement agencies which no politician is going to agree to erm you're not going to solve the pro problem there
and if they think that it suits them to shift a factory to the UNK because there won't be an inspection there that's what they'll do
can you note this mr chairman
that's depressing isn't it really
very but there you go
that's life but we do what we can
and it's a statutory obligation in this country and that's really what you know
because we can't just accept that manufacturers will look after it for us because as you've already said by the chief they'll move the factory where it
i mean you can even get a situation chairman where you'll get some of the big UNK will tell a will agree specifications with a food manufacturer but they're not going to be able to check on the ingredients so even though the sainsburys and the marks and spencers of this world say we don't want any er gen UNK modified ingredients going into anything that we're going to buy there's no way that they can guarantee that before we've even bought any
having said that do we accept the recommendations in this report
yes
UNK for legal proceeding

it's for you mr
nothing to add er if members have any questions i'll be happy to answer them
noted
charity youth committee marked s
do we have a member er from that committee
yes chairman i am following in major 's shoes i don't reckon i know a great deal about it yet and i'm not sure that this erm er advisory er committee is yet actually on the go but i will go into this
the UNK block here does seem to be the UNK of the charity commissioners themselves to keep up with the volume of work
er i am mr chairman i support that fully because if you write to them it's six months before they'll reply
and you're wondering i mean i don't think we can expect of the advice of charities now or very little you know and they've got to be very careful
i was meeting the commissioners
pardon
i was leaving the commissioners out as far as i could
yes
it's a very UNK budget chairman i should think we're getting off very lightly
yes
item nine motion evenings and saturday meetings
i propose that we retain the status quo chairman
i'll second that
i second that
are you all in favour of that
yes
west UNK police authority paper c now you received this late
i'd be pleased to answer questions chairman and i'm sure mr will help me deal with the budget crisis
and i shall endeavour to
well that's all you've got in front of you at the moment isn't it the budget chairman
you have other things as well
are there any questions
pardon
are there any questions i'm asking yes i'm waiting for questions
can i make an observation mr chairman will you take observations as well
yes i'll take UNK why wait a minute
yes erm on paragraph three erm the last sentence erm where it says without direct access to its own balances the authority may therefore have to make revised UNK in ninety four ninety five erm i understand what's being said there but any organization needs to actually work within er a clearly defined budget
er the police authority last year i think actually had to have an extra nine hundred thousand pounds of spending the budget was funded by the UNK authorities erm and we've already for next year in fact made available effectively six hundred thousand pounds worth of extra spending by erm various means so i would hope that erm the authority does use as much UNK and restraint in its financial affairs as possible because of the effects on all concerned
yes chairman can i say that erm when the b the UNK in the process of UNK and we're discussing the question of balances and reserves and how they should be marked for the immediate future particularly in regard to the way that er reorganization may take place at police authorities in the very near future and also those of us who are on this on other committees who've had experience in and the same sort of thing happening in further education for instance where immediately the assets before even the regulations were put on the table the assets of all these things were all these er erm UNK the further education colleges were frozen so we couldn't do anything with them at all as an authority and er actually many of them were taken from us without er without any question at all
so in the light of that it's per now is a good opportunity to er make sure that those reserves and balances were available for a the er police authority should it require it but b to those constituent authorities who had helped in the er build up of these reserves
now what's being said here in that particular sentence is that there are obviously going to be or possibly could be occasions when er the police authority has er an overspend which is an immediate problem for instance on pensions and you've heard the er fire service chief talking about his problems
they're just the same with the police force there could be er an increase in police pay or there could be any a very large incident which would require planning if these happen then it has always been the case if there wasn't the money available then a UNK could be put upon us as a local authorities to er cover that erm directly
that's no different to what the situation is now it was there before the difference is that the UNK is different
the UNK is not the reserves of the police authority because that has now been transferred to the authority
i should tell you that er the budget really represents er an increase in the availability of police resources over the previous years
i'm delighted with that the budget came out er much better than i'd hoped it would do and er and i am sure that we shall see some improvement in the police er over the next year
of course there is there is the possibility there is definitely going to be a reorganization we shan't have the same sort of input i don't think we shan't be allowed to have the same sort of input in a totally UNK er authority that's going to be there where the governments will er put er most of the people on board where the home secretary will decide on the chairman er we don't know what the government regulations are going to say about balances in terms for the new authority
er if they say that er they should be er a balance or reserve put in by constituent authorities then we will have the money available to do that if we didn't then they may have frozen the reserves that are already there and asked us to put some more money in as well
i find that is the situation that i've tried to er guard against with the budget that we've been put in on this occasion and i hope that answers er mr but er i'll answer any other questions that are put up
thank you very much
could i say chairman in UNK and shropshire are in agreement with this budget and er which has been UNK to a great deal by the chairman of the budget and er we're here to
yes
i don't i don't mind worked out but UNK gives a very
regarding paragraph nine chairman no doubt you would tell us if there's been a response on this because this does seem a useless step forward er to increase the number of people at the UNK as it were and self financing and no doubt we shall hear in due course about this
the authority are pushing as much as they can on the scheme and there's been no response to yesterday
it's a crazy situation because when clarke was the home secretary and he made a speech in parliament we adjourned a meeting of the authority to listen to him speaking now we'd already made applications er to increase the number complete officers by the getting rid of the UNK and clarke came out with what we'd said yes do that but the home office are still saying no you can't
er i mean the whole lot separately
yes
i mean it's crazy
if i can comment on that chairman the erm the authority asked for thirty for next month along with all the other authorities i think in the country asked for an improvement in the in the policing the country and i think people that live in shropshire and the people that live in other er parts of the country as well would have welcomed the increase in the police force this year but the government decided not to do that
we then had this situation where the er the chief constable ha went to great lengths to er work out a new establishment for himself and the senior management and actually UNK and er and UNK it and then asked the er the home office if he could use the money to increase the constables on the beat
we are still waiting for them to agree or not to that
the feeling at the moment is that they are sympathetic towards us and they don't see any difficulty in that as yet but no one is prepared to put their hand up and say yes go ahead and spend the money in that way
but the money is in the budget chairman i want to make that quite clear the money is here in the west UNK police budget to be able to provide sixteen extra policemen immediately
police officers
policemen immediately that is given to us by the home office
i hope the authority unanimously do support it
yes i think chairman you ought to ask your committee to note paragraph six i think that's quite important and worthy of note
because we employ a lot of
can i record we've received this here mr chairman
move the reports received
yes
now it is recommended that we in section nine and four a in brackets four someone move
chairman can he just report to us
right
chairman if we can just go through this briefly
erm number thirty six
erm it contains access to four five and they'll be submitted after discussion at this particular committee to policy planning or the policy resources committee
as we've made perfectly clear in the last discussion we've just had no final decisions on the implementation of any variations will be taken until council meets on the twenty fifth of february
this booklet was distributed just before met so in fact er paragraph two does say at the moment that in our new recommended programme there isn't well in fact they did agree those recommendations
in addition though and we come on to them in a second it asks for further reductions to be added to that if possible
but the provisional UNK the guideline which was set by policy and resources in the first instance was just for this committee to identify seventy thousand UNK worth of reductions
those reductions were those identified in paragraph three and perhaps i do need to point out in fact that according to the report in policy and resources committee the use of carry forwards from the registration service of twenty thousand pounds in fact needs to be UNK across all three years
now quite clearly that has er implications on the registration service and believe the county secretary will talk about that at some future point
erm paragraph four erm UNK there is a gap after these new guidelines of six hundred and seventy one thousand and to bridge that gap the p and r asked that er the fire and rescue service identify a hundred thousand pounds of UNK of reductions from its budget
the UNK which is the additional item includes moves at policy and resources committee that they asked all committees to expose further reductions if possible to help close this gap of six hundred and seventy one thousand pounds
just find it on the kind of introduction
the other guideline which was issued was namely that of capital where the a accepted the general guidelines which appeared in the county papers and as far as this committee was concerned would mean the general acceptance of all those items which appear in that the first year of that capital programme subject to the UNK that the revenue UNK and the benefits of the capital programme will be considered by policy panel in its forthcoming meeting
as far as the introduction is concerned i have nothing more to say
i am unless there are any questions can we not then five move on to number five
er one question if i may chair
erm i note that on paper r earlier we er approved the recommendation to ask resources management sub committee to approve the release of three thousand of registration service carry forward monies and we're now being asked to approve our budget next year which er also reduces twenty thousand for registration service
can we be told please exactly what the er balancing hand of carry forwards shown on the right estimates the twenty three thousand consists of
are they what are those are registration services
that the thirty three thousand includes twenty three thousand of the registration services carry forwards but it does not take into account the three thousand which have just been requested here
so that would reduce it down to twenty
i just want to make sure we have the money now
if you if you like i could speak now chair
yes
er naturally we're disappointed you're proposing to take er twenty thousand of our twenty three thousand carry forwards in the registration service
the problem is as mr has said if that is expected to be UNK across future years this would represent a ten percent reduction in the statutory service er which is only partly under control of this committee with mixed responsibilities with the UNK general
seventy percent of the expenditure is on staff who you do not employ and cannot dismiss a large part of the income or all the income is through the fees that are set na nationally by the government
you have very little room for manoeuvre within this service and the UNK general has reserve powers to impose services on you and i would have to advice you it would be virtually or i would have to say it would be impossible to achieve that ongoing reduction in future years
erm does the chair wish er me to reach section by section or do you wish to take the bookings as they are chairman
well i think we've got to take it section by section
in that case the white page which isn't numbered at the back of page three is the revised estimate and shows the variations as outlined there
erm the only variations which are actually going outside the committee control are as a result of the internal market variations which are going on down
plus of course the growth in the UNK pension scheme of thirty one thousand in the current financial year rising in future years
otherwise the committee services are containing their budgets within original cash limits
if there are no questions on the revised estimates chair then the base budget for ninety three ninety four are those outlined on the green pages identified it certain service by service
it's on these figures which in effect any committee reductions will be made
i have nothing further to say on the green pages
do members have any questions
okay does anybody
before you go on you say that the twenty thousand can't be rep UNK in income registration column does that show how would show in here then
it doesn't show it doesn't show in here no
if the registration service was erm asked to ma to reduce its budgets for ninety four five and future years by twenty thousand it could do it in to three four five because it would bring forward twenty thousand pounds worth of carry forwards
however in five six its net expenditure would reduce to erm two hundred and twelve thousand pounds
and from what county secretary's just said we would be unable to identify reductions in statutory service to live within that cash and
the salmon pages then chair are those items which have been put forward to achieve the guidelines set by policy and resources committee
in additions i would remind members of the request from policy and resources to try and identify wherever possible further savings in aid of the six hundred and seventy one thousand pound gap which currently exists between budget proposals and the expected figures
any yes mr
a couple of comments on that chair the first one on the reduction in carry forwards my understanding is that in fact it's quite amusing in some ways because this is something i was accused of as chair of resources management during my year
er what in fact this committee is doing is saying that at one of the sections that makes up part of it you happen to have carry forwards spare from last year therefore use them because we can't identify anything else in budget savings for this next year
erm that isn't necessarily the same as saying by the way your section will have to repeat that saving in future years
i think it's quite legitimate for this committee to take that twenty thousand because it's there and to say to itself post budget we will have to look at the whole of the areas covered by budget protection to find the UNK twenty thousands in future years and not just expect it to come from registration
erm from the comments from the table that seems to be generally agreed
yet the point it's a question really which refers back to the last programme summary three of the ninety four ninety five base budget
within that we're we identified a gross expenditure and a gross income across all areas of the committee's work
now clearly some of those are outside our direct control
nevertheless there's five hundred and fourteen thousand as our income that the fire and rescue service the fire training unit from the trading standards department and from emergency planning
my question is has the p a g looked at any ways of increasing any of that income to any degree at all
and if so what were their findings
we have reviewed charges on and the fire service erm in the past and we've increased certain erm but we didn't see any way we could we could increase any more at that time
so far as trading standards is concerned chairman the major income are weights and measures testing fees and they are set down by UNK that's local authority courts on UNK on trading standards on er an agreed scale so we charge exactly the same as other authorities for the same for the same work and we increase the fees every year er in line with erm the recommendation
er the amount that we get in depends on erm the amounts of trade and industry
we've done relatively well in the past couple of years because we've had a lot of petrol pumps because of the new the opening of the big UNK the supermarkets where there's thirty forty pumps go going we make a fair bit of money in that way
but you can't guarantee that er and once the supermarket developments er have gone then you'll drop off down again and again you're affected by the UNK recession whereas people won't replace things like UNK er automatic weighing machines that sort of thing during the recession if you come out of recession then you might get and you say you might get some increase in fees in that area
but those are always considered er during the erm er revised estimates time in any way
the other one and that erm the major source of income are court costs and again that depends on the cases you're taking it depends on the on the amount awarded by er magistrates
over the years we've taken the risk to increase the UNK costs erm where we've got agreed pro er principles and we've b we've been able to go to the courts and they've agreed with us for instance standard fees for UNK vehicle cases we charge seventy pounds a time
er and the courts by and large agree to erm give us the seventy pounds out ev every time but even so even if we get the award of the costs then the difficulty is in getting those costs in
erm it's up to the UNK clerk and sometimes the first
so it's in the fire service that we've actually got time posted and in fact most of the things that we wish to charge for we're actually UNK from doing
things like false alarm calls and so on have been through the courts and we've been stopped from doing that
we charge the highest rate in the country for issuing fire certificates which is one of the few things which we're actually allowed to charge and we charge more than virtually any other authority in this country
the trouble about that is it's now enforced upon us and that's official target we have to set priority of fire certificates because we need the money UNK otherwise we have to find it elsewhere so we give them a priority that they wouldn't otherwise have
er in terms of training commercial training and it's not just the fire and rescue service i spoke recently with the chief ambulance officer who's experiencing the same problems
UNK the first thing that goes in a recession that's the first thing that people cut and not only well we are achieving the fixed amount of income that we're obliged to in order to make previous reductions but we're certainly not covering costs
so what you're effectively doing at the moment is UNK the private commercial sector
erm everything else we've looked at there are either statutory problems or other problems that prevent us from charging
so it's if further income generation is limited it's through external circumstances rather than any internal increases
so we've really we've really no alternative but to accept the UNK three one to three on the reductions
it's best as i see it
erm salmon paper
we we've got not alternative did you say
well i think that that's exactly what the committee was saying to the minister there
no
we i thought were all saying that we felt that these reductions were actually unacceptable or totally un almost unacceptable
erm there's not a word that's suitable to use actually in this case because we find that they would actually impact upon the service in a serious manner and therefore we don't
well put it this way if we were UNK to find the savings they ask that is the only way we could do it
that's right we need to put that rider on that we would hope that obviously would look UNK at er erm removing these restrictions on our service if at all possible
it's only specific in item two
specifically in item two yes sorry
yes
chair sorry one and three i think that we've i certainly couldn't accept
we've got to accept the implication of item three though in future years
i think i think council is accepting this but i think it's
you're changing battle ground there mr chairman to be honest
i think what mr has said is quite right is that this is a carry forward for this year and er we've we're UNK it taking it up really is what we're saying
so what he's saying we've got to discount it
so what he's saying is
next year we wouldn't have a erm look and see whether that twenty thousand is coming from the local authority it's not necessarily in that particular money
it's not our calls
so what we're saying or in item well the last item implication of further service reduction with that twenty thousand pound on fire and rescue service will be applicable for this year only
we've said that will be acceptable in p a g chairman
it's not acceptable it's not acceptable chairman we agreed in the p a g it wasn't acceptable
it's been spelt out
we threw that one out then
mm yes
no way
but it's in but it's in here isn't it
so we put a as a rider on that it had already passed the rider it says there but we found it unacceptable at p a g
for we're offering them
if it has to be found that's the only way
but to us it is unacceptable
is the exception applied to two
yes
so we've got to in trading standards
yes
trading standards however important and trading standards is very important erm when you're getting down to erm reductions in equipment and UNK and men then lives are at risk it is really a matter of er of for our fire fighters that they have the right equipment and the right uniform and when it actually comes down you can't compare that to maybe reductions in trading standards
if i can support that chairman and what john said also
that's why we couldn't when we talked about it earlier use the same word unacceptable on both item two under fire service reductions
because the fire and rescue service reductions are unacceptable and i think this committee should say to and to leave that in its proposal to policy panel and p and r
what things
but when it comes to the trading standards board what we're saying is if p and r and policy panel this committee finds seventy thousand UNK worth of savings then clearly item two represents a way of doing it
but it represents a way of doing it which is not what the members of this committee of all three parties i suspect want to do
and we would therefore strongly urge them to consider that and not to take that saving unless it was sort of necessary
okay
sounds reasonable to me
are you all in favour of that then
yes as long as this possibly isn't major that we do not agree on
well the chairman
are we
so we're all in favour
yes
right
capital programme chair is that outlined in erm on the pink pages if members have any comments to put to david

the secretary would phone to find out if they were alright after the accident and if UNK necessary contact the chairman
treasurer's report the balance sheets were circulated to all and the treasurer went through each item of expenditure explaining in detail
there was a healthy balance for nineteen ninety three and this was mainly due to members supporting UNK and the fact that we have not put the show stand off at the british UNK festival for a couple of years
this had built up the present balance to what it now was
mr proposed seconded that the report be accepted

matters arising proposed and seconded that they be accepted recommendations
yeah no because there was no matters arising
just put that on so you can proposing and seconding
confusing isn't it
no not really
right
secretary's report
can we have the secretary's report
yeah
erm secretary's report it's much the same as last year er we had two trips this year two coach trips one to the yorkshire UNK festival in UNK was it april
i think it was april wasn't it
and one to the british UNK festival in october
they were both enjoyable erm i can't really say which i enjoyed the most er i thought they were both very good and of course good value for the money because they don't charge very much for the fares well i don't think they do
erm then we had the three way inter club table show with UNK and UNK and st UNK erm the first one was st UNK and that was the only wasn't it about april and we won that we it was a whitewash really wasn't it
erm then we had one at UNK in july and we won that er not quite as much of a whitewash was it
nevertheless we won UNK
and the third one was at UNK
which was not organized because we don't know anyone
which was we don't know who won we don't know what the score was but we think that but we're assuming that that's because they bring out all their secret UNK who don't sh travel they have a little core hard core of that don't travel but they bring them out
they bring them out at their own table shows and it's
appropriate that we should that much
well that appears to be so
i never cared for results never cared for results at all
robert is
we never saw a fish either
no
i don't think erm on reflection i don't think that a three way table show is a good thing
i would prefer to see an inter club with UNK and an inter club with UNK i think they get too big two clubs is too difficult to organize when there's three cos you you're getting it's not it's the
it's not that the show secretary was er at club had not done his job
at UNK
yeah
i mean he's in the UNK when he should be with them writing the labels
yeah
yes i mean it doesn't go down well and i'll say the things you have to do when you when you're helping to run a club you have to commit yourself to the club and you have to do the jobs that th presented by the club
i mean i date mine er well i don't date 'em i sign the cards at home and do all that at home before i go
that's right
and then when i come here i've just got to date what fish is on the bench
that's right
and it cuts down the work then
the way he's doing this is there's they can go
well that's no use is it
that's no use
i know they were still judging after midnight and that's no good really no good at all on a working week
when we got there we had to species of fish and then take it out and
yeah
it's a good idea it's a good idea in principle but it's not a UNK proposition when you've over a hundred fish and there's evening
yes
she hasn't got enough time
one of the didn't come till nearly quarter past ten
yeah
i think it er on reflection i think er i would UNK members from having a three way table show i like the one off you know one against one because it works better
yeah
i think it works better
yeah
yes of course yeah but the you know we have to i have to make a report and i have to recommend so i'm recommending that we forget about the three way stuff
er we had a UNK meeting in october which was i enjoy them very much i enjoy the talk because it's the first chance i get during the year when i can sit down and listen and i don't have to worry about them generally in another club i don't have to worry about minutes or anything i just sit and listen and it's great it i really enjoy that
meetings once again i have to say the old UNK please can we start at eight UNK clock er we're getting new members who get a bit UNK when we have a late start
i know it isn't easy but erm i think we should you know try and we advertise starting at eight o'clock and very often there's only alan and i here at eight
so if we could all try our best to get here at eight UNK clock
particularly when we're trying to get UNK into the club i mean they want to go at ten possibly you owe them not starting till
yeah
it's very difficult to
nine there's nothing you know they'll get UNK
so you john now jonathan he's only fifteen i know he looks in his twenties but he's only fifteen and he's done a lot of homework so it makes him late and it makes him uncomfortable and he's UNK because he knows he's got to disturb us when he goes out he doesn't enjoy disturbing us so i have to make that clear to you
erm again i er the old story we can't get speakers on a monday and better luck in last year this year sorry er i was able to get danny but there again he came very expensive erm but we brought we had to bring him from UNK so er you can't expect him to come for nothing
so erm and another thing i was going to suggest erm i need help really erm for the meetings i need somebody who will help a social secretary say somebody who will help with the UNK and somebody who will organize meetings what's going on at meetings because it's getting the job is getting most difficult and i work part time and it's i'm not getting any younger and i'm finding it a struggle to try and get everything fixed the UNK and the what's going on and everything organized so if you if you if you could see the way clear perhaps we could create a social secretary or an assistant secretary where we could have somebody who can give a hand with the organization of the meetings
just to get things like slide shows or erm videos and things you know that's how we're gonna
organizing the UNK just to get things like slide shows organized videos organized just a little bit of help
will you
thank you robert
yes
so if we make a list of what we've got when you have a video night if you or somebody else has the video list you can say well if you bring them back
that's right and we brian had the club slides which he very kindly handed over to us when he felt it became difficult for him to cope with it erm cos his dad's not well
we have the club slides in our house so that you know really whoever takes over organizing the meeting should really have those and they're all sorted out in order so it's just a case of UNK in the bag and looking for whatever you want ever the i always try to bring some fish to look at to the UNK to the screen erm some of the fish that were on show on the table for that particular sh er in erm table show because i think it shows interest and to learn more about the fish and it's always nice when somebody else knows a lot more about the particular species than you do and i is able to tell you UNK and UNK that they have
so i always try to do that but i again i find that it's very erm very UNK and it's very gets very can get very involved with it so i would like us i'd like you to think of the idea of a social secretary to help with the UNK and organizing what's going on at the meetings please
erm and that's about all i have to say mr chairman
need a UNK
i keep losing me place
i'll have put me
i know it's not
and the report from the treasurer can we have your report please
this is what everyone's been waiting for
have the er figures in front of you of our progress during the last twelve months you will no doubt see that we are in a very nice financial position er only a pound and a penny off that magic thousand pound in the club now
erm during the year we've made about er two hundred and two hundred and twenty odd pounds
er it's not due to my expertise at all it's just mainly due to the fact we don't go to shows these days we've always in the good old days when we used to go to shows we spent probably a hundred and thirty to two hundred pounds a year so we never had very much money as we don't go to these shows and spend this money it is it is a it is UNK each year
erm i'll go through roughly through the accounts in case anybody's not quite clear what it's all about
er we started off with seven hundred and seventy five pounds seventy six at the beginning of the year er the membership is only thirty seven we have fewer members but er that's a very small proportion of our income
four pound for visitors only seem to come and then disappear not many of them seem to join us
erm because of a social evening er we had a raffle and a UNK bowl i think the UNK might not like the e in UNK but that's the way it's been done that must be the southern way
erm right the yorkshire UNK festival we had a coach two ninety three pound on the coach and a raffle a hundred and six pound erm on the inter club we had a fourteen pound twenty five entry and we had a raffle twenty nine twenty five making forty three pound fifty
yorkshire was quite a success this year we made a lot of money o on the income side er sixty two pound for entries ninety one pound ten for refreshments hundred and nine forty for the raffle our kind and thanks to bert
thanks to bert
it says here
for breaking the record for four minute mile
the UNK thirty nine again thanks to bill for breaking the records
five hundred and fifty pound and sponsorship coming from the members of course fifty three pound fifty
all our w most of our money does come from the members themselves as you've seen
er the er the UNK evening now what happened on this UNK evening is that the they run the raffle then give us our expenses out of it so that eleven pound eighty is the is the part of the raffle proceeds which we need to e to er for our expenses you'll see on the other side erm that we spent that eleven eighty six eighty for er refreshments and five pound for the rent
er the rest of it they take for the er to keep the UNK going keep
erm
oh yes excellent
er the coach to er to er UNK on the bus we took thirty nine pound erm with discount from last year people who er bought some last christmas we made twenty three pound on that the library only thirty pence course we've had trouble with the library because we can't leave it here now and er so that's why it's s so low the income
er six twenty for the sale of UNK fancy some of that was from a previous year
yes it was it was
i forgot about the sale of UNK last year
that's probably two years actually er income from that
sales that were left over from the open show three pound thirty fourteen pound ten for the collection now that is as you see that is over from last year last year the table show so we actually have double the number of entries on the bench this year which is a healthy sign
really that
and er hopefully if we can only just bring enough fish each and every time erm we'll even get it higher
now as you can see our main income is our UNK two hundred and sixty pound that is an increase of ooh seventy five pound on last year
paid a hundred and eighty five last two hundred and sixty this year
er i'd just like to thank everybody for their UNK for taking part so
erm we're trying to have beer put on the price each time now to make it worthwhile so you get a chance of getting your money back
right that makes a total of seventeen eighty six sixty one over the year
erm right on the expenditure side we have our normal subscriptions for the year a s erm the f b a s which you all know there's no strangers here who don't know what these are the a l a and the whale and UNK er preservation society which we have taken on as a personal thing in the in the er name of the club because it's cheaper
no it's in my name
it's in your name but it's on behalf of the club
it's on behalf of the club yeah
because the club one's getting rather expensive so we yeah
eighteen pounds
so we decided to join that for this year
the rent for the club room er five pound per go a hundred and fifteen pound erm the christmas social we spent fif thirty five fifty one on the refreshments and seven eighty nine on the whisky making a forty three forty expenditure the club UNK we spent nineteen pound fifty this year and we saved a lot of money on that this year we spent about a hundred and thirty to forty last year erm so we have got a quite a difference just trying to find last year's erm there they are UNK a hundred and sixteen pound we paid last year so have we did save a lot of money by doing them ourselves more or less
erm the inter club show erm we had to pay judges er two of them thirty pound we would normally have got keith for nothing i know that we had two judges so we had to pay them er we did like so that's two fifty pounds and we bought some we had some old UNK which we were able to buy plates for to use for that event
erm UNK and stationery eight forty four raffle tickets ten thirty eight raffle prizes sixteen twenty four if i'm short
erm table show judges we had a table at the beginning of the year when we had the gentleman from UNK what's his name
paul
paul came to came to judge erm er that's the only time we've had a judge
er hundred and forty pound for the coach to yorkshire which we got on the other side a hundred and six pound back so the club er sponsored that a hundred and thirty four pound and thirty four pound
erm right the open show fifty nine ninety five for the hire of the hall much the same as last year it's keeping pretty well down er it's we paid fifty three eighty last year but i think because little bit for a longer time this year
erm the judges seventy five er and that's ten pound less than last year maybe because we're struggling to get judges forty two pound for the UNK erm er fifteen pound for the fish tank and plates at seventy five forty seven UNK eight seventy eight which we UNK to sell we think you could sell UNK but we had a struggle
UNK stationery fourteen o six raffle tickets eleven pound making a total of two thirty twenty six as against on the other side the income three ninety six so we made a hundred and sixty six pound on the open show which is a great increase on last year because last year we only made twelve pounds something twelve pound and a penny we made last year so this is a great increase
the coach to the UNK evening that's what i mentioned before we paid for the refreshments and the rent show secretary has only claimed two pounds which is a scandal really she's probably paid twenty out twenty pounds
yeah i think so cos she's sitting here smiling
so joe doesn't get so many UNK peas
er champion of champions we've i bought some prizes for the champion of champions and food er just to go with the UNK er keith again was our judge and erm knowing that he doesn't UNK accept money he wants to come and do it for nothing erm how many proposed that we buy him something a bottle to take with him so we bought him a bottle of wine to take with him and er that was the three pound
so that gives us a total expenditure of seven eighty seven sixty two for the year and that leaves us with a balance er of the year and that's nine ninety eight ninety nine pence
so we're UNK well off really for the size of the club and my trip to UNK up the UNK collecting fish gets nearer and nearer
gets nearer every day you wouldn't get
erm
very far on a thousand pound though would you
well as i say i mean we're doing very well and all the money and you know ninety percent of the money comes out of the er the members' pockets really i mean ev even the sub for the open show we put out a lot of that even the stuff and things like this so we do provide an awful lot of money
er we haven't used very much of it this year i mean i think er i mentioned a few weeks ago the question of trips out perhaps in the spring to do fish and that we could consider er we don't want to just go er UNK money for the sake of it erm we want to get some benefit out of the money we've got
erm we may of course go to UNK next year if the circumstances change and we can manage it that will course cost a fair amount of money but that remains to be seen we'll have to wait and see how the club UNK during the year whether we think we can do it
right any questions
no
we don't them
we don't with thousand pound in his back pocket can't be bad
it's coming to the stage soon when we'll have to put it in a building society get some interest on it
i mean sh shame in the banks i mean we don't get charges any charges from this bank i mean if you er put it in some banks you get interest charge you on your cheques and all sorts of things it it's as broad as it's long usually but er i mean we are gonna accumulate money i don't think we should accumulate very much more now we we've ample funds for everything we need er but it's a question
but it's just lying in the bank UNK and it's not making any interest i know it's not being i know we're not being charged but
trouble is
building society i don't know they do it
maybe you could the only way we could do it is er a joint account and that would be have to be based on trust you know a mutual trust between er y your two main people er y you would just have to trust them erm nobody how do members feel about if you
that's true
well it's a and stuff like that i mean
but i mean i
the reason i propose giving he has to do is come
it's embarrassing
and sometimes he feels it be putting on those
yes and he's such a nice man and he does it so UNK if he can
that's why he's
yes
oh i'll have one off him yeah
when it's done like you know it's going
oh yes i'll have one him
yeah he's doing it
yes
we are struggling with judges aren't we
and what about you know about the judges don't you
yes but it doesn't
i just mentioned it er we have we have had a suggestion from b class judges that er that the b class judges can show at er an open show providing they declare beforehand
