on the point of representation in fact er i think there have been representations made already be those authorities who felt they were disadvantaged in the first case and so what you've seen with using this method of distribution is a switch actually of expenditure to london UNK london UNK felt that they had lost er in the first round of s t g but now if you look at the overall spread they and the er UNK have gained
the second point is that the a c are i think the second point is that there was a UNK to the minister yesterday so if in a sense it's a little late unless it was picked up by mr yesterday it may be a little late to do something for this year er i mean obviously next year is i think going to be the er important issue and the a c has already circulated all UNK counties er it's picked up that this has happened to the majority of counties although again the south east er has escaped from that and it's asking for the sort of figures we're debating this morning
and i know it's their intention to discuss it and to make appropriate representations
shropshire always tends to lose out because of where we are er mrs
now erm yes i'd like to pick up a comment made by the director erm he said quite rightly that the prevention factor is really out of the window as far as the budget is concerned and pro as far as operations are concerned
am i taking that correctly
i was talking about children's services yes
yes well i am too and that we shall pay the penalty later on if we don't get with us and i feel that erm as difficult as the budget is as tight as it is with reduction etcetera i feel that we should make a positive funding for prevention or something or er because i think unless we do start somewhere and quickly we are going to pay the penalty at the end of the and so we've got to make a date you've got to make a year and if you wait and say and well we haven't got it now well next year we shall say we haven't got it now and the next year we'll say we haven't got it now
and i think that somewhere along the line erm even if it's only a moderate sum we should make definite erm approaches to start the ball rolling in this preventative effect because i think we're going every budget head in the whole of the county or UNK or anybody else who's got a budget is going to pay the penalty so i would like that to see if there's any movement any way we can address that particular problem er during our discussions
the other one that worried me a bit is how are we UNK recruiting
we seem to be erm taking on an enormous number of staff er at what level are we doing it
how are we doing it
are we just moving people around from where they were becoming redundant somewhere else
what i mean just you know what are we doing in the county
what is the format
what is the er methodology
what is the erm er or scale or whatever
we're just recruiting staff it's the information about how i'd like to know a bit more about that
presumably we recruit well qualified people to be able to do their job
are they
we don't know
at the right rate of pay
well there's training isn't there to give to them
well just generally we haven't restricted recruiting of care staff in other words unless we know there's a decision been made about a residential establishment which there hasn't been at present
so obviously if a cook goes a cook has to be replaced if a care assistant goes a care assistant has to be replaced as long as the population is there
that's the basis
i'm talking about new staff
the basis well that we're working on existing staff
new staff in the main have been connected with care in community and you've heard really mr explain to you already what they're doing
we got specific money in other words the government UNK up that in the first year there were going to be infrastructure costs and so there was a specific allowance made for that and we've been recruiting gradually not all at once over a period of time as the numbers of people coming into the community care system rise we've been recruiting new staff there
now they're of two sort there are the administrative staff the financial staff in other words that have to do the physical assessments er financial assessments which by the way are more complicated now than they were previously because there's all sorts of different elements and agreements having to be reached with individuals or charitable institutions or whatever
and the other are the people doing the physical assessments for example in the hospitals er at princess royal hospital in telford i think we had to i can't remember the exact figure but we certainly had to increase our staff there our hospital social workers to secure the UNK that's er being required
yes we do go for qualified staff er i'm talking about social work field staff now er wherever possible we would go for that
we have about a ninety five percent i think qualified staff and that has improved over the last eight years from
fifty odd
fifty percent i think er when we first started
so that's the general direction
we have problems in residential care with particularly with residential child care with the numbers of qualified staff
lack of them
and that was the reason that the government brought in a new initiative after the UNK report and there's a specific training grant that you now get to ensure that your training staff your residential staff get trained
but i have to say for shropshire it means one i think er per year and that's not going to make a big UNK
any other
sorry can you just repeat
the preventative work
the preventative work
yes well you are talking about children's services but i think if mr 's going to talk later to this if you want but we are absolutely at the moment we know that eighty nine percent of work at the child care centre is to do with child protection with to deal with it and by that i mean abuse physical and sexual abuse er concerns about that and a lot of that of course is tied up in procedural ways and we're dealing with events almost after the situation has er got going er and of course with the courts you know that we've got duties in relation to the courts that we have to fulfil or else we are the subject of criticism from the er courts and we have been UNK at various er times
so with what we need to break into we
i'd like to get mr
as you know with UNK of great effort got er the er scheme off the ground which has taken a lot of all of us a lot of hard work er and we're proposing other schemes at UNK house
we need to move more into that area of work that sort of prevention and we need if possible to move more in partnerships with voluntary organizations but if we do that er then we will have to pay them
you know they're not going to do it for nothing
i think the problem with erm with prevention and i mean and i suspect that there is er unity of the board in relation to prevention but we don't see the cost savings
the cost saving in the preventative work er fall falls later on in the system and that might not even accrue back to local government and that's the problem and i think if there was some specific erm government grants that enabled local authorities to really get to grips with the preventative elements and could should that reduced overall government spending on the other end on the impact end i mean i think we would be we would be sort of making very much UNK but there doesn't seem to be that specific initiative at this particular stage
perhaps if we can arrive at some sort of specific amounts or some research in that direction we might mr chairman be able to take representations to government in a more positive way
i mean i think you know to talk about it in terms such as you i mean quite rightly you've done so erm leaves us with no real impact er argument
well it might be that once we've dealt once we have dealt and are dealing with the budget it might be that we receive some papers erm from the department for future social services reports
er we've already got some items on the UNK agenda this morning specifically to do with issue of UNK care but it might be that we look at a lot earlier
maybe some joint reports with other colleagues in education to look at some innovative work erm that if it was specifically ring UNK government grant we can actually get our teeth into that would provide a cost saving for governments in the future
chairman i think that's an excellent idea and i think one to erm prove ways of cost saving is to involve erm more nursery education because one sum spent before five it apparently costs six pounds or its equivalent
it's probably tied up with education as well
but i mean out of this lot maybe we can look at some
chairman if we take mrs 's point under the children's services plan which is later in your
yes last speaker then we'll move on with the budget document tom
sorry chair i ju i just would like a little concerned that er we've accepted the five hundred pounds er the five hundred thousand pounds community care shortfall where our own calculations originally were six hundred and ninety two thousand have now gone up to seven hundred and fifty thousand
er i've seen other papers where there is a hint that we might be looking for a contribution er out of the general budget er of that difference that two hundred and fifty thousand
we're talking a lot of money here and i wonder whether we're a little bit erm over optimistic that the five hundred thousand is going to be adequate
chair i think have to make a point at this stage although as i said earlier we haven't got a complete picture yet
we are UNK as best we can these figures will change and indeed they are changing as we try to move towards a more detailed purchasing plan with the health authority to take in the changes they may go up they may go down
that's certainly the best estimate at the moment
i'm happy with the five hundred thousand pounds suggestion but my view when you come to the papers if we are able to hold on to the two hundred thousand contingency we've got for community care for the elderly and the hundred thousand we've got for bad debts and other figures
i think it's very much linked with the safeguard being that we have got the one year UNK of carry forwards sums there to meet any immediate problems within the year and give ourselves breathing space to address those in the longer term
you did promise me mr chairman that i could just ask a quick question
oh sorry
it was just on appendix one was that was that in total department part of the care in the community in general or was it hospital discharge i wasn't too clear on that
general mm general yes
is the is the projected grant likely to go up at the same rate as in as in nine ninety four ninety five
there's a sort of fifty percent increase it seems a you know a huge increase but is that going to settle down
it will settle down and reduce chair through you that the national figure has been announced that the for the future year and it does recognize the fact that there is an assumption that the number of people who d s continues to support directly will have fallen by thirty five percent by the end of this year and there will be a further fall and the amount that's transferred is very much related to here's the total available how much does the d s need to hold on to meet its commitments and how much is left to distribute to the local authorities
so it will be a smaller figure in terms of the specific grants in ninety five six
okay
thirty five percent of total
thirty five percent of people supported by the d s they are assuming will not be there at the end of the first year
i think they're optimistic in terms of that point
if we can move on then
chair if i could move on then to the budget proper and i apologize for the UNK
as you'll appreciate it we've put one or two papers together into one paper and therefore the UNK tends to repeat itself so we're on page one again but under the heading of the budget for ninety four ninety five
i would draw members' attention to the notes in block type at the head there and that is you are working to guidelines which have been agreed by the policy panel and policy and resources
they are guidelines there are no final decisions to be taken in terms of the implementation of a number of these but this is the committee's opportunity to view those in detail and make its recommendations through proposals to policy and resources committee and on to council
final decisions as always on your budget will be taken at the council meeting in february
the guidelines are set out in paragraph two in terms of the strategy
this is within as members will be aware the overall financial position that the county council finds itself in of having to get its expenditure within the cap and the fact that the increase in cap for the authority as a whole does not in any way mirror the increase in standard spending assessment for social services committee where we have been fortunate in terms the increase for this county erm and a variety of other factors which mean that it would be nice to think that where s a increases for this committee it also increases for the county council
i think if that were the case you would have far fewer problems but er of course this isn't the position
paragraph three looks at the guidelines in detail and starts with the additions and as mr said earlier we do welcome the fact that there is an explicit mechanism for the cost of client number increases in social services in the coming year
we have got a growing UNK population and that does put further demands on your services and those are shown there in summary form for the client groups and there are more details on those when we get to the additions and reductions lists on pages thirteen and fourteen later
so i don't intend to go into the detail at this stage
other variations shown there again we will look at in more detail but essentially these are loss of income grant income or additional expenditure in terms of registration inspection in community care er to continue either existing services or to meet UNK legislative change
the total there therefore for this committee is proposed guideline growth of one point five million
m i s g
yes to think m i s g is mental illness specific grants in case we pick that up later and the e s f is the european social fund grant
over the page
we'll definitely have an addition in there
but they are recorded in full later chairman in the summary i've used the UNK
yes
chairman if they are recorded all later it took me quite a long time to discover them could we have UNK just written out it makes it very difficult for me to i'm not used i mean i'm
i take the point chair
just in brackets sort of just in pencil or euro or something
i don't think education comes into it chairman because they change them every other year anyway
they make them up as they go along
it'll confuse them
you're obviously
the position on page two then shows the reductions targets where we've got a target for efficiency savings of hundred and thirty five thousand service reductions on income generation costing six hundred thousands and a proposal that we use a hundred and eighty thousand of the committee's carry forward savings in the first year erm that is obviously a one year only reduction and indeed a policy and resources committee and a report of treasurer to that committee did make the point that committees will be aware that they must use the carry forwards in funding reductions in four five will have to matched by service reductions in future years
in terms of the papers in front of you this morning chair the position is that is addressed over the three year period and the figures do UNK between years so there is a as we'll see later in the paper there is a net expenditure total in year one which increases in year two but then is offset by a reduction in year three
er paragraph four chairman is the point that policy and resources when it was addressing the fact that all of the proposals from committees that's currently within the guidelines did still leave a shortfall between projected expenditure of the county council and the capping limit
and the suggestion to this committee was that it looked that it looked further at the five hundred thousand pounds guideline that's been set to address the apparent shortfall on community care funding and also that you should look at further service reductions and their implications erm of reductions of a further two hundred and fifty thousand and those are again picked up later in the paper
erm the salmon pages set out the proposed strategy to meet those guidelines and as i say we'll pick those up as we move through
chair paragraph seven the guidelines on capital
erm we didn't have those when these papers were prepared but the position is that there is a guideline for new starts for this committee of some seven hundred and eighty six thousand pounds with two hundred thousand being set aside to go towards architects and other fee costs associated with that programme and the existing programme
erm chair i think when we come to the capital programme you will be proposing that the p a g advise you and the director in terms of producing a package which meets those guidelines erm and given the opportunity to look at them in some detail
but there will be an opportunity for members to look at the present programme which will need UNK to get it down to those guidelines and they can obviously make any comments they wish to or any advice they wish to give the p a g in terms of individual schemes or the detail
erm the rest chairman is showing the erm contents and the main budgets i think
if you wish to er spend time on those
moving to page three is the revised estimates for your committee for the current year and you'll see there the format is somewhat to the one you've seen in future years we have had
in the past
sorry in i'm getting ahead of myself already
it's different to the way you've seen in the past
erm as well as introducing care in community we also have the joy of putting a new standard form of accounts for social services during the current year and this is a national requirement that i think does make for logical presentation and does differentiate between what is termed service strategy and regulation before put management functions that you will be required to incur whether you are a direct provider of the services or not and then the costs of actually providing or commissioning services for the various client groups
erm within that chair you will see that there are various variations erm totalling a net increase of four hundred and eighty thousand in the year
if i could refer you to the block beneath there on carry forwards you started this year bringing forward savings and under UNK and various other UNK of just over one and half million
you have during the year er both through this committee and through resources and management sub committee agreed expenditure of seven hundred and seventeen thousand from that contingency
erm the reason that doesn't tie in with the four hundred and eighty thousand pound er increase in spending is that UNK that seven hundred and seventeen thousand that you've funded from your contingency there is also a net reduction in spending by the committee because of the changes in the UNK of central department charges and their allocation through committees well less have been allocated to social services committee in total
erm the position then on carry forwards chairman is that you have a number of specific contingency provisions that we are holding funded from these previous savings
as i've already said i would wish the committee to hold on to those specific ones relating to community care at this stage until we have a more certain picture
i think from the county council's point of view the safeguard is there is no proposal to make those available for other spending within the committee and therefore if hopefully we do not need to access them during the year they are still available for council in future years to meet other spending requirements
erm there are also provisions in there for the children act where we are holding a contingency of eighty two thousand
i would draw members' attention to the spending on children and families committee during this year which in fact is net some three hundred and nineteen thousand above the base budget
we have had considerable difficulty in the current year in meeting the demand upon children's services and we have met those difficulties in no small part from the use of carry forwards within the year and before you come to looking at reductions in services on the salmon papers the children's service is going to and in fact is doing a UNK of its funding to ensure that it stays within its base budget in future years
that does mean that they have already had a very difficult exercise in terms of looking at an efficiency effectiveness distribution of funding and how they manage the service and that's very much tied in with the children's services plan which mike referred to earlier on and which is later on the agenda
erm so i would certainly be asking you to keep some contingency provision in that area because we project some very expensive one off demands on certain elements of children's services
erm disability and mental health has a specific contingency of fifty thousand and again this is addressing the point that we have tried to reduce expensive out county placement erm successfully
but it only needs one that you cannot avoid and you'll be spending said fifty thousand pound plus per annum in respect to that one patient
erm and the other one is the registration and inspection where in the current year we have access to the best part of sixty five thousand pounds from to meet registration inspection and you'll see in the additions list that there is er a bid in there for the ongoing costs of that
it's substantially to do with registration of inspection duties arising from the children act the registration and inspection of UNK erm workplace UNK and mike can go into detail on that if members wish
but er it is an area where we are required to register and inspect and unfortunately if we're not happy on one these inspections we are also required to pursue those and ensure that there is improvement or UNK of the service
erm that on the carry forwards leaves a balance in hand of a hundred and eighty thousand not specifically earmarked and i must say it's up to you to decide what should be specifically earmarked
but that is the hundred and eighty thousand that was shown in the budget UNK of being a contribution towards the guideline in the first year
over the page chair within er those totals there are a number of proposals for reductions in c certain areas of spending and increases in others which are in excess of the amount which has been delegated to er to the director to agree and which needs this committee's approval erm and would then go on to er resources management for their agreement
there are net nowhere where we are using both one off and UNK savings in certain budget heads to meet UNK expenditure we come on within the year and therefore keep within the committee's overall cash limit for the year
and i hope chair that those will meet with members' approval this morning but we will need to take a resolution on those
right
if members have any specific questions on the revised estimates and those details i'd be happy with colleagues to them
comments
one question and that is that i noticed on page three er you've got your revised estimate with effect in ninety four five you've got nothing
correct the position chair is that we are as i said earlier UNK to pull all those committees UNK back in line with the budget in ninety four five
therefore we're not other than the specific items that appear on your additions list we're not looking for any growth in the base budget at this stage over and above that that's already built into your budget base
could we could we have a comment on page four on the proposed two and three erm i mean section levels of staff sickness
are we monitoring this
in one case in the community homes it says staff absence and i'm not clear what there is for training purposes but i would hope that we are checking or was this simply before christmas or what
this chair has er been a particularly difficult year with a with a higher than average level of er sickness er amongst staff
erm the result er was that we had to bring in relief staff and other staff have had to work overtime
staff UNK actually refer in the main to er unfortunate situation of a number of staff this year who have er been suspended er because of er various matters er which have had to be worked through
for members' information we have asked the UNK services er unit to undertake an exercise on the level of staffing in our homes as much as anything because of the frequent reference in UNK reports to the situation on staffing levels in our children's homes
er this is er drawing to a conclusion and er in time the results of that exercise will be reported to committee
but you're having because i think if we are going to carry on using them these UNK should be translated into UNK and if that there's any problem we do know that situation UNK
erm but what i'm really thinking is somebody looking actually into the sickness and is this a question of long term sickness or are we dealing with UNK of flu
i know at last erm budget meeting we talked about doing so for the entire health survey because really the amount of money spent on sickness is quite UNK and one does need to look at this when you're having to meet your budget
i fully accept that and we hope but i hope some monitoring is taking place
that exercise chair i can assure mrs has been taken alongside the UNK studies exercise
number four issues
okay and number four
do you do this paul
two on page four
sorry we have some
i think is we one of the concerns has been i've been visiting has been the need to feeling of security in many factors
if one person's on duty you would a situation where really that was a bit of risk quite often and er it's not an acceptable thing but er i totally agree we need to agree very carefully if one's wise to whether the initial staffing is adequate or whether it is case a of people not having
the position chair if i can just quickly through you say in terms of this budget we do make a provision for UNK because obviously we do get sickness absence
of course
in a number of cases there is a minimum level of staffing that is required and therefore it isn't a matter of managing until the person comes back you do have to replace
we have had an exceptional level erm probably the reasons such as stand by and maternity UNK and a variety of others which essentially are above the level that we normally budget for
what they were given to you
and if that work had been started because as far as i'm concerned sickness does not cover maternity
so we need it's simply a question of pulling in on the reasons for this if it's maternity it's suspension it gives us much more understanding than simply UNK assuming everybody who's away is sick
i take the point chairman and suggest by the criticism we will try and get more explicit detail in the future
in salaries or joint finance funding so where there are differences it is almost entirely down to those two factors
it does give members an indication of the level of expenditure on particular services and for the first time we are showing within these papers in terms of the budget the amounts that you're spending on the direct provision of services and the amount you're spending in terms of services that you buy in and don't provide directly and this is shown on the service page
needless to say in terms of elderly learning disability and physical disability there will be an increasing amount bought in as the community care transition er continues
erm nothing chair that i would want to refer to other than the on page eleven we're showing a figure there for management and support
this is both central management costs and those direct support costs within the divisions and within the services that is UNK over provisions of service so that you're getting a true cost in terms of your costs of running the elderly services the children and family services so they include both directly man management costs
in those there are a number of staff who are what we would call front line health based staff who are there in supporting social workers and providing direct services to your client group
they the vast majority of them are not UNK hall based er administrative staff or what i think is generally er the view er the general view of management and support
indeed in looking at the UNK in a different UNK we have got erm something less than seven percent of total costs that relate to erm indirect management and administrative costs
er and we are not in terms of any comparative statistics that are providing costs on management and support in any way a high UNK vis a vis other local authorities
the only other element in there chair is we we've shown the specific grant coming in er in the figure that it's been announced
two people have indicated that
mrs to establish
erm yes i'd like to erm ask a question and suggest that the change in the first paragraph service strategy and regulations
erm i feel that heading is including two different what i believe is two different headings
for instance cost of meetings to the committee direct of preparation of the budget at strategic level and jump to strategic information and research planning and liaison with other bodies for planning should be one heading
but there're quite definitely staff implications much more obvious and much more erm UNK in registration and inspections units and the complaints procedure and i feel that should be two sub headings if you like two elements
certainly when you get into the detailed budget then these are clearly separated
this is a summary of the detailed budget
the reason it's in this format is this is now the national standard form of accounts for social services and the thinking behind it is whether you were an authority that provided all of its services directly at one extreme or at the other extreme you were in a party that provided no direct services and bought them all in from other providers you would still need to meet to meet those costs
the costs of running your committee your requirement to have legislation inspections and UNK length service and providing independently er to produce budgets erm to monitor on a variety of other matters
so what is incorporated in there is the minimum that you could ever survive on in terms of running a totally enabling authority
my own view is that it could it be a great deal more than that but this is within the erm nationally prescribed requirements in terms of getting some consistency into local authority accounts
erm going on going on
well i want to move on cos you know it's
yes i'll be very quick
the preventative the word preventative comes in so frequently and particularly in the children's services i agree with the second one it but i would like to have a more detailed report er on that second element which is on page seven the last item before you get to elderly people
but erm i would like to know a little bit more about both those preventative things and in the light of what we've said previously
chairman we can give mrs a breakdown of the budget on those two
mr
i just want to ask mr chairman and i don't want to start er a political debate or anything erm the specialist placements erm three forty six thousand how many is that catering for i presume that's the figure that we've all been talking about in these three issues
the whole
but it seems to be a lot less than it might have been last year i mean i do we know how many that's we're talking about
we've budgeted this year er for a maximum of six but as committee were informed at the last meeting that number has exceeded during the year erm and that did create some financial difficulties but that is the budget for specifically for six out county placements which not only do grown people in specialist er accommodation such as secure accommodation but also younger children with disabilities
i understand
but if it obviously that bill increases if more add to it
yes
and there's residential care that the er on page nine the specialist residential places can you just give me a sort of what that is for
that is
people with physical and UNK disabilities
UNK homes
right erm yes it's for adults i think and it's such things as leonard UNK homes er and i can't thing of any other
star and UNK
star and UNK i'm being told from the right here those sort of very special places we don't provide them we buy in from outside
thank you
okay
if we go over the questions then on that
if we can move on then to potential net variations
an interesting title
chairman the salmon sheets if you're happy with the base that we start from
i would say on page twelve it's perhaps interesting to look just at the summary there where you'll see that your gross expenditure for next year is now some fifty four million pounds
erm so the service is growing rapidly in financial terms and will continue to grow in the coming two years if only because it's new
the salmon sheets chair we have shown our estimates of what ideally we would like for the continuing introduction of the children act and its requirements the criminal justice act and the UNK reports but we do recognize and i think this committee recognizes the difficult financial position the county council finds itself in and therefore the intention is to meet those UNK requirements from within the base budget and there are no bids in these papers for funding towards those
erm i think chair it there is a need obviously for all committees to be realistic and erm that certainly is our intention within those but i would say again it leads me to believe that you should keep a reasonable er committee contingency in case certain difficulties present themselves in terms of those additional er pressures and requirements
items four to twelve chairman are some further detail on the provision for demographic growth which is shown on items four to seven erm and that is spread between the major client groups
the elderly population is based on the estimated increase in population of the over seventy five year olds and indeed that is the factor that is now used in s a in terms of looking er the need to spend on elderly people
er it used to be those over eighty but it's been reduced to those over seventy five
erm the growth in demand for people with a known disability and again is explained briefly there and essentially means that you've got more clients coming in than you've got leaving because of the greater life expectancy because more are surviving at birth and one would have to say that they are presenting more difficult problems in a health demand
erm mental health referrals is partly demographic partly social change in that there is an expectation of dealing differently with people who have mental health problems and there is also a very clear expectation of dealing differently with offenders who are leaving the prison system who have mental health problems and there are pressures arising from both those areas as well as the constant requirement for an enhanced provision on alcohol substance abuse er and similar factors
the item seven chair increase in child population
it is true to say there isn't the same direct relation between child numbers and spending on children's services that you get in education
erm it's again recognized in the s as that it is more social factors that impact on the need to spend on children's services and therefore things like single parent families the level of family income and these tend to have a greater impact but it would be foolish to assume that with a higher child population you are not going to get more demands on children's services and therefore we have provided a fifty thousand UNK provision within that to take care of problems
so there's a proposal there of six hundred and fifty five thousand pounds in total to meet growth in client numbers broadly speaking
other additions we did earlier chair and that is we have received a mental illness specific grant erm on a number of schemes but they have been time limited and they are due to cease some of them are due to cease in the coming year
they have been used to develop services jointly with health and indeed a substantial part of the ones that we're losing are UNK the local health team in south telford at the moment
and your choice if you don't find money to i think not one of UNK the service but finding UNK savings elsewhere and i mean it's a matter of there is a required service it is there is an agreement with the health authority that neither party would will withdraw funding without detailed con consultation and determination of how needs would be met
so hence the inclusion of that one
a similar picture on european social fund which is falling out erm mainly relating to schemes for people with learning disability and we have been very successful on that front in attracting european funding for learning disability particularly those schemes which have an element of training for employment associated with them
i've already briefly referred to item ten and that is we've had to increase the numbers in registration inspection during the current year and that demand will continue there is no provision in the base for the ongoing costs for staff who're appointed
and therefore there's a hundred and twenty thousand in for that
the five hundred thousand shortfall in community chair i think we've covered in some detail on the earlier paper so there are other additions there of some nine hundred thousand
we've also included in there on item twelve a net bill item but does need to be recognized as an addition to your total spending and that is you've been involved for many years with the health authority in arranging for the discharge of people from long stay hospitals and their UNK into the community and each of these are a provider of many services and UNK services to those particular individuals
in closing the hospitals the health authority has been purchasing care for those people that let you care for them in a variety of UNK and support
they have asked that we take that on there is a report later in the agenda with detail on that but as far as these papers are concerned that's simply us taking over responsibility for the best part of two million UNK worth of spending which the health authority will refund to us by way of a section twenty eight grant
so that's a straight inheritance does increase your gross expenditure of the committee and indeed does involve you quite sensibly involve you in the total care package for those particular individuals who're increasingly seen as your clients rather than health authority clients
er moving on chair to reductions unless members wish to make any comments on the additions as a block at this stage

no carry on
sorry
joe i wonder would it help members if we as it were almost moved the reductions from our point of view we say nothing further at this point and the UNK point of view and leave members who might like to pick up on them and talk about individual ones as they go through
i would like to say something at some point about the point i made earlier about going increasingly as you go down this list you depart in directions which are er contrary to your policies but
right erm if we can let members get in
i maybe before we start that on the point of reductions and i'll ask both er george and er jean and mike to speak for the different political groups as part of the p a g erm when we did go through this process i mean it was very difficult for us as a p a g
we did meet three times and the steps erm under reductions get er gradually worse for want of a better phrase in relation to how we're able to deliver the service
i think that was recognized by all members of the p a g
i think what is happening now that these papers have been published er is that we will be receiving er erm information consultation from user groups about user groups and the UNK possible implication that these reductions will have upon their services er but george is there anything you want to add
no i think what you've said is what was agreed at the p a g and erm i don't think there's any point in adding to it
jean
well er we're in an impossible situation aren't we
i think everyone's accepted that fact er at the end of the day someone has got to make some very bad decisions
erm we can't just ignore the responsibilities that we've been given
we'll debate and these instructions but there's always this shortfall and it's been going on for far too long and we still have an increasing number of responsibilities and i just find it extremely UNK to have to sit here time and time again to go through doing things that we really know we shouldn't be
instead of cutting most should be increasing them
we are in that situation and all we can do is try and do the best we can to survive and keep some sort of service going to help people who desperately need it
mike
yes well i think the p a gs have looked very carefully at all of these things and while not being happy with er a number of them there really isn't er much alternative er ways to go
the rules and regulations are there we have the money and we're actually told where we can spend it
if we don't we we're we have no other way and er i think they're very carefully doing that in p a g meetings
you'll accept sorry to interrupt mrs
erm yes i'd like that number fifteen on the reductions erm i would like to know more detail of quite what that is all about because erm it's fairly UNK in terms of voluntary organizations so it's a UNK erm reduction
it may seem small in comparison to others but from voluntary UNK point of view it's quite an horrendous problem
chairman can we you know you recall we discussed at some length at the p a g
within our provision for grants for voluntary organizations we hold an UNK figure because we don't automatically erm add inflation to grants to voluntary bodies and in fact we wait for them to come forward and justify the increases of grants we're giving
a number of the grants virtually all of the grants are to voluntary bodies who are providing services which are of considerable benefit to this committee and where we would be in some difficulty if they didn't give those of voluntary support to it
but what we're proposing here essentially is to say we've got a seventy thousand pound contingency not specifically allocated we will reduce that down to thirty thousand but within that thirty thousand we will have to deal with requests we get to increase grants to people who're already in receipt of grant support and also we've also found it extremely helpful to have a small reserve so that when a body comes along and says i would do this for you but i do need a small grant in order to do it and you're effectively buying a hundred thousand pounds worth of service for ten thousand pounds that you have actually got a ten thousand pounds to put it in rather than funding everyone so that's basically the policy behind it chair
so far as you see it
but none of these are any proposals to reduce existing cash grants to voluntary bodies
no but i mean you've had several presumably you've had what did you say seventy five thousand last
seventy
seventy thousand last year now you're saying that even within any i know it's moderate inflation but none the less it's inflation er you are only making available did you get through the seventy i mean were they applied for
and did you find that made a difference to your overall service
and when did you use up your seventy thousand
or was there a balance
there has been a balance chair and hence the fact that we've knocked it off as an efficiency saving rather than as a reduction in service
erm our belief is that we can manage erm in line with our practice and give up that forty thousand pounds but it is it's reducing your flexibility as a number of these changes effectively do
but no our belief is that we can manage
increasingly with voluntary bodies and i know that this was discussed at length in the p a g but will be of interest to members increasingly with voluntary bodies we are moving towards er jointly providing services with them in a partnership arrangement where we are effectively purchasing and commissioning services from them and that is the way we would wish the policy to go
that rather than making a block grant for somebody because we know they do a good job that we do more directly relate that to services they're providing to us and output
needless to say voluntary bodies are very nervous about that because they have difficulty contracting to provide a service when they are totally dependent on UNK volunteers and therefore there is UNK on their part to enter into contracts that bind them to provide something where they are uncertain about their ability to do it
so we do have to manage this with some care
but undoubtedly the way we are moving with the major providers is one where increasingly they will be part of the mixed economy in the independent sector which is UNK erm UNK er commercial bodies and UNK with commercial bodies trusts and others
and therefore our relationship with them will be increasingly of a more UNK nature
councillor
yes can you on twenty four what are we talking about here
do we know where these are the proposals i mean is it one two
or is that just the overview
sorry what g page twenty four
no number twenty four
no on bid four mr 's focusing in on the closure of er
UNK
elderly persons homes i think and we're looking at two sets in that er there's the proposal at twenty two for a closure of one residential home for the elderly in the east of the county
i must stress that we are looking primarily or we propose to look primarily er at the east of the county
er and then the further closure depending where the line is drawn the further potential closure of an additional home which is the one that er mr made reference to
erm now we can explain to you in more detail but the UNK i think mr 's already said to you that the financial savings er from such moves are not as productive as they were so in sense we're driven by strategy here we're driven by the fact that there is a private and there is an independent sector that is there is alternative methods of supply
we believe as you know that there is an over supply of residential accommodation not UNK distributed i have to say that it varies for example in shrewsbury there's a very UNK er independent sector but that will vary er in other parts of the county
but we're primarily moving er on that sort of basis
now can i just add one other comment to it
we believe that we would we would find considerable difficulty too in closing one plus in a single financial year er for all sorts of reasons which we can explain to you
so we would essentially be talking about a UNK process the more we consider
are the homes that are under threat though at the moment
are they concerned about this
do they know
or
no as the director has indicated we are looking to the east of the county
no homes have been identified as such yet the officers are looking at the homes in the east of the county
right can you tell how you're intending to er administer the hundred and fifty thousand pounds home care services
how's that going to be er implemented
are you going to when you do your care packages say we can only award so much we'll have to reduce it UNK
yes
yes i must say i'm particularly concerned about home care services
you'll have a later report er from the social care enterprise agency which we've set up to stimulate independent UNK care
now it is doing that but it's not doing it doing it sorry at a rate which allows us er a sort of UNK withdrawal er on our side
total
what it means is that we reduce our service and we take we can we can we can expect the independent sector to fill that gap for us
it's a military term
to fill that gap for us immediately
and i have to say to you again that the home care service is the one that is most under pressure
i've said to you before it's the one i receive most letters about er i know that it's drawn extremely UNK at this present minute
so it as i said to you in my opening remarks here's a clear example of us having to move in a direction that we wouldn't be recommending to you in terms of policy but we're driven by the financial considerations
although i'm not totally certain it will save us in the longer term
er shirley
could i ask a question please mr chairman
item twenty as well as twenty six you are suggesting that meals go up in day centres by fifteen percent and then on twenty six we introduce a two pound a week for UNK for people with learning disabilities
but do these people at the moment receive a meal in the course of their attendance at whichever day centre they attend
if so could was that price sorry the cost of two pound include their meal
no
so you're really UNK them both ways aren't you
you're putting the meal up fifteen percent and you're assuming that you're going to charge them two pounds for the attendance to that centre
so it isn't really just two pounds that they're going to have find is it
no
well as i indicated these forms are as UNK as they are
i understand
are out are out now in relation to consultation and user groups and their re or representative organizations have been asked to comment in relation to the whole process before we go we get to panel and p and r er so that we get and then full council so we will get some indication and twenty six particularly so that maybe those members in the last er council do realize they might have got we might have got our fingers burnt in relation to this particular issue
but it is an issue that does seem to base itself on an as and where basis
we're spending five million if you look er on services for people with learning disabilities
i don't believe you can ignore five million when you're looking for reasons
oh no oh no i'm not suggesting you do but it just seems UNK of erm UNK them sort of both ways
bill did you want to come in
yes chair and i could just comment on the on the consultation process particularly in relation to potential home closures and to the charges affecting people with learning disability
we when the papers for this committee were made public we did alert people to them the potential erm effects of these proposals
we have not as yet got out any form of formal consultation process erm but obviously erm if erm if that's what members er of this committee wish erm then we would do so and we would be advised as to whether that should be in advance of p and r or whether members would wish to wait for the results of p and r committee before formally UNK on consultation there
to be advised by you chair
i think we wouldn't want consultation before it might influence the decision of p and r or there again depends if we agree the arguments for consultation
i mean personally i'm of the view that it's better to erm agree a set of proposals for consultation see what the outcome is of those consultations er to see whether or not we stick to what we're suggesting to be frank
but that's my personal view
in that case chair i
i mean well i UNK sort of from the members of the committee
perhaps i could just advise members chairman that erm that the timescale for that would be fairly tight erm and my recollection is that when we er we went out to consultation previously in the sphere of learning disability on an issue that i well you should know erm i think there were some thirteen plus consultation meetings required in order to erm to get a fair spread of opinion
so between now and policy and resources it's a very tight timetable
the letter i saw which UNK er users and their carers about these items on the agenda seem to be an indication for them to express their opinions back through the social services department now if that's consultation then the process has started
it may not have been called formal consultation process
that's right chairman we did we wanted to inform people of what was erm and they would UNK obviously have a right to comment but we didn't regard that a formal consultation basis
i think chairman in a sense some of the items are sufficiently explicit for people to say well i know what's being proposed i can comment on it
but when you come to something that says one or more closures of elderly UNK homes in the east of the county i don't think it's quite fair for people saying we have a right to be told on that but that it's UNK explicit for them to respond to consultation and to bring their particularly cases forward
bill
i presume chair we don't have a statutory obligation to consult on a matter such as item twenty six
could we not call it sort of discussions and to try and put our point of view our difficulties that we're in rather than erm er the UNK thing
but erm i i'm concerned about number twenty three
er it's difficult enough with foster parents as it is without erm reducing further the er the allowances
and erm on the er item twenty five might there be an opportunity with the agreement that we're going to deal with in item d aren't we er with the social UNK with the er health authority are under suspicion that a lot of the er personal care we offer through that system ought really to be offered by district nurses erm and i wonder whether that's erm can we perhaps we cannot establish that
somebody's shaking their head
c we've i mean we've we are having discussions er with the health authority about the way in which they propose to deal with their good fortune this year
er and i have to say that we're obviously concerned as they are that there's money put in to their side of the community care infrastructure
so i think we would want to be pressing that sort of point er on them
but over and above that you can't be expecting nurses to UNK you'd get more to take over home care duties
you're talking about social care here
peter
just wanted to point out phil last year we had savings on erm the UNK care phase of a hundred and seventy thousand and this on er reference number seventeen it shows fifty thousand er what do you include the whole of that to casualties together
mike can probably come in UNK care but essentially what we have done in the current year is sell places on UNK care where we have needed the income in order to balance our books
the children's plan when you come to it very clearly shows a very sensible wish to move from expensive specialist placements and expensive residential community home placements to more UNK more UNK care more work with families in the community
this is only being put forward not because it's a spare capacity but because it's a choice between selling something and getting income or cutting a service somewhere else
and the choice is actually for us to UNK the use of those a much needed use in some instances in order to get a net income as an alternative to cutting services elsewhere
did you want some formal in relation to the consultation
well at the end of the advice whatever conclusion members reach i'm very i think certainly on those areas erm that they wish formal consultation or discussion erm to take place and the timescale we have to work to
any further views on that and the reductions
well i think the consultation should take place i suppose as soon as possible because i think it's going to create problems er to get the timescale through committee
i think it's best maybe we're into these sort of formal words of consultation and discussion maybe if we invite comment on the service changes really or the reductions or cuts or whatever you want to describe them as er in relation to how they affect user groups
where we have the erm responsibility for a formal consultation er then we need to set about that process as soon as possible to try and meet our deadline mr chairman
be advised by mr
the chair is obviously referring to the fact recently in the courts there was consideration of the closure of old UNK homes and you know that you are under a legal requirement to consult in respect of those otherwise any decision to close without consultation can held to be UNK and that has UNK on some authorities who were going down that route so there is a duty there
there is a specific statutory provision scattered about children's services particularly where children have to be consulted
erm so on that on major services it is UNK upon you to consult erm and detailed advice is given by me to the director in relation to each of the of the er proposals as to when and how consultation should take place
but in some of the major ones the children and the elderly there are quite clearly on the UNK laid down and case law laid down saying you must go through a process of consultation
which means that at the end of the day before reaching your final decision you must hear what people are saying and so you can't take a decision as it were a final decision about a closure and then go out to consultation
it's fairly obvious but it sometimes needs UNK and the timing of your committees obviously this means that there can be a delay in the realization of any er savings that might arise
do we agree then that we proceed down that line about those two elements
yes
well chairman i'm assuming that er the p a g assuming you're accepting will want to discuss with officers the issue id of identification of er homes for the elderly
is that agreed
you want to be very careful er mr chairman how we put out erm information i mean let's face it you know you start sort of raising a lot of UNK if you're not careful and if even if it's totally irrelevant people will UNK on to a particular com comment and make it their own
that's right i'm sure you are yes that's right that's right
well we're already under pressure to give names and we are reluctant to give pressure cos n reluctant to give names because we haven't got them at this stage but we need but at some stage we need to UNK as we as part of the process this need there's a need at least to identify one home within the east of the county
er maybe more than one home particularly as part of the consultation process i don't know
but it's whether the officers do that and start the consultation or whether it's done by p a g i'm getting a shaking of the head here i think it needs a political decision as opposed to anything else
can i just ask mr chairman
are you saying that you will only close these homes if there are very few residents in other words a shortfall
no
may i say something chair
we've got other pressures upon us
well there's such a small saving in homes that's why i'm you know i'm always very UNK to see them go
but we've got other strategic pressures upon us the issue of care in the community which is to provide UNK and UNK care
and as you've seen with previous closures of our homes the last three is that we've been able to utilize some of those resources to provide that shift in policy which has been very successful and has er a process that we've got has UNK people's fears who've been used for those residential home agreements
peter
what er is this not out of true by my visits to various homes and i've been very impressed with the er general conditions the care er of the residents and everything else
but UNK erm it's this is another example of the disadvantaged and those who can least afford it to er look after themselves who're having to suffer
er we don't want to we have a go it's a definite government policy that we will we will we are forced into this corner and as i say it's the disadvantaged who suffer every time
and i would like to think that everybody in on this committee erm very much UNK having to do it but we have no alternative whatsoever
until there's a change of government policy then we can do nothing about it
chairman i'll i'm not wishing to make a political a particular political point but i totally disagree with that
so do i
i think it's very good policy there's many people policy who are in our homes who would give anything to have been able to have stayed in their own homes or maybe stayed with relatives but erm they need the help and care in their homes
i know that's difficult to provide erm and the money's got to be found for that but it it's a mixed blessing putting elderly people into a lot are put into our homes which i agree are very good the majority of them they're very nice but the people who're put into them they give up their own homes and then they get a bit better six months later and they say ooh i just want to go back to my home now
erm you must know that as well as i do so there's it's six of one and half dozen of another
it isn't anything to do with government at all
order
could i say i must reply to that
i'm not against the principle as i said when i came when i was on the council previously when this was first hanging about that there's little doubt about it as it's a good policy but will we get the money to carry it out
we're due in ninety five a reduction in home care services
with everything is being reduced and everything is being squeezed we're looking at the mentally er handicapped people er and their report we're being UNK to look after them as well
but the money isn't there to do the proper job it's a if the money was there to do the proper job i'd say great let's go ahead and do it but in policy or principle it's a wonder there's a lot good things in it but there isn't the money to do it
that wasn't what you said that wasn't what you said and probably the first person to put your granny in a home
i don't think that's going to help
mike on this
well whether we like it or not
order please can i have one meeting please one meeting
whether we like it or not we we've got elderly people to look after a lot of them and whether we like it or not there has been a change in attitude of the government
there's no doubt about that
we er had all these homes they UNK up and what they've decided is that isn't the way to go forward from here on in what we're going to do er we're gonna have what's called care in the community
we get money for doing that but we can't spend it in our homes we have to use it in the private sector so at the end of the day er whether we like it or not we didn't like these decisions but that's the way we've got to go
okay i think the suggestion is that we identify er homes within the east of the county and that is done by the p a g is there any UNK from that
now i don't i don't look for trouble you know me
is there any UNK from that
no
okay
right can we move to capital programme
now show europe please
chairman just before we leave things can i just remind members now that the target set for this committee was a net increase and have that in mind as we go through and that increase is some six hundred and forty thousand pounds which we could show within those papers as having arrived at it in ninety four five
because i think UNK the use of a hundred and eighty thousand pounds of our carry forwards contingency figure which isn't UNK in five six and six seven that the variation in five six before the home closure savings come fully on stream is in fact an increase of seven hundred and fifty four thousand but dropping in ninety six seven some five hundred and fifty eight thousand
i don't know whether this will be acceptable to policy and resources committee or the council at the end of the day but essentially what is showing there is something that taken over the three years meets er a figure equivalent to the annual but it doesn't do it UNK over the three years
and that's something i think members need to bear in mind
the only way of addressing that differently if indeed the guideline is strictly applied and you're required to identify no more than a net increase of six hundred and forty thousand in ninety five six the second year of this programme then you would have to put in additional line of further savings as yet to be identified
i'm not proposing that to you at the moment chairman i'm just pointing it out to members so that there's no confusion on it
and then on the bottom of page sixteen and through on to seventeen is addressing the point that also within the guideline we have been asked we've been asked as a committee to look at the implications of finding up to a further two hundred and fifty thousand UNK worth of reductions
i would have to say chair at this stage that item twenty eight that we put in there in terms of registration inspection now needs to be withdrawn
there is draft er legislation a draft circular has just come out which makes quite clear beyond any doubt that we are required to treat the inspection of our facilities exactly the same way as the independent sector
er we had been at legislation inspection of becoming an a costly service in terms of gross expenditure and therefore we need to look for savings from those areas where we actually spend money erm and the belief was the policy thought was that as our own homes were subject to our own direct management to inspection by members to both internal and external audits erm they were therefore better UNK than the independent sector certainly more widely UNK and therefore the least risk in terms of any reduction on registration inspection would apply in that area
unfortunately it would appear or perhaps fortunately depending on one's views erm the policy has always been quite clear that we should treat them in exactly the same way as we treat the independent sector and that there would be an UNK length independent inspection that has now been made explicitly clear that is the requirement and therefore you would have to withdraw that and say that if there is a requirement to find a further two hundred and fifty thousand UNK worth of savings we will have to go and identify another area rather than that
but if i could just make one small correction chairman at the an error on my part
on item thirty on page seventeen it refers to increased charges above those proposed in item twenty two that should of course read item twenty six
twenty six
mrs
erm just very quickly mr chairman
erm this inspection of homes erm etcetera by members
i just wonder erm if this couldn't be helped if you like by increasing them rather than decreasing them taking over perhaps some of the not absolutely statutory but some of the extra use of staff and i don't know if it's possible but at the moment i worry because some of the homes are only being UNK and visited by members anyway
so i wonder whether i can cut that out completely or
the answer is no you couldn't er in terms of UNK and UNK and in fact your role is likely to be diminished further because the draft circular talks about bringing lay UNK and lay UNK are defined as people who do not have any form of er UNK responsibility for providing a service
now i haven't totally had a chance to talk to mr er about that but i would assume that means you er and so it's moving in the other direction if anything mrs
chair it looks as though it includes not only c councillors but certainly former officers
officers former officers of the council
so the net is cast very wide as to who cannot sit on the
yes well i mean if the worst yes you might UNK you might improve to worry about
okay the final point on the salmon papers erm i have noted at the bottom there that we have not yet settled bids on joint finance for ninety four five
this is again money that the health authority provides it is agreed within joint collaborative committee UNK of health er the county council the district councils and voluntary bodies
and er whilst we do know the total that's available er there's been no er consideration in detail of the bids against that
i've noted there that if you were to bid for funds that had UNK to them and therefore you would be picking up increased costs in ninety five six and ninety six seven that they wouldn't exceed the figure shown at the bottom of the page
i would go further chairman in terms of the version we reach now i would be very surprised if they do reach those figures and er why i would expect them to be substantially less because the policy which is being proposed at this stage is one of using joint finance monies as a one hundred percent grant one off grants for one or two years in support of schemes rather than in as a UNK item
although there will be a small number of UNK items within there erm hopefully chairman we'll have more detailed information before this report is considered by the policy and resources committee in february
comments
well chairman you i think certainly the po the p and r have asked you for your views i mean there's no final er agreements
i think i should say to you at this point that if you're moving into these areas you are moving into what i can or just totally contrary in fact to your policies and directions and er not only that i think we have difficulty UNK
if i can just pick on community homes UNK reduction and we've talked about that already earlier
er we know that there's an o and m report coming through we've got a pretty good idea what's in it
we know that there's a thing called the UNK report which is er leaning all the way for more er and yet we will reducing
so i have to say to you that whilst i'm putting these forward it's absolutely clear that we would be having adverse comments and criticism er from the s i and that you would be moving into areas that i can't recommend to you but i put them forward as obviously illustrations
chair i think we have to reflect that view to the p and r committee
i mean we all know it and we all know there's a lot on this list which are most UNK and they're only there because we've been set the task of reaching a particular sum of money and er if we had the choice we'd be going in the reverse direction and adding
so while we have to discharge our responsibilities and show how these targets are achievable we also are quite right to indicate our feelings about in the manner the UNK er expressed
chair if i might be allowed just thirty seconds comment on the budget from the point of view of some of the central services
there is no doubt at all that where there are reductions er particularly at the edge of our statutory responsibilities this inevitably we know UNK more demands for support from central services particularly legal where we are then brought into dispute and there are complaint machinery and other processes brought into play
i think it's perhaps a small consideration but it does impact on increased demand for those central services
mr chairman er it's an important point but i'm so fed up with hearing people using this as a political issue erm and i'm a high UNK of the government er for many other reasons but i would like to know where these people think the money would come from
perhaps they would tell us if they were allowed to spend more where do they think the funds come from and who do they think's going to pay
well what do
can you tell us what you think it would what you think would happen
let's have it in black and white are you saying that the council tax should go up by many pounds
hundreds of pounds it's such an important issue we ought to have it out in the open and let's tell the UNK what these people say
i'm sorry i'm sorry councillor but you obviously haven't been listening to debate this morning the issue is about the settlement that we have received
it relates to lots of policy areas
and the way in which the whole settlement is UNK against shropshire we hear it on every budget debate
it's not fair that's right
so you're just arguing about UNK allocation it's got nothing to do with government policy affairs about holding cou local government spending er within limits you're not saying that
oh yes well that's part of the issue as well and it has to be part of the strategy
alright where's the money
where does the money come from
it doesn't jus i'd like to know i'd like you to tell the rate payers of shropshire what you expect them to do
are you going to put council tax up two hundred pounds because to meet all the demands of council well that's the sort of thing you're asking me to do
and you know how to blame
well i mean another point is
you've only got to see any tax that goes up and everyone's up in arms about it
if we can't find it where do we go
well when this lot
when this lot goes out to consultation you come back and te to me that other people aren't putting their arms up in air about the reduction in services or what are UNK or what are perceived no hang on
you tell them
i'm a very patient chair or what are perceived as cuts not reductions in services total UNK of services if we actually go down these particular lines
that's because of UNK in previous years
well that is UNK
that's rubbish that's rubbish john absolute rubbish
peter
no i say
good george next
i was only going to say chair that before my time in local government that i've mine as an observer each side er there was no problem for local authorities to raise a rate er there was no restrictions on this and if they thought they could get away with it politically they did and they provided the services that they believed people wanted
there was no problem all that long time ago i don't know why we haven't
well that's the great point of being honest that's a great point
and let's tell the rate payers what we expect them to do
could we move on mr chairman please
yes we need to agree this UNK as it is to go forwards to p and r to expose what the five percent reduction is and to indicate as well to p and r other points that we want to say about these specific services
i think it's been said
i think you've said chairman that you would find this final UNK very difficult to achieve
maybe this the minutes need to reflect that
if we can play them over there
is that agreed then
so the capital programme is er erm as i said earlier the capital programme is not within the guidelines set by policy and resources committee
erm the proposals there do in fact exceed the capital spend on new starts and it will therefore need UNK erm and the proposals that we suggested earlier was that subject to any comments members may have on individual schemes that are here and their views on them we would propose looking at the programme in detail and bringing it within the guideline figures that have been set erm and doing that with the advice of p a g before it goes on to policy panel and policy and resources committee
er i think there are certain papers well further down er the agenda that might be taken to p a g as well in relation to capital programmes so if we can possibly speak about the UNK of the capital programme because i think the idea is that it goes to p a g for UNK
mrs
erm very briefly i think that erm from my knowledge as opposed to bureaucracy other people in charge would know more about it er item two item three erm i think could be certainly reduced in expenditure
this seems erm over the top i erm i don't honestly think the provision of garages is absolutely essential in the light of the things that we've been cutting up which are essential erm and in number two
and i don't really see that erm number three is of vital importance either
er going to number twenty and twenty two erm i would like to know quite what this these large figures are about and quite er what we intend
there's no detail on it it's just very broad sweep various properties continuing programme of improving
number twenty two capital effects to allow for the acquisition of various properties
what do we want them for
how essential are they
you know i mean these sorts of rather broad brush suggestions er a total of i'm not very good at arithmetic something of two hundred and forty thousand pounds those two plus i think an actual reduction in certainly two and three if not erm UNK removal
i think you've got quite a significant amount of money which you could offset what we've been saying just UNK me
yes as i said previously i didn't particularly want to go into the detail because obviously as a member of p a g mrs you'll get an opportunity to see that particular detail
the other point is as well if you don't know the what the outcome of your capital UNK going to be you don't do a lot of work in working up specific projects otherwise it's going to be UNK work
you put in general points but specifically pick your point up on item three to do with UNK church UNK the reports that i read er from the visitors like yourself to go to that children's home identify this as an issue every time
so you so i don't agree with you on that point but anyway the point of UNK the point of UNK the capital programme is there is an im implication of debt UNK er which is part of revenue which could have an implication er upon how we reach our reductions
that's the main reason for the p a g to UNK the capital programme to reflect that before it goes to the policy panel and then to p and r and council
to peter
could i just say that UNK i mean there the parking is obviously a problem that is something that could go by but i mean i went to the last time i went to UNK and walked out and it's before we had all this rain my shoes were under water
in the whole garden and not just and plus a river running through to the to the north side and it is difficult and it is quite a problem and to say that this is not necessary is undoubtedly ridiculous
good UNK holiday
councillor
that's alright mr chairman i think it's been cleared thank you
okay sorry mrs
i'd just like to make a point about robert house and UNK
i'd have thought and it's in support
erm i don't know whether it's anything in the budget for de UNK i think robert house
what's the implication
yes i could use could have a little attention
again chairman it's reflected in the children's services plan up to possible future proposals for robert home
i shouldn't waste too much money on it needs replacing
that's my feeling entirely
anyway is there agreement that there's that this er capital programme and associated papers after our deliberations on are referred to the p a g is that agreed
is that agreed
yes
i'm under pressure for two decisions paul is here to speak to his paper and has to be in UNK at two o'clock and i'm told that the canteen closes at one thirty
are those alternative
is it your agreement that we take paul 's paper now before we look
can i suggest that we take paul 's paper next
which one
where do i turn to next page one
paper i
i
i
all those happy say aye
aye
that's carried
item eight
oh yes
chair do you want me to speak
i should start
yes right
er thank you chair for the opportunity to introduce the paper which i do briefly bearing in mind what i see are all the pressures on you which will go on into the afternoon
erm just to remind you or to draw to your attention erm ladies and gentlemen the fact that the report erm was considered in the first instance by your community care advisory sub committee in september and subsequently by the joint consultative committee in november
er the recommendation to those committees was that they should treat the paper as a basis for consultation it was on that basis that they approved it was my impression that they support it in general terms
the principles of what was proposed
the consultation er that the document was sent out very widely to district councils to voluntary organizations and throughout the county the consultation process was extended until the end of december er replies are now in and i believe there's around a dozen of them
the next stage i understand chair is that a report on the consultation process and what's come out of it will be will be brought in er in the first instance to the j c and the community care advisory committee and UNK with substantive recommendations to this committee and to the health authority etcetera in relation to the substance of the report
very
no i'm trying to catch the chairman's eye
he's now talking and i shall want to speak carry on
very quickly can i just say that in the er UNK in the in the work i did in the which led to the production of the report and the many people i talked to some of whom i see around the table i found on the one hand ample evidence throughout the county authorities the health authority the district councils and the voluntary sector of much evidence of recognition of improved UNK between agencies in delivery of community care in shropshire
especially as compared with those somewhat dark days in terms of specially the relationship between the county council and the health authority
and at the same time and slightly in contradiction to that i found it increasing erm er perception and indication of UNK with the way in which the joint er collaborative structures were actually working if i may say especially at the top level in terms of the political erm so i say to you colleagues that you are required as er by statute to have in place collaborative structures er under a statute that goes back to the nineteen seventies and i should also say to you that up and down the country that authorities like your own are at this stage doing what you're doing and that is reviewing the effectiveness of the operation of those structures and probably coming to much the same conclusions
erm why is that there er that review process is going up and down the country and why is that people are UNK
i would suggest to you colleagues it's because the your expectations and those of the er the other erm stake holders involved in the other agencies about joint planning depends on what you expect the joint structures to carry
a few years ago er the joint planning structures and this is before the introduction of care in the community dealt or came to be seen politically dealing very much with joint finance and although important though it that is it's what's sometimes called funny money it's money at the side it didn't deal with UNK policies and UNK budgets
and following the UNK of the new health authorities some distance was created between those structures and local authorities and so in the early seventies there was a tendency to move apart and not to expect very much from the joint collaborative structures
the introduction the build up to the introduction of care in the community with its formal launch in april erm of last year has in fact increased very significantly the expectations of joint UNK because there you're actually talking about major budgets major planning agreements erm and so a need for a review
however in terms of the recommendations and i shall very quickly come to those and deal with those very quickly chair erm i should just say to you that the be beware of UNK
any review of the structures is not likely to stand for any number of years it's not likely to get absolutely right erm and so be flexible about your approach
in relation to the recommendations chair i just pick on four points the first one is that at the political level the proposal in the paper and i should say erm and this is a matter of judgment but it was widely supported by people i spoke to there was considerable uncertainty and ambiguity in people's minds about the present structure in terms of the responsibilities of the j c vis a vis the community care advisory sub committee
there was a feeling there had been a time when you needed both but for the future it would help in general and offer much better leadership if you were to create one body and since you're UNK obliged to have a j c why not make it actually make it work so it meets more often and it actually actively involves erm er at the political level players at the political level
there was a strong feeling in some quarters especially the voluntary sector but also the district council that questions the degree of representation of all the different interests needed to be looked at hence the proposal that there should be
the annual general meeting of the above named society to be held in UNK village hall thursday the second of december nineteen ninety three at seven thirty p m
society being the UNK society
good and tracy can we have apologies first
yes
apologies from UNK and sue and richard from margaret
any more er apologies
dave jackie david
oh UNK
right any more erm apologies
right then i take it the minutes of the last annual general meeting UNK been circulated already
yes
that so
everyone got a copy
yes
yes
and that's
erm so we'll move on to matters arising and alan has asked me er in the role erm of chairman
er to raise two matters or comments rather than matters erm UNK er new cushions have now been purchased and were used with great success at the october production and alan has asked whether there are any comments we can draw about the success or otherwise of the october production and whether the experiment is worth continuing
certainly was much more comfortable at any rate
we actually sold some tickets from the that we had
seriously
realize that they had cushions on the seats
ah right
before or after
i thought it was a UNK tradition that if you wasn't in any sore in the second act you know you weren't really there
everybody anyone did not feel it was a good idea
yes send them all back
so is that pretty well er approval
good
and from alan the new flats here norman helped by dave and other members has been UNK substantial timber stroke UNK flats although a bit heavier than the conventional UNK they will last for years and they really do provide superb sets as has been proved with all three plays presented this year
thanks are due to norman and his helpers
it says in brackets ask for comments
send them back
would you like to make a gracious acknowledgement of that er you know suitably modest norman
erm
no
sufficient flats to do more or less anything er that you care to choose now
i would like to acknowledge UNK excellence because the UNK was sort of stuck in the past for a long time box set UNK stuff and norman has sort of UNK it made it extremely professional and it really did make a difference to the performances and i'd like to
i would like to thank er for the use of his er workshop and his power tools UNK to acquire the raw materials at a very low cost
happy with that er right good well those were the chairman's er comments matters arising from the minutes of the last a g m erm any further matters arising from the a g m you probably don't need to be told any other business comes later this is purely on the minutes of the last a g m any matters arising
no it would appear not
right we'll now see chairman's remarks which erm since alan is not here has asked me to read
so it's alan's voice even though it's coming out of my mouth
er first of all may i give my UNK and UNK apology for not being here to chair the UNK a g m this is due to a UNK appointment made before i realized that the first thursday in december is traditionally the day for the a g m
it's been another year of achievement for the society the UNK and the forty UNK was a great success and gave a great start to the year
the february play was a UNK of the year with an all female cast our original choice of play was a death trap we couldn't cast it because of a lack of men UNK
now where have i heard that before
the may play tea for two was performed for five nights the proceeds from the extra performance going to the UNK hospital cancer day care ward a cheque for three hundred pounds being UNK received by the hospital
following the performance officials at the hospital and members of the audience were invited to an informal get together an event which was so successful it was to repeated at the october production and hopefully will become a feature at every future production
this is seen to be an excellent p r exercise an opportunity for the audience to meet the cast
UNK heights the october production was also casting difficulties which were only resolved in august unfortunately due to a severe UNK of flu i didn't get to see it hear that all reports spoke of yet another quality production
on behalf of the society i should like to thank all those who contributed to the success of these UNK the actors and UNK staff sound and stage management UNK front of house tea coffee makers programme and raffle ticket sellers thanks also to adrian who has UNK the car park on occasions
in particular thanks are due to the directors of the four UNK julie for UNK john for UNK of the year joan for tea for two and may for UNK heights
our very best wishes go to margaret for her continuing speedy recovery i know that our recently appointed UNK will be very disappointed at not being able to take part in the steel UNK our february production get well quickly margaret and we look forward to seeing you very soon
two of our members have married during the year peter and denise not to each other i UNK to add
mrs
congratulations also to liz and phil on the birth of their daughter
at this stage i should like to thank the committee collectively for the tremendous amount of hard work and dedication put in during the year and for the support which i have received
i'm sure the other members of the committee will forgive me if i mention tracy and david and norman of the last year as secretary treasurer and stage director respectively
all three offices are extremely UNK and take up much of your free time
there was one UNK from the committee in june UNK felt she could not longer continue as publicity officer and we asked UNK to step into that office
thank you UNK for doing so UNK and for demonstrating such enthusiasm ideas and UNK for the job
the appointment of UNK we have another husband and wife team on the committee joyce and fred
so alan suggested that er the pre show committee
the final thank you goes to the village hall management committee and er particularly to margaret not only for her cooperation in arranging show UNK dates etcetera but also her ticket selling
er there seems to have been a rash of UNK recently it all started with david UNK then graham taylor and last week we heard that mary UNK is standing down now it's joan and thank you joan for your sterling work as ticket subscription secretary joan UNK the system and i'm sure that whoever takes over from joan will start with an UNK set of facts and figures
after three enjoyable years as chairman i believe it's time to stand down i shall miss those monthly meetings at thank you betty for all the tea and coffee making but i shall have many happy memories i suppose to me the highlights were the UNK anniversary celebration and the brilliant production of stepping out
i very much hope that UNK society continues to present quality plays extending and satisfying the UNK of our members in every department while at the same time attracting large audiences
the UNK has a fine reputation long may this continue i wish the society every success in the future
that is alan's chairman's remarks
tracy normal to ask for comments or just to accept the
ought to be said really since alan is not here and is erm is UNK well perhaps that could come a little later on because i think both joan and alan er there should be some record other than this about the work they have put in for the society er i mean the only idea i have i don't know how much of a precedent this is whether anybody should be offered life membership of the society or is that only for do you have to reach a certain age
fine i'll be guided by that
personally i felt i mean so many people have been UNK and the UNK
mhm
i think it would wouldn't be
well i think at the very least the society
ought to pass a vote of thanks to both of them for the sterling work they have done and i would be more than happy to er thank you
er well is it the members' wish to thank joan alan for the sterling work they have put in as members and officers
show of hands
perhaps you would be
would it be nice to would it be nice to send a letter from the society putting this in writing
i think so
that he can pin up on the
on the wall
to be used in UNK
right well that's the chairman's remarks so tracy the sorry you're still writing for your letter
well i think i can't stretch the secretary's report much longer than one and a half
right first of all i'd like to apologize for the fact that alan's report and my report especially the first half are very similar
i'm sorry about that
but anyway nineteen ninety three has been another successful year for the UNK which started so far as the UNK are concerned with the pantomime UNK and the forty UNK directed by jill her UNK as a director hopefully not her last
it was also great to see some new faces in the pantomime this year and let's hope that will be a continuing trend
as you are all probably aware death trap originally planned for february had to be UNK despite UNK efforts by the casting committee and john the directors get around the problem of the men or rather the lack of them
nevertheless UNK of the year an all female cast was very successful with house numbers totalling four hundred and thirty
the main play tea for two directed UNK as usual by joan attracted audiences totalling four hundred and sixty and was thoroughly enjoyed by all
the extra performance on the tuesday in aid of the new cancer day care ward at UNK hospital raised three hundred pounds and special thanks go to betty who came up with the original idea and everyone involved who organized the marvellous spread for the UNK afterwards
UNK heights our october play gave may in her role as director a challenge which she UNK well done may
there were a few problems with the casting of the men and staffing for the kitchen but these were overcome and an excellent play resulted a UNK that i think the four hundred and thirty seven strong audience would agree with
the lighting was also a ma of major importance and richard did an excellent job as stage manager thank you richard even though
october also saw the arrival of the much discussed cushions what will we talk about now that
i'm sure we'll think of something
these were given their first test run and UNK about by the audiences for UNK heights a very worthwhile investment
talking of worthwhile investments the new flats constructed by norman and david have been put to good use this year and indeed nor indeed UNK sets get better and better
the success of the wine evening on the friday of the october play was a pleasant surprise to us all with approximately forty people staying after the performance for a glass of wine a look round the set and UNK
as well as involving our audiences more it may also help to attract new members which can only be of benefit to the society let's hope it will be a regular event
unfortunately there have been no social events this year hopefully we can make up for this in nineteen ninety four
i have enjoyed my twelve months as secretary and would like to thank the other committee members for their help and support especially alan
all that remains is to wish you all a UNK christmas and happy new year
well would anyone like to move and second that we accept UNK report and
there's a young mover here
yes and i'm bound to say too while doing so that when pam went erm as was the case when kay went i thought oh UNK how are we gonna replace her
and yet another has emerged from the ranks
so
right then all comments on the second i know we've got any other business coming up but i mean UNK offered a sort of er word of praise for tracy anyone UNK to say something about the secretary's report
the er secretary's re treasurer's balance sheet has been er has been issued i don't broken down er would the am i the only one
no everyone has
has everyone got a copy of them here
has everyone got a copy of
no
the treasurer's report
right erm i'll just go to the thing
we started off with five thousand six hundred and ninety one pounds last year this year we've ended up with four thousand seven hundred and eighty eight pounds
erm basically we've spent more than we've erm taken in but that was a deliberate policy agreed on by the committee we've already mentioned UNK flats erm that has been a most worthwhile expenditure and we've got to look at that as a long term investment because we've got flats which are going to last for years and our expenditure which was getting on for fifteen hundred pounds will not have to be repeated
other things we have purchased which have reduced the balance again the cushions but it this is a long term investment and we should UNK that with extra UNK on cushions rather than on seats
erm the three plays have erm produced two surpluses and one deficit the UNK a UNK surplus
we made two hundred and forty five pounds on UNK of the year one hundred and nineteen pounds on tea for two but that is after we've made the three hundred pounds donation to UNK hospital we made a thousand and eighteen pounds on the UNK heights we lost four hundred and nine pounds but that was basically that we do costume plays and have to hire the erm UNK and set pieces from UNK or wherever we're always going to be in this position and i think it's the tradition of the UNK that we continue to do them and i think we have to accept that we may have losses in future on those particular erm things
i think it's true to say as well isn't it mr treasurer that there's some money ticket money still to come
oh yes
i've still got a few odds and ends that are late
late monies which will go in
yeah
which will actually reduce that figure
that's right
but we obviously have to cut off at a certain time to er get the accounts and audited in time
so there will be a slight improvement on that position but erm i do feel that we have to continue to do them the costume plays we can't just say oh we don't make a profit on it we can't do it i think that would be a very UNK erm philosophy
they are basically the nuts and bolts of the er the report if anyone has any questions i'd rather not hear it
has anyone anything they would like to ask the treasurer or comment kenneth
where did the er donation of sixty seven pounds seventy five come
they were from people who were at tea for two who made donations specifically towards the cancer erm
i see
that is included on the other side in the three hundred pounds that went out
they made specific donations on the night in the knowledge that it all the proceeds were going to the cancer day ward and that helped to boost the figure
any further questions for david
what happens to the car park then
we didn't have one on the last play
yeah but er normally alan er UNK this with our car park warden but unfortunately as was stated it was struck with the flu
yes
i agree that it is something that we must make sure that we arrange in future because people do get nervous about the cars out there UNK and er
i think it would be a very good point
so is everyone erm happy with the treasurer's report
if so could we have a UNK and a seconder that it been accepted
thank you
thank you very much
well now we move on to the election of officers and as you've heard two er officers are have UNK their UNK alan and joan
erm if it means well basically i'd better say how many erm proposals are there for
would you like er tracy now to
there have been five proposals for the er chairman chairman's position and nil proposals for the
so we
well the quickest way of doing is that those officers who are remaining in office erm could be voted back into office and then we can have a vote on the others those that are UNK as it were
yeah
tracy will read the officers who will who are standing again and are UNK
er treasurer david house manager may stage director norman play secretary lynne publicity officer UNK and secretary tracy
well since there is a return UNK it might be nice if we can have a unanimous UNK of that
do we approve that those officers remain in office
show of hands please
purely a UNK
i think that erm er my thanks obviously through erm alan and the meeting for all the hard work that those officers have put it and for their willingness to stand again
erm amateur societies just can't exist without loyal officers and those officers have shown their loyalty by s standing again and we know the special circumstances UNK to the which brings us to the UNK now erm you said we have tracy five erm perhaps you'd better read those names out for us and then i think the best thing to do is to have a closed vote where we give you all a piece of paper on which you state your nomination folded up so nobody else can see we'll put them in a bag and then we'll appoint a couple of to count the vote so that we do not the chairman
i've had two sorry i've had two nominations for chairman
what i meant was when i said five proposals
okay a UNK two members'
sorry
proposals for chairman
makes it slightly easier anyway
i was counting the forms
er the nominations for chairman are and graham
right
so i think erm those two gentlemen will have to leave the room i think while is taken
will you come back
right and now tracy will give you all a piece of paper er keep it secret write your name fold it and
you know who the two candidates are don't you
david and i will act as and er
yes i've got it's a precedent of our
erm it's a pretty close run thing but by a narrow majority your new chairman is graham
perhaps you could give him a round of applause
as the new chairman you'd like to come and take over from me now
sure
er we'd like to thank bert too for standing
pretty close run thing i can assure you
historical interest
yeah
i think it's possibly the thirteenth UNK year i've been on the committee and for the first time i've managed to be elected
patience do you feel wanted
well congratulations graham and thank you bert also for standing
now we committee erm with the UNK of joan as ticket and subscription secretary so all i can do is ask for any nominations from the floor please or any volunteer who would like to follow joan
you heard alan say that erm joan has laid the guidelines down and made the job easier
the trouble is that er erm
yes
is that a yes or a no
someone nominate
anne not to be UNK
bert thank you very much indeed you're now ticket and subscription
thank you
er secretary
that's excellent
now in the election of auditors i gather it's down to a UNK david
well bert has audited erm these i don't know whether he's er UNK from doing so by his being ticket secretary not knowing the er
i think it would be a bit unusual
yes but not against the constitution
i don't think it's against the constitution that er it would be a bit unusual to find him involved in handling money to be involved in he went to UNK or UNK or in a bid to see each other it's a possibility
no problem it's just it's i think it's a bit er just a conflict of interests
well that's right
any UNK any nomination for then
the only one i could suggest is tim but he's not here unfortunately
could he be approached
he'll probably be in the pub later on
er i'll approach him if you want
anyone second UNK nomination then
he's the next treasurer isn't he
yeah
right so tim is nominated by bert has to be approached i think be approached
well that's got all the short bits done now out of ten any other business
and as tracy said the cushions is no longer an issue but erm
one thing we did discuss at committee but i think it ought to be put to the a g m we discussed the increase in the cost of er admission erm we held our prices down for at least a couple of years we had a heavy UNK on cushions i do feel that erm we ought to put in to the meeting what we discussed at committee that be raised from two fifty and one twenty five to three pounds and two pounds for the concessions including students and erm the youngsters
i feel it ought to go before the a g m rather than just be agreed
ken
why mr treasurer do you propose this increase
well they're getting UNK seats and we're star well as you can see from the last play UNK heights that erm we actually lost money on that i know it will happen but i feel that we ought to erm go along and get into a UNK position again
i would suggest that if you put the tickets up to actually give them a raffle ticket on entrance you know so that they feel they're getting sort of and
yes
and members of the cast donate the prizes you know just one prize each or something a box UNK which i'm sure won't hurt
i know i agree with the committee but on the year we have actually made money is that right
yes
no we were actually twelve hundred pounds worse off this year
the actual show has actually made money
yes a lot
so if we take forget the cushions and the UNK which are you know
non returning
yeah
yeah
is it er justified
do you really think it's justified
it's very to keep the prices down as low as possible i think
yeah and you
and if we are making money on the shows is it justified
perhaps you'll open that to
in fact i feel the price we charge for concessions and youngsters is a UNK we might as well give them away for nothing
i really feel that no four twenty five is absolutely silly
i think i think
yeah
i'm thinking of either three pounds a ticket you're getting close to the price of a special chauffeur
erm i feel for the quality of the show that they're seeing two pound fifty is nothing
i really feel two pound fifty is low for the quality of play that they're seeing i mean other amateur groups not that we're comparing ourselves but they certainly charge more than us and quite honestly the end product on some of them is not up to our end product
pam you wanted to make a comment
well you're raising er the price of tickets by fifty pence aren't you
and the concessions by seventy five why don't you
i'll raise them both by seventy five
no it it's because they are nice round amounts one twenty five is has been such a UNK amount it it's it really has
one twenty five irrespective of who's going in it really is a UNK amount
yeah i think that the
what about the range of concessions of pensioners erm you know free tea and coffee
so that they're not having to find money for that as well as their ticket they get it sort of all in one price
tea and coffee
you'd have to know in advance
mm right
linda
i think erm i think is quite fair maybe if concessions could be raised to one fifty or two pounds but overall i think that people who can afford it spend such a lot of money on the raffle and we therefore give raffle tickets to those who can afford it could UNK and on the raffle generally about a hundred pounds is made and if there if there was more charge for tickets people might not give so much for the UNK and also if you give but if you charge them a UNK sum and then shove other things at them on their options they might be more willing to give to optional choices like a raffle
i think the problem is that if you're not careful this will leave the UNK erm somebody said well i don't mind paying two fifty or three quid so what you'd gain on the seats you'd lose on the side
er i mean that that's not an attempt to UNK or anyone but it you know people are very traditional and if the UNK has always charged reasonably and suddenly there seems to be rate of inflation and this sort of thing you know as linda said they might think okay i'll pay three quid but i'm UNK if i'm buying any raffle tickets
so really it is a case of UNK and roundabouts
any more comments obviously i think we're gonna have to take er
oh well obviously
before anything else
any anyone else like to make a comment
oh yes i'd like to erm er concur on what linda just said about options i don't think we should give erm raffle tickets away as has been suggested
i think some people do give UNK when buying raffle tickets and particularly they like the fact that the tickets are so cheap so we should continue to give them that option
erm for what it's worth i'll give you my suggestions about what we should do as far as ticket prices are concerned er having taken in a view of the most important factor of the treasurer's comments but also bearing in mind that we did have high recurring expenses this year which won't apply in future and we're not here to make money
i suggest that the erm ticket price should be two pounds fifty as it is now and that the UNK price should be increased to two pounds
that's what i suggest
yeah that's what i said
yes i agree with that
i'm not asking for a vote on it i'm simply giving you my opinion
are you qualified for two for the UNK
concessions are pensioners er and students and that's students with a student card and children
and children
and children as well
yes
actually one twenty five to two pounds is quite a steep increase
for pensioners
yes
well concessions
yes
erm oh obviously we're going to have to vote on UNK eventually
one fifty
one fifty i think would be more reasonable
i think to jump from one twenty five to two pounds is
if we do that we're only adding twenty five pence more revenue
the last play i worked out that w we had one four hundred and thirty seven of those thirty seven would be er UNK to the homes in to bring it down to about four hundred and on the ticket money we took in i would say about a hundred and twenty of those were erm er concessions
how many over the year roughly
i would have to guess at the others because i didn't do erm sums on the other ones it was only on the last play but if it's on the same sort of erm UNK then i would say somewhere around thirty percent of the audience are concessions
i just have to multiply that the figure by twenty five or divide by four pounds it's no small sum
even though twenty five er
two fifty to one fifty i think will be er
yes i think so
about five hundred over the year or six hundred or talking about a maximum of twenty pounds taken over right thank you
it could be included in the of course ticket would increase the potential
the trouble is that there's the a vast difference in the concessions
yes
to the full price ticket and i think
oh it's half price
yeah
two fifty would you do you think two fifty and one fifty is the closest it can go
i mean when is a UNK not a UNK
if it's too close together it's like it's not really a UNK
i think that's fair enough one fifty to
well shall we have a vote on those two figures then
you see if that goes through there's no point in trying another one
as a matter of interest on the raffle side david is it basically the two pound fifty person that buys the majority of the raffle tickets
yes
i would say
yes
so the
so they're the ones then that like linda said are paying two pound fifty
then they are
so they're spending three pounds
whereas erm
to concessions
perhaps will buy in couples
that's right
and two pounds for concessions children and students
that is the proposal so the suggested a maximum first could we have a show of hands on ticket prices of two pounds fifty and one pound fifty
can we have a show of hands on that
may well
yes
the erm proposal falls by so er tracy and david have made a note of this and thank you for
backup check
why don't you want
because from one
he said he would do it
i think we should up it from eight pounds it's worth it isn't it
we arrived didn't we at the eight pounds mark because
yes
that was what we were sort of we gathered in
and we broke even
we broke even on UNK of the year and lost twenty eight pounds on the UNK
i think it ought to be a regular feature a regular feature for everywhere regardless because it was felt that er during the may play which proved to be wrong
er you know i think it should be for everywhere
it should
i i've had
so sorry
people coming to me audiences members of the audience coming to me and saying oh what about the car park
yeah yes
you know on the couple of occasions not arranged anything
well would you like to propose that the matter be referred to the committee er to make a suitable appointment or appointments
yes i'll propose
make it official rather than just
get some publicity out of it as well
and a seconder
i'll second that
fine
so we have a UNK and a seconder that the committee take on board the provision of a car park steward for want of another word
thanks for the suggestion
may i suggest that er we get some money together specially to pay this
say we have a social event i'll do that
raise say a hundred pound or seventy five and then that can go towards payment er the payment for someone to patrol the car park for the plays
or thirty two pounds or whatever
even if we raise twenty pounds a performance for it
well
or should that be referred erm er well do we accept that suggestion that UNK
you are UNK with a social event to raise money for a car park steward
right
any oth other business is still open
two and half hours before the pubs close
to say something
yeah
it
we're not quite getting this clear it's an excellent idea
erm but one of the reasons that we got the audience was so that they obviously the audience were prepared to pay for the fact that
there's nothing to stop us still asking nice little UNK as they say
yes i it could be a nice little UNK as er you suggested
a nice social event
this really is committee work but i it does occur to me that mention it that erm if in our advertising we point out that we have a car park attendant and if that car park attendant were to let one slip through his fingers me were we may well then be liable to be sued by the person who
oh yes
i mean this is the kind of comment we will get from somebody who has spent the past five years on the village hall management committee
i think that i think we've agreed that is to be taken on board by the
committee
by the committee
we'll put it in
any other business
can i express thanks to the president for taking this meeting it's been very interesting
what that i have or the meeting has
thank you
can i second that
well
erm all that remains is to say thank you all for taking the trouble to turn up and show an interest in the administration of the society
the remainder of the evening is at your disposal
right shall we
yes start where we the last meeting i guess
right the last meeting was nineteenth of january last wednesday
present were mark bob john andrew
no apologies received
erm mark UNK
and we decided not to record the meeting because we had objections which is fair enough
UNK report
steve reported on UNK green car park UNK
he'd been asked to get in touch with mike for advice
erm and mike told us that new reports UNK commissioned by the city council and the new owners claimed there is no danger
mike said that the chemicals involved were mobile as well as being UNK and their ability is a potential explanation for lack of results in the council's study
there is legitimate concern that the meeting decided that little could be done at this time we might be able to contribute to the campaign at a later stage
leaflets UNK campaign were distributed
erm to be discussed at a future meeting for steve to speak on the subject
that's for now
it's being
erm secretary's report
the stall is booked for saturday for the energy conservation bill campaign
erm and i i've requested an application form from the city council for a demonstration for the big box pile up on the twelfth of february
letters have been sent to hugh about both of these campaigns
the police shelter erm both sets of student UNK and dick and your own candidate erm asking for their help with the big box pile up
correspondence had been received from the green machine and the secretary was asked to write for more information because we weren't convinced with exactly what they were doing
erm we'd also received information from the north yorkshire european erm i've got m y e c o and i can't remember what the c o stands for
limited which seemed mostly to involve advertising and but i'd written off and told them their candidate was
we'd received a campaigns update from central office and had registered the big box pile up campaign with that campaign coordinator
we decided to buy twenty letter box stickers which i am to send for and give you the cheque to this end
treasurer reported that there was no change and then there suddenly was because andy demanded to be paid for production expenses
so we all got very excited because it was the first money we'd spent for a long time
membership secretary circulated the latest membership list
john agreed to check that there aren't any more problems with our membership with john at central office just to make sure that we're all sorted
UNK coordinator distributed the postcards that he'd he printed and the s t v voting regulations he was requested to bring on
is on the way
no matters arose from previous minutes
the energy conservation bill
agreed to take to set up and take down the stall and be there for most of the day
andy agreed to go and help set up and bob likewise
mark said he'd get along later on when he could
we decided to use our green ballot box that we made and painted for the maastricht campaign for people to post their cards into so that we can count them at the end and post them all together
erm hopefully terry reported that he'd received a reply to his initial letter about the energy conservation bill
confusing facilities
mark shortly to get a l c two computer and suggested that it may be green party especially if we could purchase a suitable printer
petty cash and major UNK
ten pounds was given to forty five UNK and a donation towards the phone bill
as the secretary's doing a lot of postal work helen to keep the petty cash tin and present the book at each meeting for inspection
she was also given a cheque for nineteen pounds to buy a hundred second UNK second class stamps for the postcard campaign
the secretary then gave a briefing on the big box pile up campaign
he explained that it was something like new party policy on homelessness and would involve a march into town UNK up lots of boxes and collecting signatures on a UNK type UNK to give to hugh
under any other business UNK challenged ha reported that he had challenged british nuclear advertising campaign in which they claimed they're going to cause pollution
erm unfortunately the advertising standards didn't UNK the complaint but at least we made a point
tasks to carry forward to the next meeting
helen had to write to penny erm UNK the all green party's objection to the supporters scheme that the national party are putting out
helen was about conference accommodation and john agreed to write to jean complaining about the miserable letter they're sending out to people who've UNK
items to carry on to future agendas included the UNK and affiliation and working with other groups
and the meeting adjourned at nine thirty two
okay does anybody object to those minutes or are we willing to pass them as a pretty accurate account
well we need to go to the reports first
yeah
yeah
he has an officer's report
yeah
oh right
no you're right we agreed
the matters arising holds you off the reports
right oh
so any objections to those minutes
no
right
the secretary's minutes
ha you haven't seen the spelling
UNK report please before we have to spell check the minutes
well UNK enough i don't actually have one this week because the only things i have to report are covered at in under energy conservation bill
so unless er anyone has any direct questions for me from the meeting erm
erm can you confirm that we're doing the green world UNK
ah excellent yes
that is erm one piece of good news
we've confirmed that we're doing er the mail out for green world five
that'll be the weekend of the twelfth thirteenth of february
erm the pay will be slightly less than last time
erm but there we go er and everything's under way for that
and erm it should be reasonably light work
we we're keeping it under the first weight bracket er for cost reasons
and there's there will be about four thousand to do
so same as before we'll be coordinating it from forty five UNK and we'll erm be open house for volunteers and i'll draw up a UNK
erm we'll go for a couple of social eve evenings but probably the bulk of it will be during the day the er saturday and sunday
and that as far as i know is that
that's on behalf of the national party it is
that's right
that green world is the new national newsletter which took over from news and erm because i'm on the UNK board
right
and i'm the mail out coordinator we've so far UNK out all but one of the of the new magazines and er we didn't do the last one but we're UNK up for doing this one
and it's the sort of
i wondered how i wondered how there was a personal message on one of my er green world
what we tend to do we get bored after the first two thousand and we start writing people letters
absolutely yeah
erm and it's a birthday issue and a quite an important one for setting up for the UNK and the mail action
so there'll be the great world six will come out just long enough after the may elections to record our UNK er as stop press
so er yes
so er this one is setting everybody up for may and starting the process for erm for june the UNK and well to a certain extent we're building up already for any editor content
so issue six will come out between the local and the euro elections
that's right
just after the er soon after the may elections as physically possible
mm
with the deadline printing UNK
do we have a secretary's report
we do
erm i haven't heard anything yet erm about the UNK form from the erm city council so i'll give them a boot up their UNK because it'll be a week since he said he put it in the post so
so erm so i can't confirm booking for that yet but we do have one more meeting before the big box pile up so not to worry
i wrote to green machine
no reply as yet
erm i ordered and received the letter box stickers this morning
so if anybody wants to buy a letter box UNK your chance
the actual size they said
how much did we say in the newsletter
well we didn't
erm
oh didn't we
i might be able to find it but i didn't put no i can't
didn't we put it in
no because we didn't have them then and there's another newsletter shortly so
oh alright
erm
and there wasn't space
erm okay in that case erm think of a number
no we paid what one pound fifty for
we paid ten p each well ten p each plus fifteen p UNK
probably somewhere in the region of twenty p each
no exactly UNK fifteen p
fifteen p mm
yeah but if we charge twenty p each we're actually making a profit selling them
that was the idea
i
well the people who make them sell them for forty p er twenty p rather
i UNK move that we do similarly
lets
stack them high and sell them cheap
erm oh we'll they're going to go for twenty p plus cost of the UNK addressed return envelope
yeah
friend
which is slightly more than some people do with their money
erm where are we
oh yes orders to receive letter box stickers
erm lisa is that i'm not quite sure from the york university student rooms is in to help us with the big box pile up
and having spoken to her on saturday when she came along to the energy conservation stall i intend to invite her if it's alright with the meeting to our next meeting which is on the ninth of february to discuss how the UNK can help how the university UNK can help us with that demonstration
and perhaps UNK a link you never know
so if that's approved i'll give that a tick and so we can bring it up again later
great
erm i've also received information on conference accommodation and on the UNK but i've UNK those as separate items so that you don't listen to me half off all evening
that's it
okay
do we have a treasurer's report in absent here
no he's absent
he's
but i do have something from the membership secretary
right so that's other officers
membership secretary
well the membership secretary if i can remember how to spell it erm mm has indeed been in touch with erm john who very kindly sent us a free copy of erm their version of our membership list
which is how we found out that one that we have a new member erm sally who i'll add on to my list and er send a newsletter to
also joan ian and mrs green erm we all thought they joined locally and the national party have no record
it's the same old story
erm john has suggested that we send their membership on and then that's definitely it
we're now all up to date and we agree with head office and we can take it from here
erm one minor alteration on that point
i've got a membership card for possibly er previous
from january
sort of yeah from the end of UNK er
you've got six month's free membership don't worry about it
yeah i wasn't worrying about the six month's free membership
but it does put in rather six months out of phase with the local membership so at least
well john sorted that he's brought you up to date now
mm
because you know it's the same thing
i was gonna give the er local party er it'll be sixteen months worth local membership
if you want to give us a donation that's entirely welcome
perfectly acceptable
i'll buy some
i've already bought some
yeah
bought some more er
so what joe wanted the meeting to decide is should we ask mark to send off a cheque for those three people
i think that's the only way to proceed to sort out this UNK once and for all
yeah
you see apart from anything else if those people joined through us then we must make good
and we fixed it
the UNK fixed so
yeah
it has to be fixed by either us or the national party
we can't ask those people for money if they've already joined once
okay
erm i'll get mark to send a cheque off when he gets back from
okay is that oh i suppose as another officer i can er tell you that the newsletter has indeed been finished and gone out
erm i would like to apologize on behalf of myself and my proof reading team for the fact that two calls for nominations that erm that are in this newsletter don't actually appear to have closing dates on them
oh god
which is a bit of a UNK cock up from us
at least on my part i'm if i had my UNK hat on i'd er blame the proof reading team as well
but er i suppose really i er
well you forgot to read it because you threw coffee over me
i suppose the blame is at least almost entirely mine
if not entirely mine
so i would like to ask the meeting whether erm i suppose technically for advice on this topic
think we can get away with putting out another newsletter on the seventh of february with a ballot in it anyway for these two things even though we didn't
yes
i think so
i mean er i doubt whether we'll have a full slate in february anyway so i mean they'll probably be the option for people to come in later and we'll probably end up co opting people later and er i think we should
yeah alright
i'm pleased you think that because it gets me off the hook now
i think that because i don't think people wait until the deadline to er respond anyway
helen
erm i think technically we're actually constitutional because it doesn't say anything in the constitution about us having to publish the deadline
it just says that we have to make the call for nominations so long before we put out the selection ballot
so they can do it from they can work it out for themselves actually
briefing
ah so it's alright
so everybody who got the newsletter when they read it should have thought aha best look up
i'm sorry
my copy of the constitution that i filed away so neatly when i received that months ago
i think perhaps an apology and erm and an in er the next newsletter might be appropriate for
otherwise we'll phoning us up and complaining
you'll probably be ringing people up anyway trying to get them to understand
yes i agree entirely
i don't think people are going to be disappointed if they miss out
great
otherwise i if it's appropriate i'll say it looks like a great newsletter
yeah
right on the newsletter front the other thing is the next newsletter we said would go in the post by the seventh of february
which is actually two days before we next have a meeting which means i'm gonna have to slap another one together in a big hurry
so i'm collecting things to go in it
er those things should include well something about the box erm next day or whatever i can find
details of about where and when
i've got a thing from steve about erm planning permission or application for UNK c that i didn't have room for in this newsletter
right
he wrote it and handed it to me for this newsletter and i ran out of space
could put the green councillors ten reasons to be one in i suppose
yes
oh yes definitely
anything to fit
it will depend what the space situation is
a nice UNK can go in
advert for the letter box UNK want stuff or is it contact through the office to
yes
unless you have unless you have supplied a specific date
erm if you like i can provide a specific UNK
seeing as it is the you know the birthday edition
it will it is quite nice er make a thing of it
i think also if we could have some sort of UNK when people could turn up
yes sure
okay i'll knock those up and i'll have to run that by my household
mm yeah
so when do you need those by then
erm er middle of next week i suppose roughly
okay
i would say next meeting is at it's the one time we're going to have one
erm and do we have anything else to go in this newsletter
erm
i could keep one in the green UNK advert
yep
yeah
certainly
fine idea
and if anybody thinks of any more diary dates or anything
yeah i'll let you know
i think there might be a i've got one announcement you can put from that
again if i collect more material than i have to use no problem
got an item on media watch there did anyone notice that the green party was actually mentioned in the guardian today
no
quite a celebration
wow
about two lines commenting on the government's erm you know growing strategy
documents that they put out yesterday
mm the most we've had for months
i know absolutely
wow
first mention i've actually seen in months
do we put i wonder who statement for that
that's not mine
right er well i think i've probably finished UNK for what i did
write in the newsletter erm
thank you for getting it out so quick andy
no problem i'm sure
in future i'll try both to get the dates that are supposed to be in there and get the copy into my mouth rather than my UNK
okay do we have any other matters arising from the minutes
because i do
i've decided that this isn't any other business at all
i've got a picture of hugh
have you
yeah i've got a picture of hugh with one end of a UNK poster
yeah
because er he was down there er trying to dip his nose in the toxic chemicals
down at UNK when we were getting er postcards filled in
our UNK looking
i think you can have a rest after campaign
erm
do you know what this is about
UNK green
yeah i've read about it
according to this thing in the paper they er had a hundred and thirty people
mm
and er
hundred and thirty
well that's what is says there
you could
quite a lot don't they
UNK were joined by york mp hugh bailey and city councillors as they gathered at UNK on saturday
erm i'm surprised that slightly surprised that with council and hugh were willing to go down given what we had given our information about how dangerous or not the site actually is
that it's not very nice but it's er
i didn't know UNK was gonna be that
yes
until it mentioned
they're also apparently with ill health and amongst people living in the surrounding area
whether there's any truth in this is and the a e who did the er survey include atomic energy authority who who's like that as well
right okay
i think we must have missed a briefing from
must have done
might be the one when you were away
right well there's a nice er we did get in the paper
we did
mm
right any tasks to carry forward
well erm steve asked to write letters to penny
i don't know whether jean got john to have written to jean or not
i think he might have done but he didn't say
erm apart from that i think we've done everything this week
can you just quick quickly fill me in on what this letter to penny is
it was about the UNK campaign in the last
yeah
there's an article about erm where is it here somewhere
it's basically offering people erm rather than becoming members they can become a supporter for five pounds a year of the green party for which they get three UNK up beat UNK and this week it was two sides of a four
together with two further appeal letters
i've just noticed she actually uses the sentence being a green party supporter isn't meant to appeal to everyone
erm and the meeting felt that it asks it asks for views from local parties and we felt that the amount of money
they're gonna make you're gonna spend nearly a fiver sending all that out to people and really we should be encouraging people to be members and not to just give us money from time to time
and in my own role as the as being on the UNK board of the newsletter erm we need all the effort that we can going in into that really
there's some justification for having green link as a separate publication but even that is under question in the coming twelve months because our circulation just doesn't warrant all of these publications
there we can barely sustain green world at the moment
so erm having an extra network and all of the administration that goes with it seems very much a waste of time especially when it creates another tier of sort of UNK membership
funny business
so er we've gotta sort of
object
we don't think this is a very good idea seeing as she's asked
okay erm can we move on
conference accommodation and finance
right erm
as requested i wrote and asked about self catering accommodation at the conference and i received a reply saying that there's one house that erm she's come across that she thinks might be particularly suitable for us
it's a house for where are we for six people
in other words it UNK six erm and the UNK willing to have one person sleeping on the floor officially
slot more people in appropriate
erm two single bedrooms and two double bedrooms plus a living room all facilities erm except for sheets and UNK
which we'd have to take
what no sheep
no sheep no
erm it would cost for the four for the four nights of the con conference that's from the wednesday night to the saturday night inclusive six pounds a night each will almost cover the cost and we've fitted in an extra person on the floor at three pounds a night that would clear the cost completely
and she said to let her know straight away if we think it might be suitable
erm steve and mark and i are definitely interested so that's three people so we're looking for another three people to share
bearing in mind that if we do have the whole house then people are only coming for a few days or even one night could no they had somewhere to stay
erm and along with this we were thinking about ways to UNK conference for people and this might be one way to do it for the for york green party to pay part of the cost of UNK the accommodation
erm on the understanding that for any green party members that want to use it over the conference
that's just a proposal it's an idea
so there you go
how many people have said that they're going so far
well er me and steve and mark and you you're going
yeah
too aren't you
so that's four of us definitely going to
erm alison says she'd like to but her you know it depends on this that and the other
yeah
i i'm definitely going to i picked this up from the information places
it's got all a list of all sort of bed and UNK and
oh
holiday flats and things
and the holiday flats in here are quite expensive
but bed and breakfast are all very cheap
erm you know
where whereabouts is this is it
i don't know she didn't say
didn't that's one thing i don't know
cos if it's two or three miles away it's gonna be a bit of a problem
yes that's right
erm i need to check that
how much erm are the b and bs
well quite cheap
i mean about ten pound is the cheapest and perhaps even twelve
the extra advantage of the of the house would be cooking which we may get
because if people took advantage of the of these facilities it would make the whole business an awful lot cheaper for them
and if there's four of us there definitely then that's we only each have to cook once while we're there
yeah
to get out of conference to go to cook
if it's close
yeah
if fact it's i found it in the past to be a welcome very welcome break from the atmosphere because you can't hang around in the dining hall without talking a green party
as i remember it conference tends to run through until new clients so
not really
so long as we're talking about sort of half a mile away ma maximum or with other sort of proper travelling arrangements
if it's half less than half a mile away then it's fine but if not it starts to becoming UNK
the other thing about financing it
so i haven't done the sums in my head
how much is it actually to get a place
well if it's six pounds for six people that's thirty six pounds a night isn't it
for four nights
plus three
plus a bit
so it's about forty quid a night and there's thursday friday saturday sunday
it's four nights
so that's that sounds quite a lot to ask the political party
oh i wouldn't ask them to pay
yeah
that would be too much
but it's one way of distributing any money that the party wants to give to UNK people so that everybody can benefit from it erm rather than means testing
i'm happy as long as we get the definite six people definite
we i think you know we can do go into just four people
i i'm quite happy to come in on it
i think i probably would like a single room though
are there two single rooms
two single and two double
yeah well on a first come first serve basis a single room i'd come in on it
well UNK enough i think we'll have to have double rooms
well if we do only get four people it's going to be more isn't it
yeah
it's going to be ten pounds a night each
yes erm
roughly and you don't get breakfast thrown in
no that's right
i would hope to be able to party conference probably only which would mean turning up either friday night or saturday morning
so potentially two nights out of the four
does it have an address helen
no it's through erm
right i just wondered if she gave you an address cos it you know got a super little town map here
if i was being cynical i'd volunteer UNK car to get people to and from the town
if it was a long way out
well he said that was a possibility but i really so
but then again
erm but then it starts getting very silly
i mean this is basically she's she already books some flats and house a house because self catering UNK in such short supply because of long lets over the winter
do we need to proceed on this now
do we need to see if we can draw up an extra
i think one of the ideas behind the party UNK in on this is because it would be extremely convenient for people who are popping in at the last minute for
mm
for a night or two to have somewhere that they know they can at least UNK on the floor
where you know so as not to have to risk going having to go to an expensive b and b because all the cheap places have gone
so to a certain extent the idea was to that if we had the thing worked out it would be of great benefit to the people who were popping by
erm whereas at this stage the four of us could probably find accommodation which wasn't that much more expensive erm but to have the actual focus for the for the local party
could we have people to pay the six pound a night and erm you know a hundred and forty four to start with and just ask people to pay the six pound a night anyway and just get as much back as we can
yeah
cos six pound a night isn't bad
it's less than we pay in wolverhampton
oh it's very reasonable yes
it would be possible i suppose with the commitment of people for the local party to make on the committee
i mean i have a couple of ideas
i was going to ask mike if he wants to come as an observer because he's never been to conference and erm
and when it comes
he was talking about spending a weekend with us anyway so it might be nice thing to do
when it comes to that though there will be people from other green parties who who'll be looking for accommodation so at the last minute we can
dick for example
yeah
we're hoping that we'll
if he's coming he might like to be
to be
there's a good chance of filling most rooms most nights i would have thought
well shall i ring joyce back and say providing it's close erm we'll have it and take it from there
okay
oh i haven't written
shall i alert dick to its existence then
yes i think that would be that would be a nice thing to do
cos that would be a nice definite
okay
i'll make a decision when i'm in a position to
well this is why it would be a good idea to so people will have to decide in advance and just see how we go for
do you have to send off a deposit or anything
i'll find out when i ring and she'll
if i do i'll be ringing round UNK find out what to do
i would suggest that given the decision we prepared to make now even if you have to send a deposit get the local party to stump up the deposit and collect the money as soon as convenient from the people who are committed to going
is that agreed with all of you here
sure mm
since the local party's going to cover the shortfall anyway if there one
okay
she'll be UNK rooms to people
UNK land for the green party
right is that erm
okay presumably i should put something again in the newsletter about conference and this accommodation thing
yeah
yeah it means that you can point out that it makes it a lot simpler for someone to just pop over for a night and crash out on the floor
are you coming to conference at all
no i won't be er my family situation can change so
oh
don't have to do things like erm
we can always run a little UNK actually for UNK from scarborough got a baby as well
give over one of the rooms to people
when is it
it's er the first weekend in march
anyway shall we
okay shall we move on
do you want to tell us all about the stall for the energy conservation bill
certainly
yeah the stall was extremely successful
we kicked off at eleven and went on till three and there were i think six people UNK er in the course of the day bob andy mark and myself and chris
a late showing from the man himself
and erm i was particularly pleased to get chris along because he was extremely effective
erm what we were doing was filling in these postcards asking mps to turn up on february the fourth to support the energy conservation bill when it has its er second reading in parliament
and erm it was ex it was great having chris along because erm he went out and grabbed everybody in the street pulled them in onto the stall and er and got them got them to sign on the dotted line so to speak
er he came along after the UNK green er demonstration
which he described incidentally as a bit of a damp
and they all they all ran away very soon after the press left
so he came along and did some work for us
apart from that erm the scores on the doors forty six postcards were sent out which doesn't sound perhaps like very many but is in fact quite a lot of work when you're having to find people who's who people's mps are for them and so on
and we were we covered sixteen different mps which is especially good news because hugh bailey normally supports the bill and as far as we know is likely to turn up and vote for it
but getting out to mps like erm john UNK the energy UNK for the labour party and so on
and john UNK
john UNK right yeah
lots of people who are marginal erm we don't know erm ourselves if they're intending
so this might help tip the balance
and because in with it it's a national campaign
it's er it's all to the good
and so it's keeping up the good work that's of lobbying mps to such a degree that they they've got to back it which is what's brought it to its second reading as one of the most popular er private UNK bills in history
erm we received eleven pounds eighty seven in donations
er the cost of stamps was eight pounds seventy four and therefore our profit
profit was three pounds thirteen pence
not bad for somebody who thought it was going to cost us money
so people gave us money for the stamps that we put on and other people gave us donations
all round erm it was great
we had our presence
it's a very effective direct piece of lobbying and at a time when a lot of people who obviously weren't green party supporters behind the campaign
the cross party campaign for the for the bill which we've written
so
the only political party ever to have two pieces of legislation in the house of commons without having any m ps
i'd just like to second that it was a good day and also to point out as the er man who made the postcards we shouldn't get too excited about this as a money making scheme
because most of that three pounds UNK probably been paid for out hundreds of sheets of cardboard
so
but considering we were we were
didn't make a loss
i held ten fifteen pounds for the privilege
relation thing
every time i do a stall i UNK in my boots up until i do it and then i feel great when we're doing it and afterwards realize that it's been productive and we we've had a good lot a good response from the public
so there we go
helen do you want to tell us about the next stage
yes
seeing as we all filled in our postcards ages ago we can write some more letters this week
or tomorrow
i can give you a list of people to write to
first of all there's robert UNK m p
this is the man who erm replaced erm mr UNK
oh yes
with his trousers down
now i think erm ron was a bit upset because he spent most of christmas sending christmas cards and saying please let this bill go through don't give it any
and he said oh alright then what's your wife like
erm however
no that's right
erm tim erm you know having UNK have design resigned he was followed by robert UNK mp for south UNK
now mr UNK former job is as minister in northern ireland so he's unlikely to know a lot about what was going on in the in the commons at the end of last session which is a bit unfortunate
he's been hiding under a under an agreement
he should at least be a very effective man
well it's important to get his support so that's one person that we can write to erm seek support
that's robert UNK m p
what
also
is his actual title
sorry to UNK in
he's the secretary of state for energy or minister for energy
minister yes sure
secretary of state for the environment wasn't it
minister for the environment
it's UNK isn't it
no i'll come to that in a minute
oh
UNK is the secretary of state
yes
and he's an expert on all this
john UNK secretary oh he sent two postcards to you from his constituents
erm secretary of state for the environment and robert g hughes who's the environment whip
but it's important that you get robert g hughes and not robert hughes who is labour mp for aberdeen
so
aberdeen north i take it
yeah
so that's robert g hughes mp for UNK
do you know his
UNK east
he's environment whip
yeah
there are more
right i want
but i think UNK that's probably enough work for all of us for the rest of the week
and john UNK was
secretary of state for the environment
right
because i've already written to UNK cos that's in the newsletter
yeah
so he's secretary of state
i'm asking the people round the table to write these extra couple of letters because we must be activists because we're here by definition
and so we're likely to i think if i put the whole list in the newsletter it might have put people off
yeah
erm
yes is it all about this any more in the newsletter next newsletter
no because i think by the end well unless something dramatic happens on the fourth of february which is this friday next friday rather
if it does i'll be on to you straight on the phone
but otherwise i don't expect to need any more work on this for this friday
yeah
but we ought to have something about having a second reading in it anyway
oh of course yes
because it's news
yes indeed
even if it's stop press
probably getting tight for monday the seventh anyway
brilliant
on a point of information helen what can happen on this second reading if
right i can i can tell you
erm there'll be a whole a whole day's debate on the bill which is an achievement in itself
at the end of which a number of things can happen
firstly the bill can go through on the nod with no note
this is possible with ballot laws is now ballot bill
but we can't rely on it
it's quite possible that some mps will try and talk the bill out
that is try and ensure that when the house rises at two thirty p m the debate on the bill is still in progress
and if that happened the bill automatically falls unless we can move the closure of the debate
now this means that the sponsor of the bill UNK brothers pro proposes that the debate be closed and the bill be given a second reading
in this case we must not only win the vote but we must have a hundred mps in the house to vote for the closure
with me so far
mm
but not all of those hundred must vote for the must vote for the closure there must be a hundred people there to take part in the vote is that right
no
it is no good putting a closure vote by ninety nine to one or even ninety nine to nought
the UNK doesn't vote
we must have a hundred mps voting for the closure
all of it ah right okay
so we need a hundred present
which is where on a friday afternoon
but if everybody else around the country has been lobbying as hard we have there's a good chance
after all there's three hundred and three hundred and however many was yes three hundred and sixty mps who supported it
three hundred and twenty seven put their name to an easy end
so out of those we should be able to manage a hundred surely
the other thing is if we're successful with UNK if he's behind the bill the mps are unlikely to talk it out
they'll accept it and put send it through on the nod if we can get his support
so he's crucial
why is the whip so important
because surely he's just UNK the minister's policy
erm yes
but these people get together
right
i mean it's not as if robert UNK making all the decisions
three hundred people say hang round the bar and say conservation board i've had lots of letters well so have i we'll get through them they might cause trouble
that that's the plan
well go for democracy the decision being you know for the country being taken by three
tories rather than
well that's right yes rather than one
well they don't ask john major of course
they can tell john major
so why i'm slightly puzzled as to why robert UNK is actually more important than john UNK
i mean
because i'm because john UNK responsibilities extend a long way into things like housing and stuff as well don't they
whereas robert UNK has more specific responsibility perhaps for getting this area
people of one
i don't know that's what i imagine
people of one of the environment and the UNK secretary of state for the environment
yeah
fair enough
it's just UNK rules of procedure
there are more ministers of state that there are secretaries of state
yeah
to be honest i think we should be grateful they don't have to have the court UNK come in
wave their UNK and UNK the lords prayer
fair enough
i assumed there would be a reason assume there was going to be a good reason
erm so who else was on your list of people we ought to write to
south east UNK who's the UNK parliamentary secretary to john UNK
who's the sorry your and i can't
sorry
erm
UNK was robert UNK
parliamentary private secretary
and
and
and james UNK p a i c e
p a i c e
yes
of
mp for south east UNK and he's p s to john UNK
and these people are erm UNK helpers to ministers and secretaries of state it says here
UNK
so
they're the eyes and ears of their boss and they have to report any political pressure so we have to find something for them to report basically
i wrote to UNK saying as minister for the environment er please support the energy conversation bill because it's dead good
presumably i can also write to john UNK saying is dead good
am i right to write to the others saying i or should
oh yeah
i write to gerry saying say please UNK robert UNK and remind him that the energy conservation bill's dead good in case he's forgotten
erm no i think the former i think the parliamentary
but i can write to him in his capacity as robert UNK parliamentary private secretary
yes
cos otherwise it looks like writing to random m ps
i think you're sort of drawing their attention to the public concern over that sort of phrase
and widespread cross party support
yes
honest UNK
UNK statements for your audience
i presume getting letters out is more important than high quality UNK here is it
oh yes
just a couple
cos i mean
of lines will do
name dropping the supporters i mean for to those tories telling them that the that the association for county councils for example is a UNK probably counts more than telling them that is a UNK
yeah well i think particularly
or green particularly
doing their own i just take the letters i've already written to other people change one sentence and change the er name on
that's fine so
UNK
printed off on my er employer's er computer and er put it in one of their envelopes and try to steal a stamp from them
we're gonna get it all down andy don't worry
how wide is the green party's main bill associated with do you think
well in the main UNK has been ron who's the who's our elected campaigns officers and he's quite literally been spending time UNK the UNK halls of westminster
i mean in the media
in the media i mean i haven't seen much about it in the media
er
well when it was first read by erm it was mentioned that it had been written by the green party by radio four and the guardian and the independent
and as far as i know that's the only coverage i've seen personally of it
well i s i saw an article in erm the green alliance a fairly UNK organization er mentioned in their newsletter
it was it was erm promoted by the association of conservation of energy
mhm
so i rang them up
but that's yeah i haven't seen much
yeah it's supported by the
well no they said they said prepared by er
oh right
what is the green alliance
i don't really know
i don't know who they get their money from but they
i mean they used to provide the advisor to various secretaries of state i think didn't they
ooh
i don't know who they are really
they send out this newsletter anyway
but i mean the main the main i mean in it in certain quarters we've been down playing that aspect of it simply to get it through
sure
but er all of the main organizations that have you know world wide and greenpeace and friends of the earth and so on and age concern
they all know they were all told that it's all a bit above board
but in promoting it to mps we've been drawing their attention to the kinds of organizations which in turn in their eyes just sort of represent that UNK or structure of votes that
and of course when it goes through they already have our as it were
yeah
with a bit of luck and careful handling
and the mps who asked to put it forward including alan they had to you know they came to ron to ask can we put your bill forward
they all know ron anyway
he's a very old hand in lobbying er which shows it's how it's we've got it this far
mm
because he's known this UNK rubbish that they UNK to
okay shall we move on to UNK
mm
before we get UNK down
i haven't received the samples er oh sorry i i'll moving on to what we're talking about
the national party are mounting a poster campaign for the elections
for both elections which hope hopefully covers the UNK and the er locals starting at the beginning er towards the end of the local election campaign to running through to the june
and they said erm if you would like to see the designs write and ask for a sample so we wrote and i haven't actually received any samples yet
but i have had a letter erm explaining where the UNK are in our area and how much they cost
it's a very badly written letter actually
for one thing it starts dear mrs UNK which got my back up
erm and then it goes on to say please find the UNK the postal sites available in your area UNK who's the green party person who's organizing it has provided the required areas and if you need any more details please don't hesitate to call me or my secretary
and under the sites may also availability at the time of booking
i look forward to hearing from you with your UNK
but introductory letter aside erm interesting
can i just get clarification here
yes
that letter almost sounds like we us around this table are expected to choose some of the sites
yeah
we didn't just write for information as to what national parties
erm well i just wrote UNK and said i saw your article in green week can you send me further details
and this is what's happened so
what it UNK is local parties who are interested enough get what's
yeah
get to try and choose site
right
erm now then it gives us a erm a price here which i think is weekly
because the availability columns are weekly so it makes sense that the price means weekly
erm and it has a number of different types w and f
but if i run through the addresses i think it'll make sense because everybody will recognize where they are
erm in york UNK road which is twelve pounds a week
hundred and ten UNK which i think is the side of UNK that's fifteen pounds a week
erm in fact there's two there
east parade eighteen pounds a week
UNK hall lane eighteen pounds
another one at UNK road fifteen erm york road UNK twenty
UNK twelve pounds and hull road twelve pounds
er UNK road eighteen pounds
UNK main street UNK eighteen pounds
another couple at UNK for twenty pounds and then they also give just a cost for ripon and scarborough
so i don't know about anybody else but that's cheaper than i expected it to be
yes absolutely
and the fact that they're several in UNK that i'd say are very good sites
i always read them erm when i about UNK
at UNK road or UNK would be the best one to go for
yes
are these the sort of the like to the end of bus stops
well from what i can gather the cheaper one on UNK is a bus stop size one
there's one actually at the bus stop by the police station and there's another one on the corner of the erm just before you turn into terrace there's a free standing one outside the shop there
and i think the eighteen pound one is probably the big one on the side of UNK building
erm actually high up you know full size UNK
which i'd say is less useful in fact than the little ones
i think the little ones might noticed
cos i mean i all whenever i'm going travelling into york and they've changed that UNK i always look at it
yeah
people in cars will notice the big one a lot better
yeah that's true
which is our target audience
obviously yes
wait at bus stops
right could be a policy decision this couldn't it
anyway i suppose before we decide we really need to know how much the national party are going to charge us if anything for the actual posters and what the posters look like
yeah
and how many posters they what size and shape of posters they're doing which will affect which site of course
that's right
no good
so i'll give
the erm type thing means what means little codes mean or does that give us any indication as to what these sites are
no there isn't a key unfortunately
oh
i'll tell you now if the poster says labour isn't working i'm not having it
yeah what which is the nearest one to a conservative club
cos there's a conservative club down in UNK isn't there
they actually own the one on the side of the conservative building i thought
or they thought they did until it always says conservative propaganda on the sides so i think that's a gonna
it's on a little table at the end which says rate card analysis and it had t v areas yorkshire t v north east t v and then principle main secondary local corner shop other and totals numbers in the middle
anybody got any suggestions on that
will we pay the cost of the poster site
is this your understand as well as the cost of the poster
i think so
well i think what they suggest to me that we have to pay for the poster site
whether or not the green party then supplies the posters i wouldn't like to say
right so it's not just that the national party want the people on the ground to choose the nice addresses
well that's the
i think it's clear that the money's coming from the local parties
what they're ac what they're trying to do is coordinate enough local parties with the same poster that they can make a block booking i would have thought
this might be a good way of raising funds by asking people particularly for the UNK i think
why don't you sponsor you know members who don't normally come to meetings to sponsor erm a site for
yeah
i think a lot of people would be willing to do that
erm make a big UNK in the newsletter please sponsor your green party poster for the elections
doing this is one erm campaign that as a small proportion of the poster sites is it
it looks that way yeah
there must be lots of other
i mean this they must have got my name through UNK so they must already have worked out the they were working
right
okay are you willing to go away and
yeah i think i need to talk to UNK again don't i
unfortunately i don't have a phone number i only have an address
but i'll write her a postcard to say yes it looks quite interesting when can we see the samples and can you tell us more about how the money works
yeah and confirm that isn't a daily price
i think that i'll have to confirm with the company
yes
but it just seems UNK cheap
that twelve
well i mean it's not the huge massive UNK
i mean if they're just sort of four foot things i mean it's not you know i think
yeah perhaps
anyway that's really into this idea
especially UNK suggestion of calling for people to sponsor
sponsor
sponsor a poster
erm should i at least be prepared to again stick something in the newsletter about
as you say it's the sort of thing that might appeal to people because then they can go and look at their poster
be photographed next to it
what do you think
we could always do UNK on the side of the conservative building
your direct your direct action at home
yes well come and visit you in prison
right does that cover UNK
yep
no that was a good agenda item just got silly
okay
who wanted to talk about affiliation stroke working with other groups
this is something we said we were going to discuss at a time in the future and i thought i'd stick it on and see how much time we'd got left
right
well we've got twenty five minutes at present shall we can you just wipe around a couple of other things and then we'll come back to that if time remains
yes do
okay
right UNK leaflet
do i hear UNK
or directions
erm i think neil might benefit from knowing what the UNK leaflet is
right well we call it an UNK leaflet because we like misleading agenda items mostly
what we actually mean is a sort of mini manifesto introduction to the green party booklet sixteen pages or so
oh yeah it's gone back to being a leaflet it was a booklet last week
yes yeah
yes so what we mean is an UNK booklet sort of a five sixteen or so pages covering ten or fifteen sort of major green party policy areas
mm
er the idea was we'd be able to sell it to people or give it to people depending on whether they had any money or not i suppose by the green party
if we were really lucky we'd be able to go to conference and try and sell hundreds of them to other green parties who might want to do the same
so we a number of us went away with lists of topics that we were going to write erm two hundred and fifty or so words about
and we went away UNK bits of and similar document and things like that
erm and so far well i'm certainly willing to confess that i took these away full of good intentions and have so far carried around this torn up copy of the greater london green party for months
have they not done similar such publications knocking about the green party like UNK for
well we had our own local manifesto before and the idea well in practical terms it was extremely detailed and erm each rewrite was a very big exercise and just photocopying er it was an extremely large booklet
so we thought essentially really we're UNK down our own local manifesto
right
where and actually sort of rather than saying this is our manifesto and you know our policy promises it's lacking excitement on our general policy
it's also UNK beyond local council issues
mm
local manifesto tends to be tied to and attempting to remain more UNK that one or two
yeah more to sort of statements of principles rather than just a policy so it lasts a bit
and i wrote my section
i'd just like to make this perfectly clear that i did write a draft for work and leisure
and i even had added colours on this copy
yeah and i hope they weren't too harsh
they were written while i was on a train and probably in a bad mood
i didn't get the opportunity to explain to you the joke beside behind your writing don't use UNK in written material
which is perfectly fair comment except that you've used a UNK
i knew i'd used a UNK you know
so
it does say draft actually
yeah i know
i use UNK in the newsletter some times which is deliberately honest
it's like saying avoid UNK like the UNK
i mean i i'd having been these comments and yes there are a couple of extra points put in there i think that that's fine
it's nice to get some of it done
what about the rest of you lads
well as soon as i have a window in my diary which i'm not
we'll let you off with the newsletter
contribution it is said
alright i'll undertake to come up with something for our next meeting
i mean all i didn't i just did exactly what i was told
i put brought out a list of points
there's no grammar in there
there's UNK all over the place because erm and all sorts
i even used numbers instead of writing them out in full verse
so erm
you can minute me and i'll erm
did you use any UNK
probably put a split UNK as well
well i've got the checking erm
right so steve is undertaking to be the next brave soldier to write something for
i don't know what i'm doing
the general
we have to be very busy
i mean this item has actually been deferred two meetings and
mm
yeah
we'll just been too busy
then i'll try and get something if i get time but
okay
still i suppose the time's it's the actual the UNK starting to tick for having this isn't it now
yeah if we're actually ever gonna make use of it we will joking aside have to try and get something
well after the big box pile up i'm free on the green party
and then the elections and then get our act together
i don't think we need to be too sorry at the reason we're not getting it written is we're far too busy lobbying mps and making UNK in the centre of town and things
so it's probably good rather
on balance
right
any other business
i've got a couple of things
do we have nominations for conference reps and local election candidates
because these will need to go in the selection ballot in the newsletter what i am going to write
oh er you mean from people here
well
yes
or i mean the flood of phone calls that have no doubt saved the erm green party
oh i'd like to be a delegate at conference but i can't be a candidate this year cos i'm captain of my and i think i'll be a bit busy anyway to be honest doing press work
it would be nice to have a break from doing it
right
anybody wish to be put forward as conference UNK
the number is UNK is it
yeah
yeah
we have three voting certificates but you can pass them around
it's a shared job
yeah
oh might as well then
you just have to be approved by the that's all
yeah i'll do that thing
right so that's got three so far and
i mean i think if you're not sure whether you want whether you'll be able to go i mean you can still you can still be a delegate then if you do go then you're able to vote so
so you'd like to be put down on the ballot to be approved do you
doesn't mean you have to go
just means that if you do go you
right i that's fine yes i'll
you see it makes it easier for us as well because it means that if you do if you are there we can leave you in charge for ten minutes while
presumably mark will run
yeah i would think so
i'll tell him to give you a ring if it's
yeah right i'll put him down with a question mark
oh it's nice to see people to see a good list of people who are going
and i could put myself down as in case i get there for a day or two
and for candidates erm yeah i'll stand i'll have to bite the boys again
yeah
talking of standing did we ever make any progress on UNK
we haven't got anybody
john hasn't come back to us
no
erm john said he informed me he he'd stand for UNK again and he i told him to write a
john 's UNK
presumably in the selection ballot we don't have to
i think we do have
we can have su suggested
but we don't
wards
but we don't definitely have to sign people
er so you were clifton
which is erm bill
that's clifton
that's clifton
i i'm certainly interested i'm quite interested in bishop hill unless anybody else wants it
erm again i mean i'm happy to give that if there's someone actually living in bishop who wants it but erm i've got erm some someone who lives there wanted me to stand in
good reason to er
do you have any
not at this time
i guess i can stand somewhere
well that's got the ball rolling
erm and if anybody runs into anybody else and can ask them or anything if there isn't actually an army of er sort of letters coming through your door saying yes make me a candidate
just to remind everybody that we've decided that this year we weren't going to put pressure on people
because it just took so much of our energy last time helping people fill in forms and everything
if people aren't comfortable enough to volunteer
i mean obviously if for example didn't ring up and say i want to sign your name your name tomorrow i'd ring her up to see whether she'd lost her mind or something
because you know she usually does
she's actually got er terrible flu
but i'm going round to see her next weekend
yeah but you know what i mean
if it's somebody who we really expect to stand then by all means then chase them up
but i don't want to go around looking for candidates like we did last time
because it's erm it just takes too much energy away
right
and if we haven't got a full slate well i mean looking at that list we're doing quite well
yeah
so would you be likely to speak to john saying again wouldn't like to pressure jean again but think john would like to
i'm sure john would
erm i shall ring him and ask him make sure he's
i'll try and ask
so have we taken a decision to target UNK then
yeah
it's five for the next five years
it's quite a commitment
so we're looking for the ideal candidate
yep
this is before anybody gets any ideas at all
and the reasons for it is because we're it's the sort of by far the most solid concentration of our actual members and likely supporters
i used to live down there towards one part of that
yeah
so it's all it's from that time on it's
i'd like to get that back again if we could
but we really need a candidate and there isn't anybody erm obvious who's in a position to do it unfortunately
UNK this year
mm
yes
yes he does he lives in
that's in UNK isn't it
that's very true
must be an experienced person
i don't know cold candidate
no
yeah the main difficulty is in is in the time period because it's quite likely that i mean i'd we'd been we'd been hoping that the target candidate could put in a reasonable amount of personal commitment to the campaign
other and if it wasn't for me doing a course next year which would probably UNK me from doing that i'd be quite interested
but i haven't got i couldn't at this stage say i could do a tap next year
even the year afterwards may be not
well shall i ask UNK whether he's
worth sounding him out
ask him if he'd like to do it
we'll come back to you if we can't find somebody who's got more time i guess
okay that sort of covers i think what i need to know for election stuff
because we've said we're gonna have a selection ballot
right
erm another thing i noted under any other business is green strategy document
this government one
i mean this might not be a good time to chat about it
i it's just that i remember on monday morning hearing on the radio that it was being talked about that afternoon and of course immediately forgot to go and get a copy of the next day's guardian and read about it and all the other
it's today's guardian
it's today's guardian
i've got it i've got it at home i can bring it in at the next meeting or whatever
that would be good
or drop it into their office
possibly we could have later event if we'd read
especially
about it we could you know five minutes
well you know i mean you said that they did a couple of lines just to say something about
they both i mean they i think they've released four documents UNK the way in which they're going to meet their commitments and they one of their the guardian gave devoted page six the whole of page six to this
erm and one of the pieces was sort of comments from various interested parties and the green party got a couple of lines in there after the UNK and before
i was still laughing too much from some comment that the government did one of their four promises was to was to put UNK public transport before private roads
i nearly cracked up
john major saying that people will have to accept restrictions on car UNK and it's an amazing thing to come from a tory
yeah and i asked the question not too much from the green party point of view as from a personal point view as i would like to know what my government is saying to do about these things
i i'd no idea he he'd actually he'd actually said something like that
he also said that there's no reason to give up the dream of economic growth but then there you go
well nobody thinks that
they don't seem to be doing too well with the energy of economic growth
no
dream more i guess
no after all the party of economic growth and reduced taxation
yes
i know i've read the publicity material and
i thought you were going to say you voted for them
i would have had something to say about that
that's not my party
they had sir jonathan on the radio the day of the message saying they're long on rhetoric and short of substance
that was the overall comment i think that the documents were very light on detail as you might
i've was just i heard erm how lord jonathan has just been become a pier or something
no it's erm his father died
it it's not a UNK title i think but i think he can become a sir if he wants to
yeah i just i guess i had hoped to be UNK surprised that it wasn't rhetoric
the only coverage i've seen so far is erm is the news and ten of all things
that we were watching last night
and the encouraging thing was that they're all things that a few years ago in the green party sort things out they're all there
absolutely
for all that the government is making a bit of er UNK of itself by not UNK the things that it needs to UNK the things it needs to do at least it's saying that it won't do them
which is the first step from the process isn't it
did anyone see UNK erm because er UNK was almost entirely
i've got it taped
devoted to the question of road transport and its limitations and erm er although again i mean there was no particular mention to any party other than the government erm it certainly seemed to be taking a very critical view of road transport and it does seem to be spreading now
it doesn't seem to be er just a few sort of you know any more
yeah
certainly keeps them going on the grounds that eventually there will you know we'll be able to say and this is what we believed this long and you know this is what has been proved to be necessary
so it's
we can already say that i mean there obviously there's a lot of talk now about erm taxation towards resource taxes and those sorts of things which the green party were saying you know fifteen years ago or something
and now everyone's talking about it and it's in one way it makes you UNK your teeth that we're not getting the credit yet
yeah
but in another way it's gotta be given i suppose
mm
one last item for any other business erm i forgot about
there's a book that goes with names in this campaign
erm a policy statement like roads to the future which is what reminded me of it
and the price has gone down it's only five pounds if
what from twenty five
yes thirty five
erm and i was going to say we will get a boiled down version from with our materials for the campaign
but i was going to suggest that we order a copy of the book
certainly
okay we now have seven and a half minutes on affiliation other groups
personally i think we might er defer it because that
perhaps we could start with an informal chat on the topic and work up to
yeah can you give us sort of thirty second briefing on what we're supposed to be developing
right well it came up when war on want wrote to us and asked us to UNK and we had a brief chat about it and felt that there are many groups that we could UNK to
war on want almost certainly weren't at the top of the list
erm and then i think it was andy actually who said that erm affiliation is something we could do with considering
i mean any groups at all and if so which ones
that it would be useful for us to UNK to
what are the implications of UNK with somebody be questioned by that i don't know the answer to
it depends sometimes he gets the information sometimes it's basically just UNK your approval with them
i mean it depends on each organization doesn't it
sort of two way two way thing you agree or don't agree between yourselves
i'm in some ways surprised the non political groups want to UNK with the party
war on want are er for a long time have been the only probably the only erm that put their neck on the block as far as social and environmental aspects of the party go
but you know i agree with you cos that as a charity
yeah they seem to have a lot more to loose than we do
yeah
there's been a lot of trouble lately a lot of problems haven't they
war on want didn't they go bankrupt or something
they did yeah
there is a possibility that war on want should be considered as being relatively high on our list of people we would be willing to UNK with
that's something that not bad at all they do as well so
so is this was the national war on want who contact us or the local contact
erm it was a lady who came from UNK
oh
do we have any feedback from any other local parties or the national party are they recommending it or they only putting out UNK to local parties and ask what we feel about it
no
associated with for example you're party
oh that's just a UNK deal
they quite likely the green party got a free UNK and their communication returned or even might have got some money from them you never know
i thought this sort of thing would be something the green party nationally should decide that whether in principle we ought to UNK with
yeah but the advice might not have gone UNK and
yes surprising that war on want aren't asking the national party
yeah
and instead are UNK all the local parties
i think it may be it may be that they could perhaps get more money if the local parties UNK separately but
what about our links formal or informal with other york branches of other
yeah i mean this is this is erm more the sort of thing that i had in mind
yeah
erm i think i mean we ought to be doing more with the local friends of the earth and local greenpeace i feel
in the past greenpeace have always rejected us and er on the grounds that in fact we're a political party
and friends of the earth it's only relatively new it's only been going properly for what two years
and this could be
yeah
we are getting on very well with the student green movements
both of which are also non political so that's a good step forward
erm
we've been concentrating a lot maintain the links with the with the university and the st james
erm a lot of our members who were students in york stay on and become you know active or in other parts of the country when they move on
it's very good erm good thing for the party and they're usually quite UNK of practical campaigning ideas and so we regularly try every at least every year to go and do a tour and erm we've been giving them we we're trying to rope them in on the various activities because they're crying out for
poor steve walking into the meeting at st james and there were about twenty people in the room and you said this is the green meeting isn't it
i can't believe it there's too many people
they're both by a UNK at the moment they're both very strong
they went into a quiet period a few years ago it was very quiet erm but er yes they're going strong
we have informal links or have had er our main contact has just left
i've been trying to liaise with the save our UNK which is and UNK privatization and technically i'm on the committee
but my other commitments prevent me from turning up to their committee meetings now so erm i'm sort of stepping back on to i'm just on to their mailing list
but the UNK the whole idea behind that was really to keep the green party's finger on the pulse with that
get people along get the information UNK and also to maintain a political presence amongst the people who are writing to or potentially to vote for us
erm because the national policy is obviously to target the green movement erm as our natural constituency
erm and the only way we're going to raise a profile with them is by is by making sure that whenever can we support their actions
anybody seen this
can i suggest that we wind up the meeting and er
yeah thanks for thanks for UNK andy that's great
any other problems that you're getting a bit
er sometimes i get some UNK up on that erm v a t sometimes
yep okay
a lot of adults just haven't got a clue at working out v a t or any sort of since you mentioned percentages it's UNK can't do that
yeah
the woman at work
yeah
she you know
well UNK do it everyone did go home eventually and their wages cos there was there was two of us i told you didn't i there was two of us that worked it out
she was telling you telling you again ten per cent
yeah and we all sail go home and check just check
what came of it did they
they were all seven per cent so for
so it was seven per cent that they were giving him not ten per cent
yeah so she was a bad con merchant
that man didn't he get any more money out of it but we don't let him get away with thinking their giving him
no well they all said next time they'll check because some of them just take it for granted
well you know a lot of p a lot of them just can't check
yeah
they don't know you know how to check
well the others have made a bit we just took it for granted that she was giving us ten per cent rise and didn't bother cos they trusted her but
okay well this will
though yeah they won't trust more than the once
there's a lot of that you know wouldn't buy a used car of him but it's
yeah though so don't forget to have him looking after my money
oh no
no
so we'll just have a little quick think about numbers generally and then we'll sort of have a look at the fractions and then we'll have a look at percentages
yeah
just for a bit of revision
so you start of with the normal counting numbers and everyone's quite happy and no problem with that so we do something like seven add let's say we do er three add seven and what does that come to
er what ten
okay and seven add three
ten
no problem when you're switching round okay and then we do something like erm let's say we do ten UNK seven
three
okay and then we do seven UNK ten
minus three
now okay when you're infants and with things like that you just say can't do it
yeah
which is right you can't
no you can't do it you know there's
sensible answer
there's seven pence on the table now take ten away must be mad yeah so anyway we don't like saying we can't do it in maths so we pretend we can and we work out this complete new system it's all a game really it's all a silly game
yeah
and for all these negative numbers you can't say oh look there's minus three dogs out there
well they've started giving them in schools you've got your tab you're y aim it's like in that piece of card with one to ten on
yep
erm with the minus numbers on af another piece with minus numbers on and they use them together they don't use them till about middle infants so
i think that might be a bit early actually but i know i know they are doing it earlier and earlier
yeah
erm
it's just like writing though isn't it
yeah
i mean the but my best posh pushing all of four for writing and that's not right
i think well i think do everything as early as you possibly can as long as the kid understands what they're doing it's no good getting them to do things they don't understand if they understand negative numbers do it
yeah
if they don't understand leave it until they're a little bit older and there's other lots of other things they can learn to concentrate on
so okay we UNK we invent this new system and we say seven take away ten is minus three okay
twelve divided by oops okay we do something like erm three times four which comes to
twelve
okay and four times three
twelve
there's no problem there that's okay then we things like twelve divided by three
four
okay and then three divided by twelve
and the answer there is well we can't do it
so that this is when fractions come into it and everybody starts getting a bit ooh i'm not very sure of what i'm doing here because it's not you know it's not obvious it's not very real
yeah
it's not like putting pennies on the table and counting them put twelve pennies on and share them out between three people no problem but you put three pennies and share them out between twelve people
would it work out as minus four i can't remember
ah well okay let's see what it does come to
erm how would we do it then
let's say we've got three pizzas and we share them out between twelve people how would you do that
if you actually had to do it
twelve of you coming tonight and you got you get some big pizzas as you're working you've got loads of money now
yeah
right so you get these from you know dial a pizza and er three of giant ones please
mm
and there's twelve of you to share it out so how much are they going to get each
it's going to be two to a pizza no
well
two to
it's very awkward sharing three of them out so you could start of with by just sharing one out if we just shared one pizza out between twelve how much would you get
one pizza
one
one shared out between twelve people what fraction do you get each
a twelfth
right so you get a twelfth
so we're saying well there's the first pizza lets cut it up
that's your share out of the first pizza
yeah
now we'll have the second pizza and we'll cut that up
three twelfths should be
great right you're there already so the answer is three twelfths and that's really it's not much of an answer cos all three twelfths means is three shared out between twelve we've just written
yeah
it differently
we've just written it differently say ooh yeah we've done that fine that was no problem so then we have another little problem and work out what three shared out between twelve would come to wouldn't
yeah
we
and we can say well that would be the same really erm
as a quarter
as a quarter right
if we all got into groups of four
yeah
and say this group of four here erm will get this much shared out between us so if there were a third as many people if there was only one person we wouldn't need so many erm if there was only one pizza right
yeah
a quarter of it
erm we might have erm let's say now we want to say try and work this as a percentage so if we've got
point seven five wouldn't it
well hang on we've got one pizza shared out between four people right erm how many pizzas would you go you think that was just right that was wonderful we all had just the right amount of pizza when we had a quarter when we had one shared between the four of us
yeah
erm but we're having a big party tomorrow night and we're having a hundred people in
right now how many pizzas are we going to need so they get a quarter how many makes a quarter
how many UNK how many UNK makes a quarter in other words
well four quarters equals one
so this what we've four quarters equals one okay
so
so as soon as you get too awkward you think oh well forget about fractions and let's do it by algebra
so what have we got
we've got we don't know how many over a hundred is equal to one over four
yeah
well if we don't know the answer what do we usually do
x
right let's pretend we do and we've done it now x over a hundred is the same as one over four equals so we've got an equation we've got an equation with fractions that's one of your UNK isn't it
oh yeah
so
lovely
do you want to keep the fractions there or would you like to get rid of them
get rid of it
what are you going to do to get rid of it then so we write it out again x over
times it by itself
times it by what will you times that buy to
two
make the make the get rid of the hundreds on the bottom
a hundred
right so if you times that by a hundred you've got no choice there
you've gotta times that by a hundred
right so you do it on other side and then work out what that comes to so why did you multiply that side by a hundred
to get nought
to get one to get
to get one yeah
to get that cancelling out so we've got the one on the bottom which
right
comes to
x over one
right just x over one which means it's going to come out to x is equal to
x times a quarter it's more point seven five
it's no it's one times a
oh yeah
hundred
that's right
so it's one times a hundred over four
which is that's a hundred over four
yes it's the hundred it's a hundred over four what does that come to so now if you had a hundred things shared out between what would that come to
that would be x
ah yeah
that stays hundred it wouldn't it
well
cos one times a hundred
right so yeah so it just comes to a hundred over four good now
and do you cancel that down there
just cancel it down
how many fours in a hundred
well if you can't do anything with fours in a hundred do it in two steps how many twos in four
two
right so just divide that by two
er would that be fifty
that would be fifty over two
how many twos in that fifty divide twos in that
two
and then do it again
and you just do it again there and
yeah
wherever that is
yeah that'd be one and that'd be twenty five
that's it that's great
right so x is equal to
twenty five over one
twenty five okay x is equal t
yeah
to twenty five or twenty five o x is equal to twenty five looking
yeah
wouldn't you say that was twenty five
and what were we trying to find x for
what is it over our hundred
twenty five over a hundred
so twenty five over a hundred okay
twenty five over a hundred is equal to a quarter
so if we want to find out and twenty five over a hundred we've got the s it's a special fraction and it used to have a special name for it and we call these percentages twenty five per hundred twenty five UNK we just say twenty five per cent
yeah
so twenty five per cent is the same as a quarter
yeah
erm what would fifty per cent be the same as
half
right
okay and that's really that's where percentages fit in
yeah
they're fractions they don't look like fractions if someone writes down sixty per cent you think that's not a fraction i can't see any with
yeah
something above and something below
it's just sixty over a hundred
well it just means sixty over a hundred
yeah
it's just a special because it's a special fraction that we use a lot we just give it a special name and call it percentage but any time someone says to you like er what's let's try this one now you were saying about point seven five and things
yeah
what's seventy five per cent as a fraction
er that nought point seven five
right as a decimal it's nought point seven five and as a fraction
that
is seventy five over a hundred
right that looks like the hundred that's the sort of left over of the hundred so it's just equal to seventy five over a hundred and you
yeah
like to cancel that down and see what that comes to
divide twenty fi it's divided by twenty five wouldn't you
right do it by good that's very good
erm so there's three twenty fives in seventy five
right
and four
right
your mental UNK getting very good by the way i mean at one stage when you first started you'd be using your calculator for all this wouldn't you
yeah
so seventy five per cent is three quarters
yeah
yeah that's when i get mixed up the it's the twenty five per cent and the seventy five per cent anything in between 's alright it's just them two the right the
alright
wrong end of the scale
yeah so it gets more complicated when you say what happens if i add on so much per cent
yeah
erm but the first thing is to get these straight about your seventy five per cent what we're ta can you work out what as a fraction what twenty per cent would be
twenty over a hundred
so we take away from twenty or even tens
yeah good do it in tens first so how
is there a two and five two fifths
how many tens in a hundred
oh sorry erm ten
right you were doing you were
two tenths yeah
doing both methods at the
yeah
same time there
and then you can cancel that and
cancel that
be one fifth
one fifth so that's it twenty per cent is there one fifth
what about erm let's give you an awkward one now let's give you an awkward one er plus sixty per cent what's sixty per cent of the two
er six of something six and sixty ten sixes in sixty how many sixes in a hundred
am i
how many tens in sixty
oh yeah
how many tens in sixty
six that's
right
right yeah
okay
tens in a hundred ten six tenths
six tenths
three fifths
good
that's it
so you've got no problem with these have you
twenty minutes do last one
thirty five per cent
what that comes to
erm
what's going to go into thirty five
five
right
seven
good and you know your tables
erm
right how many fives in a hundred
there's it's going to be twenty
yeah
yeah that's right
how did you do it
how many tens in there
just doubled it at yeah
right good go for so seven UNK
innit one reduce any more than that
no
so any per UNK i give you now you can turn it into a fraction couldn't you
yeah
yeah so if i gave you twelve and a half per cent
that's nasty cos that's got sort of fractions within fractions and they'd say twelve point five per cent
urgh i think i'm not going
i'll do that one i usually don't do the hard ones
twelve and a half per cent 's going to be twelve and a half over a hundred er oh well we're going to cancel but first of all we could go the opposite way and multiply just to get rid of this fraction
what would you like to multiply twelve and a half by so that the half UNK
twelve and a half
yeah what would multiply twelve and a half by if you wanted to
a half
by two yeah
oh that's right yeah
right so what do the two twelve and a half come to
two UNK would be how much
a hundred and
two UNK
oh twenty four
right twenty four
and two halves
two
no one sorry
twenty five
so that comes to twenty five
right so if we multiply this by two from the top two and the bottom we'll get twenty five over two hundred then you can if you want like to cancel that down twenty five over two hundred what would you what would you cancel there
is it just fives again
yeah it's fives again
so five fives are twenty five
right and that
so that's eighty and there's UNK forty so that er five forties that right
yeah
so that
that was quick that five forty i was trying to work it out because i wasn't going to cancel it that way but that's great
how many fives in forty
five goes into itself once and goes into that erm eight times so it's going to be an eighth
right good so it's one eighth
so twelve and a half per cent is an eighth
yeah
seventeen and a half per cent is something horrible it just doesn't work out to anything reasonable
at all and it's it UNK everything
yeah
okay so you can convert any per UNK into a normal UNK i mean you can leave this sort of fraction is no problem like i say erm seventy eight per cent is a seventy eight over a hundred and normally you wouldn't have to bother cancelling them down because you'd just go to use your calculator
yeah
so could you find seventy eight per cent of erm a hundred and twenty pounds
and use your calculator on it if you like what are you going to do
and you could write it out as seventy eighty over a hundred and twenty
is it over a hundred and twenty
mm over a hundred yeah
just leave that at seventy eight over a hundred and then
this is per UNK probably
don't use your per UNK
er
just do seventy at the moment just do seventy eight over a hundred
nought point seven eight
right and then times
a hundred and twenty
yeah times a hundred and twenty
nine ninety three point six
ninety three pounds sixty
yeah
okay
now what you did when you worked out seventy eight per cent you say seventy eight over a hundred and you put it in your calculator and you did seventy eight divided by a hundred and that gave you nought point seven eight
yeah
so you can convert per UNK into these sorts of fractions or you can convert them into decimals
yeah
which are another sort of fraction
yeah
see that
so lets convert some per UNK into decimals because this is the trick that you were using last time you were very good at it
i said didn't i you were very good at that but you need to do a few just occasionally you think UNK i can do all these now no problem
yeah
you don't do any for a month or so you think oh i was bombing through these now where do how do i get started
which you know
i know it seems like ages
right so what's fifty three per cent as a decimal
nought point five three
didn't take long you didn't need your calculator for that
okay it right erm nought point five three you're obviously going to do these quicker than i can write them down so you can write them down
thanks
it's erm what would seventy nine per cent be as a decimal
seventy nine per cent
yeah
nought point seven nine
right
well i don't think we need to go on with any more of those do we no
no
those
right now let's think of something a bit UNK
someone buys erm let's say someone in the market buys a video at two hundred pounds from the UNK right
what a UNK
a video player you know
yeah
two hundred pounds it's a good one double UNK with all sorts of and then adds a forty five per cent mark up on it so it starts at two hundred pounds then adds
you've got to add forty five per cent
add forty five per cent
right
so what's how are you going to work out what that comes to
so it'd be forty five over a hundred
yep
times hold on forty five divided by a hundred times two hundred
right
ninety pounds
so ninety pounds is the mark up ninety pounds is what you add to it okay and that was good that you worked that out cos a lot of people just think ooh you just add forty five pounds on
they do i mean that's the most common thing that people want to do
oh they just do the two hundred pounds and then these people add forty five per cent in on the because
right
i've done that myself
right
er i've done that myself when i was in school
oh it's okay
so m what how much does it come to altogether then when he's added the ninety pounds on
two hundred and ninety pounds
right so we've got the ninety plus the original two hundred and that comes to two ninety
now you were doing it a very neat way a quick way of doing it all in one go weren't you
yeah
you remember what you were doing
er i done the forty five over a hundred and UNK it
times nought point four five of eight by two hundred and got the answer
the
that was your ninety
ninety
but you had a way of going straight to the two ninety in one go do you remember what that was you'd worked on it yourself you were doing just nicely
what we've got here is you know what forty five is you don't need to do forty five divided by
yeah
a hundred you know that you just sort of you've just been doing it on those out of your head so we've got two hundred times now what do we finish off with we finish off with once
yeah
one two hundred and then we add on
the forty five
nought point four five
four five
off two hundred now how much have we got all together
one point four five
four five
that's two hundred you remember
yeah
that now
yeah
try that one then two hundred times one point four five
two hundred two hundred and ninety
so go straight to the answer
yeah
and get it very quickly without messing about try this one then erm four hundred plus that plus seventeen point five per cent and now then okay let's do it this way
let's do four hundred plus seventeen per cent
right
erm can you do that the quick way
that way
yep
so it'd be four hundred times one
yeah
point
point
one seven
that's it
okay
four hundred and sixty
right four sixty
are you UNK it to nearest pound
that is
that's it spot on
good
should have i should have done that
right and just work out what seventeen per cent just try seventeen over a hundred times four hundred just to check see what it comes to you wouldn't normally check it
seventeen per cent
sixty eight
that makes four hundred
yeah
so that's a good way of doing it
now let's so shall i do one more of those
yeah
UNK and i want you to do four hundred times i said four hundred add seventeen point five per cent
what's that going to look like
now that's really confusing so it quite throws you having another decimal in doesn't it
all you do is you just
one point
go on
one seven five
one seven five
one point that's it
one oh seventeen five one seven five
that's it so you just if there's any decimal points in here you just ignore it forget about it and you put your because if it's a per UNK you point just go in there
so it should come to a little bit more than that one shouldn't it
four hundred and seventy
right
okay you happy with that
because that's the bit that really sh throws people
yeah
if it was seventeen per cent oh i can do that it's point one seven but when it's seventeen point five and where does the point go
i've got two
yeah well i was in a bo i'm in a book club and you have to add your own erm per UNK on
yeah i see
so i do that way when i'm doing it to practice
good
so cos i do actually sit down and work it out and me mum comes in and says what you doing so i do use that way
alright
okay so you could do this one erm six hundred plus forty seven point eight point five per cent
with that one
right
how are you going to work that one
that's it
that's it
simple as that
eight hundred and eighty seven
and ten pence
right
and then as a quick check just a rough check
forty seven out so this is about nine hundred quid isn't it
yeah
roughly
forty seven point eight per cent well it's about forty eight per cent
forty eight per cent is about fifty per cent what's fifty per cent as a fraction
half
so it's six hundred plus about half which comes to a about nine hundred should come to a bit less than nine hundred and it does so that's almost certainly
yeah
right
add two hundred and eighty seven and ten pence
right
now how about take away in the middle of per UNK
this time we start off with six hundred and we take away thirty per cent
okay so do that one any way you like
so thirty per cent of a hundred
what does that come to without doing it what would it be as a decimal
thirty
nought point three
right good
then minus but i'm not sure about that one
right
okay
so if you're going to find thirty per cent of six hundred first
yeah
so find out what thirty se what thirty per cent of six hundred is
wouldn't that be best six hundred no nought point three times six hundred
right
okay
so
because that's off
right thirty per cent
of
six hundred
one hundred and eighty
times six hundred equals ha carry on with that one hundred and eighty
right so that's how much you've gotta take away from six hundred so you can just UNK in a six hundred over the top and then take it away
see what you mean
but i want one of these
good
two four er four and twenty pounds
right
okay so that should come to four hundred and twenty there you could look at it this way it's six hundred times the one lot of six hundred
yeah
and you take away nought point three
oh yeah
so it's six hundred times what does one take away nought point three come from to one point one point nought take away nought point three we'll try it on here one point nought take away nought point three i mean most of the time you would be actually using the
nought point something
right nought point what
can't have nought take away three so
so what you going to do
borrow that one
okay
ten take away three is seven
right
it's going to be nought point seven
right
so it's nought point seven
so we've got six hundred times nought point seven
now that one you're doing sort of doing this bit erm you can do that bit on the calculator and then do times six hundred
yeah
if you like that method use it
if you don't if you're not happy and you're not very confident with it
yeah
