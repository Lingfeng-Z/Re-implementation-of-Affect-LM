you might be better just doing it this way just work out what thirty per cent of it is and then take it away from the original
yeah
that's that i mean that's fine that'll work all the time this way if you practice it you'll find it much quicker and it's easier
yeah
and you know that so let's try this one the quick way
six hundred times er well hang on six hundred take away don't use your calculator yet just think about this and tell me what you're going to do
six hundred take away twenty per cent
how do we do that the quick way
times
it's going to be
now you can do that on your calculator
yeah
nought point eight
right good
and normally they won't be as easy as this so you probably will be doing them on the calculator so to do this you just do erm one take away whatever the per UNK is
it's going to be four hundred and eighty
right which is what we got when we did it the other way
got four hundred and twenty
did we
oh we'll do a different one
yeah
so we're doing twenty per cent
it's just as well
right erm so if we do this one er three hundred and sixty three hundred and sixty take away er UNK twenty five per cent let's start confusing you now with these twenty fives and seventy fives because
this might be where it happens you see
right
three hundred and sixty take away twenty five per cent
times
right
try do that one
right
that'd be a nought anyway
right
we can always put UNK on the end of after the decimal place
so we're going to have to borrow one from the and then put a minus one put that one there leaves five and minus one minus two leaves can't do that anyway so you're going to have to borrow this one
right
and use that as an note and bring that back to one but you still can't do it so that's got to be minus one
ah
mm
urgh
i think you're getting a bit
well yeah
involved with the UNK you were doing well on that one with the minus one
well if you bring the one back you still can't do one minus two
no
easy way to do it is if we've got one
if you borrow on that unless you borrow another one
right if we've got let's say we've got one point nought and we've got nought point two five erm borrow that one first of all because we know we're going to need it
yeah
and that makes that
ten
ten lots of ten
which leaves eight
er there's ten lots of ten
oh yeah
okay now we're going to take the five from nought well we can't do that so we'll borrow a ten borrow a one from that ten
and leave the nine yeah that's right
okay and then what does that come to but again you wouldn't do that this way you'd do that on your calculator i just want
seven
you to try that for practice in
five
decimals cos you're supposed to know about decimals as well so do that one on your calculator now i know you've just you've just worked it out the long way so you just and you don't even need the one point nought you can just put one and then take away point nought point two five
nought point seven five
and it's already in your calculator now so you can just do times three sixty
so you're only doing one operation
not only is it quicker in the exam but every time you press a button you know you've got a chance of pressing the wrong one or
yeah
pressing it twice so the UNK bu you know the less button pressing you do the better
that's th the way i done that there that's because we were shown in school to work backwards
yep
that to mean that was a good way of doing it the way
yeah
you were doing it but you went wrong on that but
yeah
you don't you know you'll get away with doing it as long as you can do those on your on your calculator that's okay but that's a that's a quick way of doing that
yeah
you could do it the long round now i think you're okay on those
right
i'll give you a problem to look
okay
at some things to work out erm you better write them out and then you can read your own writing then so if i say er you can only in you can just make your own notes on what you need to do the question but computers normally costs six hundred pounds but erm UNK are doing a fifteen per cent discount how much do you pay for it
cos this is another thing sometimes they'll say discount and i get ta i get students who said to me what does this mean
what does discount mean
and they don't know so you're happy with that aren't you
yeah
discount
just means money off
right
erm and next door they've got a what the same computer was seven hundred and fifty pounds
but they're doing a twenty five per cent discount
which ones going to be what they'd normally ask is how what is the difference is prices
and they'd usually say which one would you buy
on the assumption that you know you'd buy the cheap one might and when you want to get rid of it i'll buy the dear one
what's the difference in price
yeah price reduction pay
erm i think one of those is probably enough but i'll give you another one if you want you can have
one yeah
a try that
erm i'll make them i'll make them all take away sorry discounts because if you could do those you can do the adding ones
yeah
i'll give you another i'll give you one adding up one then okay er one in one shop it's erm eight hundred pound plus vat
the computer
yeah er well this is a different thing now it is er something else a different type of computer say in one shop it's eight hundred pounds plus vat and in the second shop it's nine hundred and twenty five pounds but you don't pay any vat on that one it's already got the vat in
mm
nine hundred and twenty five gross
twenty five
right
which is the cheapest
yeah
now that excluding vat though
that this one includes
oh that's right
the vat is that you
yeah
don't have to add no vat to be added on
yeah that i know
it's all in the price there because this is what you actually get very often you're ringing some places up and they'll say oh but you had vat through this week
what's the vat
what per UNK is the vat
seventeen point five unfortunately
seventeen point five
be nice if it went up to twenty per cent in the budget cos everyone could work it out more easily
yeah
it'd cost 'em cost them a lot more okay
what was the cheapest
yeah technically it's which is the cheaper if there are only two
how's you how's your writing doing
i know you haven't been doing any english and that but erm have you have you been doing much reading
i've just been reading here some books that i've got upstairs and stuff and i went to see one of erm UNK erm i went to see a midnight UNK dream
yeah
UNK night's dream
on friday night the ballet yeah
and it was really good i wa i wa i wanna see the play
right
but i've never had a chance to see the play and i've got i've got a full book of his works upstairs and
right
i've read it over and over again but i just keep on going back to it cos i can just go on reading it for
you like it
ages yeah i do
i think it's a bit awkward because some of the words he uses are there a bit strange and they're not in the dictionary any more and er
yeah
they used to use words like that you know hundreds of years ago but you don't
yeah but you just you just figure out for yourself what
right
they mean you've got a fair idea
yep you work it out from
yeah
context
me friend over in norway she said she's she got over there and sat down and she thought yes she's got the complete works of UNK i'll have a whale of a time trying to read it she picks up the book it's all in UNK
oh no
well it well it well yeah it has to be rather awkward to read that i think i don't think i'd fancy having a go at UNK
and she's picked quite a few words up and
yeah
she's come home and that and i picked a few words up like and
alright
we there er easier to say when you've got erm a bit of drift down you as well
or a or a UNK accent
yeah
some of our i mean er UNK is a UNK word
yeah
UNK
apparently one of the little erm boys she say he UNK himself all the time and she turns round and she goes he goes to er ha he started himself and you have to change all his clothes like that and she said
sounds like a nice kid
he's she said he's nice
mm
but he just he said she's bright bit
he's just UNK a bit is he
yeah erm his mum UNK him a lot
you be nice and you can have a
you stop UNK yourself if you don't wet yourself for a week i'll get you a toy
yeah
and she said that's just not the way it's done so she saying to him now if you da if you wet yourself once more you're going back in a UNK
mhm
so he stays dry most of the time now
how old is he
he's only about three so
so he's old enough
yeah
to know when he wants to go to the loo
i know well she said
sounds as if he was doing it deliberately to get back at her doesn't it
yeah well she said it's hard you see cos when they go she goes out erm to a place called UNK and they have no public toilets
right
so you're in the end you have to say to him well you'll have to wet your UNK cos because it's like a bi bit longer the trek
if he's if he's three he can find a find a drain or just
yeah
go sit in go in a corner here rather than wet his UNK
right okay
erm do another discount one then erm
yeah
what's let's say we're selling a selling a printer at two hundred and ninety nine pounds
but there is a sale and it got they're doing forty per cent off
okay
what is the price
two so it's that's it
how much do you pay in the sale
okay
do you like UNK
on the erm
ideas don't they
plus you got to see how the other UNK are doing and
yeah
everything else don't you
right bearings time
now this is probably a
which UNK north do you know
that way
that way
okay
good erm right erm so i want you to take a bearing on me tell me what bearing i am from where you are
forty five degrees
right i'll take a bearing on you first of all
now let me see
nought forty five ninety so you're ninety degrees north which is forty five degrees away from me
er how do you sort this out
perhaps you can help me one day never mind
right
cos i'm sat dead
yeah
that's north okay
that's pointing north
that north
right well you're on a bearing of forty five degrees from me right
yeah
now what bearing am i from you
i can do the easy one you can do the hard one
so i'm north
no that's the window is north
north
right so i'm going to take a bearing on you
what i do that's north and then i sort of point round i know it's rude to point measure that angle forty five degrees okay
yeah
you're on a bearing forty five degrees so
and you're forty five degrees away from me
well i'm not so sure about that but that's where i am there and that's north okay don't forget that north is nought
yeah
always nought and you just so i line up the way that is where am i
i'm about here say i line that up i take a bearing on you that's forty five degrees
see
so that's where you are give me the one out
always draw that line in for north i've just used the red line there
you usually have to start in the middle of the page
okay
now so that up there so it's sort of facing the right way
what bearing are you from me
in what bearing sorry what bearing am i from you
i take the bearing from me you're on a bearing of forty five degrees now you take a bearing on me and tell me where i am
so
that's north
yeah
okay now from where you are
you're there
north
so you're forty five degrees
now first of all
i'm going round the wrong way
first of all that's north so you get nought and
yeah
don't forget to use the outside scale and the other thing is make sure you've got it the right height it's not a precise
okay there's all sorts of them i mean you can have it the wrong nought
yeah
the inside nought instead of the outside or you could have it upside down or anything else but that's pointing north you must line it up so it points north right now what bearing am i from you
right
two hundred and twenty one degrees
okay
is that actually a forty five there that was that was a forty five near enough now how did you work that out
because the first thing you have to do is what
before you can take a bearing at all there's something you have to do which is what am i about to do
draw the line north
right
you must put in your north otherwise you haven't got anything to take a bearing from
yeah
so nearly every point on your diagram
should have a line going up
like so
when we normally when we draw it we normally put north going straight up the page so each person or each ship or whatever it is
is a different point
you'd need a different
north
they're all pointing the same way they're all pointing
yeah but
north
but they're all from their base
right so when you measure that okay you best put it the right way up so you can see what you're doing and we'll turn it back in a minute
two hundred and
hang on hang on
i haven't got it exactly on
that's where we're taking the bearing
yeah
okay
there
so you just line that upon there to make sure
that's lined up north make sure that's right on the angle you're measuring now it's about there
two hundred and twenty six
twenty five
two twenty five
okay
all the way round there
yeah i get it
so standing up a bit here come over by the window
this is so you remember it
okay you stand there stand just stand about hang on stand about there
yeah
right and i'll stand here
now i'm going to take a bearing on you
first of all where's north
right so here's my nice straight line pointing north
yeah
and then i point to you
now which way do i turn when i'm going to point to you
clockwise
good
always clockwise so i stay to forty five degrees
now you take a bearing on me should tell me exactly what you're doing
so i'm going to be standing on here
right
and i should move round like that clockwise there
okay
do it do it again
just do it just and as you do it think i'll remember this for my examine right
so i'm standing UNK on a straight line
right
and i wanna turn two hundred and twenty five degrees
you've got to turn clockwise
but i can't yeah
okay
so i've got to turn round
going so you go that bit when you when you when you get there
back to the straight line
you've got a hundred and eighty
yeah
then
and then you got the rest of it so you'll always go more than a hundred and eighty now when you when you're pointing you're facing that way again turn around that way again when you're facing that way erm especially if i'm about erm say especially if i'm about here
yeah
right take a bearing on me
yeah got it
so yeah and it's really UNK isn't it
yes
it is
when you're there this one
yeah
varies it's only three hundred especially if i were that
i only there it's about that much
yeah
no
for all the way round it's got to be clockwise
yeah
if you start and that's what most people get wrong with erm bearings in the exam
yeah
and they always give you a question like that where it's you know there's a nice little short way which is the wrong way round
yeah
so remember that do when you do the bearings if you're doing some erm examples or you're looking through or you're doing some revision get up stand up and think right what's to think of oh it's not there like if i'm taking a bearing on these flowers it's well just that much in it you know
yeah
get UNK going all the way round but make sure you do you know stand up and do it and then it'll go in
hey that'd be a good one for UNK awareness thanks for the idea
yeah
get in why not
get them doing bearings when they're when they're two as long as they understand
yeah
what they do i mean just play a game it's just a ga it's a it's a game like sort of simon says try and catch them out in things you'll say right now you've got to point at a window say and then you have to point at and you can get them all doing it you
yeah
have to point out joe and they all go now okay now a new game
you point at the window but you must all turn round that way turn round to your right so you're going round then clockwise they probably wouldn't understand but
yeah
they must keep turning round to your right until you point at them and you mustn't go the short way and you can play like erm sort of version of musical chairs where you eliminate the ones who get it wrong you know
yeah
and they if they go round the wrong way oh all right you're out now we try again and
yeah
you point out this one erm they won't know what it's about at all it's just a nice game it's just fun but later when they come to do bearings it'll se it'll be se
they'll understand yeah
natural to them
yeah
and they won't know what hit them oh that'll be so naturally i'll go round that way not the short way why's that
why
cos you taught them early
so you're going to remember that
yeah
tell me about taking bearings what do you do let's give you an example of some bearings to take erm and then you can tell me what you're doing so there's a point there and we'll call that erm p just to be awkward now let's say what we'll do this is what we'll d this is a typical problem in fact erm i'll even draw that line on for you to start with yeah here's the problem a ship is sailing due north okay and when it's at the point of a it takes a bearing on the lighthouse so the lighthouse is somewhere don't know where it is but bearing of l from a is forty five degrees and the bearing of l from b which is when the ship has sailed on a lot further
mm
is erm a hundred and twenty degrees all right
right
now i'd like you to draw those two bearings and find out where l is this lighthouse so tell me what you're doing first of all
i'm going to put that there
right that's a bit awkward
okay
erm five and forty five degrees
right
when you put it on check that the UNK that you haven't got your thing upside down
yeah
that the nought on the on the outside is at the top not the nought on the inside which
yeah
is down here but the nought on the outside at the top
erm
right
i'm drawing me line
right
just keep going for as long as you like on that line
way
mm
up way up here keep going way up right
oh yeah
with that line because you don't know where this light house is
okay
all you know is you took a bearing from a and it could be anywhere along here could be quite close to it or it could be miles up over here
yeah
okay
erm then when you took it b it was a hundred and twenty degrees so it was the
right
i'm miles out
doesn't matter
er and also when you are drawing it doesn't matter if you keep going
right
because you've past it so it that's it so when you were here when you when you say you're in the ship
yeah
and you're at a let's say let's say north is that way okay and you set this up and you have a look you say where's that lighthouse oh it's on a bearing of forty five degrees and a lot later when you've sailed sort of past the lighthouse or the lighthouse is behind you take a bearing and you still go around clockwise
mm
it's a hundred and twenty so it's where they where they meet is
yeah
where the lighthouse is and that's what they actually use it for taking bearings on ships and if you do that and you draw your diagram you can work out how far you are from the lighthouse because it might you might have in your charts
so that's what it is then the screens just like a protractor they there's another protractor
yeah exactly
er on the computer
yeah
and you do it in the airports as well i've seen i er me uncle works in manchester airport
yeah
as an air traffic controller so
right
so let's say your uncle got you a job in the airport as an air traffic controller right
yeah
and let's say that's north
yeah
and erm you're looking you're let's say you turn up looking at a screen you're actually standing up like they used to do in the old days before they had UNK
mm
with a pair of UNK turning round looking for planes coming in
yeah
right and you say oh there's erm john's UNK coming in at forty five de john's UNK coming in at forty five degrees you see
yeah
erm from going back to okay
and they expect me to co be coming in from here
yeah
yeah if you don't measure it the right way and go all the way round there and say that he's coming in on two hundred and twenty five degrees
twenty five degrees
on a bearing of two twenty five degrees the other air traffic controller might if you tell him forty five degrees he'll say oh that's alright he's way over here he's not going to UNK with this seven four seven that's coming in this way
yeah
and so it's very important that you give the bearing correctly
yeah he's forty five degrees coming in at forty five degrees from me that's what they should say
no what they should say is we only ever
no yeah well two hundred and twenty five degrees yeah
they just say two hundred and twenty five cos if you start saying forty five degrees from
from me yeah
me it's going to get very confusing
yeah
so we have a nice simple rule
you always point to north always go clockwise
UNK have got them as well haven't they
yes
yeah
UNK and ships
you might here on erm ah if you've seen old war film there's someone in a ship and he'll say UNK bearing
yeah
three six he'll say bearing two seven o now if he says UNK bearing two seven o show me where the show me where the UNK that's the ship there the s where would the UNK be coming from
so two seven o it'd be coming from there
yep
so when he knows exactly where the where it's coming in from
yeah
he knows how to take avoiding action
but if you were here and you're on the bridge and you get it's your turn to look out for UNK and
you're getting a bit UNK and you measure it round this way instead
why do they have the numbers going round UNK as well
well that's so you can work out erm if you if you look at any two numbers they add up to a hundred and eighty
oh yeah
on this side erm they have them so you can work out the reverse bearings but it's better not to use those just stick with the out
cos it UNK m sometimes it UNK me
it does just stick with the outside ones
yeah
and go around there well going back to this one you're bearing right you're at s and you take a bearing on this ship j and the bearing is two hundred and twenty five degrees now the one ship at j takes a bearing on you and he gets forty five degrees well that angle there is always the same as that one
yeah
that's always forty five degrees
so
yeah cos we done that in pythagoras
something similar
yeah
with erm the hill top and i drew the other triangle
right the angles outside
yeah
adding up to one hundred and eighty
the one outside the triangle there
right
so if i take this bearing this is a g very common question they have in g c s e take a bearing from j and it's forty five degrees right
now that is the reverse bearing the back bearing
and that'll be right on right on
and that would be that would be so if we're doing it this way right let's erm forget about where we are sitting at the moment now and just look we're in a helicopter looking at these ships now so this one UNK you in the helicopter and says that ship s is on a bearing of forty five degrees
yeah
right and then this ship s UNK the helicopter and says this ship j is on a bearing of and let's say let's say he does it the wrong way round is on a bearing of forty five degrees
yeah
well you think that can't be right because can you work out what this UNK going to be and instead of measuring it could we have calculated it
that's always the same as that angle is the same as that angle
well wouldn't it be on the reverse bearing
the two hundred and twenty five
it is the two hundred and twenty five but how could we calculate that from just looking at if they just told us and you didn't use the protractor
that's forty five how much is just that much of it
ninety
is it
i mean no a hundred and eighty
right so that bit of it is a hundred and eighty and that bit will be forty five
yeah so
so what
a hundred and eighty
add forty five okay
five yeah
so if we did it this way erm let's pick an actual bearing so that we get it right
so this time if that was seventy
so what's going to be
so there's a and there's b we're going to take a bearing here it's the north still take a bearing here from north measure it round seventy degrees
now what i want to know is could you work out without measuring it could you work out what that one will be
a hundred and eighty plus seventy degrees
that's it
and this is a very common question
don't forget the big thing is about the bearing of and from the bearing of b and everyone must have gone and put the p put the protractor on b
yeah
so the bearing of b from a and from is where we start from
yeah
so if i say the bearing of b from a is seventy degrees then that's where we start from
where we put our UNK and start from at seventy degrees and then they'll say so the bearing the bearing of b from a is seventy degrees and then they'll say what is the bearing of a from b
and that's a very common one they give
and then you just put a hundred an a seventy plus a hundred and eighty
right so if we're in a helicopter up here and this ship says the bearing is seventy five degrees right
mm
and this ship says the bearing is just check that one is two hundred and fifty three degrees right
yeah
now what that tells us is they can't both be right
mm
because this should be if this one's right it'll be a hundred and eighty at seventy five
plus the five
which is how much
five it's fifteen er two hundred and fifty five
two hundred and fifty five and if we did it to he's absolutely right erm then this one should have given his bearing as two fifty three minus seventy which comes to what does that come to
minus thr sorry minus one eighty
two five three
which is two five three so if you're in the ship you can have them you can do work this out from the bearings they both give you and check that they're roughly right they won't be exactly right
mm
cos the ships rolling like this and someone's trying to take a bearing it's quite difficult at sea but they get a they do they get very good at UNK fairly accurately
mm
now haven't you got questions on bearings that we did haven't you and notes on it
yeah it wa we've actually done that one today we've done that one
whi using forty five degrees
yeah
yeah and that one with seventy
yeah
and forty five degrees is one try it try it do that one again with forty degrees
right
and draw it and stand up and think how you're going to do it and maybe you sort of you know sit here or something when i've gone and face the window and say that's north and i must make sure i get it set up get this the right way up and
yeah
you've got one of these haven't you
yeah
yeah
okay so try that with erm twenty five forty erm a hundred and fifty and two hundred and ten
all different angles for in there and you just sort of draw it and work out what the other one is calculate it first alright that's a from b i'll move that a and b as well
okay
yeah
this is bearing of a this one b from is where you start
for each one of these calculate the bearing of b from a okay
yeah
and when you've calculated it draw some of them and erm just check them
yeah
and see they come okay because you need to do the drawing as well to sort of get you used to
yeah
you know getting used to the feel of it it's alright just talking about it or just doing some calculations and just thinking oh yeah i can do that now but you can't beat really getting down and drawing the pictures and
yeah
playing with it and stuff like i think i should have gone a while ago actually
yeah
other things to get caught up with er four o'clock got to be over in UNK fairly soon
there's your ten pounds
thank you very much
your ten pounds take away nine pounds is minus four hundred pounds which means you owe me four hundred pounds
you wish
it's five hundred is it
it might be nothing at all
don't go away don't go away
UNK
oh
i knew i'd do that UNK fallen out of my little my little world
thanks
here's some coins for playing with for doing erm adding up and UNK with the younger ones and i keep those in there and they're all over the bottom of that bag
i used to have them little plastic ones that
they're fine but i think y you can't beat real ones
yeah
because you know erm most kids these days especially by the time they're nine or ten they're used to having their own pocket money and then you and they say they can't do any maths at all and you say well if you had a fifty pence and you bought something for twenty four how much change
yeah cos he knows he went down the shop yeah
UNK no problem
yeah
yeah
and they can do maths they just it's just that when you call it maths they say they can't do it
yeah it's like the little ones they the erm they handle all sorts and when you comes actually down to seeing it on paper you ke it's alright if they're just counting it there in the hands and stuff
but that's i mean that's what you've got to start from doing the counting and then getting to right it out how much have got there
twenty five p write it down
how much have you got
two ten p s and one five or something
have you used all them UNK like er matching numbers now in the UNK in the schools and that and you've actually got to sit there and count them so
yeah
some o to some of them it just UNK them stiff
well i think most kids are interested in counting er if it's something that they're interested in but if they're counting erm you know little dots on a bit of paper or something it's boring but if they're
i know it
counting UNK on
there's a little boy in the nursery and the nursery teacher says he's thick for a he's four and he's with the younger ones and she said he's thick because erm he just can't be bothered but what it is he knows it
yeah
and he thinks well why should i waste my time
right
doing it for her when i know i already know it
so he's not at all thick he's just bored and she's not spotting that and
yeah
giving him something to
he's a lot
to stretch him
he's erm he's a lot more intelligent than he lets on and he's one of these that lets all the others push him down where at the end of the day he can turn round
and gets what he wants doesn't he
yeah because he's the smart one
right
and he knows he knows his little w his they how to work on people
so he's not at all daft eh
no
he knows what's going on and how to make it work
UNK smart UNK
did you did you try that erm joining the dots up on a on a graph that you were going to do last time
oh no i didn't get no i didn't get a chance no
oh works very well
tell you what i will do have a go cos i want you to try that cos it's nice erm when you've done it one day
yeah
i promise but not at the moment cos it needs a lot of setting up i'll get myself to set my computer up specially to make those disks
yeah
because i can't do them on my main one i'll have to power up another one and getting wires between them and
yeah
stuff erm i'll i've got a disk that does interesting little joined up lines and there's one where you can just put numbers in yourself and it'll draw all sorts of pictures for you
oh yeah
and you can probably do i don't know if you could do print screen no if you got you'll have to learn graphics but anyway i'll tell you about that when you do it my numbers in there take all the rubbish away
see you
it's nothing compared to what we've got in the house
see you next week
yeah
i haven't had time to get it up on the machine to change again quickly but i've had a quick look at the situation with regard to the five per cent increase
yeah
so the saving that we were going to make them by reducing five per cent but increasing the UNK machine bearings and UNK this standard cost one up to well as it turned out seventeen per cent margin
yeah
mhm
would ta make that three thousand pounds
which is the one we've just been talking about
yeah
and so we were going up from that price to that price
that's what i wanted to do
that's what you wanted to do you hadn't discussed these with them
i've mentioned it to him and what he's saying is come back with a firm proposal
obviously what happened then this was before
this is because this was the dead stock that we sent him
the tools i wanted to get rid of
okay
yeah
it's changed really now because of the fact we pulled
yeah
we've got more of a leverage so we
yeah
need to re look at how we because he's mentioned straight away as soon as he was in the UNK
right
well you know the five per cent reduction you know don't worry about that at the minute and all this sort of thing so
right yeah
it does need another
yeah
looking at
basically what if we do increase to that price
yeah
on the machine build that he's given me for this year of which that is an example
the two arrow machines use it and there's a hundred and two hundred and nine machines altogether
yeah
mill which will have three of these one each machine
six hundred bearings pairs
six hundred and thirty seven to be precise
right
yes
well the difference is about six hundred and seventy two pounds
you mean the increase in prices
yes that's how much extra it'll cost him
yeah
er we've run up a cost of two hundred and fifty quid getting
and the rest and the rest
well this is this is what the point
yeah
i think UNK the time
i want to try and get it done bearing in mind UNK going to have to have the baby on friday if she hasn't had it before
yeah
so will more than likely be off next week but i do want to try and get something done with this and some of the other accounts i want to try and get them out the way before i
right
now what's the how have you calculated the five per cent erm reduction
is th is that because all
yeah
these are down five per ce no that's not it
that's down five that's UNK er that's up
that's up
because it's the UNK machine
that one's up because it's the UNK machine
it's just those two that'll have gone down by five per cent which are the UNK machine bearings
right
okay
so what's that five per cent negative worth to us
well what i what i did here to work it out so i could come up to some sort of value is i said i haven't had time to chuck these back on the screen yet to start again
yeah
but this is where it got to when we talked about it last time
er is i'd looked at the using their machine build which i've built in
yeah
on the UNK range the UNK and the arrows
yeah
it would mean that is the price that they would sell at the nineteen ninety four price volume
and that's the price up to that one
yeah that's it the first five lines
so you're going for a five six to five nine thirteen nine to fourteen six thirteen seven to fourteen five
so that that's the saving effect the difference between those two is the saving
yeah that is the saving that they would have made on each of those builds
so we're talking there about
i'll do it on the computer but
savings of whatever this is it's three hundred erm that's er seven hundred that's a thousand
er thirteen seven that's eight hundred that's eighteen hundred
that's a big one isn't it
about fifteen hundred
er that's three thousand three hundred
forty eight machines you see
right so another sixteen hundred there
so that's four or five thousand pounds that we're giving to them
right and by putting these prices up on the UNK and that i was actually UNK a couple of thousand pound back off them
and that's i was trying to put myself in the position of before
still offering them a three thousand pound saving
yeah
but helping our spread if you know what i mean
yeah
right
now it's a different ball game because we i think we have an opportunity to maintain that price for a while
i mean i it's where we feel we need to make the emphasis
this is based on full year isn't it
yeah
erm one of the things that er would be nice to end up with is a price on the books which is the higher price
yeah
so that the price we want to end up with on the books is
mhm
that one that one that one
yeah
that one and that one
yeah now well this is
that one e erm i mean i'm a i was just i said twenty pound o six it was a quick calculation it ends up at seventeen per cent margin
erm you see it's balancing that between the fact that we don't
mm
but we're s we're gonna be charging it approximately twice as much as would
but we've helped him
and i think we've got
but we're only charging twice as much as would erm because are providing a standard bearing
er well selected for their standards that we think is the only way they could do it
yeah
although understanding the way volume manufacture and i would say they've probably if they've got similar production facilities got a very good chance of producing good stuff anyway
along the lines of there's a very good probability they'll just take
mm
it straight off the line knowing that it's coming in
we haven't got as precision
so what's the advantage of our product over theirs
nothing really
think of one
well er
there must be some dimensions that have been more thoroughly checked than er
well no because i c i can't say exactly how 's applying their product
they could be doing it on a yes well ninety per cent of them will be p five
they could be selecting them off the
yeah
line
yeah if they if their churning out the stock that tu tend to UNK out i mean i go along for an enquiry for a few and find they've got thousands in stock
you know
and you think bloody hell well i'm not surprised they can guarantee getting p fives
if i had all them to choose from i could guarantee it
i don't know how they're achieving the price
i mean they're s they were something like twelve quid a pair
yeah
now john says he can only imagine that they're selecting them out
but then again john's a precision man
yeah
yeah
so you know coming to terms with how manage to do what they do you can see it's probably actually not too bad a price to charge when they can get them cheaper
yeah
but we also know that if er select from the end of the line of standard production
they don't select on every feature they only select on some
don't they
no not necessarily they could er they could check for all UNK
and i don't know how they do it
this is it i don't know how they do it
it's only UNK don't forget
they don't have to test them or anything
well according to the p thanks carol the p five UNK no doesn't involve noise testing
no it's purely UNK
the thing is the machine tool industry or super precision requirements be become use and take for granted a noise specification the fact that it must run quietly
but you can get p
right well that's something that's something that you've got to you've got to differentiate
mm
ours are noise tested correct
yeah
p five does not require a noise test
no
correct
yeah
right so what you're getting from us is a
noise tested bearing
right okay
secondly er
we guarantee p five
we are we're UNK p five plus a noise level
yeah
so you're actually getting something that you terribly badly need
i put the seed of doubt into UNK mind about the fact that i could not say that er bearings could be guaranteed p five at that price
i said the way they're picking them out i couldn't say that they can guarantee every bearing
right and what's the noise test that we put ours through is that three UNK noise testing there UNK and so on and
yeah the normal
right so what we're doing is a noise test to super precision
yeah
limits
yeah
right is there anything else like that pardon me oh dear
is there anything else like that which erm er which we do that they may not do
not really
cage it'd be interesting to find out what cage material they're supplying
what cage material are you supplying
i've a feeling b e t n
b e t n
yeah so it's the er cage
the UNK type thing
yeah
er okay so you've got your quiet noise running
quiet noise
be sure about the cage
yeah it's the one i'm not so sure what they would supply you see
possibly UNK
they do tend to have single UNK that's a single strip that just UNK round
they do a lot of that support frames
do they
yeah a single strip that they actually just feed into the ring and then put the balls in
so it's not actually a solid ring it's n UNK thing which sits in
oh yeah they use that f in the in the p two class product
they have some of those in
japanese do it as well
they works i mean you know our point is we always you know we've got the guarantee with the cage and that
but er
well okay so you're going to you're going to erm emphasize the er the fact that what we are supplying is a noise tested
mhm
p five bearing
yeah
you're going to emphasize the fact that our cage of course is erm a UNK cage
mhm
er out of er UNK six
yeah
is it still UNK sixty six not
i don't think it's changed yet
erm
our stocks over there would still be that anyway
and er and that these have er substantial advantages for them and don't know but there's got to be an element of doubt
yeah
erm and although they may say they're noise tested erm i think you've gotta question whether they're noise tested to the level
and you've seen our facilities here
er and you know how
yeah
how very careful we are
mm
so what you're what you can be sure of getting from us is absolutely on line and of course you're getting a service
right
erm e mainly it's where do i put the emphasis
i know we've got a lever now yeah we're gonna get rid of this in other words UNK gonna give us something for it
yeah
yeah it's identifying where we want to get it
now okay i know what you mean by saying yes you want to get the higher price everywhere
but if we took the highest price of everything then we're making thousands and thousands and thousands
now
yeah well presumably we're UNK this position
that's right we've got to balance that with the fact that we did promise them a decrease but we've got the erm leverage of having helped them
so if we've got
well hang on hang on hang on
i'll tell you what we'll do
i'll tell you what we'll do
yeah
how about we leave the price as it is
we'll leave no we'll no we'll leave these prices here which we were gonna reduce we're gonna
yeah
leave them as they are
right
but we will give them a five per cent reduction on those prices wh for deliveries between march and september
so we're giving em it for six months
we're giving it for six months
that's worth two and a half thousand quid
yeah
mm
er june to december he'll say
alright june to december but that's yeah
just easier you see cos he'll say the then for when we do a price increase next time
cos if you go back up in september it's higher for the increase next january
well that's exactly right
but at
yeah okay but at least we've got the price on the table
maybe we don't increase it next january
mm
maybe we leave it where it is but at least that price is on the table
right
whereas anything else we do we've got to fight ou we've got to UNK our way back to that
i'll tell you what then we've got the two options we've got the one area of this five per cent where
yeah
we don't want to give em it for the whole year
yeah
and i've got the standard cost here i need to get up
right
right now erm i want to get that up first
yeah
i want to make profit on one size rather than er
yeah
yeah keep it on others
yeah
so how about if i look at the six monthly saving
yes
yeah
yeah
i look at what that is in value about two and a half thousand i'll look at this one
yeah
i'll put a reasonable price in there i see what that's UNK
the press release that i put erm to the internationally known bearings company
right er
which you secretary seemed to think was okay for that one
yes it should be shouldn't it jane
as opposed as opposed to UNK
well yeah
yes
right
as opposed to UNK
okay i think what
erm
i'll do in that case is hold this press release because you may want to change it again a little bit
er yes
yeah
well erm what does holding it involve
telling them not to post it tomorrow
not to post it tomorrow
right okay
yeah i mean that's not going to miss us a particular slot in the in the publication
oh no
no not at all
i look if i can do that now i can save erm
right
i can save her photocopying it
right
erm
yes that would be a good idea wouldn't it
what would i do without these things i don't know
i've got an appointment in london at five o'clock so i've got to leave here at about quarter to three
right
to get the three o'clock train
no problem
yeah
if you'd like to just have a look through that is that paragraph where i put a line
yeah
hello
chris
chris
er UNK the press release number six that i've given to sandra will you tell her to hold it please and not to send it out tomorrow
yeah
okay
sorry
no to do nothing with it
yeah i'll sort it out tomorrow morning
alright bye
good
just there is a little bit that i want to add that erm that teachers get free admission
ah right
good
but does that paragraph
yeah i think in principle that
yeah
that's er that's fine erm
yeah
er the internationally known bearings company
er what should we what have we been u have we been using any particular sort of form of words jane
no
for that
because actually isn't internationally known
it's the that's internationally known and the 's internationally known
yes
but the UNK of the two is not
i think i don't think we're in UNK of the truth
i no i think it's probably that's probably about as you're going to get anyway
yes
er e erm
i think that'll be okay
yeah
yeah
i think that'll be okay
and then what we will do later on we shall do another press release which will talk more about the
exactly what's erm gonna happen
right
erm to persuade some of the nine hundred schools to reply to us
right
yes good
we've got twenty five schools taking part at the moment
they're already committed to too
they're already committed which is quite good in january
right
cos we'd got i think about twelve last year at this time
erm now what we want to talk about if i can well you tell me what you want to know i think that's the best
i think what i wanted to put some more meat on the basic idea so that
yeah
our factory colleagues and jane as far as the erm preparation of er any equipment and so on is concerned
yes
can actually start thinking about what we're actually going to do
yeah
so er because there will be certain input from the factories
erm david's newark erm road based
yes
er and erm e erm UNK erm road based
yeah
so we've got the two newark factories represented
yes
er and jane looks after all the publicity er UNK and that sort of thing so
good
so that really it's to try and er get us thinking about what we could do
yes
because there may be initiatives that can come from the factories er which would bring the thing alive also for local
yes yeah
people in some way
so erm philip could you could you just begin by putting a bit more meat on o on what the competition how the competition is envisaged to work
yes i will
let me tell you about the schools involved in the show anyway
er the nottinghamshire branch of the of the national farmer's union are the UNK of the children of the show
and they together with who are animal feed stuff and corn and UNK people erm organized the UNK and generally do the UNK that gets the kids there
erm and they sponsor that sponsor the UNK and so does the n f u erm now within the UNK there are lots of UNK that are of educational value
i mean it may well be there's a there's a lamb there may be a calf
erm there'll be someone talking about UNK production there'll be someone talking about milk production this sort of thing
now within that UNK you can have a table
erm now if you wanted to go larger i say a table because of the size of the UNK and what the
yeah
this is what national grid did last year
if you wanted to have something erm larger than that then i'm e i am UNK to say you can have a trade stand at half price
right yeah
now what i'm really looking at there is that our basic trade stand space i is about a hundred pound
erm there's no reason why you shouldn't have double that size the basic one is three metres square
now i didn't know whether you've got an exhibition unit or something
er well we have we have all sorts of exhibition
yeah you'd better have a mobile unit
er things that we
that erm
well right david you've got a an input there because we've done a project with the erm er p with a technical college here
er for a mobile a mobile unit
mhm exhibition caravan
exhibition
caravan
er caravan
yeah
trailer
yes
yes
it is actually isn't it
trailer yeah
trailer yeah
yeah
erm and it would be appropriate i guess to use that
but that probably wouldn't be inside the tent would it
well it wouldn't matter because you see the treasure hunt takes the kids all around the show ground
right
now the idea and collect a piece of treasure a ball bearing
from
or out of the reject box
yes yeah yes
i think we could probably find plenty of them
surplus stocks
talking of UNK i was i was UNK into going down to stoke yesterday to look at the UNK seconds shop
ah but this is great and everything is nice and cheap there i came away paying two hundred and forty pounds what we bought
now that you see so it might be an idea if you have your table within the UNK that does whatever you want it to do that can talk to kids if they want and so forth you see they they're sort of UNK upwards
yes
erm and then you could have your trade stand where they've got to come and collect something and answer a question
mhm
now the quiz will be erm what was our i mean if there's a history of the firm what did what did used to be called or something
something that you've got on display where they could just read it pick the answer out
yeah
and they put their answer on their form
they pick their bit of treasure up whatever it is
i mean national grid gave them a bit of cable
they chopped a lot of cable into one inch pieces you see and just gave a bit of this out
yeah
it's a UNK bit of treasure but they've gotta
yeah
come back with a bit of treasure and the answer
right
then the winner of course is the one that takes the money
erm now that sounds to me to be the best way of doing
wh what we do you see they have to wander around the UNK doing this so we get our traffic through the UNK and they see other things while they're going around
as opposed just going
mm
mhm
mhm
into a UNK and having it all laid on for
mhm
them in there
erm now if we have if we have our er erm caravan and we have the table in the in the tent they can
yeah
obviously be at opposite ends or different places so there's plenty of space between them
absolutely
oh yes yeah
we wouldn't put the caravan next to the tent
right
er are those er w would the would the er treasure hunt just involve visiting that or
ooh no about twenty about twenty others
so
yeah
what do we do
pick particular stands or pick
erm we select the stands where the UNK going to be because some
right
of the treasure might be our treasure or n f u treasure and so right
i see
yes
we'll put this treasure on this stand
yeah right i see
erm so unless anyone is UNK they wouldn't necessarily have the treasure on their stand
we'd select other stand holders
and what we'd do we'd go to say the farm machinery people and say
yeah
right will you take part in the treasure hunt
will you give a UNK and bolt or something
or whatever something that they've
right
yeah
got low on their stock
yeah
erm UNK if you like that they
yeah
can give away
yeah
erm the blacksmith and we give them a UNK nail
yeah
this sort of thing
but they
right
come back with it and we give them a carrier bag erm to carry all the stuff in
right
and them they come back
erm
and if you've got any UNK you want to dish out to them it helps
well we'll provide the carrier bags
yeah
won't we carrier bags
you have some of those have you
we have them we have them yeah
er and er we could provide as treasure
yeah
we could provide steel balls in UNK out of the
yeah
as out of assembly UNK
mhm
er and i should think we could supply rollers on the same basis couldn't we
er and
it would need to be either one or the other i think
well i mean these could be these could be collected from somebody else somewhere else
yes of course
yeah
er so i mean that c because er i mean they the steel balls and steel rollers go into the bin i mean they can't be used for anything
well that's right
well yes absolutely
yeah
so er and they're quite i mean if nobody's ever seen a er erm
yeah
a good quality steel ball before they're quite nice things to have and they
yeah
feel soft
right
yes
erm we could certainly do that
yeah
erm
of a size that
well of a reasonable a re yes i mean they won't be so small you can hardly see them
yes quite
and they won't be s so large as you can't carry them
erm i just wonder also whether er we could possibly out of our erm surplus or dead stock provide some er some small complete bearings
how many how many are we looking for
how many are we expecting to take part
we don't know last year it was about four hundred four or five hundred
so we'd need beginning to get a bit more bu but in terms
of showing people what
y yes
yes that's true
i think steel balls are but you see you can do a display on your table can't you
but i but i but in terms of showing people what bearings actually are
yeah
there's nothing like a complete bearing
no that's right
no
because what the tendency is that people feel that bearings when you say a bearing you mean a steel ball
and of course yeah
yes as opposed to the ball race
er i mean what we want to be getting them to think about is the complete
yes
unit
so i think we might make an effort
yeah
to try to provide erm
we it's always difficult in january to say how many people are going to be there to take part but we last year it was about five hundred i think
erm so we ou and carrier bags we may have enough to carry us through the show i don't know
but certainly i mean if you have carrier bags you can give them
i would like to do that
you can give them away anyway
yes
there's no problem
yes
er erm and if we can if they can all use is it
yeah
then that's further
i mean if there's a leaflet you can put in them as well fair enough
make that be your UNK bag of whatever
yeah
erm there's no problem there
cos i was going to be ordering carrier bags anyway
well i can cross that out you see
mm
yeah
erm i can't remember who said they'd sponsor those but we'll get them onto something else
well they can erm so e and we ought to provision probably for a thousand
i would have thought so
if it's likely to be any more i'll come back to you
yeah
er but i would have though that should easily do it
er right so we're talking er about basically being involved specifically at two locations
yes
if you wish that
what i was gonna come onto there is erm can we e that would involve UNK wouldn't it
on the friday and the saturday
mhm
er would the factories between them be able to help with that for a spell er one of the things that i'm slightly concerned about is if you've only got old UNK on the stand erm rather than younger people
mm
that might er erm lose an opportunity
would there be i mean is there is there a possibility of getting some of our younger people
oh yes
involved on the factory side
you know this caravan is it covered with or
it's got UNK all round it
that's something that i think we need to have a look at
mhm
perhaps if we may
mhm
erm and update er update it
the only UNK the only permanent er writing on it is er school and college
that actually built it
that's fine
could erm could you perhaps tie up between you david and jane erm so that jane you could go and have a look at it and see what's actually needed to get that up to date
by environmental friendly screen
whereabouts is this
it's actually in the in the grounds of the of the college
you can drive past it you can actually see from the UNK
mm
are the college involved at all
i i've spoken to the college
erm
are they involved i in their own right
er they aren't but they i think they're in it on the UNK
right
they'll be part of erm either nottinghamshire county council or
district council
both of whom
mm
yeah
but it's likely that it'll be the last showing at notts county council of course
indeed there won't be a county council will there
well we're all hoping there won't
er right so erm basically if we have if we have that stand which erm perhaps could be factory UNK
mhm
in principle
and er jane if perhaps we could organize the UNK of the table
and er i think perhaps if we could put a c are we allowed to put round the table some
oh yes
erm some pictures
you can you can back the table with a
yeah
with a screen
that's the sort of thing cos we've got erm perhaps we could put up some of the i mean the ones that you've got out in behind your desk at the moment
that somebody's just pinched
oh have they
yeah
well maybe we
yeah but er maybe we could we could book erm half a dozen panels
yeah
or something of that with some photographs on
no reason no reason why that shouldn't be i mean we've got what we use as a as a clip display thing that's about six foot high and three panels you know but erm
yeah
that goes nicely behind a six foot UNK or whatever it is
oh yes you can dress that little area up as much as you like
but my worry was that there wasn't going to be enough space there for you to perhaps say all you wanted to say
erm i think maybe we need to think about it we need to give a bit more thought to that
mm
yeah
erm as to how much we er want
yes
need to do
you see if you're if you do have a display caravan you can probably do some grass displays of large bearings or something in the front of it to
yeah
you know for people to have a UNK at
yeah
that's not a bad idea from the point of view of the general public really because that does give you a show to the sixty thousand odd people who are wandering around there
yeah
erm who wouldn't necessarily go to the schools UNK of course
that's right
yeah
that's right yes
just as a just as a sales pitch for that
well you're gonna ask us to pay fifty quid for the to park the caravan
i was gonna ask you to pay a hundred but i'll talk about that
you tell me how big a ground you want and i'll tell you what you're gonna pay for it
right okay
good try good try tom
okay
sorry i thought i thought you quoted a price of a hundred and said that
no i said space is a hundred pound and we'll give you twice that size for that
oh i see
i just i just assumed you'd give us that size for fifty quid
well i can talk about this i mean it depends erm
you know this UNK will it just be
yeah
the UNK at that are actually going into it
adults can go into it but we have found generally speaking that particularly on friday erm it's full of kids
i mean it's a place that adults would tend to avoid the minute the put their head inside it
saturday there tends to be kids going in with their parents
erm you see we do we do a family ticket which is used for saturday the friday which UNK two adults and four kids on saturday for twelve pounds fifty
or
erm and so kids that don't come on the friday tend to come with their parents on saturday
and we have made a point of saying in this press release that children can individually enter this as well
right
but if they win it the prize goes to their school and not to them
yeah
now of course there is the there is the spin off as well that you can get some mileage out of the winning school or the first three by inviting them here or visiting them and so forth
yes
cos they're got to divert the money to a project
they can't just put it into the school fund
right
they've got to buy some equipment
the school that won it last year bought a skeleton
erm a fully mobile UNK skeleton and th it's a deprived area of nottingham and they've apparently been able to teach them more with this skeleton over this past six months than any other kids in the school
i think they know where to hit people where it hurts most of them
well yeah i me i think that's perhaps something for er david and eric to
yeah
er to consider as to whether it would be appropriate to invite the winning schools for er to bring a party in or involve them in the erm gala day or e i mean i erm or the open day or something
i think whatever whatever's our value
when they come you're bound to get a picture in the paper of it happening
yeah
yeah
erm you know and also we want a picture of the presentation isn't actually on the day the presentation will be at the school
right
so again come along and present it you see as well
so we'll go along to school yeah
erm now er just philip just correct me er on the on the detail of this thing er individuals pitch up at the tent collect the collect the instructions
yeah
yes
which you've prepared
that's right
er which gives them the clues as to where they've got to go
that's right it gives the it tells them where they've got to go
and it will be on and stand
erm it'll tell them where the clues are
right
so they haven't got to find the site of the clues
right
they've merely got to sort the clues out when they get there
right
right and they'll be told what the clue is
yeah
and so they've got to they they'll be asked the question rather and they know the UNK going to on the stand that they go to
right so they get the answer
and when they get the answer they pick up the UNK treasure the treasure
they pick up the treasure
yeah
and then they're off to the next one
right
and now how do we decide the winner
the winner is decided erm on the total correct entries and if i'm right there is a UNK to fill in
but that's all done by n f u you need have no part of that unless you want to have
right yo i w no i was just gonna say th there's there would need to be a UNK of some sort presumably
there needs to be a UNK
yeah it isn't the first correct one out they've all got shout if you like
right
erm but it's but what happens they're all done and n f u rather treasure their erm their job as the UNK of these
and i haven't erm i thought it's prudent to leave that alone
right i was just wondering if they would i if they would like us to suggest a tie UNK
why not
why not
what i would do
or something of that sort which might be associated with like when was
yeah i'll get the next erm i'll get last year's questions
yeah
and just see what they are like and see what they did as a UNK
yeah
and then perhaps you can sort one out
yes
there's no problem
i mean like the er competitions UNK competitions erm invent a UNK for something like that
that's right that's right and who knows you might get a good one
might get a good one
er so erm yes i think something like that would be erm
yeah
er
yes well i could arrange that
so the treasure hunt course as it were
yeah
is arranged by
is UNK is defined by
by the show
and what we really do when we've got the show ground plan done you see we look at which stands are where and say right we'll have that one that one that one this one and so forth and go
yeah and then you just go and talk to them
yeah
and er run off a s er a sheet of questions
and if and if they haven't got any treasure then we provide them with it
right
whatever it is
yeah
erm i think last year well what i've got to do i've got last year national grid provided them with pens
i think we might have that one sorted out
you've got somebody to give them pens
we may have
yes
that's something i've got to sort out because
er that again if you haven't we could probably fix
could you
yes
well do you want to do that whether i whether i
do we want to do that jane
how many er
well maximum a thousand
could probably only five hundred
how are we off for pens
we'd have to order
cheap pens
order some more
we'd have to order some more would we
yes
are yours fairly elaborate ones that you have
no we do have cheap ones as well
yeah
yeah
that sort of thing
yeah
well i personally my stock
i think p maybe philip it would be best if y er i mean if you've got somebody up your UNK who
i haven't at the moment because last year it was it was national grid who haven't
right
who are closing their newark operation you see which has made it rather tricky to approach them
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
shall i see what i can do
see what see what you can do and perhaps er jane you could just look into the possibility of erm because if i mean if we were going to do a run of pens we wouldn't just have a thousand would we
no
not the cheap ones
no
erm so perhaps we could have a look and see what whether there is a plan UNK to er do those so that we could have some available for
yes er i mean that sort tell me what they want
it's fifteen by eight
fifteen foot by eight foot
er right
er are you telling me that is there are any existing pens they would be in the sales company
and i might have a thousand UNK away that i didn't know about
could have yeah
yes
er well perhaps i'd better have a look
you could have a look but like i say ordering UNK now it's up to the sales people to tell me what they want and i order them on their behalf
erm right but presumably there's some coordination between all the various sales companies
for things like pens isn't there
well yeah if the u k came to me and said i want ten thousand pens tell me what which ones they wanted i would then contact the sales companies are you interested to
oh i see
right okay
but i wouldn't just go off my own bat now and order stuff
right
and dish them out to the sales companies
right
okay
er we'll have a lo we'll have a look at that
yeah
er philip anyway
i mean they are they're funded by themselves
er i'm conscious of that
i'm conscious of that
er and no doubt no doubt david and eric are erm UNK how much what we've funding
mhm
i mean basically the s the funding will come from the sales company
mhm
erm er and erm wh what we're offering you is an opportunity to erm give your factories some promotion in the local area
mhm
as well as the as well as the erm er the sales activity
because from a sales point of view we won't actually
cost you
we won't actually sale
yeah
we won't s sell anything
what we will do perhaps is just promote the name
sign writers
er that's the object of the exercise
yeah
as far as i'm concerned
i wouldn't expect to take an order or even have a serious enquiry resulting from it
no
erm but i do feel that there is likely to be some positive spin off for the factories
yes
erm and er i don't know exactly what's in your caravan but erm er whether you would want to put in something about employment opportunities or the training scheme er apprenticeship schemes and that sort of thing
mhm
mhm
i would think there's a grand opportunity to do all that
oh yeah that's the main area really is erm recruiting for apprentices mainly to the young people
yes
that's why it would be good idea if you could man the
when is it when is it
it's the sixth fifth and sixth is it or sixth and seventh
six and seventh of may it is
six and seventh of may yeah six and seventh of may that's right
ideally have to be recruiting before then really
well okay
er but there maybe there maybe some others
well it gives a picture doesn't it of erm i mean we do one of the
erm and that type of stand i mean it that in a very restricted area haven't you
yes yeah
your UNK and everything
yeah
the caravan is ideally designed as er an exhibition with steps in er either right or left in to see whatever's on show and then out on the opposite side
mhm
quite wide steps and it's designed as a exhibition
so whatever we put inside there you can walk through it
yeah
up a few steps across and out the other side
yeah
it has its own built in generator for the lighting
brilliant
you can boil a kettle in there
it's own bar
not quite it is UNK
relatively warm
yeah right okay
erm so we need to work out how much space we need to stand it in so that i can get back to philip and agree that
oh you've got the dimensions oh right yeah
well i've got the dimensions here so i can i'm just thinking you see i may persuade the society to do a deal of free stands facing or something like this
good
but see where we go on that
yeah
yeah
right
erm
i mean i know the deal i'd do now but er only being their consultant i can't really UNK it
you can't commit
well i can tell oh i can tell them wh in fact i would be prepared to do that
right
are you happy with that
yes
you provide the pens we'll give you a free stand space
yes
right done
so we're UNK we're going to have a table which we will man which will have some sort of display around it
some pictures and things
that's right
yeah
er and there will be somebody there
on that we will provide erm er carrier bags er some pens and er we'll probably er dish out some leaflets there as well
yeah
it may be that the carrier bags and pens would go onto the onto the table where the entry forms are UNK out as part
yeah
of the package there
yeah fine
in fact i suggest it probably should
yeah
erm and also you'll get admission tickets of course
right
erm
yes
a reasonable number erm and you and i decide what's reasonable on that
right
right
erm so that's that
we will we will undertake to provide some steel balls some steel rollers
yeah
and some er bearings
yeah
for a as UNK
yeah
yes as the treasure
yes quite
er we will mobilize the er the caravan erm which needs updating and UNK to display whatever we want
yeah
and we will man that
at a at a space which you will provide us yeah
yeah
distance away from the UNK as well
yeah
erm and
yes bear in mind that of course that you're going to get quite a lot of adult audience going through it as well as kids of course
yes
yes
erm
i think er we need some product range leaflets and things like that in and the er the group UNK
d i suppose it doesn't have a er something we could the corporate video on does it
oh yes
does it
tables and chairs and
oh well we'll we could we might easily use the corporate video for that
cos that's rather exciting and new
er that but anyway we can we can organize that
er within that space
the factories will man well between us we'll work out the UNK
yeah mhm
you'll provide us with sufficient entries so that the people who are man it get in and car parking
yeah
and car parking
yeah
erm you're going to arrange the er the course
yes indeed
right
and we will set the questions
and set the questions
erm
yes and
and also talk to you about a UNK
and UNK yes
UNK
and then er in due course some time after the event er we need to be erm
you'll do the presentation of the award
present the award
school at which we'll invite the press
this didn't happen last year and i was cross it didn't but i've organized it so that it will this year
right
erm
okay
i think they daren't take it to road at nottingham for some reason
right erm er presentation to the schools and then we need to consider if we would want to invite
then if you want if you want to invite them back that's right yes
it i it could depend on where the school is you see because the winner was nottingham last year
erm it could be newark it could be lincoln it could be UNK
yeah
er wherever they come from
yeah
yeah
yes it was rather it was quite UNK but they the winner last year one of the teachers at the school was the secretary's sister
oh dear
and er this is
and the society have nothing to do with it of course you see
but it didn't stop the UNK
right okay i think i i've covered everything that was
yeah
er that i think will enable us to do our bit
erm
if there's anything else do ring me and ask
right
and erm
okay
but i will confirm all this to you
yes
the UNK made on the and the stands space so there's no stand space
good
erm and what we will do is make sure you've got enough room for fifteen foot by eight foot with whatever space in front of it as a as a lawn if you like
mhm
yeah
yeah
no problem with that at all
great
great okay
lovely thank you very much indeed
i will get me down to my
well you see he said that the problem with the college site is very few people at the college know how it runs
well that's all right i'll i can provide somebody to run it and
but as far as UNK are concerned as you know our cage UNK machine that's now into it's third year of development i have an assurance from the college that we could be we could use it on the day
now talking of UNK they could actually watch a cage being UNK for them as part of it
that's
UNK cage not a brass cage
yeah
very cheap but actually watch it being made and then that becomes the UNK
wonderful
so that would give the publicity to the companies as certainly as the bearing as well this i've just had this made
which one the one that went to the erm exhibition the one that went to the competition
cos we're doing another one aren't they
they're doing another one now the that was a UNK
would i mean could that be operated in conjunction with the trailer
well yeah well
wherever
as part of the trailer
in the trailer
or by the trailer compressed air and electricity don't you
it's no problem UNK has got compressed air and electricity laid on
yeah
the college UNK for that
that's no problem
i'm just thinking now if there are youngsters there they see something working
absolutely
and that's an it's an ideal display see the mechanics working and they take out the cage and off you go
i think i think that would be splendid david if you could if you could erm organize that er on the on the trailer or by the trailer on the trailer stand as it were
mhm
erm and provide the UNK i mean the UNK the UNK
that would be tremendous
cos they actually see it being made
yeah
this was made for me
and it was made by and UNK because that's the project
yeah
made by the you know not made by the full industry but i the off spin of the industry
yeah
and it's already i mean we've kept it in prime condition painted with company colours
it does say on the front of it but
and i would think i'm just thinking of UNK that just giving them something and yet if they've actually watched something being made and then
yeah
made then erm
you've just to got be ca you've just got to be careful that you get it i you've got it UNK working and it's gonna work for two days
you don't want
well now this is why
that's an important thing
that are now on the project make sure that it is tip top condition for the event
yes
er eric and i know fully we've been through that fingers crossed behind our backs
yeah
situations
but we had it at the n e c for a week and it must have produced hundreds of UNK on a routine daily basis
they were there for five days and they were producing them
i'm just thinking now that er we changed lots of things the heads and things of that nature so it was if it's just producing the same cage
yes no set ups or anything
they're just watch it come in drill the cage the cage turns and comes in
the mechanics of it would UNK the young imagination
yeah
yeah
especially if it's demonstrated by the younger people as well
i think that would be that would be terrific
as opposed to giving them possibly a ball bearing
well
well i mean we well
well give them a ball bearing and a cage
that's the treasure isn't it that's the treasure
why i'm yes that might be a bit more complicated because that means we've got to get a thousand a thousand reject up to a thousand reject ball bearings which are all the same
but we can get the balls and then drill the cases to them
no are you i think this treasure is something they're gonna get they're gonna they're gonna g come to the stand they're gonna a ask a ask a question and be given once they've answered the question they're given a ball any sort of ball from sort of
yeah
that big to that big which we
mm
we can pull out of the scrap
no problem there is there
no
no as far as far as the ball and the roller is concerned UNK those are something we could give away from somebody else's stand
yeah
erm and we could actually give if we if we can find some small reject ball bearings or roller bearings then we can or reject i mean erm dead stock
mhm
then and we're always we're always finding dead stock it seems to me er then we could give those away on yet another stand give the cage away on the e on our own so we will actually have provided three four different UNK all of which are associated with bearings
mm
yes
three components and one complete so
yeah
mm
the thing might even begin to connect in the individuals mind er as to what's involved with the bearing
quite true
erm and i mean the actual bearing when you pick up a little UNK bearing and you can spin it on your finger and
yeah
so it makes a lovely little toy
apart from anything else
yeah
if we could get some of them
erm
just round this table product
er i should think we might just have some products on the table and some leaflets
are you looking who are you looking to man it apprentices or young UNK
i think i would try and get young UNK to
yeah
er to do that
mm
erm
we can get the apprentices operating the machine can't we
if we can get that machine though
yes
mhm
erm and we have a er we could we could take erm a few people out of the er out of the sales office
erm and maybe out of marketing as well
lots of young people in marketing aren't there jane
well i don't know i don't know about that
probably two me and karen
oh yes
right
erm
we've got we've got leslie at erm precision
yeah but the thing is
somebody like me if i was stood at that table i mean okay if you've got kids coming in but if you get adults coming in i wouldn't be able to answer questions i don't know enough about the product
erm
no i don't i don't think
you've got to have
i don't think we need worry about that too much
no
er i mean if i if i try and cover it with one of our professional salesmen
mm
erm i think that's going to be UNK
mm
we're not going to get a lot of serious bearing enquiries
no
erm and i think that part of the skill on the on such a stand is erm to show enough interest to take the details down and say the only thing that's important
mm
it'll be a matter of taking the details down and then if it's that important we'll have somebody call monday morning
mm
mm
erm to er
yeah
er to get back at it
or alternatively i mean if it's really that important erm and it's on the friday we could actually send for somebody from here to come out
mm
so i don't think
yeah i don't i don't think you will there
i don't think we will
no
i don't think we will
erm it'll be enquiries which are of very general interest mm erm which i should think you're just as much of an expert as anybody else at answering
mm
come to that
er
most of the questions are going to be related to what it is are there any jobs available or what type of thing
yeah
general sort of
yeah
interest things
how
yeah
how can it help the er the newark UNK
yeah
i'll do friday and gary can do the saturday
right okay
done
done
well you don't ne you'll need some other people erm
yeah
other people to help out
no i was only joking
but er oh
you you're not joking
i i've written i've writ i've UNK it's UNK it's UNK er it recorded as well
so are we on tape here
yeah
er so it's jane on friday er and karen on saturday
no gary i said
oh gary
that's why i said i was only joking
right gary on saturday
right okay
erm
no we'll sort that out
but we need to no we need to sort that out
er i don't see that it's a big problem
and er we ought to make a very definite point of putting our heads together perhaps what do you think about early march or something like that
er m no mid march
sometime mid march in order to just make sure that we're all you know that there isn't some great hang up somewhere
and that then still gives us four or five weeks to put anything right
mhm
er how about somewhere around the twenty third of march
right twenty third of march would that be a
yeah
a good day
mhm
for the moment at least
er and shall we say what's a good time for you
what's the best time for you
p UNK better for me
p m
right
one thirty
one thirty fine
one thirty newark show meeting
david eric jane me and anyone else
if you want to bring anybody else along
yeah
erm who's involved that's fine
how's that grab you
fine
good
yeah
that sounds exciting
well it's a bit different isn't it
yeah
a bit different
i'm sorry to hear about your er apprentice bay
well yes it's er it is rather a sad story really
i think after all these years of having a an apprentice bay running and then er see it more or less wind down
but at least it's w it's wound down without the apprentices winding down
oh yes we're er as you know we gave four and a half thousand to the local college this year or last year
yeah
to in increase apprentices into er the engineering or bringing into young people into engineering
yeah
not necessarily for but from the town
generally
the idea being is that they would now spend the first year at college possibly we then would look at them better and
yeah
pick them off
right
and we intend to do exactly the same this year
so we've actually chamber of commerce to certain people at college and we're hoping
good
it will UNK one or two of the smaller firms to also put money into the kitty to keep our college UNK er orientated towards engineering
excellent
because er we can do the arts and UNK there's no problem but engineering there's in a sorry state
yeah
that the engineering is now safe
yes
whereas up until a few months they were thinking of closing the engineering department
were they really
college
yeah
so we've er we've come to the front and we've led from the front
we can honestly say
well this is what is faced with doing
it's what we're doing on a pricing on a pricing thing as well
we've we're taking the lead
telling everybody else what the what the rules are and you know what the pace is
erm and er of course did make a very clear statement that it would be the leader
mhm
well erm we certainly are in we certainly are in newark
and i think the ongoing concern then is we seem to have got on an even UNK with apprentices
erm literally training throughout the year
staff of twenty one
yeah
all of them have come out of the time over the nineteen ninety three have all been employed by the company
ah that's terrific
erm so yes i think we're we can we can say we've been leading from the front
yeah good
and if we've now embarrassed one or two smaller firms into actually putting money into our college
wonderful
so er
wonderful
likewise we have some projects to show that we have worked very closely as an engineering firm with the local college
yeah
and the local people
as tomorrow we give cancer fund three and a half thousand pounds cheque tomorrow
do you really
from the gala day receipts
oh that's wonderful
so we yes we are it's erm beginning to very good
yes very good in that respect
look quite significant
yeah
yeah
no longer are we referred to as although we still we're referred as
but it's getting it's getting the image it's getting
yeah
the image has certainly improved
well certainly i mean this whole initiative is something that i s just seemed to me when philip got in touch in the first place that something that we ought to er be involved with
i think e the idea there of the cage UNK machine and the caravan is to show that our connections with college what we can produce with youngsters of today
yeah
a and because schools outside the area will see what we've done
yeah
it may give them the light as well as what
right that's terrific
and we have been involved i have certainly been into schools a fair bit but they're erm they are a bit UNK they're certainly slow to come forward to ask for your for you help and
right
wh while you're erm doing that while you're th while we're thinking about that erm there's something else on the schools front and the UNK front which i am in the process of setting up
which er i will be officially erm circulating to the factories er later and that is a national erm
yes yeah
of setting a real live project for a design and technology a level student
mm
now because of other connections i've done it through UNK
er not doing the one this year because of the changes that
mm
are going on and i just didn't feel that we could erm support one
but with the arrival of UNK er the erm we have a wonderful opportunity there for doing something pretty UNK
and so i've tried to open it up er rather wider and w what i've been put in touch with a thing called the independent schools design and technology association which covers design and technology studies in all independent schools
erm and in due course they are hoping that body is hoping to extend not just to independent schools but to all schools and be a design and technology education association for all schools
erm however they're not there yet
now it concerns me that er i don't want to be associated with the possible charge of UNK if we're only associated with independent schools
therefore what i want to do is to seek the support of the factories to er spread the word to circulate the information necessary to all the schools in the area
so that any school within nottinghamshire if you like or nottinghamshire and lincolnshire or whatever might be appropriate in this area
however many you thought you could manage it might just be the two
mm
secondary schools in newark come that
erm but that opportunity would be there to circulate the information and the entry rules er around the erm er state schools within the sort of factory catchment area
so it's an opportunity for the factories to promote their own activities within whatever they regard as the school catchment area
the way it's going to work is that we will er that the first thing is to invite applications
and the individual student will submit an application with some er example of work already done
and i don't know i asked th the chap from the i s d t a how many people he thought we might get applying he said he thought well if we got fifty we'd be doing very well
er so say we get fifty people applying we will then use those application forms to decide how ma er sorry which ones we're going to go with
and i've said that the maximum that i think we could reasonably cope with would be five
and then we would give a complete project specification to the five participants and er we would invite them to visit a factory to have a conversation with a sales person to get a bit of a feeling for the style of thee of the be doing area
however many you
mm
out of those and one will win and we'll have a second and third prize and the fourth and fifth will be runners up and erm highly UNK or what have you
er and basically what i want to do is to put the winner the winning e exhibition into the new reception area for the new erm office at UNK when it opens
mm
so that er we can sort of give a great big bit of publicity for the schools for the individual for the concept of design and technology at a level
that sort of thing
the other four er erm UNK er like as not will be on display and remain on display in the er in the UNK area which is
mm
going to be a display area for product and projects
so erm we can give them a bit of a
mm
bit of a UNK as well
so what i'm that that's the sort of basic outline and i see it as an opportunity of putting the name in front of quite a lot of schools
aha
erm and in the design and technology area
er it is then an opportunity of getting at five individuals and giving them a pretty thorough going over and a lot of encouragement
it gives them the opportunity of working on a real live project er which actually has an end point and is going to be used
it also gives them the incentive of winning some cash
er it gives us when we actually set the thing up and make the presentation it gives us another opportunity for publicity not only in the local papers o of our own area but the local papers of wherever the school was
and it could be anywhere round the country
erm and i would i would want to try and do some er organize some press coverage at that time for the losers as well as for the winner so that a and one of the things when we select the participants er the UNK er we will not have them all coming from the same school or from the same area even if the five best UNK all do come from the same school
mm
we won't have that we'll have them from
yeah
where suits us
yeah
er so we've got lots of opportunity for er getting the name in front of young people promoting design and technology and the engineering concept getting these kids working on something that's real and live erm and generally promoting the whole thing
mm
so er in the course of the next week or two i will erm be writing officially to er to each of the factories to invite participation
right
er and i UNK you'll get involved in that when the time comes
mhm yes
for road and
yeah
and road
yeah
so er there we are
oh yes
yeah
of course there's i don't know whether you'd well you won't if you haven't been involved but we for the last year and this year we've had this children from er there's a sort of nottingham university
yeah
is where it's set up from
er and the young people who've left school er who are having a year out in industry before they go to university
er and i've found it very useful in t term
i've just seen this
would you like a cup of coffee
yes
at the minute the erm last year's
last year's individual with us he had i think he had he had five a levels of which four were grade a and one was UNK b grade b
that's not bad
and er he's gone off to UNK university to do doing maths and stuff
and a chap lad this year's got not quite the same but very good a level results
please
you must think i'm absolutely UNK just to have been sat with this in front of me and not done anything about it
thank you
no philip must have been er wondering what on earth it was doing there
er so erm
well it's on the UNK vein just like the machine tool association competition was that the apprentices went in for
yeah
erm that was on the same vein and they got they got a ce er a certain amount of national er erm national er publicity
yeah
milk
no thank you
jane's have some i think by the look of things
thank you very much
erm well i don't think one can do too much on that score really can one
er any publicity is good publicity
yeah
yeah
are you doing the open day again
or has nothing been said about that yet
or is it just assumed you would do an open day
no i don't think we're doing an open day this year
we're still having another gala day
another gala
and er i think throughout the year er all of the younger apprentices either sixteen eighteen year olds have now been UNK in duke of edinburgh award
have they
scheme yeah
and they're all about to do their silver
one of the somewhat older guy he can UNK it so much so that he gets his gold out of it
out in he he's going straight to gold is he
no he's done bronze and silver
oh he's done them yeah
and he if the rest of them get silver he will get a gold
it's rather good actually
it's a form of team leadership
yes
and er we so we'll pull that in over the year over this next year and that's one of the projects that
good for him
i think younger guys the sixteen eighteen year old with their silver award
yeah
er and of course the gold award erm older guys next year's team then can go on for their gold
not that we're making any UNK as part of their apprenticeship but er i think it's a good idea they have extra
yeah
erm just beyond the engineering side
what it really means of course is that erm i've committed ourselves to doing the dare i say it the odd jobs
it sounds v the odd jobs to do with all the smaller schools and
yeah
er UNK
as you know we fixed the roundabout for the people in town i can't remember the name of the place
i used to call it the back of actually
but nevertheless we
yeah
the guys went up there and they fixed it and they were very we had christmas cards from them and we've
lovely
and so i what i said was as part of their community service we would then UNK the various small erm children's homes old people's homes and they would go as a team of UNK fitters craftsmen and do a community work
marvellous
to towards their silver award
towards the
so we will be flying the flag there
because of course they will be wearing our
very constructive
and that has a nice ring to it
that younger element are doing something for the local community
and we're trying
that's very good
we're obviously there's old people's homes here on drive there are lots of small erm UNK that will require their appliances being serviced
yeah
and things of this nature
one project was to literally find out all of the old age pensioners in town and go along as a group of UNK and check all of their appliances for them
quite
mm
so they'll have so many houses to work in they will go along initially and make sure the plugs on er UNK and it sounds very simple but it's part of helping the community
yeah
yeah
for their award
erm we'll be flying the flag on those i tell you yeah
well that's very nice
that's very nice
good initiative
of course they have to do all that out themselves
they've got to negotiate with the er people that run these homes and erm and that kind of thing
and set it up
and set it up
yeah
oh it's all part of their er their project
but likewise we were looking for another project similar to what er eric and i were involved in with the cage UNK machine
i think superb projects
we're only hoping at the end of this year hopefully the company will incest in it
and buy some
they have they not cos i thought they were going to buy some of these UNK machines
oh yes but what they're doing now is all the erm they did the presentation to the manufacturing side
yeah
er with your assistance
yeah
er they did they did the sales pitch to and then management came back and said well we need automatic loading and UNK to it
yeah
so they've been working on UNK and this year oh we will we'll put the UNK right and then come back with another sales pitch to
right oh i see
yeah
yeah
they're doing another one but i think erm was talking to er andy the other day because erm i've been in manufacturing management meetings at
yes
where they're talking about spending money on a one of these old cage UNK it up to drill UNK at
and my ears went you know what on earth are you spending all this money for on that
yeah
when you've got this new technology which you can develop
mhm
er and it looks as though it certainly in UNK budget for this year
mhm
and a bit later on he's looking to put erm i don't know twenty thirty thousand into building a brand new cage UNK machine based on that technology
but using the UNK and who the main ones robert and bill
mhm
with brian main input really
mhm
that sounds excellent doesn't it
yeah
yeah
so they're looking because we at precision now need it but we need it faster than if we if we UNK for this then put in and so on
yeah
erm you know five years hence we don't want it in five years hence we want it the end of this year early next year
this year
yeah
yeah
mm
but so far you see the er have been involved in it who have been craftsmen UNK have all come out of the end of a b tec qualification with a distinction
on the project
on the project
yeah
so
yeah
er
yeah
it's
it i think there's a lot to be said for er people doing almost any sort of practical course like that to give them something which is real
because certainly the thing that particularly struck me about these design and technology a levels which so often seem to be sort of er erm a UNK project not a real one
and the three individuals who i worked with particularly they'd all been more or less written off and they all come through with UNK
yeah
and the UNK i mean i've had feedback particularly from the parents of all three and in every case er they have said this was the making of this guy
mm
you know i it's pick picked him up from being very much an also ran for whom there was virtually no hope er to leaving the school with a really good qualification and a sense of pride and purpose
mhm
erm er which has really made a big difference
it's a good thing really my son did erm a level craft design and technology
yeah
er and erm he designed his own thing what
yeah
what he wanted to do and then he got a reasonable pass and went off to university
but i think if er if he'd have had a UNK input that wanted something designing he'd have done a lot better
yeah
because the thing he produced eventually it fell over at the end of the day
yeah
you know i mean but he'd put the research and the effort into it to get the pass
to get to get the
yeah
qualification
yeah
but if he'd have had some a little bit of direction
mm
from a firm you know i'm sure he would have he would have got a distinction er an a rather than a b you know
well than the other the other thing which i think particularly in the last one that we did which was finished back in march we kept on changing the specification because it started off such a such and specification and it was going to the UNK fair in germany
mm
in april
or may
april
april
and then we decided not to go to the UNK fair so change the specification so that it could be a versatile sort of display for whatever we wanted to display
er and then i heard from australia that they were going into the engineering exhibition in UNK and i offered them er a mobile display and they came back with one or two added ideas and so i changed the specification again
that was going to be in may so we needed it to ship in april so i said well you've got to you've got to still finish it at the same time
and then australia came back and said no that won't be soon enough you've got to ship it i can't remember when it was beginning of march
and so er the guy had to bring the whole project forward a month
mm
erm and er he worked like the UNK to get this thing done
er and it was quite complex
mm
and it worked and it got over to australia it got UNK and it still worked when it got to australia and it went on the stand and it stood on the stand for a week or however long it was
er and they've now got it UNK away in australia waiting for the next exhibition
mm
mhm
so it was it really worked well
very well
and i'd like to do something like that again
and i mean some of the some of the results that we get from this competition might well be appropriate for a stand at an exhibition somewhere
or it could be that they would be appropriate for the reception area in one of the factories or we might give one to a UNK and say here you are this you know put this in if you've got the right sort of area and would like to use it for a bit stick it in there
you know so there's all sorts of
what happened to that the first
it's in UNK down in the
was it ever repaired
oh aye they repaired it
yeah
they were UNK the i think it was the geography of the world
i mean like australia
oh a mere detail
in the middle of the UNK
put australia in the northern UNK and that sort of thing
but er
yeah
yes it er i think the wiring needs to be changed because i
yeah
it had a wooden a wooden bearing would you believe
did they
yeah
they modified that
yeah
i think that was okay
it required slip rings
yeah
which was a very good thing most of the young apprentices would never know about slip rings
yeah
they had to manufacture that part itself
yeah
and er as i say at the moment
well when you when you say it's in UNK erm how seriously in UNK
i mean if could you take the UNK off and dust it off and it would work
plug it in and it would work
more or less yes just a few adjustments and it could be up and running i would think
maybe a couple of hours work on it to put it back together
cos i mean that again is something that one might put into the into the tent or something
see the idea was it picked up the balls took them to the and then the ball rolled round inside UNK slowly down to the bottom and then picked it up
yeah
originally it was supposed to be water wasn't it in the bottom
er there was going to be water in the bottom at one stage but that
yeah
got a bit too complicated
yeah
he was o he was over ambitious
mhm
in the design
the idea of the three UNK of course
yeah
was see that the ball
yeah
yeah
rushing round inside of the literally going round the UNK and then down and then
yes
erm i know at one time they were the UNK were going to fast the ball was
but the idea of course was to bring the electrical mechanical and the UNK to UNK the little bits that were
yeah
yeah
erm the inside they had to UNK that because the wood er had almost become UNK were the
yeah
had been so that
had they really
yeah
erm and again to make it safe it all ran on a twelve UNK system
that's right it was on a twelve UNK erm UNK motor
mhm
and er and that that's they had to take the top off to make it safe that's why i say a couple of hours work to put the top back on erm makes balance
what it really required was probably UNK or steel in the base to keep the base
mm
yes
stable because it was rather top heavy
a bit top heavy
yeah
with the UNK at the top
well er
i mean a brilliant idea really
i mean if er erm er if it would work
mhm
i mean i one of the things that i've always sort of had in mind is that we put it down in the reception area
mm
the only things is that now if we did that what we want instead of saying on it ought to say
well possibly i ought to put it on my review panel and er if there's a requirement for it
if you could dig it out if you could dig it out
mhm
we'd put it down in the reception area
mhm
yeah
for a bit
and then if it if we have it down in reception for a bit er and it works and doesn't look like falling to bits the we could consider taking it along to the newark show as well
mhm
as i say it's that mechanical movement that catches the eye UNK slowly turning round and the
yeah
yeah
i think the stress and strain on the bearings for instance the middle bearing of it was UNK to carry that amount of weight not in the vertical sense but in the UNK to and fro
er
old spin and UNK
yes it might have been
yeah
it might have been
they need the extra weight at the bottom
the shaft needed to come through two bearings to give it that stability
yeah
yeah
yeah
but erm the idea is have this up and running and look at the problems
right
so th this caravan aside
yeah
can presume that it it's going to involve as a whole so it will have some
yeah
industrial type applications and precision applications in there
well i guess the graphics need to be looked at in that
mhm
jane
whereabouts is it
in the grounds of the college
if you go by the side of the college you'll see it from the
where you pull into the car park
under the trees
on that side
yeah it's a sort of er trailer thing you can see from the pavement
mm
they had it on the gala day
used it on gala day
i didn't go to the gala day
we UNK it to er and back
that was a UNK of
i think the nearest thing to it is probably UNK a caravan er a UNK
really
yes
mm
quite a quite a lot of wind resistance
UNK
yeah
it wasn't the best
but ideal it's very UNK inside
yeah
erm in that respect
and erm i mean we UNK it over a thousand miles so the
yeah
the local journeys round the town there's no problem
mm
the average car could pull it
mm
erm it's very well made we have a video watching it being made from the bare
well
all the way up to it's
that that's certainly something do we have a video on a on a UNK or anything
erm cos that would be the ideal thing to do wouldn't it
we haven't yet got copies they're just masters at the moment but
ah but we'll have copies by may surely
if the european sales companies get their fingers out and get the languages checked for me then yes
i'm quite happy to have it in english
erm yeah that's another thing
yeah it c it can be put onto a UNK
video
so the as far as i'm concerned the two projects put together erm really do show what we can do we can do with a team of UNK
originally the er the idea was to build this caravan in connection with school
yeah
and er we were told that we were told that our apprentices would be working alongside apprentices from UNK and UNK and so on and so forth
that wasn't quite true
so consequently we made sure that we picked the best of our guys to match
yeah
yeah
the german er secondly there was a golden opportunity for our apprentices in industry to go and see german industry and french industry
yeah
and so on and i'm pleased to say that they came back saying yeah we can still hold our head up high
the fact that we are very good at what we do
yeah
of course we didn't realize that these would be erm students from schools
yeah
so their engineering knowledge was very little
still basic
very basic
yeah
so consequently our guys ran circles round them
marvellous
and we balance it out that we had to built the caravan the deadline we had to tow it across there in back end of march
erm so it had to have all the lighting official lighting for the continent and so on and so forth
yeah
and that was a bit of a nice little deadline the pressure was on
yeah
but er we got it over there and i'm quite pleased to see it the entire school six hundred pupils turn out to see this thing being UNK up there on a
wonderful
sunny evening
wonderful
and er had a tremendous press coverage over there
yeah
likewise the when it went through the town on the way out everybody turned out to see this thing leaving
because of the association between and york being twins
yeah
and people were in the street shaking hands and marvellous absolutely marvellous you know
brilliant
of course the logo was the biggest logo on there you see
er and even lads from the college it was a mixture of five UNK students and five students
yeah
er i think our guys UNK the show
good
right well we're on to a we're on to a new er a new era a different erm different angle
er and erm there we are
bef between now and march
or are you gonna
well erm no doubt jane will actually look inside the caravan
mhm
yeah
sometime and see what the facilities we've got there
erm i can certainly no problem
i've already earmarked the cage UNK machine just in case we did require it to make sure that no parts were taken off it to support the next one
right good yeah
erm this is where we've asked our tool room to supply them with any parts save taking them off the original
to make sure it does roll
and now if with your wish we can certainly go ahead and make sure it is in tip top condition
yeah
make sure was have enough material to make the these UNK
yeah
erm so i i'll concentrate on those
terrific
those two things
yeah
and again the UNK to run it
yeah
i e if it works out in er that the younger guys to match up with the make sure they've got the experience to actually fault find on the machine if
right
but i'm pretty certain it'll run all weekend
it ran all week at the n e c
yeah
wonderful
gave erm robert and bill and
oh yes
oh yes
oh yes
the idea is if one of those and a couple of the younger guys like we did at n e c
yeah
ideal
mm
yeah
get the expert as well as a couple of supportive
lovely
yeah
to talk about it
that's how we covered it at the n e c
right
okay well i'll do a i'll do a note on the various headings that i've made so we've all got the same piece of paper
mhm
erm and then we meet again in march
er i'll let you know if there's anything UNK up again before then
er but hopefully by march we will be able to say well it's all ready to
yeah
hot to UNK
okay
ready to go
right
wonderful thank you very much indeed
i'll really turn it of this time
nine
erm mm
yeah have you have you reviewed your revision to see sort of how you're doing and how effective it is and why it's getting you down and
no
no how
mm
how is it going just UNK along with
yeah
you know got more of this more of this to do
yeah
er is there any of it that you really enjoy or sort of enjoy a little bit or think oh this isn't too bad or
mm
or don't scream at the thought of
i don't know it's something no i'll just UNK through and
what have you been looking at in the maths
mm
i've just been going through it really the UNK
and have you looked at some of these bits at the front to tell you how to make it more effective and
couldn't see it
right okay
i mean this is where it starts with the number system erm do you know what any of these terms are
do you think it's important or interesting to know
erm
people keep talking about UNK and UNK and okay erm
negatives
powers
are you happy with negatives
yeah
and powers
roots
roots
it's only free UNK
UNK
rational and UNK it's just a sort of the UNK had a funny term for it if you can express it as a fraction think seventy five over two hundred and ninety seven then it's a rational number
if you can't if you can't find a fraction that fits then we just say it's UNK so can you think of a any examples
get numbers that you can't express exactly
you can't express exactly
mhm
like nought
mhm no you expressed that very precisely
erm
what's pi as a fraction
three point o as a fraction one over three point four
some people some books say oh take it to twenty two over seven or things like that but it's not and the UNK what you get off your calculator is only correct to however many UNK you've got on your calculator
mhm
you can never people have found pi to millions of places and it's still they still don't find a pattern where it UNK so those are the UNK anyway
you know what a prime number is and we had a quick look at we had a look at the UNK that even odd didn't we
erm why are prime fa do you know what prime factors are and why there useful
why are they useful
er i can't remember now
okay erm if you break a number down into its prime factors then you can look at the prime factors and see whether other numbers would go into it so if we take sort of say three sixty and find some of its prime factors
you won't find any UNK in there won't be able to does fourteen go into three sixty you can have a look at it's a prime factors and say well no there isn't a seven there erm does thirty six go into three sixty one we're looking for something that threes and twos appropriate number three times three or two times two times three times three would be thirty six so you have at look how many twos are there in three sixty
oh yeah we can get two out and we can get two lots of three out as well so it would go in and it's pretty obvious it would go in cos it it's by ten
mm
but erm some of the others are not so obvious would divide in
erm now circular measure did you actually measure a few round things and find pi
oh i did yeah with you i did yeah
mm
yeah
and you remember actually measuring it and you know what
yeah
pi means hopefully it means something to you now
yeah it measures the diameter divided by the UNK
which is
UNK divided by
right which is bigger UNK or diameter
UNK
right and what is pi roughly to the nearest whole number
er about three
about three
yes
so it's got to be the long one all the way round divided by how far across it is
er things like that help if you're not sure you're thinking oh no especially in an exam
mm
well was it the diameter divided by the UNK or was it the other way round and you right them on paper and c over d over c doesn't look any different and you get locked into the problem and you just back off a bit and think of something real like when you measured it
all the way round that's about three times across and it's got to be that way round the all the way round over how far across
relationships similar figures now we looked at that and we looked at scale erm and i think last time we were looking at things like though not too long ago we were looking at price of council paper and this sort of stuff which one shall we buy
shall we buy that or buy that one
yeah
erm are you happy with that
erm
shall we have a look at it again
we probably want to about work again
right we'll have a look at that again because once you've got it it's pretty straightforward and you can do it fairly quickly and you can do it very UNK
mhm
and if you haven't got it you could be there all day on the exam urgh and also you're thinking i'll put it this way up that one over that
mm
okay so we'll have a look at that and obtaining money well
it's easy you just say i'm the government give me your money
mm
have a poll tax and let's have fifty per cent v a t why make it a hundred per cent and then it's easy for people to calculate
ha yeah
if you go and buy a t v for a hundred and fifty pounds they'd say thank you a hundred and fifty pounds plus vat at a hundred per cent is another hundred and fifty to go to the government
mm
so yeah
now what about doing percentages
like vat an are you okay on that
yeah i'm okay
good because that comes up all the time
geometry
lines angles and UNK you were good at that you were using your UNK and doing things okay and geometry of the circle i as i say tend to leave that with all the
i think i'm alright on actually
that UNK there's thirteen or so circle UNK comes up quite a bit
mm
and UNK and UNK they tend to turn up right and what about sets
that's
yeah
statistics and probability
i think i'm alright because we have covered that all haven't we
with special UNK we've covered that
yeah
well
so you can what i'm thinking of now is not so much i've been thinking of stuff that you have done and that if you sort of spend a little bit of not much time maybe ten minutes on each topic just having a little look at it and finding a problem this is the sort of problem i was doing a month or two ago can i do this one
can i remember how to get started in the main thing
usually
yeah
if you get started you can you palm the pattern comes back and you follow it through and you get the answer erm need to do it every maybe sort of about once a month or so for each topic don't let a topic go for about a month without you looking at it for ten minutes or so and it will be surprising how that little bit of effort keeps it in your mind so when you come to the exam you don't sit down there and go oh it's two months ago i was doing everyone right wonderful
mm
now i just can't think can't remember
mm
so it's to keep it in your mind erm
we you
yeah
did quite a few graphs last time and you're good on algebra UNK things you're good on trig UNK and UNK how do you feel about those
er what's UNK
UNK oh dear
erm you're doing paper three and you do paper three you do UNK might even do UNK it's not that clear about somewhere before of course you know that
erm so scale proportion those are the few things brought in together we'll st we'll start off with just weight now we'll find sort of weights of things and then we'll make it more and more difficult
mm
of less easy
mhm
less easy as it goes along so we've got start by saying loaf of what do you want to buy at the moment
er
sold by weight
bar of chocolate
bar of chocolate
okay
bar of chocolate and what sort of size do they come in sort of hundred gram
yeah
things
well right erm so a three bars of chocolate there's one in the hundred grams will cost you twenty eight pence
so one
a hundred grams for one bar costs you twenty eight pence right and then another one that's two hundred grams and it'll cost you fifty pence
you know what this is going to be
yeah
this is going to be easy he thinks so you've made your mind up before you go to the shop but unfortunately when you get there there's a they've got these special hundred gram bars in because they haven't got a hundred there's a big UNK on them saying ten per cent more chocolate extra bit free extra ten per cent free on the smaller bars so which ones do you buy
how much does that one extra ten per cent
this yeah the one hundred gram ones have an extra ten per cent added on now
okay
think as an exercise work out
how each of the prices of each one and you work out which way round you're going to do it and then talk to me about it as you're doing it
mm
first of all put get that into grams that's a hundred and ten grams
right
so the first bar one ten grams cost twenty eight p
right
and the second one the second UNK fifty p
so i wanna get that
so just write the second one out again the second one you get
it's two hundred grams
it's fifty p
so two hundred grams fifty p about erm a hundred and ten for twenty eight which ones easier to work with
the for fifty
mm
so now you find out how much for one gram
right
so good rule is work out the easy one first now they're going to be about the same erm otherwise they wouldn't be asking
mm
you it'd be obvious
erm so if you if you do the easy one and let's say it comes out to ten pence per gram and you do the difficult one and it comes to a hundred and three pence per gram right or point nought one pence per gram
mm
what's what would that indicate to you
er e no point in whatever is a lot cheaper
would it
the first one nought
i mean look okay look at these two bars of chocolate that you've got there re looking at it they're going to be a about the same price you're not going to find one ten times as dear as the other are you
mm
so if one came out at ten pence per
think your first one's probably got wrong
oh right
one of them's wrong
right you think UNK this doesn't sort of seem right to me and this is sort of developing your common sense approach to maths which always goes on top of the actual maths you've done the maths yeah you have a little look and it won't does that make sense
no whoops i might have put one on top of the other when it should have been the other way round so always have this check er does the answer look i mean no you can't always tell but sometimes you can sometimes you can think well those two are about the same price per gram aren't they
mm
okay
so work out those
mm
and say explain the logic of it why you're doing it the way you're doing it
well if you want to find out how much per gram will each bar so how much the twenty eight p how much yeah how many grams no we know how many grams were there
how many pennies per gram
how many pennies per gram
good
this is this is the part where a lot of people get stuck
you can work it out how many pennies per gram or you can work it out how many grams per penny and it doesn't matter which way round you do it as long as you know what the answer means but which way do you prefer
mm
er how many pennies per gr
how many pennies per gram i would prefer that too so just sort of choose one way and stick to it i always do it that way and then you're not confusing yourself doing it different ways
so how many pence would you pay for a gram on that first bar
a hundred and ten divided by twenty eight
alright let's look at that let me just have a little look down here
okay
a hundred and ten divided by twenty eight you've got this is pence per gram a hundred and ten grams divided by twenty eight pence the answer to this is grams per penny
mm
it was a hundred and ten wasn't it
hopefully
yeah
we've got a hundred grams divided by twenty eight pennies the answer is whatever it comes to grams per divided by pennies grams per penny so that's a good check that you've got it the right way up before you go and calculate it you just have a little look what have i got here
i've got grams per penny
you got and you can write it like that when you write it down a hundred and ten grams divided by twenty eight p equals whatever the number is grams per penny
so that's a easy way to make sure that you because that was the first thing you went for now in the exam you might well put that down and think oh hang on doesn't look right perhaps it's the other way up
mm
and then start losing confidence wasting time if you've got some check like that right okay so if you like to work that one out you shouldn't have any problem with the second bar if you can do the first one
three point nine
three point nine two
three point nine grams per penny
that's a leave the three point nine two because they might be they may be close they may not
okay
the other one's a hundred divided by fifty
mhm
four
right so there's not much this looks as if these answers could both be correct because
mm
they're about the same so when the hundred gram bar has got the extra ten per cent it's just makes it the better bargain er they're not losing much on that cos they save on the UNK so it probably costs them the same
mm
they do it that way
now what happens if it gets a bit more complicated and all it another way another way of checking this erm what would happen
to buy
what would happen if you let's have a look at g depends on what would happen if you were still paying fifty pence but they gave you four hundred four hundred grams of chocolate well you get eight grams per penny this is another test that you got it the right way up if it were still only two hundred grams but you payed more money for it let's say they charged you a pound i think you'd get less grams per penny
so good ways of checking that you got it right and then you can go on UNK with let's have a look at erm this time you're buying a block of gold er
as you do yeah
which reminds me yeah the last block i got i'll have to take it back it was the wrong colour we've got some silver got some got
yeah i hate it when that happens yeah
some silver gold
ah it's terrible innit
did you have your receipt
no
oh
that's awful that is
i went to the i went to the gold shop when they were shut actually w to get it in the first place
mm
that's why they wouldn't give me my me give me the money back
ah of course yeah
so here's one lump of gold okay and that's erm how big shall we make it
that big
a metre
going to need a truck to carry this home
yeah you never have any negatives you
mm
negative metre
negative metres okay
so it's a cube one
okay
metre in all directions
mm
and they're selling them off gold prices have dropped you can get a metre a cubic metre of gold for say a million pounds
yeah
twenty p and i'll pay it off
for a million pounds one million
now there's somebody else next door selling off se there is a surplus
can go next door to us
is a surplus of goods about a ton in good wool there's a surplus of gold at the moment of course
ah of course
all selling them off like their UNK paying you to take it away
yeah
a million pounds i'd call that paying him
now this bloke this bloke unfortunately measures it in centimetres he would wouldn't he it could have been worse he could
yeah oh yeah
have measured it in inches or something
mm
erm and erm he sells smaller bits but they are cheaper obviously and his are eighty centimetre cube of gold okay
and he says sells his off at a quarter of a million per cube
mm
which one's cheaper which one would you go for
how do you work it out
i'd go for i'd go for him cos i don't like this centimetre part
okay
so for one metre cubed
you'd this start a new page and do all your of a page
one metre cubed costs one million pounds there it is eighty centimetres i'm starting one to get change numbers such like that to metres or at centimetres
good so that's the first thing you've got to do get these into the same sort of units this is a sort of variation where we had grams and UNK and things
erm thinking ahead i'd probably turn that to metres
okay
three point eight
right
it's one metre cubed it's one point eight erm er but don't know actually i'd rather have it in centimetres
hmm so would i
yeah
any day
two re why would you rather have it in centimetres
erm then i can well because dividing point eight by that'll make it a strange figure
right
so if you can avoid the decimals and avoid the fractions and
well i'm not down are they
now tell me tell me about
right you know they're at export price list
yes
yeah er steven er steve their er UNK
these were the people i wrote to the other day
that's right roy and jerry
steve works in the engineering office and has taken over some of the er you know purchasing function as well like enquiries and stuff
yeah
he's just been on to UNK got a couple of orders bearings and an anglia contact
i explained to him about what we've done up to date and the fact that we've yet to sort the account out properly
yeah
er and what he's saying is well can i have a price for these items
so i said well i explained now look you were on an export price list now one of the things jerry didn't like
but we've got to look at is more comparable with u k
yeah
erm so what i've done is said are these for use in u k or export and these are for use in the u k right so i've said well we'll probably give you a price relating to that then
ball bearings and what was the other one
and an anglia contact bearing as well
yeah
right er
now you know to be to be honest i was talking about it i couldn't tell you what the average percent is from last year
yeah
er in fa i don't know
could i could from those statistics couldn't i tho or haven't we sold anything to this year
erm i'm not sure whether we have or not
won't it be on this lot
er i'm not sure actually whether they would appear on them or not i haven't seen the new statistics so i don't know
wh who no these are old statistics these are your
mine
no they won't be on because they're export
no they're not on UNK
oh because they count as export
that's right
although they're at home
ye they've only just been put onto a home account
you think you've got problems
yeah
right
so now i can't tell you but i
right
know i know it'll be say UNK percent
yeah as
right
opposed to the forty in the u k so we've got to get it up a bit
erm but i've just thought you know get this away let him get you know buy them go in at say forty percent as an o e margin
what would i mean if it wasn't if it was if it was erm think of another u k customer
a similar sized u k customer
yes
well
we'd be looking at making forty percent margin
between thirty five forty percent margin
well you better price them accordingly
right okay
it's just that and then we have got to get this sorted out long
yeah
term obviously
yeah
so
well i apart from anything else it's stating our position
sure
isn't it
yeah
now where erm yeah i mean does that
you see
does that compare them with the customers
u k customers
i haven't even looked at yet
oh on those no we charge them a lot more
the ones we c we manage to sell at about fifty five percent margin
right
because although that's
three o'clock
it's not three o'clock is it
oh it is
it's three o'clock
it's two minutes to
right okay
so now we're being recorded
all very exciting i hope they can hear us
so if we can have some good examples of the english language please
okay
up to now we've been covering one part of the neural networks
erm in fact we only UNK covered one part of one network in fact
er that a form of continuous network er because it has continuous weights
UNK lot of variations in different sorts of neural networks
we've had different sorts of weights difference sorts of inputs and learning rules as you'll see
what i want to cover now is a type of network that we study a lot in the computer architecture group and i've been working with for years and years and years erm called the n tuple network
n tuple method
it in neural network terms is a binary UNK
it means that the weights are typically binary in the network
so you can also use lots of different learning rules UNK compared to the er networks you see
quite different
however even though it is a neural network however erm you can see it is a pack recognition technique and in fact it was first developed in nineteen fifty nine as the n tuple method er by some chap UNK erm i think cos i've never heard of UNK since that paper
so what i want to do is to introduce the basic idea of what the learning does and how the network sort of works UNK underneath it
and then show how you represent it as a neural network and the various UNK of it
straight off why it's more important or why it's important to tell you about it is because it's a very fast network
all the other networks we see i think the networks we've seen not many of them are slow in learning
and they're slow in learning because they UNK er using this learning rule
exactly where the surface has to be
the n tuple method takes a totally different approach as you will see
so how's it work
well it's extremely simple and if you're any good at UNK electronics it should be an absolute UNK for you
cos in fact it's erm can be seen er as creating functions in UNK circuits
in very simple terms
one of the reasons for its speed comes from that
so we've got some examples here of some patterns that we want to learn using the n tuple method and tuple and tuple
erm example there of t you'll recognize the t now the first thing i should remind you is of course that to recognize anything we must have something to compare it against
okay to say how similar it is to one thing to another
i've talked to you about that before
but anyway we're just picking one particular example here and we've got a t and it's a very small er example of a pattern
it's got three UNK and the first thing you notice is the UNK are binary
they're not continuous
and in the n tuple method as it's first defined the er UNK were only binary
it's called the n tuple method is because the first thing we do is to take that image and break it up into a set of UNK each of n in size
okay
and what we've got n here we've selected as three and so we've broken it up into three UNK because another rule in the method even though it can be broken is that each UNK can only go into one tuple
so we've got the first one here f one second one here f two and the third one f three
okay
once you've done that what we actually do is to look for sub patterns in those UNK
of course we've got the training and testing the same as in normal networks
the training is of recording which sub patterns occur or which patterns occur within the tuple
testing consists of identifying which of the known ones which of the known er sub patterns er occur in my new input
let's just see an example of that
f one here is this sub pattern here for this training example
we've got not x one not x two not x three and i think on your examples you've actually got them labelled
erm which means that each one of those is off
the logical er function there UNK simple
f two the second tuple x four is on x five is off x six is on and the same sort of thing for f three there
so what we've done is we've applied a simple learning rule which just says remember the sub patterns
terribly trivial
and you wonder how it would ever be any good at anything
so that's what i hope to show you
once you've trained it like that to test it on this pattern all you do is take the pack into the system and see whether you can
these UNK again
so here we'd actually have a match of all three saying that we've recognized it to a level three
okay erm on that particular pattern
now as it stands that's all it knows
and if this was covered up here i e this black dot was say made white let's say we'd only have two matching and if that was made white we'd have one and then if we changed at all that top row we'd have zero matching
so what we can what it effectively does is count sort of sub patterns within the whole pattern and how well we're recognizing those
it's rather like what we talked about right at the beginning we talked about picking out features from our image such as the width the height er the grey area or whatever of the image
now in that case we had to select those measures er by knowledge of the problem
a tuple is a very similar sort of thing
it it's a it's a measurement area here for example but all it does is record the binary pattern er under that area
we've actually taken three measurement areas
one here one in the middle one at the bottom
the important thing is that they're very arbitrary
you don't have to know anything about the problem to specify them
where we're taking measures from the image er such as height width etcetera we'd have to know a lot about the image to take those measures
the important thing about the n tuple method is that you don't make any assumptions about the image apart from it's just a set of binary UNK
okay
which is one of the strengths of course for that sort of thing
so what we're doing effectively is seeing how many features we recognize in our in our er example image
UNK which we'll come to a lot later as well in a lot more depth er is very important in these systems
i may want to recognize this pattern as well as that pattern
but i may want to recognize that just as well as that
i e at the moment this pattern fed into these functions here gives us three matching functions
if we add an extra term to the bottom of here representing this extra changed pattern okay this pattern will match just as well as that er our functions
i e this one gives us a value of three
so really that's it as far as the n tuple method is
you're just measuring sub patterns of the image counting how many of those match in training in testing and that count is a measure of similarity
you can think about it and it's very useful to think about it as a as a distance measure in a sense
it's a very complex distance measure compared to the ones we've looked at
but it is a distance measure
cos this whole function plus the UNK of how many terms match is a measure of how similar our unknown pattern is er to all our known ones that we've trained the system on
but it's rather strange and er certainly not distance measure but it is a it is a measure
and of course the whole thing is very easy to UNK
really after the n tuple method was defined in nineteen fifty nine erm the next person who came along that did anything with it was UNK supervisor that's why i work on this area
got a lot to blame to blame for i must admit
what he did he saw he saw the method and saw well this is quite neat
we can actually implement it very efficiently in hardware
we can made a very fast recognition system out of it
what we've got here is a very conventional piece of logic that UNK what i've talked about
we've got two UNK so i've given the example again we've got two UNK of two one here and one here
we'd have other ones as well but just to show this particular example just to keep it small i'll make it small
we then have binary decoders
and as you know binary decoders list all the possible states of the input erm conditions
so here we've got binary inputs to there must be two to the two UNK i e four possible UNK
and here's the truth table for this particular UNK
okay
and these you should remember are basically the terms i gave on the previous page
same as these terms here except
so the decoders are actually listing all the possible terms of the inputs
the memory cells here of course UNK whether that term occurred during training
so i present this pattern i push it through the decoders and i see that UNK maybe is active so i put a one in there to record the fact that logic term er occurred
and similarly for this er UNK down here this section down here
so training is very easy to implement like that with a few memory cells and a binary UNK
recall is similarly very simple you present the input pattern pushing through the decoders and instead of reading from these memory locations sorry writing from these memory locations you read from them okay
so in this case you get this r would be activated and we access this location here which would be UNK into UNK to give us our response of well two maybe in this particular case
and if it actually recognized it
okay so we can implement it like that in hardware but the major benefit and this was done sort of like sixties sort of sixty nine seventy was to realize that you could put it into a little package like that which of course is a random access memory
the tuple lines are the address inputs into your random access memory
the memory is just the memory the data input stores the one for the address location and the data output stores the output
and you've gotta rewrite signal to tell you whether it's gotta learn or to recognize the image
now here's an interesting story about this er
UNK who as i say recognizes started to build these little cells these things before random access memories came along
he called them erm what were they something it was
something strange like that
but the point was that random access memories never existed when he first did this
and he went to UNK and asked UNK if he could implement these little functions on micro circuits
i e sort of er the l s i type circuits
and he got some packages made but unfortunately he didn't UNK the idea because what he actually was made what he actually made was random access memories
erm and had he had he UNK it or i don't know about exactly the timing he might have made himself an absolute fortune
not that he was interested particularly but er it's an interesting story
erm he did that when he was at erm er now where was it kent university of kent
just the strange things that again you know it's having an idea and recognizing it that it would be useful
it's something that er not always happens like in the back UNK learning and people who invented it didn't realize it was that important and didn't advertise it
he invented the random access memory but er didn't tell anybody about it
never mind
okay so we can implement this sort of thing in er using random access memories
and as such of course in run load you can make this thing go in the order of tens of UNK probably less to recognize an image
but as i say every year er if i ever find an application where you need this sort of speed i'd like to hear about it
erm there's very few applications that need to recognize anything in that amount of time
the only small idea that i have and i don't think it's particularly practical is for a sort of UNK mechanism often which is in fact one you get in logic UNK anyway
but er often you might want to trigger off a particular pattern coming on the trace
and you might have to you have to do that in the order of UNK
but of course something like this would do that but you have to allow for the UNK as well and this sort of UNK might be the way to do it
i think there are a few others but not many
so if you implement it totally in parallel you can go very fast
typically we don't we implement it in software and even in software it's very quick because computers are ideally set up to implement these sort of systems
so it's great
it's the right sort of technology
we've got the right sort of computer technology to implement these erm we can move out from there into the neural network world
and of course it's very hard to see this as a neural network
so we could ask ourselves well very nice but where does neural networks fit in
fact recognition method it's a piece of hardware and one of the things that's clear actually is that er the UNK and all sorts of other people that were working on this don't look at them in this way and they look at these as i say UNK blocks
erm as a result they call them UNK networks which we actually hate because they're not UNK
if you actually represent them like i've just shown you
you can change the diagram very slightly and they look just like the normal neural network
in fact it's very much like the higher order networks that i talked about in the last lecture er i think it was the last lecture but one and the networks which pre process the data before they're presented to the network by some higher function
what you have here is basically a single UNK with a of weights the weights on the circles here are the binary elements in the random access memory
the weight you know the storage locations
the decoders here are just non linear functions they're just binary non linear functions they happen to be but they're non linear
now if we recognize it as that we immediately see that the method is well why the method works in neural network terms
if you remember a single network is a linear UNK and can't solve non UNK soluble problems
to get round that one of the approaches that i talked about was to pre process the data
i e or UNK it in some way
force it through some functions
so that's what these decoders do
er such that it is hopefully UNK
now one of the problems over all that is to say well is it
how can it always solve the problem
well it can't it doesn't always solve the problem
in fact recognition you don't have to guarantee that you will solve the problem
because even though this is a this is a linear network it can be effectively seen as a network effectively with a unit here and a unit here and maybe one weight
if it was seen like that you can't actually solve a erm a linear problem which occurs between these two sets of units
you will see that in a second but there are limitations with it
erm which are okay for fact recognition but not so good for more sorts of analysis problems
but we'll see that in a second
okay so you can view it as a as a single UNK with some er decoders
the other important thing is that the learning rule is not a graded UNK learning rule or a searching UNK learning rule as we've seen before
remember what we do with the network normally is to present an input get an output see if it's correct
if it is correct we don't do anything and if it isn't correct we use that error to adjust the weights
now here we've got binary weights
so it's either setting or not setting the weights and in the n tuple rule all we do is in fact set the weights
so we present the pattern
we could test it to see if we get an output we don't but we could do there's no need because all we have to do in effect is just set the weights of the decoders that are actually coming out
but the decoders that are the UNK lines that are active
sometimes that learning method is called the UNK learning rule erm because it's the sort of thing you find in animals erm donald a famous what was he a famous UNK
he came up with this how UNK actually did learn
by the way UNK i haven't said that but the learning rule is n is not UNK
and a lot of learning rules aren't UNK
erm this happens to be as well
as an aside
for a multi class problem where you've got more than one UNK more than one class you might display the system like this
it's a slightly different way of looking at UNK networks than perhaps we've seen before
because we have this matrix here
but what we've effectively got is a UNK here a UNK here and a UNK here and we've got our three classes
and we pre process the data as i say commonly for all the UNK before we present it to our three UNK
testing for these sort of systems erm we had to decide which of these responses is best
well as you see we can count the number of terms that actually match from our training sets
so this example here we might find that matches that matches we get a response of two from here and we get a response less than the response from here and the same response from this
we have to make a decision on those responses just like in a normal network
now we could just take the pattern of responses out of there as being some classes
you can do what you like really
erm but the easiest one is obviously to take the maximum responding output from here as er an indication of which class is belongs to
okay so that's er a very straightforward sort of thing
the other thing you should remember is that there are all sorts of UNK that you can apply to these sort of things
that if we had a response here of two one zeros i've scored at the bottom of that we've actually got two of the logic terms matching from this particular class
one of the logic terms matching from this particular class and none for this particular class
how well how sure are we of this result here
well we're too sure aren't we
we're saying that we've got two of our particular sub patterns matching
cos we've got a response of two
here we've got one
so we might say well our overall confidence is two but our relative confidence which is saying how different it is from everything else is only one
and you actually do get two types of UNK erm confidence in these sort of systems
there's this absolute confidence which is the absolute output of maximum responding UNK
then there's the relative confidence which is to say how much stronger is that particular output compared to any others
and both of those factors can be important in judging how the UNK doing
okay that basic architecture is if you want the UNK sort of architecture for the UNK stuff
erm there are a lot of variations upon it which er make it interesting and we'll see later also how the thing actually does work and all its properties
the variations to the system come in a number of forms
first of all that the input can be grey scale of course instead of binary
so how does the system cope with that
well we've only got binary decoders here so we have to cope we have to change something
maybe we change the decoders maybe we change the inputs
there's a whole section of how we do that
these this UNK of weights is binary
well we could have continuous weights in that particular UNK possibly
what benefit would that do for us
of course it UNK up the implementation er if you want to implement in hardware and these aren't binary weights it starts to make the UNK a bit more complicated
the third thing is in this UNK function why do we use a UNK function
i mean in the neural network terms we just use a UNK function
but we should ask ourselves why are we using that and what's the effect of using other functions in there such as maybe an and or an or where we or the responses out of here or we an them
because now we've got a binary network we can do different things
it's the equivalent to in a neural network saying instead of saying the weights times the inputs all UNK we'll take each weight times its input and multiply it with each weight times its input so we do the product of all the inputs times the weights
erm what effect would that have
and that's interesting to see in pattern recognition terms
really that brings out one of the benefits of using this sort of network because you can analyse it
you can look right into it and you can actually find out the behaviour of it fully
you can see how well it UNK you can see how well you can implement it
which is nice
okay i think you've got a corrected slide here
erm this is my attempt at a formal definition of the network
erm it helps you if you want to work out exactly how it works and work through it
this is not the corrected version you've got the corrected version
erm and through this we can see where the different variations come in the system and introduce one or two other ones
what we've got also is indicated a bit of how we might process it if we implement this sort of thing
the sort of UNK we've got
we've got an input pattern
okay we've got er example p er sorry class example p plus r we've got a t UNK which is basically after you've taken the input pattern just after you've UNK it
so we take our input pattern and we produce a UNK here called t which we then present to this lot here
we've got a weight UNK which is the normal sort of thing we'd have
training is a simple p simple UNK this is how you would actually implement it properly
i mean it introduces a an interesting thing
what we'd effectively do which code what effectively do of course is we UNK down here checking to see if any of these are set to one and if they are set to one we set a weight in memory
now if you're gonna be writing in software you don't actually look at it like that maybe and it is also a useful way to UNK these decoders
what these decoders actually do is take the input and UNK one of four particular states
where a state is whatever the particular sub pattern is on here
now if you view the output of these as a state number you can UNK the behaviour of these decoders and you can UNK them to anything you want
it could be an x square function that produces a number which indicates which line you should UNK
that's really how this is written down here
you go through all the example patterns
for each the example pattern you UNK er this input tuple UNK
so we take our example we put it through these decoders
before we do this we have to apply a mapping function m the mapping function is important because as i say these wires are connected to these UNK here
i must know exactly how those are connected in which order
but as we'll see later the different sort of connections that you have er affect the behaviour of it
er if you get the connections wrong er sometimes it won't recognize it
so this mapping function is quite crucial in the operation
so you map it onto the tuple UNK and then all the UNK so you take each tuple in order
you set the weight one sorry the weight it's probably it's hard to explain it like that but you apply the UNK function f here f bracket to the particular tuple and you get a state j so you set the weight for that particular state
w r i j there's a j there there's a j there okay
so effectively we take our input pattern we take our tuple we force is through our function here we get our value out sum value of the tuple and that's j and that indicates within the weight UNK that we're looking at which weight we actually set
funny way of looking at it i know but it's sort of to give you an idea of how the different ways you can actually do this mechanism and brings out the er variations
lots of ways of writing it
testing is the same sort of thing but this brings out the different functions that i talked about either UNK or products
do the same sort of thing you need a response UNK first for the result
in this case we've got an unknown pattern
we do exactly the same mapping our input pattern onto our UNK
we then apply our UNK function f to get j and then we sum for all UNK over all states the weights times the inputs
a very strange way of writing it again but basically it comes down to the following
as i say we take our tuple push it through our UNK and get our state here j that's the easy bit
but why write it like this
cos what we're doing is going for each n tuple we go through each set of states here
UNK it's very difficult to do this
you could use a UNK to actually write it a bit easier but er i didn't know about that when i wrote these slides many years ago and it's carried on since
er we write it like this
erm so you actually UNK down here and where you which is UNK the state act from here is one you set the weight in the memory
a horrible way of explaining it but er it's some attempt at some UNK
okay
as i say the variations on the system are alteration of this UNK in here to a product or
and having that mathematical description allows us to change that from summing all the n tuple to doing a product of all n tuple
what that basically means again is that for this particular blank here that we're look at okay the state value u might be one the weight might be one okay and we get that out of that cos we're just going through all these here and seeing which one's going to be one
we then instead of adding those particular UNK we don't we sum them
don't forget that each of these decoders only produces one ac active output line okay
so in this case this one might be active corresponding to that weight there that makes that whole ban bank set to one
this bank might be set to one as well or zero and then you sum those together which is that UNK there or you can do a product there's a product there
basically a product is equivalent to an and
a product is a continuous form of an and
we'll see what the benefit of that is in UNK in a second
what i've put down here is the way you alter that simple description to give you a continuous weight rather than a binary weight
during training what we do in the training UNK is of course set a link here or a weight here to one if the output of my UNK is set to one
okay that's easy
in a continuous form instead of just setting a binary link here we actually count the number of times this particular line is set to one
basically what we're doing is to count during training how often a sub pattern a tuple has a particular state has a particular pattern
and that's very useful in sort of more statistical type problems er as we'll see later
so basically what that's done is introduce the variations of the letters
i'm gonna go through each one of those sort of variations in a bit more depth er later on
but er i hope to give you an idea for that
so let's have a look at it and see how it works
i mean the basic mechanism is very simple as i say
first thing we want to have a look at is how it UNK
as i say the method has got to recognize things it hasn't seen before
like with all neural networks
now normal neural networks perform UNK by okay having some space yep having our examples here and our examples here and maybe setting a line in between that
such that any new example one down here can be seen as being belonging to that set okay
now thinking about what we've just seen how does that relate to that
very difficult
we've got our single layer network as we know so we take all our inputs we push them through the decoders and we've got our single layer after that
but there is a straight line in there somewhere
but we do this pre processing
now the pre processing makes the patterns makes the thing UNK soluble
so if we add an example using the n tuple technique of the exclusive or problem for example er like that we want to see how the network would solve that okay in terms of a single layer network
project
and they're collecting words
right
right
and they just want to hear people talking so just carry on with your meeting take no notice of that
no you can use any words you like they are UNK
oh right
they're totally UNK er UNK
UNK kno nobody will know erm who it is
right
or be able to associate who said what
fine tom yeah
we'll use some big ones now
UNK
to be sure to be sure sir
right where were we
l h
er november automatic should have gone up eight per cent automatic
end date
november
er so that'll be first eleven ninety four
yeah
check price increase applied
yeah
increase
all i have to do is go and see her and say i want to know see each one ticked
cos remember you're UNK just the UNK
right
got to check the end dates list numbers
sure
to make sure that you know they've got to understand we police it from that which means that you go over to
yeah
i think to be honest to you the have been given very little guidance she doesn't understand what's supposed to happen
mm
and the importance of it
mm
so it's just got in a bigger mess and a bigger mess to be honest with you
yes and i've got the UNK straw now
yeah that's right that's right
well one of those yeah one of them's negotiated and the other one isn't
three one four three six one
one three six one eight
yeah
is that it
eight three eight two eight four
i've got one three nine
that's right
that's okay then
that's okay
er
narrow aisle
narrow aisle being done i know that
i've seen a note for that
first of the first ninety four
yeah
would you know what they were
er check price increase
oh this is good of you
saves me doing this
you see i gave all this information on disk
she's had all this on disk
yeah
cos i was UNK off cos i said
erm now UNK
there's a letter down here
it doesn't that price it just tells you
look do you want to write on there and work that out
and then you can see what
nineteen fifty one for the s f two and a half
yeah
yeah
eleven twenty nine for the seventeen stroke
eleven twenty nine
and eleven o eight for the two stroke
so that they're the latest prices
effective first of the first of the first ninety five
super
okay
's engines
's engines
oh i'm going there next week
that's right just say it's the thirty one ninety four
check backwards and forwards like a yo
erm first of the second ninety four actually
thirty first of the first that's right that's where it ends
yes that's right
okay
yeah
so that's okay
yeah
brilliant
no in date
no they were called something else actually erm
let's have a look at the p l a
didn't have on this did we
no
i think we ought to remove that list
which list
this list
erm they've only got one size and s f t thirty with UNK
that's right
yeah
nice profitable business
pardon
nice profitable business
it is yes and we've erm
so that should be a three o eight customer
yeah it should
outside of one size we should only have one size on the net list
it's UNK let's have a look at the account number
the price on the net list should be six pound eighty
that's for the s f t thirty
price six pounds eighty latest
check price increase done
change and date it to when
maybe er
thirty one twelve
thirty one twelve nine four yeah
right
yeah
yeah
i didn't have that on this list did i
no
four five six sorry four six five
four six five
six eight one hundred
six eight one hundred
er two
two
double one
double one
three one
three one
o one
o one
okay
travel
mm
take forty p out of that
er t l a customer well yes yeah i think we should delete all ne UNK delete the net list remove er list and end date
right that's okay
ah right
we've erm we've done that
is that all we've got on erm
yeah we're onto the next area
right
do you want me to just go through any others
the other thing you've got is the fact that p o a customers will be on here and therefore those p o as should be on here
right
right
plus these are over your horizon or the end of february
oh right okay
yeah
yeah UNK
erm we've got we're in a situation with where we've just put eight per cent
we haven't affected their order book but all future orders we've affected by eight per cent
so this should be by eight per cent
it should be updated by but not applied to the order book do you follow me
yeah sure
check price increase of eight per cent for new business
not order book
that's one ninety four
er end date should be one ninety four
so it'll be thirty one twelve ninety four
yeah
yeah
well if you'd like to keep it at that that's fine
yeah cos that then that then ends on that date and you negotiate for
that's right yeah
and that's
i'd say that's the same thing myself
yeah
this price
no sorry no it isn't
n one oh one three
n one oh one three n b c three
n b
so four five seven six three one o one
that's alright that's no problem
it's er
it's picking up onto the same list is it
yeah
end date it's picking up off the same list
end date thirty first of twelfth nine
link list o nine o to i o eight three
good thinking
er that was automatic ninety th er november ninety three but we've had a problem with them so we're negotiating
so that wants to be
they've actually UNK
thirty one ten ninety three
er end date
i'm just bringing you up to date really they've actually er UNK quite UNK towards the UNK quite UNK towards the erm price increase and er we've erm just sent them back peter's just writing a letter so there'll be a letter coming in
so you see that needs to go in there so that when it prints it out again we come and ask you
yeah
what's happening
and when you update it er which UNK the whatever percentage it is then we change the end date so that it is
right fine
otherwise i'm getting paid
no that's right okay
i understand
that's how it should that that's how it should work yeah i agree
we've got this p o a actually
ah remove net list p o a customer
i heard they were in trouble
have you
i no sorry
be the sa it's the all part of the same
well precision for a while because
yeah
of the redundancy situation
oh
be a bit careful with that
engineering
oh that's site contractor
so the end date
it should follow it's list and erm it it's one ninety four
that's right then
yeah
so that's alright then
i don't think you'll find it
i don't think we'll find anything should be the same one ninety four
one ninety four
yes
one ninety four
one ninety four
yeah
's all the same
engineering
erm that's fifteenth of the second ninety four for some reason
i don't know why
deferred
but we've got we do very little business with them it's really an account
well we should actually we should that wants linking to erm 's account
can't at the moment no
but i mean our business with them is two hundred and nineteen pound
why we're worrying about them i don't know
they probably negotiate the list at the same time as
no i don't think we do
i don't think we do
yeah
okay if we do it to the fourteenth of the second ninety four er and then that'd come up i can tell you what we cos peter's just is halfway through it with well i say halfway through it
hopefully he's halfway through it with erm so that should come up
okay
okay
no end date
it's two four o two four five o five or two seven
remove
yeah
oh it's quite a big value
well let's not remove it let's go let's erm put it november ninety three
okay
november ninety four sorry UNK so it goes automatic
date to november ninety four
yeah
so thirty one ten ninety four
okay
no end date
p o a
remove from net
no
because then you get you get this which is
right and we'll be able to dummy this one will we
okay
and you can clear this up
sure
i know
carry on carry on
lead on UNK
carry on regardless
yes
i've put all the together under peter 's responsibility
because he deals with on the
ah right
and since are a big potential one ninety four i've got down here
yeah it's only one
yeah
yeah
and er
so it's still outstanding presumably
er i think it is yes
do you want me to ch check for you
it's just that if there has been a price increase then the end date wants changing as well
there's a letter in with that one
right so we haven't had a price increase
no
no we have we UNK we're halfway through it with working out
all the same they should all be the same
and the end date wants to be in as
i don't think we can treat them individually
right
you know i think we should tie em all up with the same
thirty one well ninety th ninety it says ninety three
hang on this account number
end date thirty one twelve ninety three
it looks like they're all linked in
yeah
thirty three thirty four
they should all be the same let's put them together anyway even if they're not we should put them together because erm i mean they're all part of the same company anyway
we can't UNK we shouldn't treat them individually
we should treat them
right
people
one four ninety four
end date thirty one o three ninety four
that'll stop this one coming up
engineering
yeah 's a UNK
so one
one UNK
thirty one twelve
yeah
that's okay
list price
p o a i've got down here
so
somebody's
remove
no i don't think we should do that
we could actually remove the net list right but i think we should have a net list for
yeah but i don't think it's been updated for so long
mm
at the moment erm UNK i've got a new enquiry in the system for a whole works right
yeah
what i'd like to do is UNK that and put that in as the net list
right
do you follow me for the spares
yeah
but we need to put an end date on that
erm oh i see yeah
otherwise it's gonna keep up
yeah
erm well we can change this end date can't we
yes if we put end date in as thirty one twelve ninety three
yeah
that's right
so that keeps popping up and then we get it right
when we've got it right we can put it to
one ninety four
end date thirty one twelve ninety three
engineering
er one ninety four
end date thirty twelve ninety three
one two ninety four
end date thirty one ninety four
er engineering
november automatic
november ninety three
so check price increase done
enter
enter end date er thirty one ten ninety four
next one
er automatic november ninety three
check price increase done
enter end date what date was it again
november ninety three
thirty one ten ninety four
yeah
cancel
take it out
remove net list p o a customer
don't wan don't even want it this far
okay well we'll do that later
okay
yeah we're in the middle of that
it's one ninety four
so that's okay
so
do a lot of work on that
er one ninety four negotiate
so one ninety four enter annual date thirty one twelve ninety three
engineering
engineering november automatic
enter end date thirty one twelve automatic
so these should have had price increases
yeah
check price increase
thirty one twelve ninety four
increased
that should've been automatic ni november ninety three
ninety three
done thirty one ten ninety four
that's automatic
ninety three
november ninety three
think of the money we're giving away by missing these
they might have been done it's just that we don't know
no i know
that makes it even worse
er one ninety four
really for our business it's worth messing around now
erm that's business i think if you just put er eight per cent on that just p whatever if we've got a net list put it out the way
ninety three check price increase eight per cent done thirty one twelve ninety four
one six three o three
that looks a reference
m c three
i think that's UNK bearings isn't it
really
bit of a failure weren't they
well so we should certainly put them up by eight per cent
er
automatic november ninety three
check price increase thirty one ten ninety four
if not thirty one ten ninety three
that's automatic again
industries
yes we've i've just done those
we're on to the next area now aren't we
one ninety four
erm but i've been this is i've been progressively pricing this account
right
we've had erm on those two price increases on the o eighty eight which is the volume size
yes
and we've just had another one on the b a c o UNK o nine o
yes that's why i've the increase of twelve and a half per cent on it
right
so you can see that er that price seventy six of those that price goes up to two hundred and something pound which is
thirty one twelve ninety three was that
ninety three yeah
ninety three if price increase not done
should say c j b g
yes thirty twelve ninety four
c j b g letter
yeah i think you will yeah
don't you
i bloody hope so
cos i'm not doing this every year
no but we shouldn't need to
no
we shouldn't need to
volumes is not until er later on in the year
third of april
that's it yeah first of the fourth ninety four
that sounds okay
yeah
whoops
yeah
thanks a lot UNK
is erm quite a circus cos they we've got two accounts we've got and the original equipment manufacturers
yeah
and er it's a real game of soldiers last time i had them up here and er oh it was quite fun really
that's nice
yes it's good yeah
well last year i've improved the margin on that something wicked
cos er we went through it last year and i all the sizes that we only supplied i just put them up
mm
and er if they were if they weren't making a reasonable amount you know eight and a half per cent ten and a half on some of them
right
and on the ones cos they were trying to s screw us down to the floor and on the popular UNK where they i knew they were gonna they could find better suppliers i was only about two per cent on some of those
you know one and a half per cent
and i said to them look i've re UNK all this is your new price sorted and he said we can't see what price increase we made
and i said well you know overall it's gonna be what we said you know i said we i've tried to meet your targets i said but i've had to increase some up UNK higher than others you know
got away with it
bloody hell
they believed me
oh dear
er
oh automatic that should be eight per cent automatic
check price increase done eight per cent
if yes enter end date of which date
november ninety three
thirty one ten ninety four
yeah
yeah
don't have to do it done that one
dear oh dear
limited
that should be automatic november ninety three
sorry about this
that's alright
date ninety four
ninety three
wonderful
er automatic
quick
manager of
so this hopefully
yeah
right then
limited
oh dear of dear
i don't think i've done any business really i think i've just written that account off
so p o a customer
p o a
list
what we could do actually is with a we could have a
i think i've just dumped it to the
we really ought to have these n these p o a customers with their pl with their blind lists on the computer
yeah
and we could factor em up
yeah
so if you decide you want to some er eight per cent
that's right
yeah
right instruments
well i think do something like that
they do something very similar to that
mm
they have this blind list
er sorry er instruments limited
automatic november ninety three
check price increase done
is this print picking up people who haven't had a price increase then
it's picking up people who don't have end date
oh right
it gives us an opportunity to say if the end UNK not been done has the price increase been done
yeah
yeah
yeah with an end date have actually been done
no because if the end date is
if you have a look at the end date price
price
end date thirty one ten ninety four
is that november
yes
yeah
no
no not end date thirty one ten ninety three
p o a customer
let's write him off
got to be yeah
p o a
seven two o four e t a
yeah they use that
yeah that's right
yeah you know all about that don't you
yeah cos you were in precision
no
er
i don't know anything about that
engineering
november ninety three automatic
eight per cent thirty one ten ninety four
item
automatic
check price increase
worried about this one
i put that price up more than the standard that's wrong
this is one where i put the price up and then we went and wrote to him with a net price list showing a lower price than i'd put up and we had to reduce it
so it's got to put up it's gotta be put up eight per cent i can tell you that
yeah
yeah
yes thirty one twelve ninety three
i'm annoyed about that
you know we negotiated one price didn't get
and then we we're sending them the net list and saying there's your new le er price
sending them the net list
and he said this is lower than what you'd said it was gonna be
you know
took the legs from under us didn't he
that's terrible
do the next page
automatic
er
right p o a
p o a by the way another thing i'm thinking of doing is saying if you want a net price enter in there it has to come through a manager or
yeah
good idea
and er we'll have a summary of what have got net lists and what haven't
and then you say whether yes or no
you have to sign it off
yeah
oh this one
we had some fun with it yeah we just done this one
oh we're on fourteen area fourteen
yeah
one ninety four it should be
yeah
that's right okay
erm and then we've just done a letter to them with the new prices
so that's okay
well
we haven't done it yet have we
well i don't know whether you
we've done a combined UNK here erm we've done er
here they are
the prices should be
according to that dated the ninth of december
oh no that's wrong then
check price increase done
letter ninth of december
nine twelve ninety three if yes ninety four if not
yeah
this is p o a i think
isn't it
no it's got a an end date
oh it has got one ninety four yes you're right
yeah
yes
that should be er negotiate one ninety four
yeah
i think we've put i know we've put erm eight per cent on everything that's now outstanding so it should all go up eight per cent
check price increase done eight per cent on new business yeah
yes one twelve ninety four
if not ninety three
oh we c they cancelled them
oh is that what it is
i think so yeah
ah
i assume so
yeah there's no there's no cost UNK
no cost
so if it w it was after the receipt then it would be
be
it would be a negative margin wouldn't it
yeah
the profit would have been minus cos the costs would still be there so it must be a UNK
mustn't it
that one is the same size isn't it
yes
that's a c three fifths the c m
yeah
and then no that's not the same
no
i dunno what's happened there
that's a shame
limited
er that should have gone up eight per cent
check price increase
i don't think that has gone up
i'm pretty sure that hasn't
eight per cent
if yes
ah yeah that's why because our business was smaller but business was big
with our size we could just put up by eight per cent
if yes it would be what date thirty one twelve
well it's
that's right yeah
getting frustrated
in a very matter fact way
he writes it all down he sends it all in and expects the system to handle it
mm
yeah but sh he should i mean on the road you should be able to just write in and say i want this to happen
that's right
yeah
but it doesn't
yeah
it doesn't happen on the pricing that's for sure
that's under review at the moment
just cos
carry on
just cos we can hear you when you're in here
it's got nothing to do with that roger
nice one tom
UNK
just UNK talk into don't talk
just talk
away
there you are you see and you thought we were joking
get on get on with your business
yes
right what i've come round here for er i'm going to israel in a month
oh right
right
yes that's right
i wanted to talk to you about the things that er you've got from the meetings and to just think about the pricing issues
erm and what you might say
yeah
alright well when you've finished here perhaps we can touch base
touch ba that's a good one touch base
signing out
i don't know
yeah erm i don't think we increased this
erm we quote once a year for it really er UNK this is one that
mm
comes out for tender
right
and it should really it's i think we should put november automatic on that
thirty one ten ninety
three
three
yeah and check that we've had an increase
check price increase
yeah
i don't know whether it's been done or not
i really couldn't tell you
eight per cent
check done
right that's okay
that's not mine
that's okay i can i
that's n yeah that's well that's erm that's now erm
so you ought to
that's my boy
yeah you ought to get the dates in that for that
again that's in as well
right
yeah that's in as well
these are national accounts aren't they
yeah well that's in isn't it
that's not a national account
no
that's
an area nine twenty
oh i know why administrative receiver
administrative receiver
oh right
was administrative receiver and then it went over to limited
oh right
so you need to check with on that one just to make sure that area UNK right
ok
fine
right
with me
that's it thank you i've now been through the lot
smashing
now i need to talk to er
right erm
and make sure that she can
yeah
go through all that
if i leave this here through i can tell her what she want what i want her to do
that's it and then erm then we take it to the next stage
yeah well the next stage is as i say to
one of the priorities is to get on with the price increases and get them done right you know
the administration even if it goes wrong we can catch up with them later
no cos that's the mistake we made
well alright
that's the state the mistake we made before
yeah
well the i mean the we won't leave it too late will we
i mean there's a few that's been done that haven't been caught anyway
isn't there you know there's
a few we've increased
well that's what i mean
yeah we want em caught up now
precisely if we leave it too late then
that's right i agree
yeah i meant from me i'm not i'm not doing any more and i'm not i mean i'm just keeping this log
yeah
to administer the price increases
i'm not going to do that any more UNK
you're not
no
only in as much as where we are
i'm gonna continue with that
yeah
but i'm not gonna c i'm not gonna administer if they're been done or not and double check every model
oh no
no that's right
that's what this
yeah
that's why she
agreed
yeah and i'm not saying that you know this is yours get on with it
no
no i understand that
no
if you like i've been doing a job which i shouldn't be doing
yeah
right it shouldn't be my responsibility to do that it should it should be accepted that it's gonna be done
it should be done
any decent run organization it would be done
yeah
go through the p o a customers
right
sorry i thought we'd finished but we haven't
aha
er precision engineering p o a
yeah
yeah
don't know much about them yes go on
well if you don't recognize them
p o a
yeah
yeah go on
they're either dead or no that's november ninety three so that's
no that's a that's a that's it's only one size but we should have that recorded as a
well you see that's the point
oh right
okay yeah sure
engineering
got it yeah
p o a UNK
p o a customer yeah
that's
oh sorry
yeah
medical
yeah
yeah they're dead
dead
yeah okay
yes all rollers yeah
cancel
cancel
you can't leave it it's dead it just sits there
yeah
yeah
one size isn't it
cancel they're dead
yeah
don't know anything about it
it's UNK isn't it
yeah
forget that
that's that was some stuff you see
yeah sure
and then and i think they've they're a UNK that's died
yeah
got to be in coventry isn't it
don't know what they
yeah
it's
that's erm yeah
yeah it's automatic
no it's no it's not beginning to recognize these things
yeah but it's a long story behind that
yeah that's definitely
did you
yeah
yeah that's p o a
yes definitely a p o a
mm
that's dead
that's dead yeah it's now erm
don't know anything about that
not worth worrying about
dead
no it's not i that's just the history man
alright okay
dead
p o a customer
yeah well we don't so a lot of business with them it's more distribution than anybody else actually
yeah
i was going to say to you know erm engine of peterborough
yeah
do you supply them direct
no
i don't think it's one of our accounts
i don't think we trade we don't trade with them
no it's the only business i think we get out there is from and that's UNK
i'd have thought had oh mind you have got a contract on bearing for
have they
yeah
oh right
i don't know i don't know i don't know anything about it
yeah
the o e side
no
used to do er he used to make sure he got precision when he wanted it
oh right
yeah
yeah fine that's
it's really to make sure that there's nobody on here that should be on there
yeah
that's all to make sure there's nobody on here that should be on there
yeah that's all right that is
yeah that's okay leave them on p o a
when do these prices go up
they don't
they don't
no they don't i mean the whole point is with p o a is what's wh what we're doing is sorting out should the customer be on p o a or should be on net list
if he's on p o a and he should be on net list we need to change it if he's on
right
once we've done that we can then start examining the list to see what's on the list
yeah
and on the p o a
on some of these p o a's if there's a big potential i'd like to have a dummy net list
yeah that's what i want
so we'll be saying look these are the core sizes
yeah
but anything out of that we don't want to know
right
these are the prices we quote
right
do you follow me
yeah i mean i don't know what but that's obviously by the look of it
yeah
that's the sort of thing you're interested in isn't it
not two of this
no that's right yeah
that's so what
engineering
engineering
yeah that's p o a
yeah the same
i thought we had a net list for them
but er go on leave them on there leave them on there
ooh are you sure
leave them on there
go on
well i suppose you what the thing is we
leave them on there
yeah
yeah i think so
er
linear account that
yeah well leave that leave that alone that's alright
but it should really we should quote volumes for that and they do volumes business
right
but they always go market and they go against UNK and buy when they want to
they supposed
they're not no
yeah i know
but erm they do
mind you i want to try and get them to take
that's different
yeah
that's made in the u k
that's right yeah
power tools
it's all bloody walls isn't it
yeah
isn't it
it is no it's part of group but it's power tools down in
oh right
UNK
yeah
yeah forget about that
international
that rings a bell that's the same account actually
that's de that's cancelled
yeah leave that on
yeah
engineering
what's the next thing
yeah that's alright
i don't know what that's yeah
fine yeah that's
is it
no c f c
no
they don't come back
tell you about it
they don't come back
they don't come back
they go
they don't come back
bang
bang
weapons isn't it
yeah
yes
yeah
yeah
business
oh yeah special bearings yeah leave that
yeah
yeah
yeah leave it on
leave it on
i mean i can't take them off i can't cancel them off
no okay
oh well if they we can't cancel them off that's alright
don't know anything about them
that's alright
er yeah that's okay
the
yeah
you can le you can't take it off so leave it there
i don't think we'll ever trade with them again
yeah
no
that's the sort of thing we should have isn't it

should have done that by now
machines
interesting
machine tools yeah this is all UNK
it's all UNK
alright yeah thank you very much
okay
very much obliged some more er
right thanks a lot UNK that's lovely
has your group finished those sentences
no
erm
yes
pat has your group finished those sentences
i've finished mine but i don't know
right
mark
yes what
would you like to do number one
er
i put in between the n and s on UNK
yeah
er e s e and s of cottages
yeah
er and one between UNK t and s
t and s of UNK the n the n and the s of UNK the e and the s of UNK and the t and the s of UNK
put your hands up if you got it right
let that me a lesson to you
ben number two
serves you right
yeah one between n and s of men's
shh
one between n and s of men's
and between n and s of children's and d and s in UNK
right
n and s and men's n and s in children's and d and s in wards
put your hands up if you got that right
oh dear it would erm
manage to confuse you utterly
yes you did so
erm right
would you like to do number three
erm after the s in books erm after the s in libraries and after the s in UNK
yeah i think it's definitely got to be after the s in books as it sounds as if there's more than one of them
libraries is obviously plural so it's got to go after the s
and UNK depends on whether you think there's one or more than one and it's not clear in the sense as you say
did you take
hang on could you do the same with UNK could they not have an apostrophe after the s
no
UNK
more than one
men is clearly plural isn't it
so
so what about cottages
because when the word doesn't end in s when the plural doesn't end in s as it doesn't in men women and children and sheep
you er put an apostrophe and then you put an s on
i see
it's when the plural word doesn't end in s
what about cottages
cottages
let's see
put an apostrophe after the s
so e apostrophe
after the s
yes
'cos there's more than one of them isn't there
that's what we did that's what we did
oh did i say that was wrong
but you said that was wrong
oh sorry
number one it should be erm
after the s
yes after the s this is obvious more than one cottage sorry
what about what about the children's
what's that plural isn't it
that's apostrophe s
yes
yes
yeah i'm with you
yes that's right
yeah
erm right who'd like to do the last one tracey
erm both teachers apostrophe between the r and the s of teachers
yeah
apostrophe between the d and s of husband
i wouldn't agree
i wouldn't know
i think it's
go on what do you think
i think er it's apostrophe after the s of classes after the s in teachers and after the s in husbands and after the s in schools 'cos they're all plural
classes is isn't it
UNK yes classes yes UNK plural isn't it because the UNK is c l a s
and it's e apostrophe
and it's more than one teacher because it's
helen hang on
classes is a plural word that ends in s so you put the apostrophe after the s
yeah
right helen plural word that ends in s
the apostrophe goes after
when the word the words plural that does not end in s and there's just a minority of cases then it's apostrophe followed by s
mm
okay
got it
right classes is definitely plural so it's definitely got to go after the s and therefore it sounds as if teachers is going to be plural doesn't it
'cos there's more than one
sounds as if we're talking about more than one teacher
more than one wife anyway can you
hopefully not
well hang on a second we're not talking about putting an apostrophe on wives are we for goodness sake
no
because they don't own anything
so let's put an apostrophe on the s of teachers and then husbands is clearly plural because the teachers were plural and we th we talking in UNK so after the s in husbands
with school erm it depends on whether you're talking about were they're both teachers in one school in which case if you understood that way it's the apostrophe before the s and if you understood it er teachers in several schools then you'd have put to the apostrophe after s
i should think it sounds as if they're both teaching in the same school myself
yeah
i would have put the apostrophe between the l and the s but erm i'd be prepared to i'd be persuaded that it wasn't crystal clear
okay
now the two little things in boxes at the bottom just UNK what i've said
it's with an apostrophe is an UNK for it is because you never and i think those three little rules there only apply only UNK have an apostrophe UNK never have an apostrophe and it's only UNK ending in s have an apostrophe and it's only when they own the thing that follows except when they when they don't end with an s but you know the exception of men's women's children's and sheep
er are exceptions
right well i didn't expect it to take that long to the apostrophe
erm you must be honest about this er is anybody feel clearer about these the apostrophe than they did half an hour ago
yes
would you be kind enough to just raise your hand in the air if you feel a little bit clearer
you can be honest and put your hand in the air if you feel more confused than ever
stuart does
no
but i don't really think i could make it any clearer but you need to perhaps take it home and go through it again and think about it and see if you can understand it you know in the quiet of your own bedroom plus is a very useful time to try and learn things
if you turn over
it was heart searching
turn over
this is just i'm not going to through these exercises this is an exercise on the apostrophe to show not possession this time but that letters have been left out of words
i think you know all this
you drop the letter and put the apostrophe where the letter would have been had you not removed it
so all that you need to think to remember things like don't is that it's do not and you've got to put the apostrophe in where the UNK been missed
so if you follow that it shouldn't cause you a problem
erm but the one thing to remember is when your writing a formal essay in an exam situation don't use the UNK form
the only time you're likely to be using it is if your writing an essay where you going to use conversation to make it realistic people do UNK in a conversation or if you're asked to write in an informal way
so those the only the only exceptions
so generally avoid using UNK in an exam essay unless you're asked to it in an informal way
okay that's the apostrophe
the next sheet is on commas
commas right are you ready for quick gallop through commas
martin are you ready
good people use commas much too often and some they don't use them at all
but especially when they put them at the end of a sentence where they should be putting a full stop
there are some however sorry there are comma however comma please note some situations where commas are necessary if you're going to write clearly
first they are used to show a pause between parts of a sentence which makes it for example when you start off with a UNK clause after i'd UNK my UNK comma i went to the shops and bought some food or because of the UNK comma all the trains were running late
technical to think of it technically it's when your sentence starts with a UNK clause
when it comes to the end of that UNK clause you need a comma to separate it from the main clause which is then going to follow
another use of the comma is on either side of a word or phrase which could be left out of a sentence
for instance my sister comma who works in a green UNK comma said she saw her with kim last night
so the fact that who works in the green UNK is just a bit of additional information it's not necessary for the main part of the sentence you can take it out and it's not going to take make any difference to the construction or the meaning of the sentence it's a bit of additional information
or you will need comma amongst other things comma three bricks and a length of rope
what you have to remember is that you need a pair of commas and not just one
some words are often used between commas like he comma too comma was embarrassed and this one in particularly please tomorrow comma however comma UNK is expected and don't try to use however as a conjunction 'cos it isn't
and it will if you at the beginning of the sentence however it's got a comma after it before you go on to the rest of the sentence
if you use it in the middle it's got to have commas both sides of it
is it the same for therefore
the same thing happens with therefore and the same thing happens with nevertheless
you also use commas between items in a list
you bought three apples comma a UNK comma a bicycle pump and a walking stick and you don't need the comma when you use and
so it's commas between the items on the list except for the last two where you're using and
okay
got it
now try the sentences
and see if you can agree as a group on where you're putting them and don't be too influenced by people that might be wrong
but i have been up all night comma too tired but i was really UNK
really there's one after night but you don't need after one after tired just carry straight on
but it's a normal
james it must be your turn to
since my operation i haven't looked back comma although maybe because i can't move my leg
ah
and erm number three
as i missed the train comma i decided to catch the next one which was in an hour's time
has anyone got a comma after one
yeah
yeah
i got oh i sort of like to use two and then cross out the wrong one
going to write a little note to the examiner aren't you
please examiner please whichever was right
i like that one
erm i think i'd be inclined to put a comma after one the next one because it's a bit of additional information
train
the train in an hour's time
no train
oh yes as i as i missed the train comma i decided to catch the next one comma
yeah but wouldn't that make it possible to take that out and then it wouldn't make sense 'cos it would say as i missed the train which went in an hour's time if you put another comma 'cos if you if you put two commas you couldn't take it out
your main sentence yo the main clause is i decided to catch the next one
additional information really is as i had missed the train comma but it's er you've got to have a comma after train because it's following that rule that was given in the top left hand corner after i UNK my UNK comma because of the UNK comma it's that rule it's the application of that rule
well i think you need one after
after UNK
do you need one after the next one 'cos which sticks one which
well without getting too technical about it i think you ought to have a comma after one because in the erm y you know the erm UNK they gave you on the left hand side that would apply what you've learnt on the left hand side
i see right
but ask me another day when i've got a bit more time
there is a an occasion when you wouldn't have a comma in front of that relative pronoun
yeah
it depends whether you can take the information or whether the information is the essential part and it's a bit of a fine line there actually
yes it is
in number four erm i can't see anybody who hasn't done one so erm martin have the pleasure of doing this last one
first comma sitting never really understood which means
right
er definitely after evidence and definitely after right
i'm not going to go through the erm passage at the bottom but i'd like you to have a go at it and will go over it on friday
hang on i haven't finished yet
turn over
today gallop very quickly through people often use a comma instead of a full stop
which is what a lot of still do martin included
you use a comma to show a pause in a sentence but a full stop shows that a sentence has finished
how do you know if you're at the end of a sentence
it's what you've written a complete idea in itself and does it have a main verb
if the answer to both questions is yes then it's a sentence put a full stop
okay look at this one
james
yesterday i bought a new video comma it was great
is wrong because the comma is between two sentences
each it's not a phrase it's each clause is a sentence because it's a complete idea
yesterday i bought a video
end of idea
second idea
it was great and therefore you need a full stop between the two
it's stuart instead of using a full stop between the two short sentences you could use a conjunction to join them together which would give you one sentence
yesterday i bought a new video and it was great
otherwise you could use a pronoun as a joining word so you could use a pronoun and use which
yesterday i bought a new video which was great
okay
normally you would use which to join sentences about things and who or which to join sentences about people
about UNK that you looked at on friday
okay
some sentences quick sort them out please
put the full stops in where
martin
please return the cups to the counter full stop
number four
comma
yes helen sorry helen
there's no point in talking about it full stop
all we do all we do is argue full stop
can you put because
sorry
can you put because
because all we do is argue
yes it if you're being simple about it
it just said put full stops where they are needed
th the UNK on the exercise is to make them one sentence by using yes you could use a conjunction if you were going to make it into one sentence
right then last one please
erm
working in the theatre isn't all fun full stop
a lot of it's hard work
it's
ah
instead of instead of using a full stop you could use a conjunction
there is another possibility that they haven't mentioned because the book hasn't come on to deal with it yet but you should know what it is
is it the colon
you could use the UNK
but what you mustn't use is the comma
alright
okay we'll continue this keep these sheets
bring them to the next lesson
thank you very much
point of view today because we have actually UNK that and that's the reason for the amended recommendation
right are you happy with that
oh i'm sorry mr wants to speak sorry
thank you chairman
briefly er i think that explains why we haven't got the erm item mentioned in paragraph seven
it does indeed yes sorry i should have mentioned that
yes
erm this is something that i've spoken with about over a long period and what really has concerned me is that we've two red signals both facing the traffic and children and blind people could be crossing thinking the traffic had held up and when i or UNK we rely on our own engineers maybe going round that way maybe the police or public reporting it
that doesn't seem to me to be a very satisfactory way of UNK that these systems weren't working and with such complex systems as we've got such as the system it would take one person quite a number of minutes if not hours to check all the lights so i very much recommend this system and i should i suppose declare an interest when you start to talk about UNK
right thank you
is that recommendation agreed then
sorry chairman
just a very quick point
could we also look at the actual time that's on crossing signals
sometimes you hardly get any time to cross the road before the actual lights turn and particularly the handicapped and the blind
yeah okay thank you
i'm not taking any more on that thank you
we have agreed the recommendation
we will bear that in mind
thank you mr
erm item sixteen the on street parking supply and management contract
you want to say something about this one as well
i would like you please to refer to the county secretary in the recommendation on page seventy three with the county surveyor
i'm sure he'd rather let the contract
page seventy three
yes the county secretary seems to harbour these wishes to become the
no that's not fair
well you might have thought it was nice
okay is that recommendation agreed
agreed
agreed thank you
item seventeen erm the urban grass cutting contract
now this is a very interesting one because we are always under great pressure to increase the number of cuts etcetera
have you gotta change this one as well
yes
er
it's not my fault though this one
right shall we let the county secretary tell us what she wants to change
i'm not the county secretary
sorry about that but it's just you're representing him
yes i do represent him
erm mr explained the reason for changing this but basically it's to swap us again and that it will read that for one that for ninety four to ninety eight the standard of grass cutting be seven occasions per year and the county surveyor in consultation with the chairman be authorized to accept UNK from suitable contractors and the contracts be let to commence on the first of march nineteen ninety four
and secondly i think the second one is exactly the same as it stands madam chairman
right thank you very much mrs
right i've got mr
no oh i've got
oh sorry er i've got mr and then mrs
thank you madam chairman
i never thought today i would sit here and criticize very severely
er grass cutting in borough council and i see their contract is up for renewal next year is about the most disgusting grass cutting you could ever wish to see
i think i talk for the whole of when i say this erm the disgusting way that borough council are doing grass cutting
there is part of that grass cutting probably due to the fact that our pavements are also covered in grass some of them as much as two foot on either side and you've got two foot down the middle going like that where the grass is growing and has not been cut back since nineteen seventy four
er now the county really ought to look at this problem of grass growing over the pavement but the cou borough council are using the UNK that are not capable of cutting grass edges grass UNK
th you drive along a massive machine probably doing more damage getting up and down the UNK a and everything else
they are going along at vast speeds and i say vast speeds they're twenty miles an hour over the grass and you can imagine how much they're cutting
the also the big rotary UNK on 'em are throwing all the grass over the pavement and all over the road and eventually finishes up all down the drains
i would to our officers they should not grant another contract to borough council until they start to use the correct machines for doing the work and i hope that message now has got across to the cou county surveyor and he really ought to be talking to borough council to find out what they're doing about it
right thank you mr
mrs followed by mr
erm thank you chairman
well erm i entirely agree with most of what mr has said
it is absolutely appalling
the whole trouble i think started when the districts were formed in nineteen seventy three i think district council to seventy seven but it's always been a problem
erm first the district did it and erm they didn't want it so then it was decided to have to share it with county and that was a disaster too and they did so many cuts each a year and then county took it over
it's never got any better
erm the only time it was really good in my area was when urban district council did it with a little chap pushing a UNK and cutting the grass and it all looked absolutely beautiful
i know it's difficult now because population has increased grass UNK have increased
erm they go round with these machines the grass flies everywhere they never do the edges
several contractors have had it and it's never been right and eventually a few days or weeks later a man comes round to pick up the grass which has already flown everywhere so it's too late and a wa total waste of money
erm there obviously isn't enough supervision by the contractors of the people they employ
it's certainly absolutely dreadful and erm people complain when they come down and say whatever's happened to it used to be such an attractive place but obviously when the grass is knee high it doesn't look very nice for anyone to see
i think we've really got to do something about it and hold a proper UNK and see what's going to go on this year because it's it gets worse
i personally would like to see the parishes of the towns doing it themselves i don't suppose that is possible now but at least let's have somebody reliable and UNK
thank you mrs
i've got mr followed by mr
yes thank you madam chairman
very briefly i would've preferred to have seen a contract based on the end performance with the grass being cut to a structured length
we always seem to get the wrong sort of weather in
three different sorts of machines
the playing fields are cut very well no doubt about that
it's the UNK that're either not cut at all or they're cut with one of two machines the UNK is little bits and the machines that so UNK described
they don't come round at the same time so you're always out of phase and it always looks UNK
the only grass that's well cut is where people cut it themselves outside their own house but in particular erm th i would like to see the supervision of the contract and that we don't cough up the money unless the job's done properly because i think we're paying for a job that's not being either done at all or when it is being done it's not being done well
it's the quality of service we're getting is ab UNK in that area
thank you mr
this is of course why we are proposing the trial in which would er give us an end performance grass cutting contract but we don't want to do that right across the county because of the projected cost until we know whether it would work
erm i've got mr followed by mr
thank you chairman
to some extent to a larger extent i agree with what says
the grass cutting we get is appalling
erm unfortunately erm when you let a contract out you've got certain criteria and a contractor will only do what's specified on their contract
unfortunately whether the contract drawn up in the first place has been a correct one or not i'm not sure
i do know that council do pay for two extra cuts over and above what the cou county council have paid for
but the question of machinery is a very important issue
the person between the parks department and the erm this contract in they are two separate departments and there's no doubt about it the parks department do a very good job
why the people who cut the actual grass that people walk on erm i don't know why they don't do that job properly
we have asked questions about clearing the grass up afterwards and we're told that would probably be two or three times the amount in the contract and in the actual at the end of the day you get what you're paid for you get what you pay for and if you don't provide the resources or you can't provide the resources i should say then obviously you've gotta make do with second best
whether we could look at our contract and see if this could be because mentioned about grass on the pavements not only is it the machine that's doing that but there's a danger to young children from the machines they're using and elderly people with pavements being very slippery once they're doing the grass if it's raining
apart from that UNK in people's houses
thank you mr
well thank you madam chairman
there's been a lot of hot air generated over many years about grass cutting standards but it's not an idle thought when i say if anybody wants to see where the best grass cutting takes place then they should visit
erm i've gotta say that i think the year was nineteen hundred and seventy six when it was the county council's responsibility for cutting the UNK not the district
county UNK said we're not doing it any more that's to save money and the thing fell upon the district councils
now even in it took us some time to get the situation under control but we did eventually get it under control but as i say not without a lot of UNK and very strong complaints from the public at large
now but in many areas of the county work was put out to contractors
finally the th county picked up its responsibility again but the damage had been done and er grass cutting never seems to have recovered in some areas on the that i'll just try to describe in a few words
erm i welcomed chairman the present experiment before us i hope it UNK i hope it sets a continuing example to other parts of the county but you only get what you pay for and in we top it up from the seven cuts to i think thirteen or fourteen
but there always remains still one point of complaint by some members of the public that is that the grass that's cut does tend to blow about but if the cutting is frequent there's less grass t to blow about at a given time
but if you want the grass swept up as well then i tell you here and now you're getting into cost that's greater than that of cutting the grass
thank you mr
i've got mr and mr and then i'm drawing a line
mr
well department of transport erm say that five cuts per year is enough and er we do seven cuts which is a little bit better than that
i wouldn't disagree with mr in what he said about the more cuts we have the better it looks and so it stands to reason it's a question of cost
but i think that he would probably agree and i know he's made comments at various times on this subject about er the grass that is left behind and it is always a problem i think throughout the county erm where grass is cut and then spread around
