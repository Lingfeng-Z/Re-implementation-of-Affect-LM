my own view that sun readers aren't stupid and that the general public isn't really a stupid erm but erm they enjoy reading it and they're reading for the experience of reading getting their views and are very almost like have you ever seen processed cheese UNK you know you can buy little pieces of cheese in little UNK that stick on your bread or your butter or your rolls and the way the sun the sun UNK kind of like that if you don't wanna read thirty five pages in the independent every day enormous amount of news UNK written reported for the for the most part you could read the sun at a quarter of the price except that you don't get all the news and you also get er a different political viewpoint but it's one way of getting news in er
but very often i think tabloid UNK is interesting in terms of language because it's very UNK it's UNK because i in some of our terms you might find people into a three minute reader and a thirty minute reader because in attention span and intellectual capacity are quite different but to actually UNK something into meaningful short UNK even if they are politically biased actually requires a certain amount of skill i would suspect the clarity index which i can't find is the process that i mentioned the other night where you take erm some people call it the fog index a correct me if i'm wrong in my figures but i think it's a piece of something like two hundred or three hundred words you count the number of UNK erm UNK and full stops or is it only full stops
full stops
full stops
you then count the number of words of more than two UNK
mm
and then you do a division of the one into the other and you get a figure that is smaller in the tabloids and larger in UNK like the times and the financial times and in UNK like the communist and the new UNK
and it it's called the fog index but the thing that's interesting about it is that i've got i've got some interesting examples of fog indexes erm and you'll get people like UNK who sometimes made speeches and their fog index is quite small you're going to use this you know example and they might have a fog index that's fine and what anne and i are talking about with say something like the telegraph or the times or whatever might have a fog index that people but this is because UNK was very clear very concise and going back to the original point about or some of the original points about this and i was UNK raising these issues earlier this evening one of the great UNK that i have is that is that when i first went into UNK the tabloids as we call them were incredibly well written beautifully UNK well UNK and okay they might have been UNK and shorter and everything else compared to the turning up the er the times or whatever but they were well written and you might have had if you can put the fog index test on it you might have had a fog index of say six or seven compared to eleven on the telegraph story but it was still full of clarity like to read
over the last twenty years or so one of the things that's slipped has been those kind of things and i believe and peter may disagree with me but a lot of the have been because of the commercial fact that the thing that is now driving the newspapers more than anything else is the advertising and advertising UNK and that drives the style of newspapers and stories that are written
i suppose one of the things i use to demonstrate it most clearly is that for many years i s i gave lectures on communications and one of the things i used to say in those lectures was i did not know and i was UNK that sense what came first if newspapers write stories in a particular way because that is what the public wanted or do public want a particular type of story and that's that newspapers round up and i stopped UNK that question when UNK murdoch bought the UNK sun because UNK murdoch bought the UNK sun and introduced a lot of sex type stories you know stories about UNK and UNK people and goodness knows what else and the sales UNK and there we had almost a UNK example of change in the design of change in the type of stories that were written and people were buying it and so you have an issue of you know that your content was actually being by what your UNK wanted
so that answers all those years that i have been conducting these seminars it answers my question not in the way i was particularly happy about i have to say but i mean it did answer my question and then it may be them having you know i mean like sort of things i may not be particularly happy with but maybe it is good that the papers are reflecting what the community wants
maybe my UNK is more about wants
but in a sense i mean i can erm i mean i agree with everything you've said erm but er when murdoch took over the sun i mean the sun was selling at one point was selling about four million copies which is
someone else UNK
okay yeah i appreciate that but i mean i would erm basically say that the less UNK sun
well probably not that he went and it would of we subsequently we apply much to the u k erm
to know anyway
but i mean i i'm guessing i'm assuming i'm not sure he did but i have seen erm when i was in edinburgh studying communications if you work in the sun which was erm a UNK for murdoch on it
yeah and we've seen some different erm they had i think it was actually waiver paper as well when murdoch bought it and for a while he honoured the political content and then he decided he was gonna do major changes and this may all sound familiar to you but erm the effect that had i mean not only on the on the on the end up being this side but also on erm the mirror because it meant that page three girls were in on the daily record in scotland erm it was it was quite profound i mean there's a broader argument here as to whether you should get UNK to those possible UNK to taste erm it's interesting that the daily sport and the sunday sport which are two i don't know if they have anything like it in japan but they're a bit like the national UNK erm it's all made up UNK there's a sad proportion of erm journalist stories of fantasy land stuff erm along with erm UNK content and er copy content which probably
it's fiction not fact
UNK on the sort of UNK as well yeah
i mean like i saw a double UNK bus on the moon and that sort of stuff
mm
you know an and i met UNK at the chip shop and that stuff i mean it's
anyway it's fiction
anyway it's fiction erm basically i mean for me there's two issues one do you UNK to the worst possible taste erm and two erm is the sun the face of newspapers to come er
it's that one
i mean
but newspapers essentially are
four million copies of that i mean that makes it i think most popular with newspapers i mean
i mean i was quite UNK having lunch one day with a UNK a UNK journalist erm and this was about six months after murdoch had taken over the UNK sun all this and we were chatting away and i actually threw in the stuff which were saying about how papers are there to make profits these days so that's what drives them and that journalists on newspapers such as UNK papers write what they're supposed to write and she and i got quite out of with one another and the bottom UNK was that she absolutely totally and utterly denied what we were saying and i said to her okay if you were given a story to write you know and it was opposite to how you would view it what would you do and she said oh well i would have to write it and the issue with the murdoch papers and it's quite interesting because i mean i'm sure you can with other newspapers but i i've just got a bit more is that murdoch never ever writes a minute or a memo to his editor or staff saying this is what the line is ever
he never writes a memo saying you know we are supporting or attacking this government as about this election campaign never but journalists know what his view is and they write in a code with that view and if they didn't they would quickly find out where they should be and it would not be working for one of those newspapers and the thing that's quite UNK about it is the
first of all he will have one newspaper running one line and another newspaper running another this is something that's quite fascinating they came over
today's
we have two quite different publications
that is owned by the same stable if you like it's a UNK and it's the sun
oh
i think i am right in saying
yeah er if you what was on tonight was er on the there was a t v programme on tonight called what the papers say and the editor UNK was on tonight he is actually quite left wing and this paper will is actually quite UNK about the government much more than the sun would ever be it's quite interesting yet that is owned by murdoch but i have to say that i think that is only because murdoch isn't liked in that way since to have
about murdoch the australian inverted commas because that his he was i mean when i first i don't know the man but when i first knew about him in australia he was a he supported the labour government's election in australia
what has happened with him since he became more of a big newspaper owner is he shifted from that and he has been known to support a labour government in australia and a tory government in britain at the same time and george bush in the united states while supporting UNK or bob UNK in australia
i mean he's been known to do that because he you know what is going to happen with him UNK in his newspapers and he's actually very clever and i mean none of us i mean okay and i think peter might be the but i can get quite upset or intense or UNK or whatever the word is about that sort of stuff because i am my background is UNK and i'm quite pure about it but we're living in reality times here and the reality times is that he has got certain agendas
he's not UNK there are other old newspaper owners so he will say okay the government in australia is doing what i like therefore my newspapers or usually most of my newspapers in fact one or two of them won't will support that government and that government can be totally different one in the united states where in the washington post or you know in the new york post or whatever will go and attack or support because he thinks it's in the less interest that his commercial interest and the u s because he sees us doing the same thing there
you go to UNK where he has interests you go to UNK where he has interests you go to different parts of the europe where has interests and then you go to britain where he has interests and you can and so what we're talking about here really i mean that's we're talking here of commercial interest
you see we're not talking of newspapers as we probably traditionally known we're talking commercial interest
the language register of the UNK will be more UNK more steady
it may be highly critical that the actual language will be completely different in the register
yes
the tabloids will go for UNK and UNK
they will go for vocabulary which is highly charged with UNK and emotion
mm
the others will chip in if they agree but they will they are they are wanting to set a missile to move they're wanting to send a bullet they are wanting to s to UNK emotion or anger or rage or frustration or political bias or to change attitudes now for example the interesting thing about the princess diana erm the headline on one of those tabloids which talks about UNK is i suspect that they want to UNK the constitutional crisis which there was at the time of
edward
edward and UNK because edward UNK in order to marry a divorced american and so they then went to live in UNK and he was eventually after he died he was buried in britain but UNK or the UNK of UNK or as she then was
did she get divorced
she did
mm
funeral
there was a special UNK given to her to attend and in fact there were photographs at the time with the queen with her
yes
but i mean it was the story to run that while sh the queen was with her it was a it was not war erm i mean a whole part of story like
do you think that's reasonable about the ex the use of the word UNK
i think i
absolutely to reach the historical UNK
some extra layers on this i mean i think that's very valid and the extra layers include er one the fact that since then there have been a number of UNK who have divorced and so it is not unique for UNK to be divorced and the church of england has not jumped up and down about the fact that there are UNK who are divorced particularly given that the you know the church of england are opposed to divorce
the second issue is the fact that charles is the head church of england
this is a really major issue because i mean he there would be a situation where the person who would be head of the church of england would be a UNK of a church which does not believe in divorce
and divorce is or sorry UNK is not allowed for members of the UNK church
how about divorce
they er well i think UNK it's very difficult and this is why there is now in a similar sense as why i suggested it to you as a subject because not only it was er a very emotional story of a UNK young woman saying i can't cope with being treated by the media and other people i'm going to UNK but what made it so historic and therefore the treatment of it's so interesting was that it presented such an extraordinary constitutional position
that's right
for us here in britain
because as long as they don't divorce theoretically when charles becomes king his queen
and therefore you can have a situation where i mean if the queen is there for another twenty years say the situation in twenty years time where you have king on UNK and a queen who have not lived together for thirty years or whatever years and you know still playing out this
the other interesting thing you would find about vocabulary and treatment between the tabloids and the independent is the independent has a policy of very little coverage of the royal family and i suspect that other than a paragraph or a sentence or two of introduction that those four paragraphs at the foot of the page are simply the text of her speech UNK and media blamed as the princess UNK from public life i suspect that you will find that is not a story it is simply a statement of fact and an actual UNK of the text of her speech
i think you will find there are no observation no UNK no emotion no judgment
what happens with the language about the rest of these is that they are making judgments
yes that's right but though i mean there are a couple of additional issues to that and that is that the tabloid are UNK is that the right word UNK to their collective view of what the royal family should be a view that is probably wrong
they're UNK to UNK
well there's that i mean there's all there's a whole range of things there's UNK right i mean that that's important there's also the way the UNK have been UNK by the media over the decades and the fact that you know this has been how they've been UNK this is what they actually are and that y you know what i'm saying that erm or whatever it is between this is what they are this is what we've been and they don't match they really don't match
i mean UNK little telephone calls between he who will be king and his is she a UNK is she a girlfriend is she merely a friend but at any event she's married and her husband's in the next bedroom as far as we can gather you know erm do those kind of conversations and would i mean maybe it's important to sort of say and anne probably has this but peter might not i mean when i grew up the royal family were a UNK sort of image and you might have known about george the third who was mad i mean who else was brought up george the third was mad and UNK an and this guy was a drunk and this guy was a UNK this guy was this but victoria you know UNK for sixty years or whatever it was but this royal family i e the royal family with which i grew up and anne did were really sweet nice little UNK who behaved themselves and that was what was went into our UNK and there was the odd crack about phil the great who's the queen's husband you know and how he perhaps had an eye for the ladies but there was never any photographs of him being or any evidence that it might have gone further than that particular and basically there was that any there was the fact that he was a UNK when he married the queen anyway so all sailors are like that aren't they
but then here we are twenty thirty years on and those of us who had that UNK about the UNK of that royal family that's suddenly been confronted with this image that's anything but that and you know and i'm and i and it's been and now you have the tabloids saying giving you UNK evidence of its any but that and so that whole erm image view that a lot of UNK grew up with has gone it's been
but the whole social and cultural revolution evolution change has led i think to whole different UNK in the press which perhaps may have existed in some of the very one might almost say near communist publication like the
daily worker
daily worker whereas the now the UNK of UNK and the UNK of print
mm
are that this is UNK throughout the world within minutes of being spoken so you have the monarchy which has tried to make itself UNK has actually made its language much more UNK
if you listen sometimes to speeches made by the royal family now they are not necessarily to my mind and er this is this difficulty of the sort of UNK and UNK of the UNK of york and the princess of wales who tried i think both of them to do a UNK amount of public work with different levels of success and different levels of coverage
don't agree i think er
but oh peter's been a all for self UNK to create their own image for their own purpose
i think they had a jolly good time at the UNK expense i but i won't be
it's
but i think i mean i think that
so they have they have in fact embarked on a course which now lets these newspapers really deliver them up on a plate i mean they can UNK them they can UNK them they can UNK them they can UNK them because they've put themselves in a position where they now deserve the criticism and the level of UNK which they're getting
for example if you go back to say queen victoria and queen mary and one of my former bosses was a UNK of queen mary and i mean he simply said to me talking not long ago about one of the nobody i people didn't behave like that at court so they've really asked for everything they've got
i think there's probably a strong view about that
i mean it's interesting i mean i made all those comments earlier about and i mean peter he might disagree with them but what i think is how we view the UNK as we were all growing up
but if my kid comes off a UNK the language comes off the UNK too
absolutely now i mean i it's interesting for women because i suppose in australia i was a republican and here i suppose i thought i saw about two erm now for me to have used that word thirty years ago i would possibly have been locked in the garden shed and left without food and drink
erm i suspect a few members of family
to be a social worker was shit yeah
that's right
you'd be there six o'clock gone mate
wonderful
i suspect now that you know i mean i they might still to move given to one or two of my family members but basically i could more openly say you know that in fact i suppose my view in britain but not in australia but my view in britain is okay the royal family could continue to exist they must a pay taxes b i don't UNK to any of them and c we've gotta put them in perspective they're in which is they're a tourist attraction erm you know but i and i can make those comments which would be met by a lot of UNK with UNK people who would totally disagree with me and say well they are the UNK and you know bow but others would agree with me and that is something that has changed over the last three decades it really has it's changed during my absence in australia it is something you know that i came back to and i mean i kept i've been back about three or four weeks and there's a pro i mean there's some delightful radio programmes here comedy political comedy shows and there was one show i listened to and i had been back a couple of weeks and it was about erm the queen had a p r issue and she had to sort of do something about it so she decided they'd have a public execution of edward and they described edward was a cream UNK and they the queen and er andrew and everybody else was on the UNK at er UNK house and the crowds are UNK and the rolled and the execution
now i cannot concede that programme going on the air when i was to UNK
cannot concede that it had been possible and neither will shift in how we communicate and view the place of the UNK in our society and what the are and how those p r shifts a phrase in terms of let's make ourselves more public let's make ourselves more accessible have resulted in that because their very their very UNK is the those kind of radio programmes to happen
it just wouldn't have happened i mean
but i wa
i was shocked
i listened to it i was shocked not because of the content but because of the happening of it and the realization of how britain had changed
you see one of the other interesting things is that there is a essentially a tradition in this country that the royal family do not sue newspapers
yes
for UNK
there are various exceptions erm and there have been two or three in recent years but it therefore meant that they were fair game for saying anything so they were fair game for a very UNK headline because there was very little chance of UNK
mm
now the view er was that they were UNK and above taking action and also in the sense that the public was UNK i think with more sense than to believe everything and that the public memory is relatively short and therefore if you start a court action and you then have coverage in the court action you are merely making the thing worse erm sometimes the things that some people may have thought were highly UNK one day become almost a joke and something of affection later on and you can one of the UNK maybe is about the prince of wales talking to his plants now that a national joke and he will make jokes about it in speeches
mm
and it's become of the exchange of talk and of media erm but what else do we say about language register and vocabulary
length of words
oh yes
erm
you mean so w
shorter
yeah not physical length of words
now in a sentence in the independent and the times and other UNK you would find there are more words of three and four UNK than in the tabloids but that gets back to the clarity index again
that's right
but it's not just necessarily the number that there are it a it's the whole type of vocabulary the whole register
also i think you'd find that the erm er although now i'm suggesting you do this but if you went through the independent and you counted the erm number of different words the total vocabulary i think you'd find it's many times bigger than the
that's right
i'm not sure but i think when i studied this in college i think it was something like the average of producers of vocabulary of less than two thousand words
mm
so if you have
sorry
er we're talking nineteen eighty two i was there so it ten year ten fourteen years
do you think it would be greater now
no actually no not at all
erm the reason i'm asking is because i suspect it would have been greater at the time i was talking about all the ago though
i think that is something that you know we looked at the you know the mirror that you know while thirty years ago they were doing short UNK stories and they maintained that there was actually
a wider range of vocabulary
a wider range of vocabulary and a greater intellectual depth to it and you know i'm i actually almost feel tempted to get some of the files out and look and make sure i'm not wrong if you know what i mean
it would be quite interesting
i mean i think
i mean i think you'll find that erm that there was an UNK you know i mean that while the language might have been simple it wasn't UNK and but the change in a in a way now is around
yeah
do you know do you know am i being clear about that
yeah
yes
but there are we've got i've got three books for you to look at for you to do with your project and i might try and find you one or two sentences and references
one the good bad the good the bad and the unacceptable
mhm
one called shock horror and the tabloids in action and one called power without responsibility because i think you could perhaps make in fact the taste that in terms of circulation the tabloids actually have the power to influence significantly to in int influence public attitudes so but how they exercise that power is without responsibility
the other thing there is the evidence from the law society in england to the committee appointed by the government to look into the question of press self regulation which has quite a lot to do obviously with privacy for everybody but also
refers to
privacy of the royal family public figures
there is a question as to whether public life she'd be treated differently erm and also whether in fact journalist by not being able to do things that other people can do if they're not writing a newspaper
does that help you do you think
any questions you want to ask us
erm so far i don't
well
peter was doing a thing about counting words
these are just are just
for fourteen er years ago when i studied erm communications at one of the things he said was the sun paragraph would be short of twenty words whereas the tabloids would probably qualities they er full size papers would probably be longer but interestingly enough the this introduction the introduction of the story about princess diana in the sun is the same length as introduction about the story of princess diana in the independent
same way one of the words about i mean i'll just read it to you
see if you can tell which one is which it's an interesting test
the princess of wales yesterday dramatically announced the UNK of her official duties widely interpreted as but with complete withdrawal from public
i would say that was in the independent
yeah
yeah
yeah it is this is how the sun did it
how does the sun do it
close to tears and her voice UNK with emotion
excuse me i have to say princess diana yesterday UNK the world UNK that she is to UNK public life
i have to admit i quite like this that's UNK that's UNK straight to the point and i think er you know it's UNK with emotion
can you say the UNK for
they are they are they're more they're a more UNK newspaper erm the sun has more passion
more information i mean this is i mean this is part of what i was talk UNK i mean we're talking about the index survey so when i raised the example of UNK and the UNK ex example is was a good one because i mean he was an intellectual in his way you know i mean he was a big bright UNK and but his was in terms of word count because he had a use of words for the way he used his words was how ordinary people would understand him i mean if you go back to you know we will fight them on the UNK and everything else i mean you think of the number of UNK he used in those words etcetera i mean that's sort of what i'm getting to i mean he had his sharp UNK approach you know
yes he had i think he had an UNK and an UNK and a feel for the common man
he would have made he would have made a good sun journalist
the man the man who's the man or the man in the street and he had that UNK which allowed him to
and i mean i i'm making i'm UNK i'm deliberately making these points because he is UNK as someone who perhaps wouldn't have been a sun type but more of a telegraph type or whatever but when you've analyzed his words and his speeches and everything else in terms of what we're talking about the tabloids or UNK or whatever you know he would his language would have fitted in more neatly to the tabloid style than the telegraph style
i think it's a very wonderful thing i mean i regard him as a UNK world war two by his eighteen month should have been
he does see if he came amongst us and then for those four men who let their friend down through the roof he saw their faith
well is that what he would see with you or would he just see what you're wearing and what would he see
would there be any faith to see
he saw their faith
and then last week again we considered another question regarding er regarding faith
i'd like us to ask another question this week it's slightly different perhaps a strange on the surface and it's how much faith does god have in you
how much faith does god have in you
now you might say perhaps without really thinking about it well if he's got any sense he won't have a lot of fe faith in me because i am i am a great failure i've let him down
he shouldn't have faith in me
but it's a serious question
how much faith does god have in you
how much does he have in me
well let's keep that to the back of our mind for the moment cos we're gonna er see some answers to that along the way this morning i trust
right at the outset perhaps we can read a verse from one UNK er two timothy chapter one and verse twelve and paul says there he's come almost to the end of his life he's he will shortly be taken out and will be UNK and he says for this reason i also suffer these things
because er he had given them of how he had become a christian he had become a minister of jesus christ and so on he says for this reason i suffer these things but i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed
i'm convinced that he is able to guard what i have UNK to him until that day
i know whom i have believed
and it's very important to notice what the apostle paul says there
he does not say i know what i have believed but he says i know whom i have believed
and our faith is not in our creed vital though that is important though it is it does matter what we believe but even more important than that and UNK to that it matters who we believe
and paul says i know whom i have believed
whom i've trusted in
in whom i have put my faith
now god never asks us to do something that he doesn't do himself
he doesn't ask us en to give anything that he himself hasn't given
and so when god comes to me and asks me to do something he's already walked that path before me
when god comes and he asks me to give something whether it's my finance whether it's my time whether it's my abilities whether it's even my life itself for him he only asks because he has already done it
he is not the sort of person who sits on the UNK giving instructions
he is not a coach or a trainer who sits the game out never plays it but just as a theoretical UNK
but he's already done it
he's already known all the knocks and all the UNK he's been there before us
that's why the apostle could say we don't have a high priest who's not touched with the feelings of our UNK he's been there before it he was UNK in all points like as we are yet he was without sin
and the same is true of faith and so for paul to say i know whom i have believed i know the one in whom i have put my trust then the other side of th the other direction is true also god had put his trust had put his faith in paul
god had deposited his faith and his confidence in paul
you see UNK always a two way traffic it's not just me believing god but it's god believing me
it's not just me trusting in god but it's god trusting in me
after all what have you and i committed to him
but to take it in it's UNK like paul we can say we've committed our life to him
our eternal future we've committed to him
now for you and for me that's a lot in fact it's everything we've got but what has god committed to you and to me
he has committed himself
now as a simple equation me committing myself to god is UNK to god committing himself to me
it's way out of balance but that's how god has done it
he has committed himself to us
well let's think for just a moment you know we've been talking over these last three or four weeks about faith and that erm let's just think perhaps and we should have done this sooner but i dunno it fits in th this morning er perhaps just what faith is
and like a lot of things it's often easier not what it is but first of all what it isn't
i have to confess for what it's worth i do not really like lewis UNK alice through the looking glass and alice in UNK they bore me stiff
but the man wasn't stupid who wrote it
and he can tell yo i within the book there's some tremendous illustrations and some tremendous UNK
and you may remember the incident where in er th the story through the looking glass and alice is talking to the queen and er the queen says to alice i am one hundred and one
i find that impossible to believe says alice
you only need practice says the queen
i can believe six impossible things before breakfast
and you know the sad thing is there are an awful lot of UNK faith that mu that comes under the realm to my way of thinking of mind over matter that's the power of positive thinking that is not UNK faith
i can believe god will do this therefore because i believe it then god has got to do it
you can't UNK god like that
you can't UNK god like that
that is not faith
and yet there's an awful lot of christians who go around thinking along those lines
that if i believe hard enough and long enough then god will do it
don't you believe it
he doesn't do it because you believe it
that's not the reason for god doing anything
and we've got to believe but that is not the reason for him doing it
faith is not believing six impossible things before breakfast
it's not an easy UNK
it's not because i believe therefore it's going to happen
you see basically UNK faith is not in things it's in the person
it's in christ
let me turn you to a er a little incident that happened with the erm in the life of jesus it's in matthew chapter nine and just gonna read i think it's three verses there now let's pick it up at verse twenty seven this is in and jesus passed on from there
two blind men followed him crying out and saying have mercy on us son of david
and as th jesus come into the house the blind men came up to him and said and jesus said to him do you believe that i am able to do this
they said to him yes lord
then he touched their eyes saying be it done unto you according to your faith
and their eyes were opened
now then what is it that jesus really teaching here
you see he's not just asking them a question for the sake of it he is actually trying to teach these blind folks er these blind men er some spiritual truth
he asked them this question do you believe that i am able to do this
now what jesus is doing here he is not asking them you know do you have faith that you're gonna see again
do you have faith that a miracle is going to happen
he is taking their eyes if you'll excuse the UNK off their situation and condition off their UNK off their need off the miracle even and he's directing it to UNK
he didn't say to them do you believe you're gonna get better
he says do you believe that i am able to do this
so he was focusing their attention on him and that was the important thing
because what they had to believe for was not a miracle
it's not a case of believing for a miracle every day but it's a case of having faith and trust in the christ of the miracle
so often we have faith in a miracle in the UNK rather than having faith in the christ of the UNK
and so jesus is taking their attention off the UNK in a sense and directing it towards him
do you believe that i am able to do it
because that was the important thing
yes lord
they believed him
he then he performs it be it done to you according to your faith
now within each one of us god has deposited faith
and that's good to know that anyway
don't say i haven't got faith
you've got faith or you're calling god a UNK
because he has given you faith
now ha what sort of faith has god given us
now when god gives faith when he gives anything he is giving of himself
there is not a great UNK in heaven there's not a huge warehouse and you come to god and say oh father
i increase my faith give me faith
but in a sense you don't actually have to ask to have faith because god's already given it to you
but in giving us this faith he doesn't go with a picking order into the warehouse of heaven a and look there up all the great pallets and boxes of faith or boxes of love or boxes and UNK of peace and say right there's one i'll give that to you
and he pulls out another container of peace and he gives it to somebody else that isn't how it happens
what how does he give us faith
how does he give us love
how does he give us joy
how does he give us er peace
by giving of himself
there's no vast warehouse in heaven
the UNK are in him
my god shall supply you all your needs according to his UNK in christ jesus
and so when you get peace when god gives his gift of peace it's not something he has given from heaven down to you but he says my peace i give unto you
that your that my joy may be in you and remain
we have his love
let the love of god fill you UNK you
and so when he gives us faith he gives of himself
it is his faith
he has deposited faith his faith
have the faith of god or have faith in god the literal translation of that is have the faith of god
and that is something that god gives of himself
now let's look at this verse UNK two eight
there is a statement you have been saved
we've come to jesus christ he's forgiven us our sins we've been made new creatures we are saved according to UNK two eight
but how are we saved
well there's first of all there's god's side to it all
there it is there god
by grace you're saved
now we've no real question or UNK about that
we know that we couldn't earn our salvation we know that we don't deserve that we know that we couldn't merit it
we are saved by god's grace
but there is our responsibility to it
because god's grace has provided salvation for the world
god so loved the world
that UNK in him should not UNK but have UNK life
so god's grace is sufficient for the world
his gift of salvation is for the whole world it's available god UNK not the death of the sinner but that all should come to UNK
and there is i god's grace and his gift and his er his provision of salvation has reached out to everybody
but you know as well as i do that not everybody UNK to it
there is our responsibility and there is our side through faith
there it is that that's you are saved
god's grace has provided it
there it is god in his mercy and his love in his UNK he has provided a gift a free package gift for you and for me forgiveness salvation but there is our responsibility of receiving it or taking hold of it of experiencing it
then there's the other bit of the verse and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
now what is the gift of god
well the salvation is a statement we could not save ourselves that of course is god is given up there's no question about that
the UNK of god you didn't need any grace to get saved yourself
you didn't need grace to be forgiven yourself
you see if i do you a wrong and you forgive me it's not because i've UNK grace it's because you've UNK the grace
so that is a that is a perfectly obviously statement there and that's not what paul is saying
the gift is the faith that god gives to us to receive his forgiveness and his salvation and his grace as provided
you see god's grace is provided in jesus christ all that i need for salvation
now god loves the world he sent jesus to die for the world jesus came he lived a UNK life he gave his life on the cross of UNK he died there for my sins they were put on him the whole story of salvation but salvation in it's UNK is god's gift i do not have to merit it
i can't merit it
i can't work for it
and i can't of myself even produce the faith for it otherwise you might have an advantage over me
i perhaps of myself haven't got that faith
nor you we know but still somehow by some UNK you may get faith you may produce it yourself that gives you an advantage over anybody else
you see the very faith that we have to receive god's gift is god's gift to us
that is provided by god as well
it's not a works so that none of us can UNK on any account
it's not because i had christian parents it's not because i'd some advantage over you or you had some advantage over me it is all of god's UNK it is all of god's giving
so god's grace is provided in jesus christ all that i need for salvation and for a life that will please god
but you see it only becomes my experience as i exercise the faith that god has given to me
faith then is the UNK of grace
all the grace of heaven
all the UNK supply of god's grace could not save you or me by itself it had to have the other side it had to have faith i have to receive it
the gift is there but until i make it mine it doesn't do me any good
and there is without any exception everything in the christian life is a gift
you and i do not deserve any of it not a bit of it
it doesn't matter if you live as a christian for a hundred years if you live the most UNK life if you live a life of prayer and UNK if you lead thousands of people to the lord if you are the UNK of christian UNK you still don't deserve anything
because at the very end of the day we are UNK servants
we do not deserve anything from god because we of what we were to start with
we were sinners
but it is all of god's giving
it's his grace it's his giving
and so everything in your life and my life as a christian is the gift of god
our salvation is a gift
the gifts of the spirit
th the er the UNK of the holy spirit they're the th every single thing every area our growth our maturity whilst we might have input into it is still god's gift to us
eternity in heaven with him
you don't deserve
i don't deserve it
but it's god's gift to us
and the thing is faith er grace gives and faith receives
the two have got to go together
now you remember the account of the children of israel in the wilderness
we just touched on this on tuesday night
they wander around for forty years in the wilderness
why
why should they do that
well it was very simply because of UNK
you see th the provision was there
the promise was there
there's the land it's yours i have promised it to your to your seed and to your to you and to your seed it's yours it's there
go ahead and take it
god did everything except push them into the land
because they had to exercise a bit of faith
they had to go and possess it
but because of UNK in erm UNK chapter three you got the er you got the account of it there in verses seventeen to the end of the chapter seventeen to nineteen he says and with whom was god angry for forty years
was it not with those who UNK
whose bodies fell in the wilderness
and to whom did he swear that they should not enter his rest
but to those who were UNK to those who had no faith
and so we see they were not able to enter because of UNK
they had the most fantastic gift awaiting them
here they were a UNK people they had UNK from egypt from the from the UNK and UNK of UNK and god had provided a land which was flowing with milk and honey it was theirs
what UNK they you say they were not to go in and possess it
that's all they had to do
well they'd see there were problems you see faith doesn't mean that everything just happens because faith has gotta do something faith without works is dead
and they had to go in a do some fighting
they had to defeat the enemy
and only UNK and UNK had any UNK
they were the only ones who realized they could do it because god was with them
the fact the UNK were like UNK didn't mean a thing
and they cou they could say we well over to possess this land because god was with them
it had been promised to them
in UNK chapter one in verses two and three moses my servant is dead now therefore arise cross this UNK you and all his people to the land that i'm giving to them to the sons of israel
every place on which the sole of your foot UNK i have given it to you
it's not something that we god's not really given it to you it's yours
it's all gift wrapped ready
your name's on it
just go and take it and it's yours
just as i spoke to moses
and then ri down a bit further in verse eleven pass through the midst of the camp and command the people say UNK prepare provisions for yourself for within three days you are to cross this UNK to go in and possess the land which the lord your god is giving you to possess it
it was there's all for the taking
but they felt they couldn't do it
and so for forty long UNK years they wander around as UNK in a wilderness
forty years going nowhere
doing nothing
until every single one of them who had not gone in apart from UNK and UNK died
and they were buried
god said right now it's somebody else's chance
back in UNK in the first chapter in verse three see it's easy for us to say well what a lot of stupid people they were
why on earth didn't they go in and possess the land
well they're not quite well they were stupid but the thing is we can't always point the finger at silly people because we're silly people as well
there in UNK one three blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the UNK places in christ
and then like the children of israel if only we go around saying if only god would do this
if only this could happen
the point is he has already done it
there is UNK there is for you he has blessed you
he had not is going god's got no other future blessings for you
if you are waiting for god to suddenly send some new blessings you'll wait for eternity
he has already blessed you with every spiritual blessing
god hasn't got any more spiritual blessings lined up for you nor for me
they're there
he has already given them to us
the trouble is just like the children of israel we spend our time wandering around in the wilderness
wondering why we can't get it why we can't go in
and it's there all the time
you see our faith must make UNK what god's grace has made possible
he's done the providing
he's got the gift there
we've just got to take it by faith
now there's no time to go through them all this morning
let me just give you a list of some of the things that god has provided for us in by and we receive it by faith
ah i think this is UNK is so important that actually whether you like it or not you're gonna get it er written down with the UNK to go with th o on the next monthly thing
but these are some of the things faith opens to us the door to every blessing that is ours in christ
you don't get it without faith
but god's already given you the faith so don't worry
you've just gotta exercise what he's given you
we have access to him by faith
we have UNK we have righteousness forgiveness of sins UNK cleansing christ UNK how do you know that christ UNK you
you know it by faith
we receive the holy spirit
how
by faith
we inherit the promises by faith
we have victory over the world victory over the evil one victory over circumstances and difficulties not because we're good not because we're UNK not because we read our UNK or pray we have it by faith
we are kept
how are we kept as christians
cos we work hard
cos we do the right things
no
we are kept by faith
and we have power by faith
he started the working by faith and he's not gonna change horses half way through
how he starts he continues and will bring it to it's conclusion by faith
do you remember the er incident when jesus was with the disciples in the boat
now this is one of those interesting incidents because it was one of the times when he tells the disciples off
i don't know if you're like me but i must confess i get er i wouldn't say pleasure but i rather like those incidents where he tells the disciples off not because he's telling them off but because i can fit in wi with what they've been up to
i can see UNK in it me
and so they weren't super UNK
they weren't wonderful characters they were just like me
and so when he tells them off i think ha
ha
yeah
that's what i'd have been doing if i had been there so you're not so different from me peter so you might have you might be different in other ways john but i've got that weakness as well
and th so i in matthew it's in matthew chapter eight the incident th the of the er the storm and listen to what jesus says when he when he's when he's telling them off
remember the UNK been filling with water they've been UNK out in UNK after they'd done everything that they can do they then turn round and said lord don't you care we're gonna UNK
well they said that a little bit you know more UNK than that i'm sure but that was that was the thing lord help us
we sa we're UNK
and he said to them why are you UNK
you men of little faith
now why on earth did jesus UNK them
now let's be honest here put yourself in their situation the obvious thing in the storm and th the water comes UNK over well you don't really want to fill the boat with water so you start UNK the water out when you realize you're not gonna be successful cos more is coming in than you can get out and the storm is not UNK you would naturally get UNK and if for nothing else at least you can come and help us to bail out
even if we're not gonna succeed it must have stuck in their throat that there was jesus lying asleep
why should he be lying asleep when i'm working to try and save us
and jesus UNK them
now why should he UNK them
why is it that they should have had more faith
after all they had never seen a storm being still before
they had never witnessed a man get up and say to the wind and to the wave be UNK
and the wind stopped and UNK stopped UNK
they had never ever seen that in all their lives before
now if they seen a miracle if they had been there before and had seen jesus do something like this then it would appear that they would have ev that jesus would have every reason for saying oh you UNK people
why are you so frightened
don't you remember what i did last week
don't you remember how i UNK that storm
don't you remember how i UNK the winds on that occasion
they had never ever seen it
they'd never even heard of it before
i mean at the end after jesus does it they th the they're frightened by what they had now seen jesus do
and they say never have we seen anything like this before
so why should jesus UNK them
surely the reason for the UNK why he said that they were UNK and they'd no faith was because they had lost sight of the fact or the importance of the fact that he was there with them
you see that was the important issue
not what he could do but that he was there with them
and that is the reason why they were UNK
if you turn over a few UNK in matthew into chapter fourteen you've got another er UNK illustration there it's jesus is coming towards the disciples he walking on the water
and peter
right
i'll just have a look through what you've been doing
yeah er
there's the syllabus i've got
oh that's
i managed to arrange that
that is brilliant that's great
so your objectives that and you should be able to do these
right
now what's happened here is we we've done some of each of these there's bits that we've missed out though
but anything that we covered basically i've got in them notes there
okay so the problem that you were having was differentiation and integration
mhm
and of those two which do you think is harder
erm that one's a bit of an odd question to be honest with you because i'm finding because i've had an exam in this that this is the hardest
what differentiation
because i've spent more time trying it
okay
but the thing is i've got an integration exam in a few weeks popping up
so i'll be looking more towards that now and end up thinking that's the harder
right well that's fine
most people myself included find that integration is more difficult than
mhm
differentiation
which do you find easier multiplication or division
multiplication
yeah and addition UNK
addition
it's the natural thing if you like
mhm
it's the going forward way
yeah
the other way the inverse is well we got no where did we come from
and you have to back track all the way and work out so UNK very similar now
mhm
is you started off at school with division
mhm
and you'd never done multiplication you'd find it very hard
erm if you're familiar with multiplication if you know your tables
yeah
erm assume you do so if i if you know what three fours are
mhm
then when i say to you well how many threes are there in twelve you can
immediately spot
four UNK be twelve or three UNK be twelve and your not actually working it out i mean
mhm
you're going back and saying
what would i have done to get
yeah
here
now integration that's probably the best way to look at it
mhm
someone gives you with something to integrate and they say i started off i differentiated something
mhm
and that was what i got
mhm
yeah how did i what did i start out from
okay so although you say you've finished your differentiation exam
yeah
erm i'd still like you to do more work on differentiation
mhm
because that's the that's the key once you've got that er you look at some for example if i say integrate x to the sixth
mhm
okay what would make of that
what were your first tell me your first thoughts on it i don't want the answer right away i want your thoughts on it
x to the sixth
x to the sixth
what's your first thought about that
it's differentiate
to integrate it
oh to integrate it
right what are your first thoughts about it
right now for integration i always raise the power by one and then
right
divide by the new power so
okay you do that straight off
it'd be that
right and that's it straight off good
mhm
a lot of people would think ah oh x to the sixth well he must have started of with x to the seventh
well if he had x to the seventh that would have given him seven x to the sixth
mhm
so we better start off with one seventh of that
erm how about if i say integrate cos x
ee
er
are you going to write the answer straight down or are you going to tell me what
cos
you're thinking about
well what are you thinking about
i thinking a table how to
i am thinking about the table that is
have you ever done anything that would help with this now
erm we've covered it i've done it before i'm just trying to remember what the answer was
that was the answer think of it that way
think that you were think that you were differentiating something
so it'd be
and when you differentiated it you got cos x
mhm
think of it that way
so that was the answer and what was the question
probably sine x
it would be sine x okay erm so differentiate sine x what do you get
cos x
okay so that's it
so integral of sine x with respect to x cos x
mhm
with respect to x is going to be in x
now
yeah
suppose i give you sine x and say integrate that
cos x
okay you think that's your first thought
mhm
that's it's cos x
okay write down cos x and differentiate it and see what you get
sine x
do you get sine x or
oh it's actually minus sine x
right it's
yeah
minus sine x
okay so if you started off with cos x differentiated it would give you minus sine x
mhm
ah you don't want to finish up with minus sine x you want to finish up with sine x so what are you going to have to start off with
minus cos x
right and this is the way most people get into integration
mhm
there's a lot of UNK it's not a question of learn every integral there is and you have them all neatly laid out in your head in a
mhm
big table and you say oh yes it'll be that erm let's say integrate erm cos well say cos squared three x
right
erm
cos
cos squared three x yeah okay
ow don't try it straight off as an integral what would you sort of have a split your page and work over here sort of playing
mhm
about differentiating thing what sort of thing did you start off with to finish up with a cos squared three x
well for starters you have to have minus sine for the UNK now the square would be erm cubed over three
ah right well it wouldn't so
well i'm trying to i'm still thinking integration that's all
don't worry yeah don't worry about this erm you're still thinking about integration
now er there are lots of things going on here
mhm
people throw all these trig functions at you now that's not a very complicated trig function so far cos squared
mhm
but people chuck all this stuff at you and you ooh what's going on now if you're not very sure of what you're working with in the first place
mhm
you've got very little chance so what does cos squared three x mean well let's forget about the three x could you tell me what cos squared x means
erm i'm not really with you
erm
i've never i've never heard about this thing called cos squared x you explain it to me what do what's it all about
sounds a load of rubbish to me cos squared x what's it mean
all that is just a function of x whatever number x is x is for
mm
so
okay i've heard of cos x
mhm
but i don't know what this cos squared x is all about what's that how does that tie up with cos x
erm no
mm okay
i couldn't say
okay that's fine erm so you're already even when you're differentiating
mhm
say differentiate cos squared x you're already trying to do something and you don't know what it is
mhm
you're working with
now this is very common you don't know what you're working with so you can't really be expected even if you get the answer if
mhm
it's someone's given you a list look it's that learn it
that tends to be the er
you still can't understand what you're doing and if you
mhm
don't understand it's very hard to learn
it's very hard to retain it lot's of work we've done on this and if you don't remember if you don't understand you don't remember
mhm
erm simple as that if i give you a list of telephone numbers you're not likely to remember them for long you might be able to
mhm
remember them for a day or two but they'd go cos they don't mean anything
yeah
so let's have a little look at what cos squared x means erm that cos squared three x UNK i have given you x times cos squared three x to integrate do you think that would have been easier or harder
erm probably a little bit easier certainly
mm
easier to explain
okay let's have a look at cos x erm cos x what does that mean
it's just a UNK function of whatever figure that is whatever figure x represents
erm what does x represent when you're taking the UNK of it
it's a point on the x axis of a graph
erm okay so you're drawing the function and x goes from nought to what to fourteen
erm
point two or what
do you mean on a co on erm a UNK graph
well x goes up to three sixty doesn't it
so if you're working in degrees you'd go zero degrees to three sixty degrees
mhm
right it would from minus infinity to plus
mm minus yeah
infinity you can measure in degrees or in UNK
mhm
doesn't matter
so x is an angle
yeah
right x is an angle and what's the UNK of the angle so if we look at it this way erm it's supposed to go through there through the origin
mhm
and that's the angle x have it in degrees if you like
mhm
and let's say it's erm this particular example we've chosen happens to be sixty degrees
and this is any point x y this is the y that's the x how would you find the UNK of x on that
well you could work it using x and y
let's get rid of this is this is where a lot of the confusion is
mhm
so let's get rid of some of it and let's make the angle UNK
mhm
okay and that's the x distance along there
yeah
and that's the y
so could you find cos UNK
erm now let me get m
write it down if you're not sure
it's going to back this really isn't it
the UNK is erm awkward
okay which is which is the easiest one of this lot to work out
we're trying to work out which
is the hypotenuse which is
the ninety degree angle
so the one opposite the ninety is the UNK
is the hypotenuse
right which is the next easiest one to work out
the adjacent
mm maybe okay loads of people find that the one opposite the angle we're interested in
mhm
is the that's the opposite
mhm
especially if you're using UNK for the angle looks a bit like UNK
so that's the opposite and this one is the adjacent
doesn't matter if you remember the adjacent first that's fine
if you can remember
mhm
it doesn't matter how you remember it
so adjacent over hypotenuse
adjacent is x the hypotenuse is root x squared plus y squared
right that's cos UNK
and we plot along here if we plot y against UNK
mhm
we plot this horrible lot against UNK and we get the usual UNK
yeah
nice little sine wave cos wave
mhm
it's a number sine or cos
yeah
it's a ratio of two lengths you can measure them in centimetres miles whatever you like but it'll
mhm
still come down to a ratio that has no units it's just a number
that's what cos is now what does that's cos x cos UNK cos
mhm
z whatever you like
yeah
what would cos squared z what does that mean
what's the notation in other words
it's that ratio
mm
squared
right
what's that
the ratio times itself
right what is the ratio
the ratio is cos z
mhm
that's the ratio
yeah
that's the ratio squared
mhm
same thing but
and that's what it means
now people start getting very involved with this cos squared and integrating it to being cos cubed
mhm
right there's nothing to do with that at all
we just have this weird notation that we write it like this and we say it like that cos squared z what we mean
mhm
is cos z squared
mhm
but if you say that especially when you say it quickly it's starting to sound a bit like cos z squared
mhm
right
which is a different thing again
which is nothing at all to do with that
yeah
it's not that
cos that'd just be you'd figure for z squared as opposed to the whole lot
right and then take the cos of it but this
yeah
is take the cos and then square the answer the answer you get
mhm
so part of trig functions are probably what give most people more trouble that anything else on differentiation and
mhm
integration
part of it is not really it it's being a bit out of touch with what you're doing
it doesn't sound real
it's a bit like if you like the difference between working with nice UNK nice numbers if i'm saying
mhm
what's erm eighteen times three yeah i can work that out i might
yeah
not know it immediately but if i say well what's x plus seven times y minus five or it's only the same it's exactly the same rules
mhm
as you'd use for your three times eighteen
yeah
but the concepts aren't familiar and you're starting to feel a little bit sort of not quite sure what you can do with them and what you can't
mhm
the numbers you've had them since you were about this big
yeah
you've grown up with them you know what you can do with numbers
mhm
you can play with them you're quite happy but these other strange objects you don't really know what the rules are
well they're all numbers they all follow the same rules
mhm
they all behave the same way
and then you move on to functions and they're UNK you're quite happy with y equals x squared three x squared plus two you think
yeah
i can do that no problem
then they start throwing in things like y plus cos x ooh and cos x cos squared x
you don't even know what it means
mhm
so if you're not happy with the basic objects that you're playing around with you you've immediately lost most of your confidence
mhm
you don't know what you're doing
you know that you don't know what you're doing
yeah
someone's telling you the answers and you're thinking well okay it must be right knows what he's doing he's a teacher right okay i'll put it down
but if you know what you're doing
mhm
then you can take it on you can start understanding you can start building up your knowledge base
like
mhm
putting things into little pigeon holes saying oh that's just like i did with that other problem
er i'd use that bit here
until you get that UNK then everything's a one off
every
mm
problem you do is er start right
mm
from scratch i don't know whether i'm allowed to do that i think i can possibly get away with this
erm so your confidence goes your speed at working through it goes you might find you're going back and doing it again when it was right then first time
mhm
so you need to know the objects you're dealing with then differentiate them then when you've differentiated them when you've differentiated them you can work back and you think ah i know how i got that
so let's look at now you've been doing i noticed today you'd been doing differentiating products
yeah
mhm
and you've done UNK as well presumably
yeah
yeah
now you said that if i gave you x cos squared three x it might be a bit easier to integrate
mm
why did you say that
it's correct
because what i saw there was that as a single function as a single function
mm
now i'm not entirely positive if i'm right but i think that would be easier to do because you could then alter that round to and then you'd have your three x as a separate thing
your times in there
yeah
what would you do then
x to the power of one
what would do then
er does that mean you've integrated
i'm about i'm UNK through it
you so you have done some part of the integration
yeah
ah no
now have you learnt the formula for integrating a product some people do
probably
oh i don't usually recommend it some people do and find it easier that way i would rather they just stuck with the formula for differentiating a product and
mhm
differentiating a UNK and then recognizing the picture
so that you can work backwards
let's go away from trig functions for a bit
mhm
okay we'll find out some general applications and then see if we can bring the trig functions back into them
mm
okay
so let's say three x to the power seventeen
mm that's a bit let's make it more awkward
right three x to the power seventeen plus x squared all to the power five
right
now could you differentiate that
what's your fir just tell me tell me i'm more interested in sort what you're thinking about it what you're feeling about it er what you're thinking of trying and not trying than the answer you get
so what are you thinking about that
that's what i'm thinking
okay
that can you understand where i'm going with that
oh i can understand what you why you're thinking that yeah
now that's the way that we've been shown to do
okay
things along those lines
so what would your an let's pick a simpler one and see what your answer is to this
erm okay we've got y equals that erm follow that one through and actually differentiate it
okay we'll make it even more less messy looking and have y equals
right
how would you do that
i'm trying to think of it handled the squared on the outside
mm
i'm thinking that it may be a function of a function
right good
it could possibly be that
i mean it definitely is isn't it
the way you test that is ooh this looks a bit awkward could i do ooh yeah i could that
mhm
i could do y equals x squared i could do y equals u squared
that's what i was about to head for
okay so
change u for four x
right so
u
in that one right
you carry on from there
that's great yeah that's excellent
okay on this one erm
mhm
now back to integration
mhm
if i gave you this to integrate something like four x cubed minus x two times four x cubed minus x times
mhm
twelve x squared
what sort of what would you to say about it
again it's a function of a function
okay so it was it was something you differentiated
mhm
and you treated it as a function of a function
and when you treated it as a function of a function you get that thing inside there was the function
mhm
and what's this what's this bit this twelve
mhm
x squared that it's multiplied by
that's another function
it's another of x
yeah that's a UNK it's a very particular tie up between that function and this one isn't there
which is what
it's basically that
right so the function you've got in brackets when you differentiate it
mhm
gives you this thing you're UNK i multiplying it by
mhm
so what we've got here is we've got the integral of some function of x
mhm
times f dash are you happy with f dash notation
yeah fine
times the differential of that function
as soon
mhm
as you see that you know it's
th this all integration is that's the answer what was the question
you think this is
yeah
where we finished up now where did we start from
well to finish up with something like that as you your first guess which is almost certainly correct on this one is well
mhm
that came from someone doing this sort of thing
yeah
okay
and so you could plough that straight back in
yeah right
so you'd say well we must have let let's say that i wasn't being that helpful
mhm
and i said would you integrate so it didn't stand out sort of too obviously four x cubed minus x times x squared
so oh sorry that should be minus one because i taking your word for this one here
yeah
erm that's a minus one
erm
oh of course yeah it's just the figures that disappear
that's right
er yeah i hadn't finished off this that's probably what the problem was
right that's better
okay
no i would've forgotten that anyway
okay so we'll let u be this thing that's raised to a power
mhm
u equals four x cubed minus x differentiate it with respect to x twelve x cubed minus four
mhm
so that gives us this and so if i said erm and that's a all right we'll leave that as twelve x squared minus one
put the twelve in there
write it out again
so if i said integrate four x cubed minus x
mhm
times erm twelve x squared minus one
look at that the UNK what's the UNK
that this has got some chance of being f dash
that times that is that
right
differentiate this
mhm
differentiate that so the big the first thing to go for is the power is one less and then
yeah
this looks a little bit suspicious where did
mhm
it come from ah three fours are twelve x to the three minus the power right oh and this one fits too very nicely
great so that that's f dash of x
so we started off with something like now we're not we haven't got there yet
mhm
but we've broken the back of it
yeah
we're just about there
what have we got here
let's try a four x cubed minus x and
mhm
differentiate it and what do we get
we get this
yeah
right so we differentiate four x cubed minus x we get how does it tie up with what we've got there
we get two times four x cubed minus x times twelve x squared minus one well that's a shame we should be getting we should get twice it
mm
so we didn't actually start off with this
mm
to finish up with that answer did we what
mm
did we start off with
if we'd have started off with this it would have given us twice what we got
yeah
so what must we have started out with
we started off with that one squared the whole lot squared
that was squared sorry that was
to make it the function of a function
that was squared yeah
sorry that was squared yeah so the differential of that would've given us twice er would have given us twice that
oh of course
but we didn't finish up with twice we
no
just finished up with four x cubed minus x times its differential so what must we have started off we differentiated something and it was very close to this very
mhm
similar
and this time it didn't give us two x it just gave us one times this one times that one
what what's missing from this let's look at it this way erm differentiate erm no let's go straight for the integral integrate four x squared
four x squared
yeah
that's erm
make it make it twelve x just to be awkward
twelve x
it's a little it's also being a bit helpful
okay so if we'd have started off i mean we can just take the constant straight out
mhm
right away
twelve times integral of x squared d x well if we'd have started off with x squared we'd could have we would have if we've started off with x cubed we would have finished up with three x cubed
mhm
so we only we only need to start off with a third of that
now if we'd have started off four x cubed minus x all squared we would have two times this lot but we didn't we just got once this so we must have started off this is only a coefficient only a factor
yeah
what must we have started off with here to finish up with that
it's very s it's similar
i'm just working back
same sort of thing that we were doing here
if i'd have said integrate x cubed
mhm
you'd think well he must have integrate x squared
you'd say well he must have started off with x cubed
with x cubed
that would have given three x squared well that's
mhm
no good it's three times too much so he must have started off with x cubed over three and that would've given us one third of three x squared
so here it's something very like that i finished up with i've if i'd started off with that i would have finished up with twice what
mhm
i've actually got here
now the other thing about an integral really when it boils down to it it's only a number or a function or a sine or a cos it comes down to you these are just numbers you're playing with erm
you'd have to take that from a half
you'd have to take a half of it
mm
okay
take a half of it
so if we only had started off with a half of it
mm you'd end up with that
what would we get
we've got y equals a half of this thing four x cubed minus x squared then d y by d x would come to a half of two times
four x cubed minus
no it's not it's x times
times
its differential
mhm
right so this is what some one gave us
mhm
they didn't express it as a half of twice they just cancelled it through
yeah they just cancelled it down
once and we said ah well we can see the sort of thing we should be working it sh
yeah
it should've been something like this
mhm
it should have been that thing squared and now we then having worked it out that far
right we must have had four x cubed minus x in brackets
yeah
all that squared i don't know i don't know what the coefficient was i don't really
mhm
care because i'm going to differentiate it now because differentiating is a lot easier than integrating
so i'll differentiate it find out what that gives oh well that gives twice it well i don't want twice it so i'll
mhm
start off with half of it
if this had given eighteen times it then you would have started off with one eighteenth
whatever it was
er are you fairly happy with that
yeah i said that was going
we'll now we'll now have a we'll do one more of those and then we'll apply it to the wonderful cos sine and sec squared
and all sorts of wonderful things like that
i'll just go and make that coffee
that sounds like an excellent idea
how many UNK
no sugar no sugar thanks
okey doke
so how are you getting on with the rest of your course
erm
can i just look through this
yeah go on
thanks
erm i did first science exam a little while ago
yeah
erm that went about as well as the first maths one
but i have done a maths erm another science exam sorry
yeah
about a week ago and from the looks of things i've passed it quite successfully
good
so i've picked up on one
right
erm
so how many subjects have you got
about nine
about nine okay and they're all spread out little bits various levels and
yeah that's
okay
which one do you feel most happy with most confident
erm anything except the maths and science
okay
to be perfectly honest with you because they're the UNK ones
well what are the what are the others then that you're doing that you're happy with
just take a look got me little list knocking round
it's just the technology and things really it's erm dealing with cars electrical studies er it's
how
there we are
okay
there's me timetable it's got the different subjects on it
right which campus are you on
er
right
down by UNK
right i know it well
okay erm projects science right now what's your what are you doing on your science
thanks very much
erm science at the moment we've just covered erm things like UNK momentum erm it just tends to be stuff like that we've done simple harmonic motion er
mm are you happy with that
oh yeah no problems at all with it
good
sailed through that
excellent cos that's you know that's quite a lot of maths in that and you get these UNK and UNK and UNK t UNK t and
that's it this is it it's something that's unusual because with stuff like i'll i can see what i'm aiming for
right
and so i'm bi i'm a no problems with it at all
good erm just about everyone UNK things practically
mm
it's not you can't just have an abstract theory that's not tied
yeah
into anything it must come from something
i don't know if you saw a programme a while ago about carbon sixty a new form of carbon that some UNK in america discovered
i s i heard something about somebody was talking to me about it a little while ago
i can't remember what it was like
well three sort of top UNK in america they
mhm
they made this big discovery they all went back to their hotel rooms
mhm
the next morning when they got together everyone had got a model
mm
one had made one UNK bits of straw together another one had used something else but they'd
mhm
all got a physical model
yeah
so they were playing with each others models no that bit has to go there
mm
because of this and that would UNK they were making it real concrete something
mhm
you can pick up play with like a bit of UNK
yeah
erm and then you understand
if i say erm you know can i can i have a look at your pen it usually
mhm
means pick it and feel the weight of it and
yeah
see how it works
not give me a an abstract technical description of it
yeah
or have a quick glance but getting to understand it
now you're obviously i mean most people are but you can obviously understand better think better if they're more practical
very much so
everyone can
mhm
everyone is like no matter how sort of academic they pretend to be
yeah
they always understand things much better if it's something concrete so if you've got simple harmonic motion and you can relate it to something physical
mm
you're with it
so how are we going to relate this differentiation and integration to something physical
erm let's go back to differentiation what does is mean why the why the big deal you know why do we make such a fuss about hey wouldn't it be nice to integrate things
mhm
why
you know why do we go to this trouble
we need to integrate to find out the gradient at a certain point
to
on a curve
differentiate yeah
well that's to
to find the gradient
yeah
we differentiate to find the gradient
mhm
we integrate
we integrate from the gradient
we yeah integrate for other reasons like you're doing moment of UNK and
mhm
things like that
erm we're finding basically area under a curve or volume of revolution
yeah
integrating but as you say differentiate find the gradient
mhm
how steep is that hill
i don't know what hill do you know perhaps you know erm road or something like that how
yeah i know where you mean
how steep is that hill
well it's erm one in fifty
mhm
what does that mean
well for every for every fifty you go along UNK
yeah you go one up
you go up one
er that's one way of expressing its
mhm
gradient
another way would be to tell me what the angle is from
mhm
the horizontal
and you'd find that the tan of that angle
mhm
is the other way of expressing the gradient
up so many along so many
yeah
yeah
so that's what gradient is erm that's thinking of something very solid like a hill
mhm
how does rate of change d y by d x or d s by d t
mhm
tie up with things like velocity
well yo you still getting a ratio you're getting a ratio of distance and erm time
okay so in a in a fixed time
you go so far
you go so far
if you're going further in a set over a set
mhm
time then you're going faster
you're going faster
if you're not going as far you're going slower and then you take that up a level all right
mhm
a level of e UNK if you like your gradient you've got so you you're very happy with this yeah
yeah
so that's time going along there
mhm
and that's distance
that's distance
there or it's displacement
and as time goes on you find he's gone further and further away
mhm
and it's a nice straight line so the gradient is constant
the gradient
mhm
the d s by d t
mhm
the velocity is constant
mhm
then that sort of makes sense you know
yeah
that's practical and you can you can get your head round it
mhm
then they take it sort of up a level
yeah
if you like there's time going along there
now what we're plotting up here is d s by d t well we don't call it that it's a bit confusing call it velocity
we're plotting velocity
mhm
up there and we've got say another straight line here erm this is a straight line which means that d v by d t is how is velocity changing if constant
yeah
okay erm now you you've used to the equations of motion for a constant acceleration are you
erm
v squared equals u squared plus two a s and
we've come across them yeah
you've come across them okay
you can derive all those
mhm
starting from the acceleration
UNK a constant
yeah
integrate it gives you the velocity
integrate it again it gives you the distance you integrate with respect to time
mhm
each time you do it
so this is why we get interested in differentiation
erm
i've done stuff like this actually i remember doing exactly them sort of questions
right so the more you can spot the tie up and say well this isn't something i'm going to take this off
this isn't something totally artificial
yeah
it has got a real purpose and it does tie up very well with erm velocity and
here we are there it is
doing velocity is a certain time
mhm
velocity at time zero acceleration at a
mhm
certain time
acceleration at
mhm
time zero
right
okay
so i've covered bits and pieces like that
so how about you you've just had have a quick glance at that
mhm
okay
so if i put something like this erm okay
mhm
could you could you give me an expression for if that's the acceleration
mhm
okay
the velocity would be what
your velocity would now be d s by d t
right and your distance would just be
s
mhm
right i don't know what i don't know i didn't have the function a formula
yeah
to let me work this out what the distance was as time went on
and i didn't have a formula to work out what the velocity was all i did ha know was the acceleration was a constant
yeah
derive these equations by what trick
well the easiest way would be to integrate that
right okay so there we are a horrible looking thing to integrate
yeah
k some constant where do i start here
well talk about it
right
well it's a constant value and i know that it's to the power of one
whoa hang on hang on hang on hang on right think about what you just said it's a constant
mm
right now i'm asking you to integrate it which is work backwards
the answer was a constant now what did i differentiate
think in terms of x if you like
the answer was a constant what did i differentiate
it'd need to be something like k x
k x right okay
so right k x something like k x
now is it only k x that could have given me that
if i differentiate k x i'll get k
mhm
what about if i had k x plus three
that'd do
mhm so
that'd be the same
right so is erm y or that's the velocity
mhm
right velocity up there and t along here
we're integrating with respect to t so it's going to be k it's not going to be k x it's k
k t
right okay so if we differentiate k t with respect to t we get k
mhm
if we differentiated so there's velocity equals k t it's supposed to be
yeah
velocity equals k t plus
plus something yeah
velocity equals k t minus four
it makes no odds because the UNK still the same
so plus any constant
yeah
okay
right well that's found the velocity now can you find the distance
what would you do to find the distance
the same again
okay integrate again
now this is where it gets interesting
erm
don't forget when they're added when they're added you can do them one bit at a time
mm
now if they're multiplied or divided then you can't say oh well i'll just take this bit and do that and then i'll come back for the other one
you've got to take the whole lot as a unit
and you do something pretty clever with it usually but if they're just added one bit at a time
well how did how did you manage to get a c you had something here and you differentiated it
it'd need to be like c x
so and you were working the variable we were working with is not x but t
not t so
okay so that's c t
now don't forget as we did here it's not just
mhm
c t that could give us c t plus any other form of constant
erm
n
n okay right so that's sorted that bit out now where did we get a k t from
it was that
okay but we're working up from
you
this way we started i started here i wrote in here s equals some function of t
mhm
right
and differentiated it and it gave me k t well forget about the k it's only a number it's only
mhm
a constant
i had something here i differentiated it and it gave me t so what was it
another number
er let's go back to there
hang on erm
let's g let's go to the UNK
let me think
let's take these two out to the UNK and just look at that bit there
i had something we'll forget about that
mhm
cos we've done that sorted
yeah
that out
i had y equals something don't know what we had
mhm
and i differentiated it and it gave me d y by d x equals x
okay so what did i have here so that when i differentiated i got x
you'd need you need to have that to the power of something
yep okay and what power
erm one
try this one i had y equals something
mhm
and i brought it this way round the normal way that we go
mm
and i found d y by d x and i found that it came to erm x squared
mhm
what did i start with there so that when i differentiated it i got x squared
a third x cubed
right okay if it was x cubed that would have given me three times too much
mhm
so it must have been a third x cubed
third
brilliant okay now here i started off with something i don't know what it was but i know that when i differentiated it i finished up with x
ah now
so what did i start with
right to do that mm
you've just done it for there
yeah
instantly right away bang you did that
now is it throwing you because this is an x and it doesn't look like
it doesn't have a power at all
it is x to the one
power of one
okay
so what did i start with
half x squared
right
okay
mhm
half x squared
so if i started off with a half x squared and i differentiated it i would get two times a half times x
a half it UNK
UNK out just x
right we're not working with x
we're working with t
i have something and i differ forget about the k cos it's only a like a three times or a fives times
mhm
it's only a coefficient we can adjust that later
i had some function of t and i finished up with t what did i start with
ah now i see how it's tying in
right
yeah that's exactly the same as what you're i was trying to do before so it'd be the equivalent of that
right which would be
yeah i see how that's going now
okay
mhm
so i finished up with t to the one what did i start up with
you started off with say half
t squared
t squared yeah
so it's k times a half t squared
mhm
right so we've got our equation now s is equal to a half some constant let's call it g
mhm
t squared plus c t plus some other constant erm say c one t plus c two
you recognize that from your equations of motion
now we got there just by starting off from d two s d t squared equals k
mm
so it's a very UNK if someone said to you come up er okay this you put initial values in
mhm
erm to make some of these terms disappear if you like to make
yeah
some of your UNK go but your important thing that comes out is this
is the
half g t half g t squared plus some constant times time normally your the g will be a negative half a t squared but someone had said come up with that equation and you've said well what are you going to give me to go on well the UNK constant
and they've given me that
you say oh yeah so what that doesn't help at all
yeah
and it doesn't without integration you just
mhm
you just give up
yeah
as people have UNK have done for centuries
they've said well i can't make head or tail of it
mhm
so how did you feel when you first did fractions
can you remember
oh god that's going back a bit
mhm but how did you feel
erm confused as hell until somebody told me about having a pie
right until you eventually
you're cutting it up into bits
right until you eventually got something physical to relate it to
yeah
how did you feel about negative numbers when you first met them can't remember
i wasn't too bad with them as far as i can remember i was fairly okay
have a look have a look see how many cars are outside
minus fifteen
yeah
definitely yes i agree with you
no i remember from what i can remember anyway when i first started using negative numbers it was on a graph
mm really that's
started off with a graph
if it's if it's below the table we'll say it's minus two centimetres you know
yeah
if it's below sea level we'll just say that if it's you owe me rather i owe you
mhm
it's below zero on a it it's just a little trick there's no such thing as minus three
it's just another way of putting it that's all
it's it just means we go like we got mixed up with our zero and we should have started lower down but we're not going to change it now
mm
that's what minus three means it does it's not real
what about erm the square root of minus one then
the square root of minus one oh god
some number you multiply it by itself and it comes to minus one
have you done complex numbers
erm probably somewhere along the road
right
erm
so when you first mean these things they're weird
mm
erm now professional UNK people who did nothing but that the whole the community used to bring them
mhm
their food and support them they say around all day having very weird discussions about
mhm
sort of funny little numbers
they spent thousands of years before they could understand fractions
mhm
or negative numbers
yeah
right just fractions or negative numbers forget about integration
mhm
integrating cos squared just to get to that stage they had thousands of years they were full time professionals did nothing else but it
you are expected you know
yeah
you're given about four or five years to play with one and one makes two yes he's doing
mhm
very well he can count to twenty
all of a sudden in the next couple of years you've got to go through thousands of years of evolution
that UNK had a very hard time and they got a lot of things wrong they went off down the wrong track for hundreds of years before
mhm
people put them right
so it's not obvious and it's not natural unless as you said fractions cut up your pie
yeah
right then you know where you are i always i always have a pie with me just in case i get hungry
because there are so many people who have trouble with fractions
mhm
adults particularly they're alright with a quarter and a half but after that you know
after that it gets confusing yeah
so relate it to something like that and it's real now if we can relate this to something that you are happy with and you understand it will become real for you
mhm
and you'll know what you're doing
at the moment there's so much new stuff being shoved in
if i'm
mm
explaining this to you in chinese you know you don't understand the words
no
i'm using
if i'm explaining it to you in terms of cos squared and idea what cos squared is i'll have a guess then it's not explaining
mhm
you're getting you know
confused terms even more confused
explaining it in terms of something you don't understand
yeah
you know if for example you didn't understand anything about engines
mhm
and erm someone was trying to explain simple harmonic motion they start UNK going up and down inside an engine and you think well what what's a what's a UNK
that's exactly what we done
what's an engine
and if you don't know that
yeah
well it's just useless trying to
you've had it yeah
explain it like that okay
mhm
so it's trying to get this tied down and get its limits clearly defined so you know what you're talking you know exactly
yeah
what you're talking about
erm somebody comes in some UNK comes in to your garage and he's telling
mhm
you about erm well of course erm i've got this diesel car and it's exactly the same principle as a petrol engine and i just put petrol in it
erm
i have a fit yeah
hang on hang on now if you're talking to a UNK and you're sort of saying cos squared is well erm you know if i integrate that ah i'm going to get cos so if erm well i'll just change that there and i'll fiddle
mm
fiddle i'll just have a bit of a fiddle well perhaps i'll try running it on lead free petrol and see if that
yeah
works better
erm it's similar yes i mean
mm
there is a there are more similarities between a petrol engine and a diesel engine than there are differences really
yeah there are very true
a lot of similarities but
mhm
if you try and treat one as the other you're gonna come very UNK
it doesn't yeah
yeah erm like say mixing up your low tension and your high tension circuit with your UNK erm so
or electricity isn't it you know
not going to make a lot of difference surely
erm more similarities than differences but the
mhm
differences are important enough to make
yeah
th make it
make it a definite similarity
totally UNK if you start trying to treat one as the other and this is
mhm
why you know okay you're happy with cars you're happy
mm
with mechanics with UNK and you wouldn't dream of trying to say well these two are the same
yeah
so you've got to learn now when you can use the similarities and
mhm
when you have to watch out for the differences
yeah
this sort of stuff because that's where most of the UNK are what happens to everyone who tries fractions
what's a half plus a third that's no problem add the top two add the bottom it's going to be two fifths it's obvious isn't it
well okay it might be obvious but it doesn't give you the right answer
so
yeah
i mean it's obvious that you can put petrol in a diesel engine and diesel in a petrol engine
mm
it might be obvious it might
won't do you any good like but
it might be obvious but it's not a good idea
yeah
so it's find out what works and what doesn't so that's integration at work if you like why it's useful you've just done simple harmonic motion
mhm
right now this time i'm not telling you that the acceleration for some we won't bother writing it like that right we'll write it this way
d two s d t squared
mhm
right is equal to minus k x
minus k is it minus k x
mhm
so acceleration is always working the opposite way to whichever way you're measuring x and trying to pull it back
that's it
yeah mhm
i'm with you
okay that's your equation for simple harmonic motion
mm
now have you seen it like that
never
oh
i have never seen it like that
well that's erm have you heard a UNK a definition of simple harmonic motion
give me a definition if you can remember one
i couldn't
if you've got a book handy or notes handy it'd be worth looking it up
erm see if i can remember what on earth i did with the damn thing
don't worry don't worry if you can't
i think it's in here
i'm interested in you doing more of the work than me if we can
i'm with you
i'm trying to remember where on earth it was
i know for certain it's in here somewhere
mhm
erm
don't
now we're close here
oh good
there's another UNK thing about any course but particularly this one where there's sort of lots of subjects and a bit of overlap it is difficult to get a good system for organizing your notes but it is essential
okay well
er basically this one UNK
what about this bit right at the start
mhm
just read that bit
it's it moves
acceleration is always
it moves with s h m when
its acceleration is directed towards a fixed point in its path
yeah
and is proportional to its distance from this point
okay that's it
mhm
that's the definition of s h m
mhm
that's another way of writing it
acceleration right
yeah
is proportional to equals k
mhm
the distance from a point
mhm
and always works the opposite way
mm
okay so just from that definition of simple harmonic motion we've got acceleration equal to minus k x
yeah
d two s d t squared equals minus k x
now it's your turn
what are we going to do with that
oh i'm not interested in its acceleration i want to find out its speed
its velocity at any point in time
so what do we do
okay
need to take that down to d
right
d s by d t
yeah
right then
now i differentiated something forget about the k you can
mhm
put the k down right away so we'll keep that there
now we're only bothered about the x
i differentiated something and i finished up with x what did i start from
what would you differentiate that would give you x
erm x squared
okay but that will give us too much
so half x squared
right so k times a half times x squared
right that's the velocity at any point
now s
okay now the other thing is
c
right good
there's a whole family of equations that could have been differentiated to give that we don't know what c is
but we always fiddle the c by choosing suitable starting conditions suitable initial conditions okay
right then what i'll do is i'll split it up again
make life easier
the same as the other before
mm
leaves me with this
okay and your half k you can leave your half k out
you keep that sort of to one side
wouldn't that need to be to the power of x
er not to the power of x sorry erm times x
er don't quite follow well i don't i don't see why you want it to be
i'm trying to see where
okay let's have a look at this
we've got let's take let's take the minus k out completely
mhm
we can the constant is no problem we can always if we've got ten times it five times it minus point six times it
mhm
no problem we just multiply that one or divide
mhm
okay
so the problem we've got here is that we've x squared d y by d x equals x squared so somewhere up here we had y equals what
and we differentiated it and we got d y by d x is x squared
so what did we start with
no
x
we er okay
mm
now there's another big thing that comes into it integration involves
mhm
flipping backwards and forwards
mhm
between differentiating and integrating and erm integrating and differentiating and it's ver one of the most common UNK is to forget which way you're going
mm
instead of going there and back sort of go back and back again
yeah
or sort of there and further on
so what are we doing right this is why it's a good UNK to draw a line down the side and think well i'll just play about over here till i
mhm
know what i want and then i'll come back to what i was doing
so here trying to find out what happens who did who differentiated what sort of thing to get this x squared
mhm
well what happened
someone had something some function of x here they differentiated it and it gave them x squared no what did they differentiate
a third x cubed
right so they had a third x cubed or x cubed over three
x cubed over three yeah
a third x cubed might be a nicer way to write cos we can keep all our UNK together
so it was the minus k times the half times
a third x cubed
a third and then the x cubed
mhm
and these are just sort of UNK up together well they can all be if we choose it right we can make it usually make it one
make it one figure yeah
with a bit of with a bit of UNK
erm okay it doesn't look like anything like what you've got here
mhm
because you're doing it in a very different coordinate system which is
mhm
a UNK way to do it because we want this sine UNK t
erm we want the tie up we want this two pi what is how does two pi come into it
two pi
yeah
that's erm
how do you get how do you get two pi into it
changing degrees to UNK is all
right
yeah basically
okay right
not its
UNK
or even yeah UNK no
in UNK basically
yeah UNK to UNK
erm degrees don't come into it
they're a very artificial unit very handy
mm
they're very artificial whereas a UNK is a more natural unit
yeah
but it keeps bringing this two pi in because two pi is the ratio of all the way round to straight across
yeah i know
it keeps coming in
okay erm does that help to show what integration is about what you're doing
it does because i've only ever done that by differentiating from s
right
and i've got to there and then to there and
mm
and that's it basically that's the
okay
way i've ever known it so it is
so if you think of those three stages then
mhm
i mean there is erm we've s we've stopped there let's go working from this way s is that that's that that's that
mhm
acceleration is that
mhm
okay er acceleration equals k x what's the rate of change of acceleration
if we differentiate acceleration with respect to time
to time yeah
what do we get when you differentiate that
ooh erm
could you differentiate three x
yeah
what would you get
erm three x to the power of one
uh okay go on
now three
right
so could you differentiate minus k x the coefficient is not three this time it's minus k
x it's minus k
so it's just the minus k
minus k
so what's how is the acceleration changing with respect to time how's the acceleration changing as time goes on
it's the same as the constant
it's a constant and it's negative
oh what do you mean what do you mean it's a negative
well you're measuring it in the opposite direction to the way you're measuring x
mhm
so if we're going over that way
mhm
the acceleration is always negative which means s
it's being measured as a UNK
the opposite way and it's k it's sort of the rate at which the UNK
it's a constant UNK
the rate of change of acceleration is a constant
in other words the acceleration itself is not changing
mhm
so you keep you could keep on going until you got a constant and then
now i don't know if you think this has been useful
yeah
but until it's the same with any subject you know until you know what you're doing until you can tie it down to something physical and until you can understand i mean you always understand by similarities
mhm
and then you UNK and then you UNK it and you concentrate on the differences
i mean it is good to see the similarities between petrol and diesel first
mhm
they're both engines you stick em in a
yeah
car it'll do either one of them i don't care whether you've got a diesel engine or a petrol engine as long as it'll get me from a to b
mhm
okay yeah and then you start concentrating on the differences
you have got one of these don't put the wrong type of stuff in
erm that's the way everyone's brain works no matter how they think it does
mhm
a very young kid goes out for a walk with his parents he's only ever seen cats and dogs before they go
mhm
out and they see the big this big cow in a field he says ooh
mhm
look at that big dog
yeah
and the parent says yes that's right yeah
i mean that's all he knows cat
mhm
and dog
well it's he's being very intelligent cos it's much too big to be a cat
yeah
and the only big things you get are dogs
mm
well it's a funny looking dog with horns on
mm
oh yeah a funny looking dog with horns on like that and others and everything standing in the middle of the field you call those funny sort of dogs cows
mm
we have a separate category for them
mhm
but that is the way you learn by UNK over
yeah
UNK
now if you
get the basics the rest will follow through
can understand that you can do the rest on your own
mhm
you can do it because as you read through your notes as someone's talking to you in the lecture you will be saying yeah of course of course
mm
rather than what the hell is he talking about
that's the yeah
and you'll be and you'd be thinking ah i can see where he's going now yeah i can see what's coming up next he's going to now he's integrated once
mhm
he's going to go integrate again he's going to find out what you know if you're working one way he's going to find out what the distance is
mhm
erm or he's going to find out what the acceleration is
tying it up to something real
now UNK and UNK
yeah
UNK t doesn't matter it's all the same thing
mhm
the maths that you do ties up in some way with usually ties up with reality there's some reason for it
they
yeah
don't always tell you at the time they just say
learn that
yeah
learn that
erm why would i need to use the square root of minus one
well it's brilliant at solving problems in electrical theory
mm
erm what is it
oh don't know any more than we know what minus one is how
mhm
find the square root of minus one we don't even understand minus one
yeah
so we just say it's it does something
mhm
it's an operator that say
it's you use it
UNK a UNK so that it's pointing in completely the opposite
mhm
well in minus one points a UNK in completely
yeah
the opposite way
mhm
now the square root of minus one UNK it to ninety degrees
ninety degrees
and again UNK it through another so square root of minus one times the square root of minus one is the same effect as multiplying by minus one
mhm
it's a trick but it helps it took all the
i never though of that one
UNK a long time but it does help
erm you don't have to exactly understand the tools that you're using and how they work but
mhm
you do have to understand their limitations
how to use them
right you
mhm
don't you might not know what happens when you press the UNK on
mm
a car
yeah
you might not know what happens when you UNK this stick about and press your left foot up and down
mhm
but if don't do it properly
yeah
you know you finish up with a UNK
a UNK or what's more likely to happen on this sort of thing
mhm
you're too scared about changing gear so you go all the way from here to glasgow in first
yeah
right when you could be going up and down the UNK and using whatever is appropriate
mhm
for what you're doing or you might even find that it's been left in reverse and you go all the way from here to glasgow in reverse
mm
or in fact you go to london because it happens to be in reverse
and it's not really the way you want to go in go but it's carrying you that way instead of you
mhm
in control
so it's getting in control of this you can only control it if you understand it
mhm
right when you know what the terms are what people are talking about what they mean when they say petrol engine or a diesel engine
yeah
they're all the same aren't they engines you know
i've heard that one many times
yeah
yeah so when people are saying well simple harmonic motion or erm you know throwing a stone up and down that sort of thing roughly isn't it sort of one of them goes up and down a lot like that one of them just goes up once and down same equation
it's not
as it happens
it would be nice if it would be nice if
it'd be easier if it was
as you say if there was just one equation that covered all UNK
so definition of simple harmonic motion you find anything that's moving so that the acceleration is always measured the opposite way to
mhm
the way you're measuring the distance and is proportional to that distance
mhm
you've got simple harmonic motion
erm you'll find this on exam questions show that the resulting motion is simple harmonic motion
mhm
erm for example if we ha if i gave you that equation
yeah
right and said erm a UNK moves so that its displacement is given by this function of t
mhm
they would they those x UNK there'd be
would be t squared watch that by the way because i did say that's d s by d t
yeah
and these tend to come in so i put them in there
right so everywhere there's an x there it should be t's
yeah
erm
it's cos i'm used to er using d y by d x now
so if i gave you that and said show that is simple harmonic motion
mhm
differentiate it
try and work it back to that
no well
well work it forward to the
for work it forward this is the easy way when they
yeah
say they give you something and it'll be UNK looking you know er
mhm
it won't be nice and simple like this it's when they give you the simple one and say integrate it that it's hard
when they give you the horrible one which is the answer
mhm
and say now what was the question erm
then you can just chop them off as they become UNK
yeah
so you look at that and you say okay differentiate it once to get the v differentiate it again to get acceleration and it'll come to minus k x
so it comes to minus k x and you say as the acceleration is proportional to x but in the opposite direction
mhm
erm we've got simple harmonic motion because that's the definition of it
now you might be give all sorts of UNK and you'll be given working with UNK and UNK which is where we came in
yeah
right
mhm
erm now if i'd given you the same thing and you'd
mhm
had sine squared and cos squared
mhm
are you with you wouldn't have been so happy with it would you
no not at all
but it would have been exactly the same problem simple harmonic motion
mhm
looking at it from a different point of view and measuring different things
so going back to where we came in
you're not rushing off anywhere are you
no
it wasn't in there i'll scribble that out
looking at cos erm i tend to use a lot of paper particularly if it's yours it's usually my own but never mind
so yes you can what i want you to do with these is look through them
mhm
some of them you might just ignore and say oh i'm not bothered about that others
yeah
you might think ah there was a good point now put it down in your own words don't copy
mhm
what i wrote or the example that i worked out or even the way you did it yourself here
mhm
try to UNK it as though you were explaining it to someone who doesn't understand quite as much as you
mhm
okay someone else in your own class say who's got a fair idea about what's going on but
mm
doesn't quite understand it as well as you do and you're trying to explain it to him
mhm
because you'll understand it fairly well at the moment but when you come to read your notes
yeah it's a different thing
what on earth was i talking about here
i obviously understood this very well and i had all sorts of
mhm
funny UNK and lots of and so obviously
yeah
seem obvious a month later when you when you've
mhm
UNK half the stages or you know how do you feel when he's working on the board and he UNK several lines
yeah
and you're thinking how did he get from there and by the time you've worked out how he got from there to there you've
mhm
missed where he's going to
yeah that happens
erm
quite often
yeah so the big thing about this is getting up to date getting yourself understanding the terms when he says cos squared when he says simple UNK when he says s h m you think yeah
simple harmonic motion straight away
i know what that means it means if you get ten times further away you've got ten times the acceleration but it's pulling back in towards
mhm
the centre
it's pulling it against the direction we're measuring s
mhm
or x or anything else we might have to call it
so if we if i gave you this to integrate erm what do you think of that
apart from how kind he is to me giving me something so easy
two words pop into me head and they're oh hell
erm right okay well the first thing i'd do is handle that one
what does that look like
that would be sine three x squared
right but don't forget to put your brackets on it's not sort of sine of nine x squared it's
yeah
it's that
mm all squared
okay
yeah
so there's all sorts of things this could be and that's the one it is
mhm
it's find the sine of three x and then square your answer
square the lot
right okay so it's that times
times cos three x
cos of three x
okay
right then
now where did that come from
what was i differentiating to finish up with that weird looking thing
have you spotted anything
it's a function of a function again
right that's what it is it's raised to some power
mhm
right sine three x differentiated
cos three x
right
it might not actually be exactly cos three x erm
it might be plus erm
it's more likely to be times
right so now we've got something to start on okay
okay
we've got a we've got this is what integrating is about
mhm
look at it what on earth have we got here what a horrible mess
now what
mhm
could we have possibly started out with not to give us exactly this cos it's too it's too much to find
mhm
exactly this
but to give us something along these lines
so we might have started out with something like y equals sine three x squared
mhm
right okay so if you'd like to differentiate that see what it gives
now you're doing all this in your head
mm
mm
mm
okay well soon i will be asking you to do them in your head but
yeah
to start with erm same as any job you do UNK an engine whatever you like when you first do it you go through very slowly one bit at a time to make sure you're doing everything right and then
mhm
you build up a pattern then you build up a rhythm and eventually you know do it
yeah
as you're talking to someone
so let's do that's good so you've got a three in it three cos cubed x
that's not quite d y by d x yet is it
mm no
so let's take it through erm the way we would do that okay
y equals that
mhm
can't do that
mhm
that's it
yeah
i cannot i cannot do i cannot differentiate that i'll tell you what i could do i'd have no problem at all if you gave me something y equals u squared no problem
mm
so i'm going to fix it so that's the that's what i do cos i'm just going to say let y equal u
mhm
so okay what's or hang on
u equals
right
sine
that's it
three x
sine three x
so what can you find from that
yeah that's correct
am i on the right line there
you definitely are on along the right lines
now i can never remember whether you need to put the minus in or not
well erm i haven't got a definite way a sort of little trick for remembering that erm but the big thing to remember is s before you just put it in no matter how sure you are stop and think now am i differentiating or integrating
mhm
because one way it's one way round the other way it's the other
it's the other way around
which is the one that you're sort of that you came across first of all the trig functions
erm sine
sine and then cos
mhm
differentiate sine you get cos
right
okay they're the straightforward ones if you do it the other way round if you differentiate cos you'll get minus sine
minus sine
and if you're integrating it will be the other way round
so there's quite a lot of things to think of and the
yeah
best way is to just thick of one of them
mhm
and get that solid
yeah
and use that as a reference so you can work out the others from it instead of trying to remember the lot
cos you've got
yeah
so many things to remember in all subjects not just in maths
mhm
that you need some sort of anchor points that you think
yeah
right i know that's okay so i can build on that
mhm
so you've worked out d u by d x right and what do you get from here
you can differentiate that with respect to
d y by d u
okay
right
hang on you're differentiating
you're differentiating
mm
not integrating
you're not
oh
right and as i said this is this is so
yeah
easy to do
mm
because of that it's a very common UNK
so y equals x squared you differentiate that two x okay
mm yeah
and it's always the dead easy ones like y equals x where people think it's too easy too
yeah
differentiate and get one so they integrate and get a half x squared
you integrate it to get the difficult one
yeah
right now what about this one here let's have a little look at this
we've got u equals sine three x
mhm
anyone ever shown you how to in how to differentiate sine of three x can't do that
i could do
erm
sine x but not sine of three x
oh hang on a minute now i'm
mm
there's something in the back of me mind which is saying there should be a figure there
right okay
well i can't do that i'm afraid
mm
tell you what i could do if i had something like u equals sine t or if
mhm
you don't like t i can d what other letter would you like z okay
mm
u equals sine z i could
yeah
do that
that's be d u by d z
mhm
would be now differentiate sine you get a cos okay
mhm
integrating a sine you get a minus cos so cos z okay
mhm
where z equals three x and d z
mhm
by d x is what
erm
if z equals three x so if i differentiate that with respect to x what do i get
differentiate three x with respect to x
you get erm i'm getting UNK up now
yeah you're getting you're getting UNK at the moment you've
mhm
had a lot of stuff thrown at you in one go
erm y equals five x UNK d y by d x
right
draw a picture y equals five x differentiate think of some UNK
erm
y equals five x if x equals two what would y be
y would be ten
y equals five x the gradient
equals five
mhm
okay it's the easy ones that go
yeah
and the big thing that happens is you suddenly in the middle of differentiating start integrating or in the middle of an integrating start differentiating or you start doing taking you've had enough of this so you start doing little short cuts like erm differentiating sine three x just as if it was sine x
mhm
which it's not
to just three
yeah
so this one come to so the d y the d u by d x that we're looking for here
mhm
mhm
by a function of a function of a function
mm good
for a while i was in the air force and then i lived in various parts of the country
but coming back to live in like to call it er in nineteen seventy five
and i know perfectly well that there's no way that er i could get my wife to move out of the town she loves it
and so indeed do i
anyhow er this evening very happy to provide a few pictures for you to have a look at and hopefully with a bit of information
if there's anything you want to er to ask me about please don't hesitate to er to UNK in at any time
erm can you all reasonably see what er what's going on
right this is er merely a map erm where we're dealing with er local people
it's er it's not so necessary probably er as where at times i've given talks in various parts of the country on this area
er but erm this gives an idea of the railway lines that er well basically were in this area erm i suppose er still round about nineteen fifty sixty time
some of them had er already gone
but that's er basically what was around
and of course er the nottingham lincoln y lincoln line here
the er main east coast main line over here
the er mass of lines in the nottingham area and so on
and that is a real subject in itself and i think you've probably had john talking to you
have you not
er john's erm quite a UNK on that one
erm anyhow this evening i'm proposing to just merely cover this particular area particularly
erm and then just coming along here and er as far as and just coming back to there
erm let's have a look and see what we can we've got
erm well as many of you know the first one of the first things that you see if you're c approaching the town from the a six one two from er
or from er is that building which is the old crossing UNK house or cottage
erm it has been altered somewhat since the original er railway days but nevertheless it UNK quite a bit of the old character erm and er the high pitched roofs erm and the
interestingly of different styles on that
it's not such an attractive house as the station master's house but nevertheless er it is one of only two railway buildings now left er in this town
and of course as many of you will know the railway line er used to run just in front here
there's another picture of it as one er goes past on the road
and again
very UNK pitched roof
now if you want to go and have a look at the other oth the oth other building at er railway er the railway erm going down road er again a UNK to that one time this er town did have er a railway er is of course the arms
i think that's they've altered that they've put a porch over there haven't they since er i took that one
er but er that was very much the local er in victorian times
er for the er the station
there again erm i think there's still on the windows here there's still reference to one of the coal merchants i think isn't there
have a look anyhow
erm looking across from the arms one can see that what i can only describe as a delightful bit of architecture erm perhaps i'm a little bit er of a UNK but er i think it's one of the UNK most attractive buildings in the town
erm you know i like UNK and i like a lot of other architecture but that i think has got tremendous character
er and of course was the old station master's er house
the erm well let's see again the UNK pitched roof the er the UNK er the barge boards the UNK er and the er UNK fencing which was characteristic of the railway er post about nineteen o seven
and also the railway used it and er it was used elsewhere and it's interesting this i noticed that erm b r have recently UNK er this type of fencing er which is adds insult to injury possibly on the at er
er but i you know it's rather nice actually
erm anyhow that was the sort of site er a few years ago
see it's very attractive the erm UNK and so on and the slate roofs
and er it didn't used to be erm white barge boarding er nor white erm fencing
but nevertheless i think it looks very attractive in that way
just note the er the entrance round there in the in the hedge er from the new building nearby
there's another picture of it where er this was er about five or six years ago this was taken and you can see there going along to the end of the er of this fencing the post there which was one of the er of the posts er to which the gates the crossing gates were attached
there you have a brick wall
now once upon a time there was a railway
looking back you can see the UNK erm and basically just er here was the railway and the entrance to the goods yard er coal offices etcetera or at least one of the UNK was on that side
coming back to look at this erm er as i say very attractive building again and you can see there's still a bit of work there
and er to go back and you can see it here
nice lamp and as i say these er the barge boarding
excellent erm brickwork as well just proud there
now you can see here again we've still got er some UNK
that actually is a railway gate post unless they've changed it which i don't think they have
on that one was taken a little bit earlier you can see they certainly had one of the old er gates there
and looking up that er UNK er now they've got that house there you can see er what the view is say up that entrance
and there again much the same
and just take note of that
and that's what it looked like in nineteen seventy seven
er one had the gateway UNK stone approach to the railway station
terrible shame in my opinion that building was demolished allowed to go to UNK and UNK er and then demolished
there you have the er individual UNK th along there and the entrance along here er up the yard
the old sort of double erm er goods shed
er and er vehicles would go down it drops down inside there and there's UNK er at obviously level erm on either side er of this arch er this erm er wide way er through to the bottom
and i'll show you a bit more in a little while
there is another picture taken on a different day showing again in about nineteen seventy eight
seventy seven seventy eight the remains of quite a substantial goods shed for a relatively small place
now i UNK most of you know that really the population of or was pretty static in the er well from eighteen fifty to about nineteen fifty or even nineteen sixty
erm round about three and a quarter thousand
very little change
they had er seventeen or nineteen pubs i can never quite remember
er for that population
er and er of course a number were closed in the er early part of this century and more er coming along
we've still got about ten or eleven i think haven't we
erm really the railway was closed in nineteen fifty nine for passenger traffic
just about the time that dougie started er building substantially in the town and doubled to population to its present six and a half thousand or so
er whether or not it would have survived i wouldn't know
anyhow that as i say was the er goods shed
er that erm was in use er as i say until the closure
now there's a picture of the station and you can see that we've got the post the UNK entrance on this on the left hand side was the station master's house the garden
you'll notice that the erm fencing is vertical
erm and that was normal practice until the early part of the century about nineteen o seven i think it was that the started using the er forty five degree angles style
but er UNK garden and the lot
there's over here there's er a passenger station
four UNK coaches er in here
some goods er wagons on that side erm lovely ladies in the long dresses and so on
er on this right hand side you've got erm various advertisements for er belfast and northern ireland and er and sort of er away days and so on
erm various signals
the main er sort of booking place er waiting rooms and so on
er normal practice for the railway was to have the main er part of the buildings on the town side and you got a er smaller building on the other side of the tracks over there
there's er part of the er goods shed over there
and we've got lamp house er signal box and the white gate and er woodwork there
now that er merely shows that is a cattle dock
a lot of quite a lot o cattle traffic in those days agriculture and cattle traffic and the normal practice er in certainly in the last century er to avoid disease was to use a lime wash
er they didn't have the er the normal erm UNK which sort of came in later on
er brothers of were manufacturers of sheep UNK and various UNK
and of course as i say those were around but erm the reason that is all white is that it was erm er when the cattle had been got out of the way they er UNK a fair amount of lime wash all over things er to er to kill any UNK there
erm here you have a UNK cab
and that cab you'll see in other photographs we've got
erm that UNK to the 's head hotel
er and again you'll see on one of the 's photographs i've got it shows just to the right hand side as you're looking at the front of the main archway erm it had the UNK railway parcels receiving office
so if you wanted to er send parcels via the railway anywhere in the country then you could take your parcels into er the 's head er sort of office there erm and they were UNK down here
you didn't actually have to come down er with er to the station to
erm a number of er sort of UNK up here various signals erm lamps
quite an interesting picture er and for anybody who is interested in sort of modelling this scene get is right er that's a very valuable photograph
erm it's off a er an ordinary postcard that was produced many years ago quite common
erm round about nineteen o five i think that was
now as you let's have a look at er the track layout of the place
erm want to run to about half past eight or
we'll see how we go
erm coming in from er on the a six one two from er we've come to over the level crossing there
now this is a er an UNK survey map of about nineteen fifteen
and at that time single track over that level crossing erm and the track became double as one went up past about close isn't it now over here
erm 's UNK close erm and er then we've got the double track runs into the station up here past the cattle pens which you saw those white things on the photograph various signal posts the goods shed there erm an engine shed a small engine shed which was built to accommodate normally only one UNK
erm and a little UNK by the er track to accommodate erm a UNK which was largely used for er UNK purposes of the UNK
and on the er here you've got erm UNK with that erm circular object is called a wagon UNK
and goods wagons that needed to be UNK er would be brought into er at least UNK erm er perhaps for the distribution of items in the town would be brought onto that UNK erm and normally horse purely a horse hook would be er put on er and UNK round and the wagon or the wagons a couple of wagons perhaps would be taken at right angles into that er goods shed for UNK
and the there was there was a central say UNK or carriageway down the middle there
er well not quite central erm and the er s wooden UNK inside the goods shed er was at wagon height
so the er the items could be UNK straight out of their packages and whatever
erm there was also an interesting erm UNK bit of railway track there
perhaps if i move on i think we've perhaps got one a little bit bigger
oh no
erm i'll go back a minute
er there's another little UNK bit of track there and that er provided er what was termed end loading facilities er so that erm er in the old days er the sort of lord of the manor er would have a er horse a horses and carriage
erm and er they had what they call carriage trucks which were er flat trucks basically or thereabouts
which could be attached to passenger trains and the er the actual er gentleman's carriage er horse drawn carriage could be loaded onto this flat truck and er the er would be transported to be available er at his UNK in his or her destination
erm and er it was er it was a UNK basically er up here so that one could run straight off that UNK onto this flat truck
and that's a that's one of the what that was used for
erm as you i say initially er it was a single track into the station over crossing
and erm in between the wars erm it was made double track er up towards over there
by just merely putting in an additional point or UNK here er to er to make that say double track
that's er well that's all there
that's a er map i acquired off the water board
i think from somewhere
erm the slightly larger erm engine shed here as i say
erm cattle pens goods shed the main station building here the erm station master's house here
a signal box the platforms on both sides the smaller building on the north side of the station
erm a weighed a weighing machine a weighing office over here and coal offices were situated there
erm i will give a little bit of history of dates and what things were altered and when in a bit
erm the railway track erm once it was extended through to and i say i'll give you the details on that in a minute erm went over the er road and then the track that was nearest to er the town was UNK in and joined that other line erm and er went off to
and there's a book on engine sheds and er engine sheds which was published some years ago i think by publishing company er which gives track plans to help people
but looked at a er at any UNK survey map they'd have seen that they got the track plan wrong
erm that is that is what it should be
erm some additional UNK mills over here some additional UNK were put in the early part of this century and they came off the this track erm just this side of on the left hand side of the level crossing erm and went er up to a dead end er just along in the right hand side er over now towards where factory is
erm or bakery
and then er they returned the line or double track round here er and bringing so goods wagons could be brought round into the sort of UNK area er of 's mill
of course 's was a very important customer of the of the railway
now let's give a little bit of er of information
the er there were many railways erm were UNK in the eighteen thirties and forties and beyond
and erm the er there was a nottingham lincoln and hull line i think proposed in eighteen thirty
erm but this line involving er was actually er part of a much bigger scheme that was put forward about eighteen forty and really involved er a line from near cross to on to on to and then up to and UNK
basically sort of cutting across country about twenty eight miles i think it was
er as an original project
erm the er in eighteen thirty nine the railway came to nottingham er from derby and er there were three companies the er railway i think it was and the er railway or er sorry railway
and they amalgamated in eighteen forty four to become the railway
and er a certain
george known as the railway king was very keen to get er across into to lincoln and certainly in various other parts of east anglia to sort of UNK other people's guns and to erm er to obtain the traffic for his own er benefit and for his UNK benefit perhaps
erm and erm the railway er opened the nottingham newark lincoln railway line in eighteen forty six
he whole thing was built in a year quite incredible
in those days
erm because it crossed the trent quite a number of times and quite a number of UNK er wooden bridges were involved in that construction
but the whole lot was done and opened i think it was er in august eighteen forty six
and one of the say one of the proposals was that there should be this er line from and through this town and over to join the er nottingham lincoln line er at
what was built in eighteen forty seven and opened in eighteen forty seven was merely a small branch line of two and a half three miles from this town to where it say er made a er a connection and a small junction there
there was no station actually at that time
erm the station was opened er and trains began to run in eighteen forty seven
but very quickly it was er all the promises of much traffic
say the town had only got three and a bit thousand people anyhow three thousand people erm there was very little actual passenger traffic
er even in the early eighteen well late eighteen forties early eighteen fifties
and after a matter of a couple of years of use er the service had already been UNK from nine trains down to five per day erm and er shortly the passenger service was completely withdrawn
or at least it was withdrawn as far as er railway engines were concerned
they did in fact get a horse erm and er they had a small carriage er and er a horse made the odd er visit up the line from time to time
er but erm the so the railway line erm still carried a little bit of er of freight traffic but erm it wasn't quite abandoned but even some of the er station buildings were removed erm to er to
so that's really what happened and it wasn't until eighteen sixty or eighteen fifty eight fifty nine in time that the railway directors agreed to UNK this branch line as they'd been basically promised a lot more traffic
erm it was still pretty marginal er but er at least it was opened and erm in eighteen er it carried on until in eighteen seventy one the line was extended back to or a station roughly halfway between the two
then er through to erm and on to
in those days there wasn't a great deal of mining i mean wasn't open and er there was a tremendous amount well there's a fair amount of traffic agricultural traffic and i mean one had to accept that virtually everything came in all coal road stone erm goods required er for well 's who were going at the time they er they used the railway
erm and the various er food s food stores er again virtually everything came in
and of course in due course er time er the town had a gas station erm or a gas not a gas station erm er a gas works
erm and so again coal was brought in erm for that
erm anyhow so that is sort of the background
and the railway er it operated i suppose pretty marginally certainly for the rest of er last century
erm in nineteen o two i think it was i've got the details at home erm UNK were put in for 's
they paid a bit and the railway paid a bit
and the idea here was that one would be for incoming goods and one would be for empty wagons or the other way round er going out
erm and of course the wagons as i say would come up right along side that er road
now that's a picture which er many of you will be very familiar of with
erm and it shows it's er just about the turn of the century that is
and er there you have a s a signal
erm the level crossing gates here 's mill on the left hand side erm a er sort of lean to er over the erm sort of loading bay or UNK bay there
erm a typical er signal box and a rather pretty little station master's house there
and that i say that picture has appeared on everything even on china i think you can buy some at erm can't you even with that on it
it's a very well known photograph
again about the turn of the century erm looking up towards
the track across here the crossing gates
er signal box there the er lower UNK signal here
there's a round spot on the back which was used before they had er a white er sort of a black erm UNK er vertical UNK erm on the er on it there
you can see at the back here erm a UNK crossing er which could be used er to get erm heavy items on a on a UNK or trolley over the tracks er from the platforms
erm various lamps the station b main station building the s the subsidiary station building there
er in the background there's the engine shed erm and a few er one or two there's a UNK there i think
erm one or two bits and pieces anyhow
and on the right hand side there's the goods shed
erm in nineteen fourteen erm 's who had a water UNK er as their sort of main motive power for their er UNK operations erm put in or had er not only this line UNK but they had one put in round the back here erm because that was to provide coal for steam UNK which were er put in to UNK the water power
erm that later on the signal box that used to be here was moved over to the other side that's all that's there for
and er that shows it later on when that one at the back had been taken out
now erm last century er goods came up er the trent to er and er by sailing barge er and er this sort of equipment was used to er to collect er items from the holds of these er UNK erm put on wagons horse drawn er and er some steam UNK engines er to be transported around
there's another picture of one of the UNK on the trent
a steam one
now the great er as you can see that is a just pre first world war advertisement from 's
and erm so they were quite major users of the railway services and indeed i think that there was at least one clerk from the railway employed in 's offices all day every day at some time
there's a picture of er flour going out from 's mill er latter part of er last century erm going out to 's bakery in the town
a steam lorry that acquired in the er early part of the century
erm obviously er no erm UNK tyres or anything on that but er quite er good old wo work horses they were
no that was er that's a picture of er 's erm er i think before they took that off they've taken that off haven't they now
erm that was when er it had just been erm well before they started erm altering it into flats and so on
but you can see that in fact the railway line came round and in front actually just in the front here
and there used to be a lean to just there
that doorway is still there
c eighteen sixty seven charles
er it's not the date the place was built it's the date it er the last time that particular area was erm UNK
they had a number of fires over the years at 's mill er and one was in eighteen sixty six or sixty seven
erm and er that UNK was the was when erm that part of the job was er was done
there's a picture that i obtained from actually ruth who was who was a miss
erm and it shows it's the twenty i think it's the twenty second or twenty third i've got it at home er of october nineteen fourteen this
erm and it's the UNK of the first full load of coal into round the back of the er 's mill erm and there's fifteen eight ton railway wagons there full of coal just erm coming
and it's an twelve twenty seven railway m r on the front as standard
and er bit UNK but that's looking out from the signal box you can just possibly just about make out there and at the back erm the er with the erm station master's house etcetera
er that was taken out i say in due course
but erm er i think that er that picture i borrowed i mean with her permission of course erm and er i think it was hung up in the bathroom or somewhere which was not the best place for a photograph to be really
and so i took with i say with her blessing took a er a picture of it for UNK
erm that's a er rather nice picture erm which has never been published not at the moment anyhow
erm and it was one that erm er mr gave me many years ago when i was involved with the cricket club about nineteen seventy seven i think it was
he knew i was interested in railways and his grand grandfather i think or uncle was er photographer of the town
and this was a photograph erm taken from the roof of the engine shed
and about er i'd guess about nineteen
nineteen twenty perhaps
and you're looking up towards
i don't know why i'm not really using this er this UNK
well perhaps cos you can't see it
erm the er arms over there
the cattle dock here
er a loading gauge just here to ensure that er anything coming out of that er that had been loaded in the goods shed was not erm UNK and likely to hit UNK and bridges and so on
there's the wagon UNK that we mentioned
that end loading er and UNK at er the end
that's a er that's a railway UNK there
erm and the line running into the goods shed there
erm you've got er fire buckets on the end
er a warning not to UNK or something careful about that
erm o a UNK crossing er between platforms there
there's a engine or carriage co er couple of UNK in there
the gates are shut over there
signal box there
er the er station master's house the line disappearing off towards over there
erm 's mill along here and actually you can actually just see there's a wagon there which says l b s c
now that's london brighton and south coast
what on UNK that doing there
er but er maybe it was erm collecting or delivering a load or something
er there you have the UNK
er or weigh office and again pretty little building er the UNK pitched roof the barge boarding on it erm and er multi coloured er brick there's a sort of UNK brick with erm er sort of UNK er brick work er put in to er b by way of UNK
and again you've got the same sort of thing
that's the coal er th the coal offices
there were three well there we were in fact four coal merchants in the in the town
there was er 's erm 's who were probably the biggest samuel 's erm 's and s
erm i think that 's had gone out of the coal UNK business erm probably by nineteen twenty or earlier i think
i haven't been able to trace anything er later than that
there you've got er a line of coal wagons and so that's UNK be coming that is a more sort of general UNK wagons which would be parked in there loaded or UNK erm er UNK across the lines and er into that goods yard goods shed for er loading and so on
erm lamps UNK and all the rest of it would be kept there
UNK toilet there
erm and the UNK er over there
and again as i say it's rather a nice erm picture which erm er was given to me some time ago
a close up really just showing you er more detail on er that wagon UNK the UNK stops rail built UNK stops or just across there fire buckets
erm and er there's the er loading gauge and there of course is the UNK erm cattle dock
er and er so there's the goods shed and the er door the wooden door to provide excess er trucks into there
er another picture i say really just erm closer up erm and giving perhaps better detail
you can see the er the pattern of the UNK
there's the sort of UNK bricks
and again you can see the barge boarding erm and rather attractive roof designs er which er reflect er the rest of the architecture
some of the some of the railways were very functional not and didn't bother too much about er what places looked like
railway was
er they perhaps spent too much money that way but to be fair the railway was the biggest well the railway er on amalgamation in nineteen twenty three was the biggest company and biggest employer in this country
and if one goes back er and think about that wages were probably no more than two pounds a week on average at that time the er share capital of the rail railway i think i'm right in saying was four hundred and fifty million pounds at that time
quite a concern
they had hundreds of thousands of employees of horses and er everything
er massive organization
and of course if you strip everything that's profitable out of it like the erm er the railway air services went erm the er the er erm hotels UNK everything else you can think of you're left with er with a UNK that doesn't make money and not surprisingly the government then closes it down
still i'm mustn't get too political must i
er but you know you can always close things if you want to
erm you can fiddle the books i know that very well
another picture show the here a little bit here
erm some of the a adverts in er our sort of parish magazines and so on er fifty sixty seventy years ago some of the names still there
motor company well that used er that erm er that's the er
er 's well they were well known very big shop in the town they had
erm where UNK is isn't it
now then samuel
some of 's wagons delivering coal to mr 's house well no it was erm 's manor it was before mr came there
er but erm that was er the UNK house of course at one time in the eighteen early eighteen hundreds
now a snow scene
samuel this was taken from an advertisement in one of the magazines and one sometimes got a little bit of er of UNK
er not quite certain how many he had he had at least one wagon i know that
erm very common you know s seventy three twenty five eighteen erm they very often started at sort of seventy three or something like that
to give the impression before
erm i say i don't know how many he did have
erm er but that er is a model of one that i made
er and er i think it's a fairly accurate representation
erm that is er four millimetres to the foot erm so not very big
but that's on to scale there
i work to a pretty scale on these things
eighteen point eight three millimetres between the tracks
's and all the rest of it and er UNK just by the er just by the station master's house
i'll stop in about five minutes if that's alright
fine
erm again l m s yard there residents
i think that's where dr lives now isn't it
in the nineteen sixties an awful lot of er of stuff went er or was just allowed to er to get into bad repair and of course er b r weren't terribly interested so they just abandoned it
you can see again this er this UNK work on there and again most attractive er UNK
the er gents toilet
a bit UNK but there it is
and er the ladies one look er there we are again
going round the other side where the sun was shining that way better
very attractive for modelling purposes this
looking close up
there you can see the sort of UNK light windows
and the basically the UNK colour of the er the brick work
the doors to the waiting room etcetera or to the booking office
inside
used to be UNK there i think
but er rather dirty yellow UNK interior
and again that's looking at the same time in nineteen seventy se seventy seven seventy eight time it's looking back into that er UNK and if you can remember the sort of the victorian or UNK er photograph that er i showed you before of er virtually that er that view
going back to seeing to looking at the erm goods shed
there you can see the main entrance
and that's where you went down slightly er or erm carts lorries anything else went down there
erm normally there was a er horse and cart here
er certainly until the i think probably until the end of the war
erm i believe there ha there was a comma or a yeah i think there was a comma vehicle that was used er later on
it may have come from york i don't know
er i suppose that's where they er did a lot of the office work a wooden shed built on to it
you can see the UNK and again the rather attractive brickwork that even on a goods shed a functional goods shed
now that's the entrance and there is where the er there used to be the erm er wagon UNK out here and the entrance for the trucks was er through that doorway
i won't say through the door looks as if it has been
but er there
i'm afraid the er the end loading UNK and a lot of the other stuff had gone by then
interior
there you can see the er wooden UNK and this is where the wagons were brought in er and were UNK onto this wooden UNK and the delivery vehicles would come down this er sort of UNK erm between er well either side the UNK either side
and you can just see some of the er you can just see the UNK on the in the UNK
there you can see the UNK and that is where the er wagons came in along here
more pictures of the roof timbers
outside that was some UNK i think there
and er internal roof work of the UNK
just er UNK there to avoid it getting damaged with things passing on the side
and we're now walking round the back and er sort of now pointing towards the arms
and you'll notice the er again the brickwork and the UNK along there
now having just walked away er up towards erm er crossing end there's the
and that's the remains of the cattle dock here
er i'm afraid a lot of it had gone by that time
that was to hang mr on
or dr
in fact there're two of them there and one there
and that's erm crossing house up there
and you can see that's where the main tracks where and this is of course where we had er sort of UNK and er other things and er and the main yard
erm odd pictures of the engine shed taken from somebody's back garden i suppose now
er but you can see the er the engine shed as it was
single road
accommodate er one UNK only
they normally had here er just the one erm UNK little o four tank engine UNK
erm built before the turn of the century
and er they also had er normally a little o six o tank er which was er spent a lot of it's time at er a at the what is what is now er castle
er UNK there
as i say that er train would nip off to nottingham i think every monday i think it was and get UNK cleaned out
er and then return
what i've never seen there's the that's the er tank water tank at the top
what i've never seen is a photograph from the other end
if anybody can tell me what was at the other end apart from a hole then not carefully er i'd be very grateful
i guess there was probably a lean to or something like that
but er i just don't know maybe erm a sand store
but as i say i've never seen anything and i've never been able to find anybody who can provide that answer for me
there is a coal truck that was parked there and they would load up coal er from there as necessary
er into the er into the UNK
in actual fact in later times erm possibly when that er when this was no longer in use erm they er put five instead of two or three coal rails on the UNK erm they put five on at least a couple of the engines
to so it could accommodate more coal erm and not have to return to base so frequently
erm there's another picture showing the er water er water crane with a barrel
er and the erm and the hose and er and lighting and so on
and this was a little stage er for people to go and to erm transfer coal across
now you can see on there there's something at the back isn't there
oh yes
but i don't know what it is
i suspect it's er it's er it's some sort of little office at a guess
but i would very much like to er to find out er and get a picture of what is up there
or somebody could tell me
now that's a bit of a UNK picture put er it's useful to er to give an idea of what was there
now after the er there was a incident at erm the er engine shed er the UNK of the UNK was transferred away erm and it used to travel at the end of the day over to the er or er engine shed where it er stayed for the stayed for the night
er and this is a picture of it and the engine shed with some ex UNK
er which were normal at that time
erm and er and basically that engine shed is where 's clothing factory is erm just er at the side of road
and by the hill bridge
a nineteen twenty four timetable erm not many trains between er and er and
i say originally there were four but by nineteen er thir nineteen twenty nine erm basically the passenger service had ceased although er we did get there were minor special and so on that were run and race days the stations and the er were used but basically erm er the er the line beyond er was er virtually entirely erm colliery er and goods traffic
but i say it became er quite increasingly important right up to its closure er of er particularly for catering for UNK for erm pit
er and indeed er a triangle or a curve was put in near to er bring to bring trains or enable trains to er to turn round or go round and face nottingham or come from nottingham from yard and so on
there's quite a quite a good service as you can see er between erm at least er junction and
virtually everything
and that was maintained right through to the end
erm a late picture say on or about the day UNK when it packed up which was erm july nineteen fifty nine for passenger servicing
and that was a sad day erm and i've got the details i think it was nineteen eighty one er that it was finally UNK
and i think a lot of that er of the hard core and er went and was buried near the rifle range up erm at 's place
er just off road
i think i'm right in that
you can see that erm good job of the knocking all the er UNK down and so on
rather sad
now let's move along the line
erm any questions on er itself or you know if there's anything i haven't told you i mean there's probably quite a lot well there's a lot i know there is
but yes anything you want to er erm please jump in
er but if not let's move up erm to towards er towards and this is erm this is the erm former under bridge at going up to mill
now the UNK used to come under the railway
little UNK bridge here erm and used i say used to go through to er mill itself just er quarter of a mile along the track
erm the er the road was later just moved to the left hand side of that bridge and er no longer having to have that restriction
but that is still in place as you can see
er a fairly light railway erm but er but adequate
that's taken from just re wh basically where the UNK is now
and that's the trail looking towards
now let's move up to the next port of call which is station
i should say it's convenient for neither i should imagine
erm single track shown on this UNK survey map
again about nineteen er i think nineteen fifteen maybe a little bit earlier
erm a passing UNK there for trains to be able to just pull in and let anything going the other way because it was mainly single track from er from onwards
erm and a little bay there for er goods traffic to go into the sort of station
station platform the bridge there and the station master's house there
a little head UNK at the end to protect anything running back onto the er main line
erm slightly nearer picture
er and i think erm er a bit later date actually
no it's probably about the same
that one's a bit later date and you can see that they've double the track here
erm just made it a er does it's not double track er very far but they have actually double UNK that
and this is erm in the nineteen forties nineteen fifties
when there was a fair amount of er goods traffic particularly coal from
that er that line i think went to just er a bit further up and erm er i say not an any matter of er another couple of hundred yards i think before there was only a single track
er that is the station master's house at station
and er it's now the part of the you can er go to a picnic area along here
you know you can walk through there back to
you can just see the remains of the platform there
and er platform over here
er this has been altered quite a lot since then but you can still see the er gate that was er to the yard of the station
moving on to
again er early nineteen hundreds and you can see single track coming in from here and interesting bit of track work here erm station up here
double track through the station
erm goods shed er and er UNK along here
so interesting type of track work there
now when the was opened er it was decided to er to put in a line erm just near to connect with and pick up some of the trade for the for railway cos the or the had already decided to get some from that end as well
er going up to erm and so on
so a line was put in up to colliery
and there you have not a very good picture but you can see this was th with the goods shed as per the last UNK survey map
slightly altered UNK but er tracks put in there erm and er to house quite a lot of wagons and to er allow trains to er to just be held there until they could move up to erm cos that's single track beyond there
that was the quite UNK quite UNK er UNK erm these haven't been changed here but additional UNK on this side er and i say that curve up here
erm just look at that one that er goods shed that's er that's interesting cos er there's still remains of that there
there you can see station
station master's house there
erm and the i can never remember the name of that road over there
er o this is road down here isn't it
anyhow erm that's in a cutting there
and you can see the track layout
i say in interesting if you built that in a model people wouldn't believe you
there's a picture in early b r days of a i think erm special probably from
and showing that even if the er station isn't actually used for passenger traffic er it's well kept
now let's look down from the bridge
and there you see again in early b r days er the er the station master's house and er and the station itself over here the goods shed over there the various track works coming across the er line up to round here and as i say the various UNK that were put in to accommodate the additional er colliery and other traffic
but er considering it isn't er used for passengers it looks in quite good nick doesn't it really that
but i say that er just er look at that and look at the particular roof line
and er the UNK there the circular UNK
now that's what it looks like more or less now
er looking just er well that picture of that going through th station on a special
that's roughly the same place
well just a few yards along
picture from the from the er bridge and there you can see the goods sheds still there
and that's looking up towards up there
but the house is in quite good order it has been extended
and that's er from the front view i didn't go wandering in
but that was the entrance to the station originally
er i don't know whether that's listed or not but er i'm surprised it's still there frankly
so as i say very er prominent building
there's a little UNK or office
er in somebody's garden
and er you can just walk down either side of it
er onto the trail
that's one of the see the old railway building there
erm looking up er the er line or that is looking from the bridge erm that's going down towards er th the just it er UNK round to meet the er the line er an and the s and the station was here
just along the road
er that was erm station just along here
and that's a line from between quite er steep er in quite a steep cutting
looking towards again from the bridge over the main road er as one gets er near
now moving on a little bit further i know the talk said that i was only going up to er to but i'm just going a little bit further
we've cut across the er a six one four here
erm at the white post
er and er the line came from over here and on that UNK there was a bridge here er but they farmer has er removed that UNK but has still left this part
and there's some still some one or two rather nice little bridges
er still UNK and er now i rather like the architecture
erm and so i UNK up there and had a look at it and photographed
interesting four arch bricks and er and very nice UNK
and the UNK there the retaining walls
you can see the brickwork there nicely done and er very attractive for again for modelling purposes
going a little bit further i'm only er just a couple here
that's up erm near not a very good picture that erm but a er l m s eight er eight f up near that is
on a er coal train going towards er towards
and that's a an l m s UNK also at
again on a on a special going towards UNK probably at a guess
now what's going the other way
erm and er this is coming in old UNK survey map coming in past the race course at
and er single track at the time and running double track and platforms either side erm a er wedge shape platform nice wooden building there another building there
and er the platforms either side
signal box over here
various UNK er and the trains from would come in to the left hand side of the top platform erm and er would er go over here and cut back and go out from this er this side
a little bit er it's not a very good map the er UNK survey map in the nottingham library er local studies department
about the best i could get off them
erm and i've obviously photographed it
now there's a picture er in early b r days again of the line coming in from here and the very attractive in my opinion wooden er structures the shelter there
the UNK at the back fencing platform here wooden structure here buildings erm and er you can just see the edge of er another UNK similar to that er on this side
this is taken from the er from a sta er from a signal box er just er over sort of where i am er here roughly in line
and er well kept flower beds and so on
UNK here signals and so on
there's another picture now that's looking erm towards up there and the branch coming in there behind that er building
very attractive take note of what that looks like
a train waiting to go out go out to er having met the er nottingham lincoln or lincoln nottingham line which you can see just goes up the back there
and there's that wooden building there
the train having come in from and just going er forward well i don't know erm before back to er to
i think that's an ex carriage actually but it makes you realize how small these things were
in b r days not a very good picture but an b one UNK four six o b one on a erm probably a birmingham train er real cross country
and there's the er in the platform there just having come in
another picture er of the not very good but erm best i can do best i've got
again see the old wooden structures rather nice lamps and so on
that's what you've got now
don't know whether that's an improvement upon the wooden structures
no i think not
that's where that rather nice this is w this is the er the departure platform at
and that's the platform arrival from nottingham to lincoln on the other side the lincoln to nottingham one
but er not terribly pretty
there you can see that's looking up towards
well the UNK gone completely that was taken two or three years ago
and that's what you've got left up there
i don't know why they bother
there's a signal box from which the other picture was taken
no doubt a lamp and store there
er this taken from where the signal box used to be and that's where the line out to is over there
there's hardly a trace of it whoops
and there you see er really that was the old erm remains of the platform going towards er
that's all that's left
and again that's the er platforms as it is now looking towards
oh and they sorry the other way round
that's the other end of it
and the er house there
quite a fair erm service on the nottingham lincoln line
erm there's a sort of typical timetable of the nineteen twenties
now moving over to er what is castle now used to be quite a nice er well the actual building erm that building is still here and the bulk of that er station building is still there er but erm i'm afraid all the er the buildings this side have gone erm and er a lot of this has a lot of this has gone
again you you've got er lamps erm and water columns and barrier here
in the background erm a big goods shed which is still there
i think er it won't be long before that goes i think
there you can see early b r days erm as it shows it's castle it wasn't castle it was just in the old days
water tower here
there was never a UNK at er at
er but er rather nice er buildings here and er UNK which i say have been completely er removed
and er the level crossing of the old a one used to be here
the goods shed at the back and the train just coming in from lincoln there
and the old UNK bracket signal there
er in b r days a lot of the er traffic between nottingham and lincoln and derby er was UNK by UNK from lincoln depot and when the erm region took that over they closed the or the er shed down and used erm er lincoln region UNK
this is an old express passenger four o director class
er in york station erm on a er lincoln to derby train
erm very attractive er UNK they were and extremely successful they were the UNK of er the er line and er UNK many of the UNK four six os er that were built subsequently
erm very attractive building and i think in fact ten years ago when i took that photograph
erm i don't think it's changed much
coming back er along the line
and that's how it was in earlier days
the same building
if you look at the look at that building
it's the same building
the gates they only had a single er they didn't have gates on either side here they just got the one set of gates
erm plus this er for passengers
but there wasn't there wasn't another set this side
wasn't room
in fact it's a very narrow er UNK there
it still is
little er signal box at
i managed to go in and have a chat with the UNK
erm pretty little thing the er boxes are very standard er in design they're they were varying in size but erm the er sort of double UNK roof the UNK erm the UNK corners of the windows erm the er the rails erm and the er sort of platform there er very standard er all over the place
they've got quite a few of these at erm at the railway trust they've er they've got a number of these signal boxes
they reckon they've probably got more than b r now there
er but a pretty little box that is
that's another view of the of the same box
now a little bit further up the line whoops is junction
now used to be er a link line between erm this er track here and round the back erm under road there's still a bridge there er and joined up near where the rubbish tip is
erm and er so trains could er instead of going towards lincoln having to perhaps back up to they would go round er a triangle basically and be facing towards equally if they're coming back they didn't have to go towards lincoln and then back they could erm could erm go round and er take their UNK to UNK and UNK yards
er inside er is a wheel which with which the erm signal box or UNK er could er open and shut the gates as necessary
and er a line of UNK for points for signals and some spares inside
and that was er duly inside you've got a fair number of spares on that
the UNK where the home signals yellow the distance and i this the black were points were they not
that's looking up er towards er nottingham
long time ago
an old a very old photograph and a bit UNK
but erm a train just coming in er from lincoln to nottingham
that's gone now
the signal box and the gates have gone taken now probably five or six years or so ago
again typical er box erm rather attractive has now got the er normal lifting barriers
there you can see the er box
erm and er the er UNK the er the level crossing er and house
in UNK days before they built the er bridge
when the all the traffic came across the level crossing there
there's still a signal box there
erm that's now a private house isn't it
yeah it's a listed building
but er rather nice
and a UNK a very common sight and this type of er of UNK erm very common er the barge boarding er and the er and the again the roof and the er UNK and very interesting sort of a in the garden erm of the sort of station master's house is that
very much like er the style used er in coal offices and erm weigh UNK at
that's still there
erm where there's a caravan office or caravan sales place just by the station at sorry at er
erm i remember er thinking one day erm i must get a photograph of that er building which was clearly a erm er a coal office or similar i'll go back at the weekend and get that
i went back at the weekend and it was a pile of UNK
and that is the danger if you don't do things at the sec at the time because er things do get er knocked down
nice little building little wendy house there
another picture of it
just playing
but er nice little summer house there
now
and let's just w just take one or two other pictures just for interest
just to show you a bit further on
that's what nottingham station i used to look like from london road bridge
isn't that beautiful
absolute er changed a bit hasn't it since er well the lines have gone the signal box and er and so on
the old 's premises at the back
and the bridges erm lovely o six o and er erm four UNK van with a UNK at this end
erm these er this is a one a of three or four photographs erm from the society collection
we've got erm tens of thousands of photographs
quite a number are erm there's quite a few taken in the nottingham area in
erm and this is one in station one of the UNK
beautiful design UNK
these erm finished there days really on easy graded routes such as the nottingham lincoln line
and er that's waiting to take a train out to lincoln
erm nineteen er probably just about erm nineteen twenty time that one
there's another similar UNK railway one seventy eight UNK
nottingham behind
underneath the old bridge over the top
again a train to er out to lincoln one of the two four os
very much in use on the lincoln line until certainly during the wars
till about the beginning of the second world war
along with and the other guns of four o
UNK of the motive power at the n and on the nottingham UNK services erm the old er built erm er round top fire box with the safety valves er and erm er well no UNK here or anything on it
and that's got a bell pipe fire box and er valves on that
again all in nottingham station on local
and there we are ladies and gentlemen as er all things should finish with the queen
erm
that er concludes my little contribution to the UNK entertainment
erm i hope it may be of some interest
erm it is i assure you but a fraction of what i've got
but erm they difficulty is in erm let's say keeping within a couple of hours
well that's fantastic
erm anyhow thank you er all very much
right
is there anybody
and when pilate saw that he was UNK nothing but rather that a riot was starting he took water and washed his hands in front of the multitude saying i am innocent of this man's blood see to that yourselves
and all the people answered and said his blood be on us and our and on our children
then he released UNK for them but after having jesus UNK he delivered him to be crucified
here then is this man who has this very unusual interview with jesus pilate the hard UNK and hard headed governor of UNK the representative of UNK the might of imperial rome and he has upon his hands for trial a man whom he is convinced is innocent
a man has been UNK accused a man who is standing in a court against UNK up charges
a man concerning whom pilate has to pronounce a UNK
it's up to him
jesus can either physically live or die
the decision UNK with pilate
now he's tried to shift the responsibility and that's something we're all good at doing we like shifting the responsibility whether it's in even the very tiny things in life or whether it's major issues we like to shift the responsibility to other people then if it goes wrong we're alright our hands are clean we we'll have nothing to do with it
and so pilate he tries to do this he tries first of all to shift the responsibility and he does it by different methods first of all he sends into UNK the king then he suggests that UNK should be released to the people now however both of these methods of shifting responsibility have failed and the ball is firmly back with pilate
he has got to take the next action it's up to him now
it's no good sending him to UNK he's found that out
no good suggesting to the people they release UNK cos they said we don't want UNK
now jesus has come back again upon his hands and he pilate is faced with this tremendous decision
the voice of conscience is UNK in his soul and he stands before this huge crowd of people
a few moments ago there they were shouting away with him
UNK him
we don't want him
take him away
put him to death
in front of them he gets a bowl of water and he UNK his hands says i'm free from this innocent man's blood
well of course he wasn't free
you need more than a bowl of water to solve your to UNK your conscience and to and to be free from innocent blood
but what a dramatic scene this is
but you see the important thing about this scene is not what is taking place there it's not really that pilate is standing in the trial as the judge of jesus it's not that pilate has i within his hands the power of life and death for jesus that's not the important issue that's not the real significance of this incident the real significance is that every one of us at some time or other stand in the same place that pilate stood
that's the real significance for you and for me
it's not just an event in history two thousand years ago something that happened way back i in a back water of the roman empire that's not the really important issue for you and for me today it's the important thing is that you and i have to stand in that same place that pilate stood and we have to make that same decision what will i do then with jesus that is called the christ
that is the decision you have to face up to that's the decision i have to face up to
we can put it off for a while we can say i'll leave it till i'm older i'll leave it till some other time i don't want to make that decision now
we may be able to put it off for a while but make that decision we have got to some day or another
what will i do with UNK with jesus that is called christ
what will you do
how will you respond
will you send him to the UNK
i don't want anything to do with him take him away
have done with him
or will you respond positively yes i will receive you i will you accept you
but that is the decision every one of us has to make and that is the real significance of this scene here in jerusalem
it speaks to you and it speaks to me of our attitude of our response towards jesus christ
and as we look over these next few minutes we'll consider that it was pilate who rejected and who crucified the lord jesus
it is of course true that although pilate pronounced the UNK jesus was already as the bible says a lamb UNK from before the foundation of the world
in god's purposes jesus had already gone to the cross he was UNK hi his natural fate if you like was already sealed he had come for this purpose he had come to die
there were that tremendous sense in which jesus had to die
there was sense in which it wasn't really in UNK hands because jesus had said to him if i wanted i would speak to my father he would send ten UNK of angels and they would deliver me out of your hands pilate you have no power over me
you see the real issue for pilate wasn't what he was gonna do with jesus as far as the cross was concerned it was what he was gonna do with jesus as far as his life was concerned
and that's the issue that you face and that i face
what do we do with jesus that is called the christ
the soldiers of UNK him the soldiers arrested him th the scenario works out it all UNK they nail him to a cross
as a nation the jews are responsible for his death but it was UNK pilate who delivered him to be crucified who announced the UNK who pronounced the sentence
but was it
later on in the bible in UNK chapter six in verse six listen to these words
it says it is impossible to new the ma renew them again to UNK since they again UNK to themselves the son of god and to put him to open shame
this surely whatever else it means this for this scripture here surely means that those people who had the opportunity of accepting christ of responding to him but who have rejected him they are in exactly the same position as UNK pilate
before you and i can ever point a finger to pilate what have you done what have i done with jesus that is called christ
in rejecting him we share that same guilt that pilate had
well let's just consider for a moments then this morning in some of the ways in which we can be like pilate the first thing i see here is that pilate rejected the lord jesus christ although he had tremendous opportunities of doing otherwise
of all the thousands the tens of thousands of people who lived in UNK of all the thousands of people who were UNK into jerusalem for this religious festival here is pilate in this favoured position of having a UNK personal face to face encounter with jesus christ
he can ask all the questions he wants to ask he can find out the answers not from a third party but from jesus christ himself
is it true what folk are saying
is it true the things that you've been UNK about yourself
the miracles you've done are they true or are they just tricks
tell me about yourself
all the opportunities that pilate had and in front of and despite all of those opportunities he still UNK the lord jesus
there are few people who are who have had a more unique opportunity of welcoming christ into their life than pilate had
over these over those few hours many times pilate was faced with the lord jesus and he recognized who he was
pilate had the opportunity of coming to him but instead he delivered jesus to be crucified
how many people there are who have many opportunities of accepting christ
they hear about him again and again and still they as the bible says UNK their heart and continue to reject him just like pilate
the tragedy is that life has now become complex and involved and they wonder if they can ever break UNK from all those things that are now UNK
break UNK from all those things that hold them and that UNK them and hold their interest
it is always a most solemn thing to turn down an opportunity of accepting jesus christ
it is not something oh well i didn't feel like it is not a light UNK thing because it is the most fantastic the most solemn the most life changing decision we can ever make
let me read you two or three other verses from that same book of UNK that we read from a few moments ago
first of all in chapter three and in verse seven it says therefore just as the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice do not UNK your hearts
it goes on and uses the picture of the children of israel in the wilderness how they UNK their hearts
it says don't be like that don't UNK your hearts when you hear his voice
further on in that same book in chapter twelve and verse twenty five see to it that you do not refuse him that is the lord jesus who is speaking for if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth how much less shall we escape who turn away from him who UNK from heaven
the apostle here gives two very clear and very solemn UNK about rejecting jesus about turning a deaf ear to him
you see the bible tells us god isn't UNK
in chapter two of UNK in verse two for if in verse three sorry
it says there how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation if we ignore god's offer if we ignore the ga the offer of jesus christ of forgiveness and of life how shall we escape the apostle asks
pilate then he rejected the lord jesus despite the tremendous opportunities he had
then again he rejected the lord jesus knowing full well that he was doing wrong
he did not reject jesus out of ignorance because he knew who he was
he was convinced that he was innocent
in another account of UNK of the of the trial of jesus in luke chapter twenty three in verse four pilate said to the chief priest and the UNK i find no guilt in this man
he said er i find nothing in him worthy of death
more than that pilate believed that he was the king of the jews that's why he had it written up and put over his cross
jesus the king of the jews
and when the folk UNK with him an and said take it down
he's not the king of the jews put it up he said he was the king of the jews
pilate said hold on what i have written i have written
he's saying i believe in what i've written there
how solemn it is to believe that jesus is the son of god the saviour of the world and yet to reject him
to be a christ UNK is to be in the same position as pilate was in
to know that's it right to receive him and wrong to reject him and yet to join with the crowd and say away with him
UNK him
then again UNK pilate he rejected the lord jesus although he was UNK and warned not to do so by his loved one
UNK tells us that after pilate committed suicide his wife became a christian
but at this particular time there is no indication that she was one
but a marvellous thing happened whilst the trial is going on don't forget it's in the dead of night and whilst the trial is going on there is UNK wife at home in bed sleeping and she has a dream and seemed as though god spoke to her and she saw and recognized the awful deed that her husband was about to commit so she sent an urgent message to him that is you've got it in ve verse nineteen have nothing to do with that righteousness man for last night i suffered greatly in a dream because of him
maybe in your life there are those around you friends families who love you and er and er who are urging you to respond to jesus christ and to receive him as your saviour
that was a similar sort of situation that pilate was in
his wife says don't do what you're gonna do
don't put this man to death
he is an innocent man
the tragedy is that pilate still rejected the lord jesus although his loved one UNK to him not to do so
how many folk there are who continue to reject jesus
although families and friends urge them to turn to him and to respond to him and to receive him
but then again UNK pilate rejected the lord jesus and thought that in doing so he had got rid of him
do you know that was one of the biggest mistakes ever made in his life
you cannot get rid of jesus christ that easily
you cannot do it
one UNK wrote a poem called the hound of hell in which he pictures UNK the na name of the UNK in which he pictures UNK er god pursuing men and women down through the corridors and UNK of time down throughout their life UNK pursuing and no matter how much you try and give god the slip there he is he will pursue you he will seek you out he UNK to ca for you to come to know him and you cannot get rid of god that easily
you cannot chase jesus christ away easily
he is not easily put off
you see in the first place he is the one who takes the initiative to seek you
jesus said the son of man is come to seek and save that which is lost
he takes the initiative to seek you
to start pursuing you
to start drawing you to himself
and he is the one and he alone is the one who will take the initiative to call it off
there's that very solemn warning back in genesis for god says my spirit will not always UNK with man
it's god who stops us UNK
you don't you don't put god off
you don't scare him away
it's god who takes that initiative to withdraw from seeking you
and pilate made this tremendous mistake he thought he had got rid of jesus
and the gospel said the record in which pilate tried to escape the responsibility that was thrust upon him
first he sent him to the jews to be tried as they said then he sent him UNK then pilate thought if i UNK him that will satisfy them let me just give him a beating and the folk will be happy and it'll be alright
but that didn't work either
finally he UNK him off to be crucified and he takes that bowl of water and UNK his hands thinking he's UNK from guilt but you don't get rid of jesus that easily
it takes more than a bowl of water to get rid of jesus christ seeking you out to follow him and to receive him
pilate knew that it would be a sin against god
he knew that it's a sin against himself his own soul he knew that what he was doing was against justice it was against the advice of his wife it was against everything within him and yet he still UNK this cause of having jesus put to death
he tried therefore to UNK the issue but he couldn't do it
he still has jesus on his hands the position is the same for every non christian for every UNK person you still have jesus on your hand you can't get rid of him that easily
you can UNK him out of your mind for a while you can go your own way and forget about him you cannot get rid of jesus christ and his claims that easily
you must do something with jesus
jesus himself said while he was here on earth that it's in matthew chapter twelve and verse thirty he who is not with me is against me
you're either for me or you're against me you can't be neutral
then pilate rejected the lord jesus we find for very UNK reasons
after all any reason that leads us to keep christ out of our hearts is an is an UNK one
what were the motives
what were the reasons that prompted and motivated pilate
well undoubtedly there was first of all the love of position he was after all the ra the governor he was the representative of rome and he loved his position
and the folk had said to him if you release this man you are no friend of UNK
what about your position
and that's still something that comes again and again when men and women when you and i are confronted with the claims of jesus what about this
what about the job
what about the position
what about your friends
what about your family
what will folk say
we find that there is no reason that stands scrutiny for our rejecting christ they all UNK
bring the very best reason you can against why you should not accept christ and once you put it under the ga under the scrutiny it just UNK
it's UNK
and there no reason there is no worthy reason there is no valid reason that you or i or any other person on the face of the earth has for rejecting jesus christ
he may well have been UNK he may well have lost his job bad word may have got back to rome they may have sent the UNK back to UNK telling him all about pilate but it wasn't sufficient reason for him rejecting christ
another is linked with that it's the fear of men and here again we see that with pilate he UNK the courage of his own convictions and in this respect this UNK absolutely up to date in the vast majority of cases people who say no i will not receive jesus it is not because of so called intellectual doubts that is only an excuse because his reasoning his far above our reasoning
the real reason is i am frightened what folk will say or i do not want to give up this particular habit of mine
a wise man back in UNK he reminds us and he puts this solemn warning and he reminds there and he says i in UNK chapter twenty nine and verse twenty five the fear of man brings a UNK
do you know it is possible because of the fear of people around you the fear of your UNK the fear of what men may say of what your family will think of what your work mates might say about you it is possible to allow that fear to send you to hell
nobody on a natural level is that stupid
nobody on a natural level is that foolish
and we take out contingency plans fo for various things you'll take out insurance er against your house being broken into against there being a fire or something else you'll take out insurance policies or assurance policies against your life so that your dependants will be provided for you'll take out pe er pension plans so that in your old age when you're not working you'll have sufficient money to live on
we make these plans on an natural level and yet we do not plan for the most important event of all time when we will stand before god and he will ask that question what have you done with jesus that is called the christ
and we make no plans for that
what are you gonna say then
i didn't think it UNK
i was frightened what people would say
i was concerned for my family
i thought that i would UNK
i couldn't give up this
i couldn't stop that
there is no reason there is no valid reason for rejecting jesus
UNK pilate also he UNK the lord jesus and in doing so he hated himself for it
let me read you the what happened immediately after UNK evil deed after he had delivered jesus to be crucified
pilate standing on you imagine knowing that he has delivered up an innocent man knowing that he's delivered to death someone who is not guilty of death knowing that he is the son of god the king of the jews listen to what he says and th listen to what he's watch he's seeing rather and the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the UNK and gathered the whole roman UNK around him and they stripped him and put a UNK on him and after weaving a crown of UNK they put it on his head and reed in his right hand and they UNK down before him and UNK him saying UNK
king of the jews
and they UNK on him and took the reed and began to beat him on the head and after they had UNK him they took his UNK off and put his garments on them and led him away to be to UNK him
and pilate standing there watching in UNK knowing that he is the one who is guilty for allowing this to happen UNK himself for it
why did i do it
why didn't i have the courage to release him
as pilate stands watching jesus being UNK watching him being UNK that thought going through the mind i am responsible for this i am guilty of it i have done it
course he hated himself for it just as every person who is not a christian will hate themselves because they had anything to do with that crowd who had cried out away with him
UNK him
how solemn it is to take sides with the UNK of christ
oh but you say i wouldn't do a thing like that
remember what we read what jesus said
if you're not for me you're against me
you can't be UNK
you can't be on middle ground there is no neutral territory
you know very often when you go from one country to another you go through an area of re what is called no man's land you come through from one UNK and then you've got a distance and you come to the next UNK that doesn't exist as far as accepting or rejecting christ is concerned
there's one simple boundary and that's all there is to it
you're either for me says jesus or you're against me
you're with me or with my UNK
it's as simple as straightforward as that
and to reject jesus is to take sides with his UNK
it's to say with the crowd away with him
UNK him
we will not have this man
i will not have him to rule over me
and finally pilate rejected the lord jesus and in so doing he sealed his own UNK
not so very long after this incident pilate was removed from jerusalem and in a d thirty six he committed suicide
anyone whether it was pilate then or you or me today who UNK and UNK christ UNK seals his or her own UNK
listen to what jesus himself says in john chapter three in verse eighteen he who believes in him that is in jesus is not judged
he who does not believe has been judged already because he has not believed in the name of the only son of god
and over in the last verse in that chapter it says he who believes in the son has eternal life but he who does not obey the son shall not see life but the UNK of god UNK on him
just as surely as jesus had an interview with pilate in the judgement hall so now he has an interview with you and with me
do we crown him
or do you UNK him
do you accept him
or do you reject him
do you welcome him
or do you UNK him
the story is told of one time archbishop of paris who with two or three other of his friends as young lads they went into the great cathedral there at UNK
okay now if i write something down
write an essay about
when you when you pass not if
yeah
when you pass
erm right i'll just write this down
okay if you'd like to try that
add that up
six point eight plus
nought point o two
good yeah that's great
right that's brilliant i think you can both do decimals
yeah that's very good i mean a lot of
we done them in second year
a lot of sixteen year olds are still having trouble with decimals like that and they're adding them in the wrong place
what is the most important point when you're adding decimals
keep the decimal in a line
keep the decimal in a line
that's it line that up and you can't go wrong
right who wants to tell me what a pie chart is
it's a chart in the shape of a circle
in the shape of a circle
and why do we bother doing one
so it can show you things how m many one piece and
okay have you got anything to add to that
it's like fractions it's like
right yes it's like fractions it can show you things and it can show you it as a sort of fraction
erm
on your computer okay
what sort of things have you seen pie charts used for
in my maths in school we just finished them on the last day
we erm had a
right
but it just shows it erm twelve hours of a baby's life
and we had a round pie chart and it was split into all different hours
okay
so was it split into
twelve sections for the twelve hours
no it was just the round circle and that was UNK
that was that was twelve hours and how was that
yeah we put twenty four hours and then coloured in half
okay so you had twenty four hours all the way round
right okay erm what other things could you use a pie chart for
in geography we had one because erm there was a farmer and what he does and there's like a big section for sleeping a smaller s section for eating
okay
and the cleaning the pigs and stuff like that
right so you can use it for almost anything to show but it it's showing it as a fraction of the whole thing
so it might be a fraction of a day a fraction of twelve hours a fraction of one hour
erm a fraction of money is another thing they use it for
erm how much pocket money do you get about three hundred and sixty each
one pound
i don't really get pocket money but if i see something in the shops in this toy or something my mum UNK buy it for me and say that's your pocket money for this week
okay so let's say if you got three pound sixty a week pocket money
why do i pick three pound sixty or three hundred and sixty pennies
any ideas
cos three hundred and sixty is a full turn
right three hundred and sixty degrees
so if we drew a pie chart how many degrees would be the same as one penny
one
are you happy with that
do you know do you know about three hundred and sixty degrees goes all the way round
ah okay when we do pie charts we're measuring angles aren't we
you we're doing fractions if you like so you could draw a half and that would be a half of three hundred and sixty
half of all the way round so how many would that be
erm
what's half of three sixty
one pound eighty
right and it'd be a hundred and eighty degrees all the way round and that would represent one pound eighty if three hun three pound sixty was all the way round
and what about a quarter of the way round what would that be
do you know how to divide three sixty by four
quite a big number could you divide thirty six by four
how many fours in thirty six
okay
could you have done could you do half of thirty six
mm
okay what would half of thirty six be
eighteen
and then what would half of eighteen be
it's er eight is it
nine
nine
nine so we're looking at three hundred and sixty
trying to divide it by four
well that's a bit awkward so pretend it's thirty six times ten
leave the ten alone we'll bring that back in later
half of thirty six would be eighteen
so half of three sixty could be eighteen times ten
half of eighteen is nine so half of one eighty would be nine times ten so ninety degrees is a quarter of a turn a quarter of the way round
and er look at look at these again
in school we didn't really do the actual pie charts but we used UNK
yeah
to measure angles
we had all different kinds of
one of these to make an angle
yeah
yeah that's a protractor
protractor that's it
UNK have you seen one of those have you used one
yeah
yeah
right that's for measuring angles so we could measure these angles before we s before we start on the money
yeah
where it all goes to
perhaps we could just have a look at what sort of angles we've got here
so let's say that represented your three pound sixty the complete circle
and you spent quite a bit of it that say on sweets
okay so you could draw that and you'd draw the same angle and we could measure that angle see what it is
well what fraction is that
a third
third
so what angle anyone claire have a guess at what angle that will be or how would wor how would you work out what angle that is
how did we work out what a half was
it's erm divide thirty six by three and then
right so we divide thirty six by three and what does that come to
tw
UNK
twelve
twelve
so three hundred
and you times that by ten
so that would be
one hundred and twenty
one hundred and twenty
so a third of this should be a hundred and twenty and we just measure that and see
yes it does come to a hundred and twenty well that's good
i'd be looking a bit daft if it didn't
a quarter should be ninety
well that's the angle on the
ninety
square or a UNK isn't it that's ninety degrees no need to check that really we can see that's ninety
it's ninety
what about this one
what fraction is that
a sixth
sixth
and what angle will it be
how will we work out the angle
sixty
sixty yeah
right good sixty
how did you do it
divide thirty six by six is six and times it by ten
right so that's sixty and what's this fraction
a twelfth
twelfth
and what will that be
mm a twelfth
what angle will it be
a twelfth
so how many UNK in thirty six
three
three
so that's going to be three times ten that'll be
thirty
thirty
thirty degrees
we'll just check that see if it's right
yeah that's fine
okay you have to get the point just on
yeah
the hole there
measure that and have a look and it comes just on the thirty
yeah
okay
so we could do thirds sixth quarter twelfth we could do a half
what would a half be again
what angle would a half be
half of three sixty
one eighty
okay one eighty
right so let's decide how we're going to spend what i'd like you to do erm what sort of things do you spend your pocket money on
sweets
sweets
is that what you spend most of it on probably
yeah
yeah
okay so sweets
what else do you spend your pocket money on
sometimes if i see little a little or little toys for my brothers
so presents okay presents for other people
anything else
anything else you spend your money on
save it up
save it okay so saving is some of it and anything else
like little UNK
okay the UNK
stationery
stationery good word
how do you spell stationery
can you both write that down
when it means pens and UNK and papers and UNK and
okay now what have you got there
i don't think that's right
why don't you think that's right
mm what do you think kelly
do you think that looks right
no
no
okay what do you think about claire what do you think of UNK does that look better
yeah
can you both spell station
okay that's station
do you want to swap back
you can both write station
there are lots of words are built up from other words aren't they
station and now underneath that write stationery
that's it
that's fine now that's how you spell stationary if something's not moving okay
the wheels were stationary
with an a
it's not moving but when it's papers and UNK and stuff like that
is it e
exactly yeah it's stationery with an e
so write that one and then later on when i've gone if you can make up some sentences with stationary and stationery
we both just say stationary so you can't tell by the sound of it how you spell it
if you could make up a sentence with those
so stationery is one of the things so we've got erm what else might you spend money on
okay so i what i'd like you to do now is both write down if you had three pound sixty a week how much would you spend on sweets on presents on stationery and how much would save
i'd save most of mine
so both write down you'd save most of it
what half of it or more than half or
half of it
okay
well write down how much you'd save and how much you'd spend on sweets how much you'd spend on presents how much on stationery
spend on sweets
so how much would you spend on sweets
one pound on sweets okay
i spend sixty pence on sweets
sixty pence on sweets okay and say what you're spending that on sweets okay
and what about presents and stationery
both make your own mind up what you'd want to do
and how much would you spend on presents
mm
you wouldn't spend any
okay that's fine you put presents none
does it have to be a exact amount
just what you
what you think you'd
on presents
presents
okay
but if i'm up at the shop and i see a little card or something
okay
about a pound
okay
and would you spend anything on stationery
yeah
okay and have you added yours up
just put total good that's good
stationery right
so if you'd like to add them up now see what you've got
is that one pound
yeah
mm
so adds up very nicely to three sixty and kelly spent more than she had
so you've got to you'll have to change something won't you
ninety pence
okay ninety pence yeah that's a good one
so ninety pence on the on the presents there
change that one there
so we'll draw a pie chart now which one shall we do first
whose shall we do first
UNK
okay we'll do UNK first
the first thing we need it as a circle
mark the centre of it go all the way round with that
now what fraction are you s are you going to save
s save a half of it
yeah so it's a hundred and eighty degrees
a hundred and eighty out of three hundred and sixty you could save a half of it
well that's no problem
could you d would you like to draw would you like to draw half
okay
just write save
write save in there
now what's your next thing that you're going to do
sweets
sweets one pound so one hundred out of three sixty
so that's a hundred degrees out of three hundred and sixty degrees
now if you can mark off a hundred degrees
you know how to use the protractor
yeah
good
now where's the hundred
ah okay what we usually do is make sure it's not upside down
and on this one there's a nought on the inside and a nought on the outside so we work with the nought on the outside and we'll go round that way clockwise the way the numbers go
yeah
nought ten twenty thirty forty
okay so we start from nought and go round
so where are we going to where are you going to put it
down here say
do don't be afraid to turn your paper round
so make sure that dot is on the centre there
is it on the c let's have a look
let's get that in there
okay and then you can move it round to line it is that lined up okay
yeah
where you are
yeah
okay and then on the outside circle there we mark a hundred degrees
okay and join that one up
and then
with this part this bit
ah well have a guess
can you remember how much ninety degrees is
ninety degrees is that nice square angle you found on a
a right angle
square or a UNK
special name for it as kelly says
a right angle right
so that must be the hundred and that must be the eighty
so that's for sweets and what's this for
good and you've both spelt it correctly stationery
okay so that's UNK chart
that shows so you can look at that and you can see how she's spending her money
but it doesn't tell you
it just unless you've actually got a protractor
doesn't tell you how much
much you spend
no but it's still helpful like that cos you can see well it looks as if without measuring it accurately it looks as if she spends half of it she actually saves half of it
okay
so it looks as if she saves half of her money and then spends a bit more than a quarter
out of what's left a bit more than half of what's left goes on sweets and a bit less than half goes on stationery
so even if you didn't have a protractor i mean if you wanted to be really UNK and find out exactly you could measure it and say ooh that's actually it's not eighty that's seventy nine and this is a hundred and one so she spends a pound and a penny on sweets and she saves seventy nine
you don't normally need to get it that accurately do you
you just want a quick glance at it to see what she oh well half of it's saved and then a bit more than a quarter
is it probability
yes
guess yeah that's it
guess okay
a bit more than a quarter on sweets and a bit less than a quarter on stationery
and if you wanted to find out exactly you could measure it
now somewhere on there we should say what the total is because we could look at this and we could say well she saves erm half of it but does she how much does she get
well perhaps she only gets two pence a week pocket money and she saves one penny
or perhaps she gets two hundred pounds a week pocket money right
or two million pounds a week pocket money
we don't know so i think UNK at least you need the total on
and i know it's not saying there's anything wrong with it just hadn't got round to writing it
so we could say total is three pound sixty or something like that
just write total
yeah total is three pound sixty
right so do you want to have a go at doing your one kelly
okay
and oh we'll ask your dad what sort of computer he's got
i save about a half of it
okay
hi
hello claire says she's been doing pie charts on your computer
yes it's only a it's a amstrad
er what sort is it
i b m compatible
no it's not no
it's the original one which was er what was it called
six one two eight plus
it's only got a three inch disk drive on it
ah it hasn't got three and a half it's the amstrad three inch
yeah
okay
are you doing pie charts what are you doing that on
right
because i've got some stuff for i b m compatible that she could play with
i'm looking to upgrade it soon so
mm
hopefully it'll be alright then
don't i mean don't buy it just for this it's just that if you had it handy
yeah
it's a shame not to use it
but er
i'm UNK i'm gonna upgrade it for business you know
you can't get no software for the amstrad it's really hard to come by
it is it is
there is some very cheap stuff about for things like the fifteen twelve and sixteen forty
mm the p c UNK then
erm no the p c rather than the p c the p c w is just a dedicated word processor that's all it does
but very good sort of cheap way into computers
we couldn't load save it could we
okay well she's just working out how she'd spend three pound sixty pocket money
very easily i would think
no she's going to save half of it
oh yes please er black no sugar
before i
right you're a bit stuck
so let's see how is it going
what see what see if claire can help
let's sh explain to claire what you're doing and
right
i think i'm right but i'm not sure
well that's the your nought isn't it
mhm
and then that was right
right good
and then i needed my ninety pence
right
for my present so
ah okay right
do i go from that nought or that nought
don't mark the nought on
now this is this is very this is very good this the reason you're stopping here because have you done bearings
no you probably wouldn't have done but you'll do
yeah i had a homework sheet
