they're now even on to the UNK trade union reform bill they're accepting it admittedly but they're accepting it but it's in the wrong bill it's in the wrong place it should be up in the front
they claim c t was about efficiency compulsory competitive tendering
this now gives the light to it
this was only here to drive down wages and conditions of our members
it didn't matter to be honest in some contracts whether we won or lost against other people low paid workers exploitation by the contractors
the reason i joined the g m b and i'm sure most of you was in good times the g m b looks for improvements in pay and conditions in bad times we look for holding on to what we have got
this gives us the chance this helps us but that's all it does
the union itself the members will also have to do something about this as well
local authorities have been subject of budget cuts rate cutting and unfortunately redundancies over the last dozen years or more
the g m b and other unions but principally the g m b cos that's one i'm concerned about needs to UNK councillors and officers because councillors and officers have been UNK with almost as much legislation as the trade unions have had from the tory government and most of them actually just want an easy time so you've got to hassle them you got to UNK them what they do
we have done this locally in my local authority
we've got to spend the award of the contract the day before because i put the leader of the council on the spot
they took legal advice and now they're going to re do the tender with the clause in it we done it locally
we've also in london the london region took tribunal for UNK who were who were not transferred from a school and we won that tribunal
it can be done we need to move this up internationally because what we need to do is show the members that we can fight back
this gives us something that UNK the legislation on this gives us a UNK of sunshine in all the UNK and UNK
c t to some extend UNK the recession because it brought on members down to conditions that other people are now suffering
this was what a boost to when we won that thing at to the stewards and the members it really was it was an UNK
people were saying the union can do something we can fight back and we need to translate that right across the country
as mick said it's not a it's not the end of things c t will remain until the labour government get back in
however and it also has a down side because now the contractors will be able to see the information which used to be confidential that local authorities will be putting on the table but the point is it's a UNK it's a way forward we need to build on this
let's exploit this let let's use this not just for the existing members let's use this as a recruitment tool
we can go out and say we can fight them now we can do it we can use this legislation
i say we should this we should UNK this because we can win on this
i move

motion two nine four g m b scotland to move
sally UNK g m b scotland moving motion two nine four compulsory competitive tendering
president congress since nineteen seventy nine local authorities and public services have been under attack from the tory government
attack after attack through privatization compulsory tendering and hospital opt outs
these attacks and these attacks and the anti town hall and pro whitehall legislation has resulted in many g m b members suffering drastic cuts in wages
er women workers mainly part time and school cleaning and school meal services have had fundamental changes in the conditions of service
privatization for our members has meant more work for less pay with less people and with less time to complete the work
the tories claim that local authorities must be more competitive than the market place
well we don't disagree with that
we all share the view that local authority services should be provided by highly motivated highly trained professional staff but local authorities have had their budgets cut from central government over the last thirteen years which has restricted the amount of finance available for training and has cut to the bone the finance available to provide efficient and effective services to the consumer
congress the UNK exploitation of our members is totally unacceptable
we should debate and argue at every level to ensure the local government receives the money available to provide efficient effective services and not be subject to the UNK of the market economy where UNK contractors can come in and UNK in house UNK in order to gain local authority services
whilst computing was the UNK contractors in order for our members to keep their jobs hours have been cut bonuses have been cut and arrangements for a working year have been changed and many other things have been altered in order for people to save their jobs within local authority services
compulsory competitive tendering is not the way forward what is needed is quality services provided by a quality workforce
the g m b must continue to argue at every at every level locally UNK and nationally to ensure that our members are properly trained to meet the challenges that lie ahead
president we should be under no illusion that this UNK government will continue to attack local government to attack local to attack local government our public services are at the mercy of the fast UNK merchants within the private contractors who are bidding for council services
we should continue to debate with local authorities to ensure that quality is included in the specifications for direct works
quality that means providing a quality service with a quality workforce
president what this motion is calling for is a political backing required to remove compulsory competitive tendering
in the meantime the g m b will continue to take a high profile and negotiations in order to fulfil our members' expectations

motion two nine five local government UNK schemes g m b scotland to move
frank g m b scotland motion two nine five local government UNK schemes
some of you may not know the history of this decision
reports for nineteen ninety one to nineteen ninety two the metropolitan borough of the outcome of which local authorities in redundancy pay
this is quite clearly a case of discrimination
discrimination between local authorities in the private sector the private sector being allowed to set their own levels of redundancy payments the local authorities having to stick to statutory
the discrimination between the local authorities throughout the country and the london UNK pardon me are not included in this decision in fact they're exempt from it
colleagues this is taking away the trade union's right to negotiate a redundancy package on behalf of our members we need to negotiate a package when it's required for the members and for the members being forced out of their jobs with just a statutory they should UNK their service
congress we in the public services have failed have faced imposed redundancies since the introduction of c t
we're under the constant threat of job losses
redundancies brought about spending cuts to the public sector and by the extension of c t
we have a government who are intent on privatization at whatever cost a government with no consideration for the people of this country
we now even have a situation where some of our members that the local authorities have now been given guidelines to recover the monies paid to them and
all this decision means was in the public services there much greater use of a compulsory redundancy that reduces job security and results in much lower redundancy payments
it also makes local government less attractive employer
we in the public services provide a higher standard of efficiency and quality in fact we provide a service that's second to none
we shouldn't have to compete with anyone
what we need is a good employment practice not shifting of a goal post at every turn
just to finish up colleagues this should not be seen as a willingness for local authority workers to give up their jobs but it needs to be sorted so that our brothers and sisters who are forced into redundancy receive fair UNK for their loss

composite thirteen cuts in council services liverpool region to move south western region to second
liverpool north wales irish region
president congress we move this motion er i'd just like give you some examples
being a local councillor suspended and i've been up and down like a yo as regarding the principles of this government
what's happening to the local government this time of the democracy and they have been UNK attacked UNK attacked at the locally controlled labour councils
the standard spending assessments doesn't take into account the influence to spend especially on the economic unemployment and health issues
the government has UNK the in the community programme the government is programme
this will have a major effect on the jobs and services councils will not be able to raise cash by other means
compulsory competitive tendering is seen by the government as a means of UNK the working conditions
conditions of brothers and sisters for many years
competition within the white collar section is another nail in the coffin and an attempt to reduce to the paying conditions
the UNK charter was introduced local authorities money to achieve
the issues of education schools now are in control over their own budgets and if not handled properly will become a recipe for disaster
prospects of wholesale changes in working practices and conditions of services if we will be if we are able to compete with the private sector in an aggressive market
i call on the c e c and if you can find any labour mps to ensure maximum publicity to expose the cynical UNK activities of this tory government by mounting a campaign to make its government provide adequate services
i move
thanks colleague
the seconder for composite thirteen
the seconder for composite thirteen
can i just say colleagues before you second the motion there is this UNK again that's growing i mean it seems to go down and i don't know perhaps it's like the tide but can we try and keep it a bit lower especially when colleagues are trying to make a speech from the rostrum
thank you president

president conference motion two nine six UNK this government's UNK low spending levels imposed on local authorities causing drastic UNK in social services who provides facilities for UNK most vulnerable citizens the old sick and disabled
to show how safe services are in the hands of this government you only have to study john major's speech to the society of county UNK at his annual dinner in london last december and i quote together we have achieved much over the last decade to improve the services we provide for the people we serve and the environment in which they live unquote
well colleagues he's achieved a lot of things but it hasn't been in cooperation with local governments
cooperation means working hand in hand not hand to mouth
it's been in contradiction to the wishes of the voters of this country
conference he's pushed up unemployment he's achieved cuts on training budgets and used training enterprise councils
he has cut public transport funding and cut in the number of people employed in the public transport service
he has cut the number of schools and colleges and increased the size of classes
he has watched homelessness rise and yet he has cut public building programmes
low cost housing has become less and less available as councils have been refused the resources to build and of course this savage and UNK cuts in the social services
while councils are UNK to avoid compulsory redundancies and adopting restrictions on recruitment freezing posts and voluntary UNK as alternative compulsory redundancies are taking place
the scale of the mean that virtually every service is affected in one part of the country or another
president the association of directors of social services recently published the results of its survey on social services department nineteen ninety three budget plans
with a response rate of seventy eight per cent the a d f survey UNK that in eighty two per cent of the eighty four authorities that replied budget reductions were planned and in a further eight per cent a UNK budget was expected
conference i ask you with that response what does that hold for our social services within our communities and how UNK we must feel that given we will certainly not
colleagues this motion falls upon the c e c and labour mps to mount a campaign to UNK the government into providing adequate funding to not only maintain but to improve much needed services
please support
two nine eight local authority wage restraint g m b scotland to move
william g m b scotland moving motion two nine eight local government wage restraint
president delegates when this resolution was drawn up and passed by my branch at the latter part of nineteen ninety two we understood the text of chancellor UNK autumn statement regarding public sector workers and a ceiling of one point five per cent on pay increases starting in nineteen ninety three
it was to drive another nail into the coffin into the public UNK coffin to go alongside compulsory competitive tendering UNK of working conditions and compulsory redundancies just to satisfy their own political UNK not caring about the citizens of this country whose quality of life depends on them the services provided by the public sector
since the government's autumn statement we have seen increased health service charges transport increases etcetera and now we hear in the recent budget the result of black wednesday in september nineteen ninety two of which UNK of pounds were thrown down the drain that workers will be expected to bear the burden once again
vat to be imposed on gas on electricity bills and many other items too many to mention at this rostrum
delegates this resolution is about UNK all of the unions in the public sector after all we did it in nineteen seventy nine and as we all know that was against our labour government with one aim to reject this government's pay policy and to combine and fight for a pay increase which we'll endeavour to counter the savage attacks which are being made against public service workers
every local authority and this is where the sponsored councillors can play a major part in this campaign to fight for justice on behalf of their employees
let's also use our union and other publications to publish details of their campaign
let's have major demonstrations and all of the major with the regional and national leaders to the forefront and highlight to the people what our case is about and seek their support
congress i know i'm speaking to the team but it's up to us and the activists who are not here to UNK our members and get this campaign off the ground and by supporting this motion we will be putting the first foot on the ladder to UNK the government's pay policy
congress please support the motion

motion two nine liverpool region to move
president congress
paul liverpool north wales and irish region
i welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion on pay policies
judging by the mood of the conference and the UNK er UNK see more than ever before
week after week year after year the economic failures of the tories are apparent and every day of the failure we have seen the most valued assets the people of this country bear the blame and pay the price
the UNK reduction of public borrowing has been excuse me has seen many public services destroyed or disappeared forever
yet what workforce is left is asked no it's told that one point five is a sufficient pay rise given the present economic climate the catch being up to one point five not one point five
we all know that one point five of thirty thousand pound is far better than one point five of three thousand pound yet with the present government crisis the t u c lacks in leadership in building a campaign to reject the pay policy
the issue needs to be pushed to the front of the t u c agenda and a rolling programme of industrial action in key services nationwide throughout the public services should take place
there also needs to be collective approach so every union worker in this section UNK the present UNK offer and builds on a campaign run by the fire brigade union
an acceptance of this offer without a fight will certainly lead to the future offers of any if any being even lower
i move
ian liverpool north wales and irish region
when the tory government announced the one and a half per cent pay ceiling for public service workers many public service workers quite rightly so were angry
there's an old saying don't get mad get even and the only way we're gonna get even with this government and we have to learn a lesson from history is to do to this government what unfortunately we had to do in nineteen seventy nine and if any government deserve to be taken on then it's this tory government
the thing that UNK me is that we're supposed to have a t u c that organization is supposed to draw together the various trade unions and what are we seeing an ideal opportunity slipped from our grasp when the miners were facing the issue of jobs to public service workers should have linked up with the miners and we should have took the government on
on the question
of pay
and because of the UNK of the leadership of the t u c that opportunity has been lost and what are we also seeing in the public sector
that group after group have UNK
they've not UNK because they've not been prepared to fight they've UNK because there was no UNK er organizations to pull them together
i honestly believe that the rail workers wouldn't have accepted the one and a half per cent other workers wouldn't have accepted the one and a half per cent if they believed that they were on their own that they were gonna fight in isolation
sadly we've lost the opportunity with a couple of groups but there are still other group left in the fight this union has the ideal opportunity to UNK that fight and i ask conference to support the motion
motion three o two protection for residential workers birmingham region to move
formally moved is that formally seconded
thanks very much indeed
i call emergency motion number one the crawley dispute to be moved by southern region
colleagues UNK southern region moving emergency motion one crawley dispute
UNK the company that won the tender when crawley district council put it out of a bunch of UNK and on the first of february crawley district council awarded under c t their refuse contract to UNK as the cheapest UNK
UNK have never recognized any union and are well known for the low rates and poor conditions that they impose on their workers
they are also totally anti trade union even half of the contractors think they are UNK amongst UNK
for many weeks prior to the first of february we attempted to get a district council a labour council to agree that should apply in the case
they refused on the advice from the department of the environment
the first step taken by UNK was to impose substantially reduced terms and conditions the next step was to tell g m b members that they must work as many hours as necessary to complete their refuse tasks
even though the waste tip was closed and to leave refuse overnight in public places is a breach of the environmental act
so much for standards
our members would not breach the health act and five g m b members were instantly dismissed
the union immediately attempted to get talks going with the company even UNK to UNK but UNK would not talk to no one
we immediately authorized a ballot and we are now in our sixteenth week of the strike
we have started all legal steps open to us for example industrial tribunal claims we have given the council dozens of examples of UNK of the contract by UNK but they do nothing
we have obtained much support locally from other trade unionists and residents we are attempting to meet the leaders of the labour group
we are now at the UNK we need wider support and help both moral and financial and there will be a bucket collection at the end of this session
a victory for the g m b is essential UNK must be defeated
a labour council must get off the fence sack UNK
now i love the labour party and a lot of what was said this morning was painful
we adopted the position and as soon as the UNK resolved the better so i'm somewhat reluctant in saying that jack straw could be less UNK about c t rather than concerning himself with what is written on the back of his party card
c t has the potential to rip the UNK out of the movement due to the density of public sector trade unionist membership
it is UNK that we fight
a victory for the twenty one members at crawley will be a victory for all workers in the public services
i UNK you
and i move
right phil london region with an l mick
alright
er you've all seen this haven't you
it's a lie and i tell you why it isn't the southern problem it's every UNK problem
every region here got this problem because all of you every one of you have got local authority workers and other workers and UNK is like a UNK on a UNK back it's creeping in and they going getting everywhere
now i work for a local authority so i've got a big interest in this but i've also been involved as john will remember in a strike
i stood outside for fifteen months with some girls from UNK hospital some of UNK people might remember that
ninety women that have all been forgotten just like these twenty three could be forgotten today if we don't do something about it
the tories are useless everybody keeps telling us that but are they
they're picking us off like flies they can't be that bloody useless can they
it's about time we realize they're not useless and done something about them because there are people that are listening to them and there's people that are voting for them and while people do that UNK will get a UNK because they've already got quite a big one they're a big multi national company and know what they're doing
they're not UNK either john
right this big union and it is a big union innit big labour party what are they doing what are we doing to help people like these up here
let me tell you about the UNK women most of them are dead some of them are working for local authority
the steward alice she's dead she stood out there for fifteen months she got very ill and she died and one officer from this union turned up at her funeral
she said to me phil they can't my spirit but they really took the heart out of me
well what about this union are we gonna let it take the heart out of us
for UNK sake we gotta do something haven't we
john came down to UNK he wasn't a general secretary he was just an officer and i remember cos i've got a good memory john what you said to me
you said er i told i told him i was fed up with the general secretary of this union that hadn't given us any backing and you said sorry phil but i'm not the general secretary
well you bloody well are now john
the london region was good to me in those days and the london region are gonna put their money where their mouth is today
now we're gonna make a start in london by offering a thousand pound today to those people up there to help them
now how many other regions have got the UNK to do that and if you do it come on we can ask the general secretary to double everything you do now come on
give these people the support they need
no matter what you've heard about john i know he's a man of his word he's an honest man and he won't say that he didn't say that to me will you john
so we're home and dry with some help for these people
come on make the man stand up and put his money where his mouth is
make this union as big as john tells us it is
thanks very much colleagues er that concludes the debate but the c e c are er are recommending exceptions of every motion but in respect of some are asking for a statement to be made so i call mick to respond
thank you president
mick responding on behalf of the c e c
c e c is asking congress to support composite twelve support motions two nine four two nine five
support composite thirteen support motion two nine eight we support with qualification motion two nine and support motion three o two
the c e c UNK composite twelve on the transfer of undertakings and the acquired rights directive
as a union we've successfully argued albeit UNK at some times that UNK protects public sector workers in all cases of contracting out
that has threatened the whole concept of compulsory competitive tendering and we will keep threatening the government's compulsory competitive tendering regime by using UNK and the acquired rights directive as the legal shield to protect our members' jobs and public services from the UNK of this world
the recently launched g m b t and g information pack on the acquired rights directive has been well received all over the country and a revised pack is available here at congress today giving UNK and stewards the latest information and arguments to use to protect members' jobs and conditions
so congress please support composite twelve
motion two nine four refers to the damage that c t has done and in particular the effects upon women
success for contractors has meant unemployment for all but for women work council workers in particular
women who are employed by contractors have often faced worse conditions and even lower pay
many of them are part time workers and many have had their already small number of hours reduced further
private contractors we all know cut corners services decline and women customers and users of the service suffer
most elderly people in this country are women
many rely on council day centres home helps and meals on wheels
many of these services have been UNK or reduced
congress we need good quality public services
women and men who provide these services deserve decent pay and decent conditions
the c e c will campaign for that so please support motion two nine four
motion two nine four refers to the discrimination council workers face as compared to private sector employees particularly in relation to redundancy schemes
council workers outside of london and increasingly within london are no longer allowed to er receive enhanced redundancy schemes
the c e c believes that this is not only unfair but it UNK with local government democracy and free collective bargaining and should be opposed
we fully support the idea of campaigning to change the law to give local authorities the back the power towards enhanced redundancy payments
composite thirteen UNK the UNK current round of government cuts in local government spending and the impact of this on services and on local democracy
the c e c UNK these cuts
as i said earlier our community watch has demonstrated the double UNK of service cuts and job losses
we need to put the blame
mick could you wind up please

could i just say colleagues that the general secretary is proposing that we're having we we're gonna we gonna have the bucket collection as has been referred to during the course of the debate and it's recommended that whatever is in the buckets that the union actually UNK the collection
right colleagues i now propose to call the deputy general secretary to move a further section of the report pages ninety to one hundred and four
tom
formally move er president pages ninety to one hundred and four my section of the report
thank you very much indeed for that tom

thanks very much
the c e c are asking for reference of this particular motion and i ask ann to put the c e c view
ann c e c
the c e c is asking you to refer motion four three seven
the motion calls in the g m b to UNK
this is an organization which provides study schools and briefing materials on international issues
it may well be obvious to the union but at the moment we have too little information to judge
g m b scotland and lancashire region are considering UNK
the c e c recommends that we look at the experience of these regions before we take any decisions nationally
if we refer this motion to the c e cs the international committee will investigate this matter fully once we get reports from scotland and lancashire
please refer motion four three seven
thanks very much ann
do birmingham region accept reference
conference agree
thanks very much indeed
colleagues it's approximately four twenty five what i propose to do is to go on for a short period and to take in the resolutions on the on your erm maastricht erm and then we'll have a look at the time but i think we should be able to get those in within a relatively short period of time
but colleagues it's now my very great pleasure indeed to ask steven hughes member of the european parliament who's deputy leader of the european p l p er to address conference
can i say that
can i say that it gives me particular pleasure to introduce steven not least because steven hughes is one of our colleagues in parliament who does a fantastic job for the trade union movement
another thing about steven hughes conference is that he knows what he's talking about on shop floor UNK issues like health and safety and those colleagues who were present at the launch of the g m b's national health and safety campaign will confirm that especially the way he described the chief executive of the health and safety executive
colleagues steven hughes
thank you president and congress for UNK me the honour to report back on behalf of the ten g m b members in the european parliament
we make up more than a fifth of the european parliamentary labour group in europe which in turn forms a quarter of the socialist group the biggest political block in the european parliament and g m b members cover the full range of parliamentary committees over the years we feel that a vast range of queries and questions UNK by the g m b membership
it hasn't all been smooth running of course i mean working in a parliament with eighty separate national political UNK working in t nine languages i have to admit we've made the odd slip
i will remember one g m b member UNK on the shift in political scene in the u k through the miracle of UNK interpretation
quite what the house when he pointed out that in the u k the UNK is UNK remains
remains something of a mystery but perhaps they took it as a reference to our well known problems with UNK sewer pipes and the directive from europe
or there's the celebrated case of one of our members speaking in last year's debate on the maternity leave directive
she informed an astonished house that each year in britain forty four thousand women get pregnant while at work
until then the french and italian and other UNK had us down as a quiet reserved nation
i suggested that perhaps there was a need to amend er UNK personal protective equipment in the workplace directive
to take account of this previously UNK workplace hazard but so far the commission have brought forward no proposals
but seriously the work we do for the union is only one part of the equation
g m b is very busy and very influential on your behalf at european level and we appreciate what g m b does for us
it's the first and so far only british union to employ a full time officer in brussels giving you direct access to the law making process and e c funds to set up to benefit trade unions
UNK walker UNK is that officer in brussels and is doing a magnificent job on your behalf
the in the last few months alone we've also had visits to brussels by the general secretary the deputy general secretary a number of regional secretaries political officers training officers and others
they've made UNK visits to brussels UNK your interests and meeting with those with greatest influence in the e c institutions
also officers of the union play an active part in the work at the e t u c its industry committees and the full range of e c consultative bodies and i think all of that work pays dividends
i'm a practical sort of person and perhaps i can refer to my area of work as the president said since nineteen eighty four i've concentrated on health and safety and workplace legislation
during all of that time my greatest UNK and adviser in UNK the laws passing through the parliament has been nigel g m b's director of health safety and the environment
some sixty per cent of the amendments that we've adopted in this field have been incorporated in the finished legislation and that means in reality that much of the content of these laws has come from UNK pen the pens of the other trade unionists inside and outside the g m b that he's plugged in to that system extremely worthwhile
we have been fairly busy
six months ago six major e c health and safety directives came into effect covering workplace safety machinery protective equipment manual handling work with computers and word UNK they've built on a framework directive giving workers new rights to consultation and the right to stop the job and the union has been watching the government and the h s e and me as well in their attempts to water down the requirements of these directives and we might well lodge a formal complaint with brussels that could land the tories in UNK court of justice
another thirty health and safety proposals are on the way such as that on working time in the news last week and another to restore the protection for young people at work which we've lost over the last decade and just as important the union has just n not just reacting to what's coming out of brussels it's actually helping set the agenda
due to work by the union the community is now set to act on UNK strain injury something we've UNK on for years and in late june the e c's head of health and safety will share a platform with john and nigel in brussels to launch g m b's campaign to create working environment funds at e c level to channel money to unions and their health and safety work
our health and safety is only one g m b success story
i could refer to the work of our other g m b m e ps
carol UNK outstanding work on the european car industry
UNK hugh UNK pursuit of social legislation
gary UNK work in highlighting the impact of developments in eastern europe and e f t a on european on european industries
the work of michael UNK on and the developing world
alan UNK work on ship building and the UNK industries
barry UNK on the aerospace industries
henry leading work on safety in the offshore industries
UNK work tackling the problems our young people face and the ongoing work of david martin to UNK the european community institutions
or indeed the work that you've just been discussing that we've all pursued jointly in UNK down the government on the transfer of undertakings directive
helping bring their compulsory competitive tendering and privatization plans to a halt up and down the country
as deputy leader of the labour group in europe i look after liaison between our group the parliamentary labour party the t u c and individual trade unions but i can say in all honesty that the individuals just listed play a very important role in giving you access to the possibilities which exist to further your aims in europe
and let me say in a personal capacity that if this link between my group in europe and the trade union movement at home is important i think the UNK link between the trade union movement and the party at home is of crucial importance
to UNK that link would be disaster in my view
but what of the broader picture
well i can't unfortunately avoid mentioning maastricht
it looks as though it will be through UNK in all member states by the end of the year
the clear majority view in my group in brussels is that though not perfect maastricht takes us a step in the right direction setting about building the sense of a community on the market place created by the nineteen eighty seven single act
not everyone has shared that view of course two big questions have caused some to hesitate over maastricht
some of you will still be worried that the targets for UNK limiting public borrowing might lead to cuts in social spending
if that does concern you please get hold of the recent t u c UNK sum UNK advice on the subject from chris UNK economic adviser
that makes it clear that the public debt targets are not rigid they can be UNK applied UNK to take account of unemployment
it also makes it clear that those artificial targets can be revised and that should be the focus of our campaign to make sure that they are revised to make sure that they take account of the real concerns in the real world
levels of investment levels of unemployment
the other cause for concern is the opt out on the social chapter and some have said that should have been enough to cause us to reject maastricht
i'll make just three brief points on the social chapter
first i think it would run completely counter to our UNK traditions to say that because we have a temporary difficulty we don't want the workers of the other er other eleven member states to benefit from a new social chapter
we should instead encourage them to press ahead because it is a temporary difficulty the clock is ticking towards the day when john smith is prime minister will convert that opt out into an opt in
second the opt out will soon begin to UNK at the edges
the commissioner has already made it clear that if it needs to bring its works council proposal on where the consultation and multi UNK through the new chapter it'll include workers in british plants and calculating which firms have to comply and u k firms operating plants on the continent will have to operate the directive there
and third for every new piece of legislation under the new social chapter there'll be a queue of continental employers and governments lodging cases in UNK court of justice over the u k's anti competitive behaviour
the opt out will be UNK and i applaud john 's UNK determination to go to the UNK court if necessary to win the benefits from the new social chapter for british workers
we shouldn't forget either though that we already have a social chapter from the ni nineteen eighty seven act it's not to be UNK at it's given us the directive on the protection of pregnant women at work
it's also given us the new agreement on working time which our own government have tried to work against consistently for the last two years they now say they'll challenge it in UNK court of justice well what they seem to forget is it's gotta come back to parliament for a second reading yet and they've created such ill feeling in the parliament and among the commission that it's likely to be UNK we're gonna end up with a UNK agreement on working time by the autumn of this year
so president to conclude i think it's now necessary to look beyond maastricht to look to nineteen ninety six and the next set of inter UNK conferences and beyond
as a movement we need to campaign to make sure that the convergence criteria of the monetary union reflect our concern and not of the UNK
we need to press the case for the social chapter but above all else we the left need to take the initiative in pursuing a strategy for employment and growth in europe
as members of the party of european UNK we are taking the lead in that campaign
with twenty million unemployed in the european community the response from the edinburgh summit was pathetic
what was agreed there will lead to an injection of no more than twenty four billion into the european economy
that UNK to the seventy billion pounds that japan recently UNK into its own economy on feeling an economic cold coming on
the UNK of national governments is UNK the fear the UNK and UNK which UNK the front UNK in france the UNK party in germany the UNK in holland and the other strains of UNK throughout europe
we must defeat that fear of UNK and UNK especially among the young
we must reject absolutely a europe where your freedom of movement will depend on the colour of your skin
the party of european UNK is UNK a european programme for jobs growth and recovery to be UNK employment intensive areas of growth to tackle the pattern and distribution of work to increase opportunities for employment rather than re cycling unemployment and all of this to recognize that growth alone will not be enough
we will put opportunity in place of despair renewal in place of UNK and hope in place of fear
in this i look forward to our continued partnership g m b and the labour movement
next year we have the european parliament elections the only national test before the next general election
i know you'll be there to play your part in that campaign
sisters and brothers let's continue to work and campaign and together to create a europe with a future rather than one locked in the past
thank you
thank you
thanks very much indeed steven
colleagues er there are a number of motions that i have mentioned on europe the first one being motion four one o the treaty on european union be moved by southern region
congress mr president steven southern region moving motion four one o on the maastricht treaty
colleagues if we believe in playing the full part in the european community then as steven hughes has just said we as a union must back the maastricht treaty
the maastricht treaty is the only framework which currently exists for UNK the european UNK role in UNK european integration
it UNK important responsibilities to the european community in the key areas of consumer policy research and development education and training industrial policy the environment and UNK rights
for the first time colleagues the community will be able to legitimately address these issues and UNK action into ensuring the e c is a people's europe and not just a business europe
poorer regions of the community are specifically addressed in the treaty to the establishment of a new fund which will help kick start industry in those areas which are disadvantaged due either to failing industry or to their position on the of europe
not only that but all regions will have a direct say in european affairs at e c level thanks to the creation of a new community institution the committee of the regions
the g m b should welcome this move which will give elected regional representatives a direction say in issues affecting their region and we should recognize the successful efforts made by labour in the house of commons to ensure the democratic accountability of these representatives
of course UNK attempts to deal with a number of important political issues
colleagues don't be UNK by the anti europe brigade who believe that the treaty is about and UNK which UNK the front UNK in making the existing institutions more democratic
too much power lies with the council of ministers who meet in secret making it almost impossible for the public national governments and the european parliament to follow their decision making process
such UNK heavily against democratic scrutiny and it is unacceptable in a modern democracy
maastricht deals directly with its problem by giving new powers and scrutiny to the european parliament which means that decisions cannot be made unless both council and parliament agree
of course there are weaknesses in the treaty particularly from a u k point of view and it would be wrong to lead this union to believe otherwise
steven mentioned the constraints that the e m u may impose on the economy but the biggest single issue is the UNK position in which this government has placed british workers by opting out of a social chapter and thus denying the right and protection at work which are granted taken for granted as minimum basic conditions in all other member states
but as steven also said this was no reason for labour to vote against the treaty
what this union must do and what labour must do is campaign for the earliest possible opt in to the social chapter
to conclude colleagues the maastricht treaty the dynamic evolution of the european community from where the single act in nineteen eighty six left off
the treaty is not written on tablets of stone it allows for changes and improvements as early as nineteen ninety six
our european priorities now should be to campaign for the sort of policies and changes we would like to see in nineteen ninety six and seek the earliest possible opt in to the social chapter
this is a battle which must be fought and won by the trade union movement now in post maastricht europe
i move
seconder for four one o
charlie southern region seconding motion four one o
the reason the trade union movement should support the maastricht treaty is it's the only treaty that is on offer there's nothing else on offer but it's a reasonable treaty it has differences in the u k and the reasons it has differences in the u k is the one mr major came back last december tell us what a wonderful opportunity it was for britain what a wonderful success it was for britain that he'd opted out of the social chapter
yet the other eleven nations of europe opted into the social chapter
what's so different about workers in the u k to difference of workers in germany france spain UNK and UNK
workers in the u k demand the protection of the social chapter
what the european movement needs to do the labour movement in europe labour and socialist parties in europe is to monitor the maastricht treaty because it is not necessarily the best thing since UNK bread there are problems with it
full and economic monetary union could be a problem handled in the wrong way this could create large unemployment in countries
it could give and take away the rights of states to alter UNK and problems but handled correctly it can be dealt with properly
it's an issue we need to monitor but the best way forward is for us to do that under the labour movement
next comes the social chapter
why are we different in the u k why can't we have our rights
the easiest way we can get back into the social chapter is to accept maastricht without maastricht there is no social chapter with maastricht we can opt back in to the social chapter
now a couple of weeks ago a man called mr UNK actually resigned i understand or was he sacked i'm not quite sure but when he disappeared off the scene mr major said i am still keeping forward with my policies
well if he's keeping forward with his policies why did he have to sack the man
the man forgot one issue the european monetary union it was mr major that took us into the economic monetary union at the wrong way he took us in on a political decision on the last day of a labour party conference in blackpool and he's forgotten that
now it was also interesting that after he forgot that two weeks ago we had his own minister david hunt crying on the steps of brussels about the fact that the forty eight hour week had been passed by a majority vote with only him opting out
he was really upset about that but maastricht gave us the ability that we could ex have that in britain on a majority decision
i think we should support maastricht i think it's the only way forward
thank you
motion four one midland region to move
just wait there
congress president ed london region westminster trade union political UNK branch er speaking on a free vote for the london region but speaking in opposition to motion four one o
congress before you vote on this motion i think you should read it carefully and consider er the what could possibly happen if it's passed
the g m b if it passes this motion we welcoming a proposal to extend majority voting in the council of ministers to new areas
now at the moment that might seem quite a good idea we have a very right wing tory government and europe seems very reasonable
in a few years' time hopefully we might have a different situation where we have people like UNK and the right wing in france trying to block things that er a british labour government wants to do
with majority voting the european commission and the council of ministers can put things through that may not be in the labour party's and our interests
secondly i i'd point out that it UNK the community becoming more involved in industrial policy
now this also could mean that under a future labour government if they wish to support certain industries they will not be allowed to do so by the european community
thirdly and i find it most worrying it states here that this motion UNK the concept of european UNK which throughout th through the UNK treaty will give e c citizens the right to vote and stand in european and local elections wherever they UNK in the community
now colleagues at the last elections we lost two or three seats on votes of overseas british citizens
it's not beyond the wit of the tories to move in european people into the country into this country in certain seats from the right in europe to make sure those seats are won for them again and i think it's an extremely dangerous precedent to allow european voting if you're not if you're just resident within britain rather than a citizen
lastly it UNK the house of commons to proceed the to the earliest possible UNK of the maastricht treaty preferably with but it doesn't say definitely with the social chapter
now the maastricht treaty without the social chapter is just a charter for business
it takes away any
can you wind up you've now got the
it takes away all the rights from british workers because the other eleven will have it and we won't and will make it a UNK economy
i urge you to consider very carefully before you vote and to oppose
motion er four one europe midland region
linda midland and east coast region
motion four one europe
president congress
when this resolution was put together my branch was very UNK with maastricht
i stress we are not anti europe and nor was this meant to be a UNK motion but we are very UNK about any deal negotiated by any member of this government
they play musical chairs in the cabinet but the same UNK are still there with one UNK exception but they're still bad people
john some time this week you will tell us in the midland region that a package is just that no picking the bits out you either vote for the package or against
maastricht was a package and major kept the bits in he wanted for his supporters and opted out of the things that he didn't want first and foremost being the social chapter
he said it would cost industry too much he wants to keep a low wage low skill labour force
constantly in fear of losing their jobs and joining the massive ranks of the unemployed but an employment is bankrupt in this country unemployment caused by tories and which we all know brings suffering to our people and let's face it how long is the rest of europe going to put up with britain attracting overseas companies because they can get away with abusing and UNK our workers
a united economic policy in europe depends on all countries adopting the social chapter and its provisions
at the g m b centenary congress i spoke from the platform seconding a document on europe and i expressed my fears and hopes along with a lot of other delegates
without the social chapter a lot of our hopes cannot be fulfilled
why didn't we start raising hell straight away after maastricht
i could UNK with frustration when i go around seeing the conditions some of our people work in the UNK they have paid young people hung around on street corners with no job and no real training
we need the european social chapter to bring unscrupulous employers into light
we can only go so far as union UNK
voting for maastricht and hoping that the tories can be beaten at a later date on the social chapter was a decision i found difficult to accept and i have done my homework on this issue
i felt once again the working class in this country has been let down but i am aware that the treaty has gone through the commons making this motion out of date
president with a very heavy heart and bitter disappointment for all our people out there who are depending on the social chapter to give them dignity safety and a reasonable UNK standard of living i UNK withdraw this motion but i will say this we live to fight another day
was the mo was the motion formally seconded before it was withdrawn
formally seconded
thanks very much
we we'll come back to er whether you accept that or not
motion four one three e c works councils lancashire move er region to move
UNK lancashire region speaking on motion four one three
president congress
european work council's probably a subject of which most people here know very little
so briefly it was started in the er late sixties early seventies companies with over a thousand employees which had their member states er at least nine hundred of them at the moment that particular covering at least thirteen point six million people
well this is growing all the time due to UNK and UNK
at the moment they're just a voluntary body but it looks as though works councils will become mandatory for eleven of the twelve states in the e c with the implementation very soon of the european social works council directive britain as usual being the odd one out because of course it's part of the social chapter
UNK shepherd told other e c ministers
UNK i'm sorry to interrupt you colleagues you're starting to UNK a bit i know you all want to get to the european fair and the wine and the cheese and all that sort of thing just bear with us for about ten minutes
thank you er UNK shepherd told other e c ministers that she and virtually every employer's organization in europe remained strongly opposed to the proposals and said it should be left to companies at local level to council workers
however the european commission and most e c governments UNK this and UNK that legislation is needed to ensure that workers are not kept in the dark about decisions taken elsewhere in the community that could affect their UNK
now colleagues we come to the UNK question of election to these bodies
this is why the resolution was placed in the agenda in the first place
your question of how people come to be members of these bodies seems to be UNK in mystery
i've heard from people who have visited brussels that meetings were being cancelled because the british delegation were not even members of the trade union but looking at the structure of the works councils in the u k this is no wonder
could i please quote from the bargaining report document dated twenty seventh of april nineteen ninety three which says and i quote works councils elected bodies representing the whole workforce are becoming an increasing interest to the u k trade unionists and this par this in part because of the growing awareness of industrial relation structures in the rest of the e c
well this form of employee representation is common but the prospect that it be could begin to be introduced through the european works council directive
what's interesting also growing cos the election employee representation is something which trade unionists are beginning to face as a result of initiative they'd taken by u k employers
these bodies are often called company councils employee councils advisory councils as well as works councils and as yet are far removed from the works councils elsewhere in europe
a group of unions has endorsed proposals put forward by the UNK and partnership association a document towards industrial partnership was signed in september nineteen ninety two by the general secretaries of the a w e u a u t b i f u the g m b i m s f n c u c w and
this document accepts that the traditional trade union approach to employee representation has been that the single channel for th for the representation should be through trade union membership now just listen to this colleagues
a non unionist should have no right to representation but believes it is now time to change to change this attitude
it therefore states that many british trade unionists now suggest that we need a new industrial relations institution where a wide agenda of issues can be discussed between managers and employee representatives that work company level
it considers that in return for this new institutional arrangement many trade unions have accepted the idea
UNK i think you're gonna need to wind up you're getting close to your time
well er basically the i want to ask our general secretary i if this is the case er non trade union members can indeed elect represent representatives in councils and i say that there should be any election to these bodies should be by the usual manner by union representatives in the workplace i move
thanks UNK
jimmy okay
well i think paul on behalf of the c e c will pick that particular point up that you made and respond to it
yes jim
it's alright you always wanted to be a star
right jim
right
lancashire region UNK er seconding motion four one three
president congress most councils may well work to the good effect in germany france and other e c countries but with the tory government in britain it would be foolish to believe the trade union would play a great major role in those works councils
i am not sure at the moment if the labour are sure if they would work under the labour government
as of the tories as we're not going to for non trade unions where employees are hand picked by their employer
therefore i must ensure that trade unions of representatives at works councils are not trade unions
i support
thanks jim
motion four one four liverpool region
ken liverpool north wales irish region moving motion four one four
president congress conference i know we will all welcome all the pressure that we can be brought to this government and its pursuit of policies if that's the right world policies that don't have a direction would just have them from one crisis to another
bill UNK victory was a victory for morale while european law is a more practical help in our efforts
leading up on this as the members state at the e c i believe we should not only have for the benefits of the european legislation to protect employees but also to seek form and strengthen links with the european union
if multi national companies exist and dividing UNK against workers for their own games we should organize cooperate and perhaps even UNK to resist the combat to co to combat common problems and disputes second or third class nation will not service british workers but will undermine the nations
we would not and do not like them ma UNK and UNK of workers anywhere in the world
we must investigate and act to utilize what ways we can to defeat such abuse and division
traditional stance of unity
UNK of water and sea to is that unity is strength and workers of this union this country and europe and even beyond
united we will never be defeated
i move

motion four one five eastern europe london region to move
dave london region moving er whatever it is
as the trade union movement has found out in recent times sometimes to its painful cost modern capitalism and exploitation does not recognize international UNK and employers and their political supporters are not slow to export their practices to countries whose borders have previously been closed to them
the opening of east european borders has provided new opportunities for UNK free UNK and with it the exploitation of the workers in these countries
right wing politicians including our own tory party and those with even more dubious UNK and european employers are already active and working under the UNK of economic UNK and UNK
as an UNK labour organization we must also stretch our wings and offer help and expertise to our fellow workers in these countries
whatever UNK workers share common problem and fears low pay poor health and safety job security poor training and poor social conditions
these are all international problems UNK only by cooperation and solidarity within the labour movement
western trade unions have both the resources and the expertise to assist the workers in forming active free trade unions to combat from counter balance the free market economy now being constructed in eastern europe
help and advice will also be needed in their input in setting up a democratic political system allowing them and their members full expression and protection
it is UNK on us to be part of this assistance whether it be financial practical or political
the consequences of ignoring their plight will not only UNK them but it will strengthen employers as they take the opportunity to export jobs to wherever labour is cheapest and protection UNK
west german trade unions have already had to take action to re to prevent their government from denying equal conditions to workers in the former east germany
we too must play our part
it will not always be easy attempts are always made to divide workers whether by nationalism racism or UNK
colleagues do not let us UNK from our responsibilities to our fellow workers and this attempt to international solidarity
support this motion
i move
thanks very much
is that seconded
alan london region seconding motion four one five eastern europe
president congress already for former communist countries of eastern europe are attracting invest investment from multi national companies from the west who see rich UNK from the those foot in the door investments
once they have a controlling interest they will want a very high return for their money and the cost well that will be borne by the workers in terms of lower health and safety standards massive labour cuts from industry that is admittedly out dated and labour UNK
in poland for instance the approach to work is a much more UNK one
that would change with labour cuts er sorry that would change with labour costs roughly one sixth of that in the u k
the door is wide open for their exploitation britain is being UNK as the UNK or the UNK of europe and the government are UNK the virtues of investment in britain for its cheap labour costs well how much more then do the workers of poland UNK and rest need protection from the money hungry the power crazy multi UNK of the west
there is a parallel between east and west a slippery slope that we dare not set foot on
a competition for companies to follow the cheapest labour could well UNK and the UNK the labour force both east and west
the input from our union er suggested by the motion is needed now
eastern european workers must be informed on what to expect and how best to deal with it
the need for that is plain the time for that is now
this must be an ongoing and er this must be an ongoing commitment by the g m b and we would ask that the executive report back on the situation in eastern european regularly and at least at every annual congress
please support the motion
thanks very much
colleagues the c e c are now accepting all the motions and i call paul er paul to put a view concerning a qualification with one of them
paul
thank you president
erm europe a very complex issue
the resolutions and the UNK contribution show that very clearly
as the president said the c e c are asking you to support four one o four one three er with the qualification i'll give you later four one four and four one five and er just thank you linda for making me write up all the notes about that resolution and pulling out at the last minute
thank you very much mate very pleased
you know we're only gonna get the best from european initiatives when we start realizing we must deal with the present in order to shape the future remembering the cruel lessons many of us have learned particularly during the last twelve years
i admit to being a healthy euro UNK at times UNK by fears of the UNK of my UNK the great british UNK that's a sausage not norman UNK
well i dunno though
yes norman UNK you're right erm even the UNK was suggested that the square sausage which seemed possible on the basis of the conversion of UNK tables and if you don't know what the square sausage is the g m b scotland delegates will only be too happy er to give you the answer
ed spoke erm from my own region in opposition to four one o
ed erm you spoke on the basis of concern for the future
ed i've got some news for ya there's actually need every scrap of help we can get right now and anything that comes out of europe that gives us that assistance needs our support
european directives on acquired rights and the transfer of undertakings regulations have given public service shop stewards their first UNK of light over c t which they fought for a decade with little more than their own UNK and courage
the house of lords today will see UNK and thatcher that pair of b UNK
i nearly slipped up there dick i UNK i nearly slipped up there president and called them slippery dog UNK toe UNK i'm glad i avoided that one
the demand for a referendum over maastricht is described as a healing positive thing for the conservative party
healing i wouldn't give it penicillin if had vietnam of UNK and in growing UNK all at the same time
now i'm going to try and deal with the qualification
four one three the c e c agrees with the movements of motion four one three that european works councils should as far as possible be made up of elected trade union representatives but the european directive needs to take account of different industrial relations traditions in different countries
british trade unionists have therefore been pushing for a slightly different wording that european works council representatives should be elected by current workers' representatives wherever they exist
this would ensure that the organized sites at least representatives would be an elected trade unionist
that's the qualification from the c e c
thank you
thanks very much paul
colleagues i propose to take the vote
c e c are UNK recommending acceptance of four one o all those in favour
against
that's carried
motion four one the region have indicated they'd prepared to withdraw
does conference accept withdrawal
thanks very much
motion four one three recommended to accept
all those in favour
against
that's carried
motion four one four to accept all those in favour
against that's carried
similarly four one five you're being recommended to accept
all those in favour
against
and that's carried
colleagues just before we adjourn till nine thirty tomorrow morning i would just like to make one or two comments
er don't forget the crawley strikers the bucket collection will be taken at the door as you go out every pound is worth two as the general secretary has UNK said
don't expect that to continue by the way
don don't forget as well colleagues the euro fair evening when you can meet the new european officer for the union that's er UNK immediately after this session being held in the lord UNK hall guest speakers include steven UNK alison and barry
samples of european food and wine will be available in what quantities i do not know
there'll be a fringe event on the child support act between five thirty and seven thirty er in commission room number three
some colleagues are giving me some messages to read out it wouldn't be appropriate to do so today because colleagues they er forget them so i'm gonna do them tomorrow which will be more appropriate so please don't think that i've er forgotten them
colleagues equally i want you to extend a warm UNK welcome to two of our parliamentary mps that support the trade union movement george UNK and gerald colleagues
anybody interested in going to the theatre from tonight onwards a member of the g m b if they've produced a ticket you'll get it for half price at the king's theatre
that means delegates will only pay one seventy five and two fifty er produce your UNK and you'll get it half price
conference stands adjourned till nine thirty tomorrow morning
thank you very much
so
she was like a dog with a bone
oh i know
wasn't she let it
yeah
go
well you see especially as well with the UNK we've got at the moment
that's right yes
i mean it's
in fact as soon as i walked in i wasn't allowed to go to my desk until i promised her i would get the computer out
first before i did anything else
if you didn't get it out at that time it'd be half past eleven and she'd lose two hours
martin wasn't very happy though was he when he came
no
in the morning to you
well she should have shifted it all up to yours
i know
she's supposed to have taken it off
yes
ooh
i don't know if it would affect
anybody in york
in there
yes
i can't think see UNK already got t quite a lot of scale two time
she's scale two anyway
yeah
and she'll she's one off so i mean she'd never go to p
no
anyway
don't think she would no
it would only be if somebody was off on long term sickness or
only when i keep getting her to do all this typing for me
yeah but look at that in a week i mean
and look i mean she'd never spend
two hours a week
forty percent of her time because she does it so quickly but er oh
being tied to reception though you see j UNK likely to do quite a lot because she's got to stay there so you've got to
yes
rather than giving her any other jobs
yes
yes
yeah
erm
right so i'll erm sort of see what i can do with julie
quite nice
i don't know if she's at the top of one yet i imagine she probably
she will be yeah
yeah i'm sure she is
she will she's been
yeah
yeah
here four years
yeah
and i'm not sure i can't remember which i don't know whether she started on the bottom or the bottom i've a feeling she may be didn't start on the bottom actually
no i don't think she did
mm
no
so
so it would take her two UNK into scale two
mm mhm
which you know is an advantage in other ways as well i think because if you know she's being paid scale two you know other responsibility comes with it as well
yes
that's right
even though she's getting it for the technology
yeah
mm
i mean i do think that w what we would have to do is if people started making UNK into two via this route it might mean then we'd get to the point where it wasn't going to cost that much more to enable other scale one people
mm
to do that
because i still think this is very much UNK on the people like UNK for example i know she's got a little bit of scale two but i still think the reception is such a big responsibility
mm
and particularly
mm
in a big office like york
mm
the thing is a couple of UNK is not a great deal of money is it
you swing you multiply it around the council it makes a difference
yeah
but within an office
yeah
it's
mm
i mean what do you get paid
a pound a week extra
me
yeah
yeah
that's cos i'm only half time i'd get two pound if i were
yeah
full time
and you're
some pe some people would think it wasn't worth it but erm
isn't is it
well if you look at it if you look at it if you look
financially
at it for responsibility and financial reasons and if you log down every bit that you spent doing admin assistant and e o then you'd say stuff this for a game of soldiers but you don't
mm
do it purely for that reason do you
mm
in
oh no but if you look at the responsibility an e o hasn't got for scale three why are we UNK ourselves to death on scale four
oh but that's the same for erm kevin as well isn't it
especially
yeah
when kevin doesn't get paid overtime and careers officers
mm
m most of the careers officers that are on si scale six are taking more money home than kevin is
yeah it's true yeah
that's right you don't want to
so it's just the organization
doesn't make it right no but
situation so mm
yeah
yeah i suppose
no i was actually getting at a certain person that works for UNK that doesn't think it's worth extra hassle for a hundred and eighty pounds more a year
yeah and it's the difference between that is isn't it that somebody that's in the post will not give as much as another person in the same post
mm
but what can you do
mm
it's down to that individual isn't it
how they view
yeah
you know if that person in project UNK got a much easier for her scale four than you
mm
well i mean there's the other thing is the differential around the county cos there was a time when
waiting for sheila to retire cos
whe
i'm gonna love one member of staff to look after
when the area career
she's only got one to UNK so she can only have one
i wouldn't let her UNK
wonderful job
erm
yeah you'd have to work for deborah then
yeah
you'd have to work for deborah you'd love that
i know and to be quite honest with you the other day
you don't have to work with deborah
i'm not sure between her and tony UNK so busy looking into
he's going so busy looking on what's going on behind the question that's being asked that you never answer the question that you're being asked in the first place
me as well actually i did one of your tricks sue i mean we'd done something i mean is it li liz went in and said and would you like to report tony on what you've discussed and i just spoke he never even got a got chance to say one other sentence i'm just doing a
taking over
me that didn't know what to do i wasn't gonna participate
yeah well
oh i know what i was gonna quickly go through the i was going through the training wasn't i
so there's the
yeah
technology bit then there was UNK was identified that m management training was needed for all line managers
erm yes so there's a variety of things there
careers UNK that was quite a good point but we've actually t got a group of professionals working within the service we need to make sure they have access to other professional UNK and staff development that would be
mm
appropriate to them
rather than just appropriate to the careers service
mm
mm
erm but the more general training er sort of across the board that came up for staff in general was certain things that are bound to happen for example on course training will happen
update on h e c g software negotiation skills train the trainers group work resources presentation skills interviewing skills m marketing our guidance adult update for e os the with the unemployed employer work personnel skills recruitment and interviewing skills employer legislation update UNK of guidance careers guidance agreements management training business financial management UNK skills supervision of UNK appraisal interviewing skills careers education and guidance for careers officers in equal opportunities
i asked liz specifically to put on the list this one that i try trying to do with e os the group work one
mm
yes it's being asked all the time
because alan said it would be i know
and er alan keeps saying you can do it but you have to wait to the next programme coming through and i specifically asked for liz to put it on
now i'm not sure
come under that you think
i don't know
in fact we've had a couple of meetings recently kevin with erm the employment office looking at their changing role
yeah
and certainly from the first meeting that we had which is only a month ago that was one of the things one of the outcomes
yeah
was that erm jane erm has put down that take place and your name and i said
mm
i would i would help
mm
if it was necessary
mm
so i
did she do me a note to raise that we've got a follow up meeting erm about this training
i think it's
cos i've had er you might have had the west one to me again well not just recently but just er a month ago saying is it still on is it still going to happen
it
yeah it UNK for
yeah it was UNK for
the
have you got a date
we've not no
no alan's not given me the go ahead really to do
i mean he sort of
yeah
said it'd be for april you see
next budget
right
yeah it was the two training aspects that came out of that meeting one was
that's right it was all
training in c v workshops and the other one was presentation skills and group work skills
oh yes
that's quite a good idea isn't it
cos we have to
yeah
give that advice all the time
mm
th yeah well what we said
yeah
was we wanted
yeah
something you know
good idea that
if we're going to get into helping people to draw up c UNK then we need training in that area
job search skills
training yeah
well that yeah good thinking
because it is it's very
there's a handout there which we talked
mm
about an er
and said that's one of the things we can do
do
th these are things that we need to look at
yeah
and if we can do it we need to be
so that e os need to be looking at how to help with interview
okay
mm
techniques
yeah
er what you know how what to expect
yeah
erm use of computers er how so al help you filling in job search so these
yeah
are the sort of things
yeah
that also saying you
yeah
know we'd like
good
training on those
mm
erm and in group sessions and also with e t you know training for work as well
training for work as it
yeah
is at the moment
er presentation skills
yeah
much wider role
mm
in
so there's quite a lot
sounds about right
follow up meeting's next friday a week today and i've written it in my diary so i'll make sure i bring it up then
can i just say that er ray phoned me up the other day and he said er would you be prepared to take part in UNK er regional UNK sort of training day er which is at coming up er in a few months time to give erm presentation skills er i part of what we were doing erm but just those o h ps that we did on that part
and that was quite interesting
mm
erm so i said okay
have to go along and sort that out
he did mention to me now i'd forgotten until
mm
you mentioned it but he
yeah
had mentioned to me actually
yeah
it was purely just on that part because ray brian was doing other w other in fact group work skills
mhm
mm
the other bit to them and there was
yeah
a couple of sessions purely on the actual no public speaking that's right it was actually public speaking rather than
yeah
have you worked with brian before
i dunno his name's so familiar
see you
see you bye
he's alright
right
i didn't really think it was going to take me very long to go through that sorry
but i mean it brought up a lot of things that we perhaps
it did yeah
needed to talk about anyway didn't it
so we'd already touched on haven't we
by taking
yeah
away stuff yeah
right are we going to finish at half twelve
mhm
yeah sounds reasonable
so if we try and tackle the staff appraisal at least
yeah
before lunch
right no problems
this sorted out staffing for the office diane
yes
right we've been UNK this discussion i know erm because we've not sort of felt er we've not fitted it into previous meetings
just to sort of update on where we're at with it
i've been done and bill's been done
UNK been done but i've not given him anything back in writing yet which i've go to do
erm next stage have you done diane or UNK
no have i arranged a day with UNK but then i
the day is set
realized
right
we didn't have the yellow booklets so
ah and i've not brought them with me they're in my office sorry
i said i'd bring them today didn't i
yes
and i
but i might have to cancel it on what UNK said
yeah
why
what does deborah
cos they've not been trained yet
yeah and then she did keep speaking
cos they've not had a three hour training sessions
out very strongly didn't she
sorry th they
who's they
they were supposed to come back to the offices and do a three hour training
mm training
session with all staff
remember
well it was talked about but oh
wouldn't be us cos we went to the
yes
yeah
no we had to do it
training
yeah but we've got to do the training
we were
we were trained to train
yes but what i meant is it doesn't stop us being
no
no
no UNK wasn't there
can't be UNK then but i mean
yeah no
i
yes
to my next thing
can i have a little plaster please
oh what you done
just a paper cut but
ooh
i'd go home if i were you
not my office
UNK is stupid so all altered and all
UNK
the numbers are changed and
oh no
what are you telling me for
have a bandage is okay
i don't need a bandage
are you allergic to UNK
if there's not a little one there i've got a
you see a thin one
just a thin one
i've got a little one
do you want to do the UNK
no that's alright
cos i've got erm maybe we need some more
do you want a dirty UNK wrap round
no
cos i hurt my finger the other day
we're keep anything here now
no but technically
oh i know technically
you are allowed to keep them but in a centred box
what
UNK
i know but where else do keep 'em know where they are
cos the allergic reaction not allowed to
well
UNK are not part of a first aid box
you should not
so the only thing you've got is something just to wrap round
oh i know
that's about it
useless but i mean they should come out of somebody's UNK under their own personal supply
yeah same with UNK
along with the UNK
yeah if they have a reaction
bottles and bottles
it's their own fault
it hasn't come out of a first aid
office yeah
yeah
well we UNK have UNK in there but that's why
as long as it's not in that green box it doesn't they have been to check on us i mean
i think all staff have their big bottles in their UNK somewhere
yeah we did but a while ago
health and safety yeah
co couple of years of ago
safety inspectors yeah
well i don't know who put that box of UNK in there
no i don't
jackie husband's doing it i'm sure that we'll
yes
all be investigated
yeah they can actually just turn up and say let's have a look at your box
right if we can get back to the appraisal
oh we'll take it out after
erm
husband got a job
mm
yes training to be a UNK inspector
oh right
mm
right yeah i i've got a i need to set a date with catherine an appraisal and then we'll be are you not looking forward to it
i am not
it'll be good it was good wasn't it kevin
actually i thought it was fun yeah
it's just that i dunno i mean
the ones i've
yeah
so far had
yeah
got erm well we never got anywhere i never got anything back and it was just a total i was a UNK pig
well we do get a positive f
i think a i think actually who you have 'em with like with sue i mean i was quite positive about this er i can understand you sort of just w who did you have 'em with before
my two best friends jeff and peter
that's right
yeah
so
they're i don't i have a f you know they're i dunno
well i mean i think i certainly feel positive based
mm
on the experience so far really
mm
and
what i'm sorry i switched off a couple of minutes ago
of the of the
we're talking about c e t
what do you think
no appraisal
appraisal yes
yes
yes i found it useful yeah
and you written your targets for me yet bill
no i've started them though
right
i've started i've not written i know but i've started
thinking about it okay
well i have i have a problem with spending three hours training staff in the office
i mean let's face it it's not realistic
kevin and bill and i have discussed this we don't think it's realistic
i mean whether we think it's necessary or not is another matter
yes t i can't see that happening
everybody's supposed to have a go at
how
UNK somebody and being UNK
so they can appreciate what the situation is
well i mean i did those pilot appraisals
mm
here last year
well yeah cos everybody's
gone through it here
yeah
i mean
yes we had quite a lot of pilot
yeah
in york
what we'd proposed
and me
what we were going to propose was that k when kevin bill and i met and we talked about this we said let's prepare i volunteered actually to prepare a summary sheet
yeah
of the main points that training would cover
and that we would issue those summary sheets at a staff meeting and we would go through it at a staff meeting and that probably that was as much as we could do
yeah
by way of ensuring staff knew what was going on and had something by way of training
but
mm
managed it
and UNK
would they have had the three hour thing
yes
yes
away from the office as well wasn't it
night out
i agree i'm was winding you up
i mean that because deborah kept going on and on and on about this three hour thing didn't she
all the time she kept coming back to it
when you go and do your three hour training sessions didn't she
well the point she was trying to make was that the it d the appraisal interview would be so s so easy because the staff will know exactly what
what
to do you know so what be these sort of
and what to expect and what
queries and barriers that you're bringing out
it's going to be all so smooth because they've had three hour training
but as soon they've had an appraisal then they will know what it involves
yeah
and because you're having the pre appraisal thing
yeah
it's to set it all in context they understand before they come
that's right
i mean that's like the really the training isn't it
for them
but surely if they got the yellow book and had we sent them off in a room to actually read that book
mm
three hours
mm
t no
mm
but instead of try and fit it
mm
while they're doing something
yes
else but give everybody an hour off
mm
their UNK to go and read the
yeah
book somewhere quiet
and as you saying a summary sheet and
mm
a quick half hour's
mm
any questions
that should be enough
should be enough for anybody
yeah
you see my point was i'd i mean i kept saying to her has this got to take place
and she kept saying yes and i kept saying in every division
and she kept saying yes
so whatever we we'd said to her she was coming back all the time wasn't she
that this had got to take place
cos only
you mean she'll be UNK for me then
but because that i mean that b
harrogate
no she'll be UNK for everybody else because only harrogate and UNK
but we can say also that the we're not new appraisals th we've been through the pilot
mm
i mean
yeah
we can use
that's right
that argument to
mm
to support i think for
i'm just say
but was it only those two that had done it or was it
no UNK not done it
and who's
northallerton
well i asked for those
i get there the impression that northallerton spend half of their time in staff meetings so i'd be surprised
mm
if they'd not done it
we asked our employer our employment UNK group yesterday
mm
and UNK hadn't had the opportunity to discuss anything with
a lot of careers officers meetings then
oh right well definitely not employment staff because they've not even managed to even
she's not even managed to show it anybody
mm
well that makes me feel a lot better
yeah it made me feel better actually because i had the same impression as you
anyway
anyway
when bill and kevin and i looked at how we could cope with appraisal in our division the numbers didn't work out as badly at least as i thought they were going to originally
erm the way that we see it is that i would UNK kevin bill and cath initially and that oh this is just UNK isn't it
and that bill UNK who are you going to UNK
the careers offices UNK and diane here
right
we actually said UNK as well but UNK lo probably have left selby
yes
by the time i get back to it
yes
right
and i did charlotte eventually
you could always do her first so that doesn't
that's a good idea cath
well
remember that
i don't er i don't see any relevance in that because she's not you
can't set targets for
no
her that i'm
yes
not going to be responsible for
no you're right
but bill's going to do charlotte
yeah when she's been here long enough
yes
but you don't do anybody until they've be here for six months
and you don't do any
six twelve
she down the other day didn't she
no it's six months
alright
and you don't
i wasn't here kevin i missed it
and you don't bring do anybody that's in er
she's coming down next month
c g part two
so that UNK a few people you see
or temporary contracts
or temporary contracts yeah
well that UNK
not that quite a few
quite a lot at the moment but hopefully won't shortly
so when we went through it kevin was going to do all of the careers officers in york but didn't need to do mary because she's part of the adult team and therefore jane and julie will have to sort her
thank god for that
won't happen to j
wouldn't have to do UNK because she's a UNK wouldn't have to do denise
cos we don't know what her UNK going to be
not really worth it is she
and that if cath did all of the clerical staff and then eventually UNK and mary once they become in service long enough oh they probably are already aren't they
i think they are yeah
yeah
well mary and UNK
but that i kevin would stick with the careers officers cos it fits in very well with his team leader role with the careers offices in york
so that i wouldn't get involved with careers officers i'd actually make a jump and that i would do the three wise UNK and hilary
the three wise UNK
they sit in a long line in york yeah
we don't have to mention names
the one thing that
no you don't have to i've seen them
does worry me and i don't think any provisions have been done for it and that is UNK
right
and i think it would be very useful for her to have an appraisal
oh yeah
i mean having great
oh yeah
difficulty in working out whether she's understanding what we've said now in the way of instructions until it comes back
but you're down
s
to do her
so what sort of provision do you mean cath
taught her how to do
write it down we're supposed to do
does she sign or not
i'm not sure
cos we could have somebody in to help that's all i'm thinking if she says yeah i'm sure you could get something from
mm
well that's why i'm asking what do i do
social services
mm
but i don't think she is very good at signing i don't think it's her main way of communicating
she's quite good at lip reading
it'll just take you longer to do
it's a it's more you understanding
because she i can't understand what she says to me
no that's the trouble
that's the embarrassing
yeah
thing
i can't understand a word
mm
well you see as part of the appraisal thing if you get w when we've done it so far we've got people to actually and i did myself one of the stages after the preliminary meeting is to complete a self assessment or to go through some self assess assessments self appraisal
now certainly when i did it i wrote some notes which i then talked through with alan kevin wrote some notes which he then talked through with me
now obviously if UNK did that she could write some notes in a form that was actually UNK for you so that you could actually i mean i know the discussion would be more difficult but you would have quite a lot of information from her to go on
i wonder whether it might be useful to get somebody in from social services side anyway to help to identify some other problems that i'm having
yeah
perhaps and how you might overcome them
i think i think she will probably have an UNK she's a very bright girl i'm sure she'd have an awful lot to contribute
mm
yeah
mm
so but that might be one of the things that you need to look at i mean once sh she may have UNK because of the difficulties in communicating with other staff and
mm
yourself
that might be a target to overcome
yeah
and social services will be able to advise on that
mm
i mean there must
mm
be a social worker for the hearing UNK
jackie should be able to recommend somebody
yeah
erm that could come up come along to that meeting with UNK agreement
erm
or even to talk to UNK specifically UNK about that and h how to approach
yes
something like this
mm
so that
mm
they you know they could talk together perhaps having been briefed beforehand and then maybe work out how to approach appraisal interview
i mean it's an issue that needs to be looked at anyway isn't it
regardless of appraisal
yeah
with anything yes
cos then the spin UNK you know if we can get her to be able to communicate back to us
mm
it's great
erm
it's certainly the appraisal interview is a good opportunity to address the issue of because communication is difficult
mm she's not
she's being under UNK in a sense
yeah mm
it's not pulling it out just out of thin air
that's right
it it's
yeah
i mean contacts
mm
yeah
i mean i think maybe cath if we sit down and talk that through beforehand
i mean i'm obviously happy to sit down and talk through any of it beforehand anyway with you
erm and you might want to do that formally you might a if you have pre meetings with some of these people you might want to say that you are going to sit down and talk it through with me in advance ar and are they happy about that
but i mean it we can talk things through in principle anyway just to think because you know until we build up
mm
more experience
but i you know hopeful i know that th quite a large and high numbers but what we agreed was if we were working on the basis of something like on one person every six weeks
mm
which wasn't an unreasonable sort of target erm we would get through everybody we had to get through in a year
other than the issue of UNK are you unhappy with that
no i don't want to do it but i mean i'm not i'm certainly happier than i have been about it if
mm
that's any help
i just want some help with these writing these forms and target setting
yeah
it's easier once you've been done
actually it's easier once you've been done cos then you have an appreciation of what's to
well i think you know
yes i think you'll feel a bit better once we've done you
yeah
really
mm
yeah i think
because
i didn't really
the thing's i've had two attempts at me and i've never had any feedback whatsoever
all i did was spend my time tell telling them how they could do their job better
mm
mm
you know so i mean so i've never had a it's been a bad experience for me not a good one
oh god i can't cope with the pressure
and as far as in the appraisals i mean i found when i did the three s part staff and i was it was that pilot and i know
mm
and i don't know whether the forms were i don't think they were quite as complicated as these but i found that
i've got a if you want to borrow
well i've got copies of them all
it's easier now to be honest
yeah i mean i felt once i got going it just seemed to flow naturally
mm
and it was and even deciding on where the training needs were and writing them down and setting targets it i don't know it just seemed to happen erm difficult at all
the form complete is much easier than the
is it
form you had to that you had to
oh right
last time
mm
as
mm
an individual you
mm
know what your needs are
yeah
yeah
it's much more clearer
yeah
than the previous
yeah
yeah
one
mm
yeah
i think the other thing is it's very much an appraisal of the working relationship between the UNK and the UNK the way we're doing it
it's not entirely focused on the UNK you know cos i think
mm
you're talking as much a about y it's reflecting on you as the line manager how much are you communicating with this
mm
person
mm
what are you actually
yeah
failing to do that's making this person's job more difficult
mhm
should you be giving them more support
should you be recognizing this need or this skill or this strength or whatever that you're
mm
not
mm
and it's very much a two way thing
yeah
in fact in some ways i feel i almost got more out of UNK kevin and bill than i did out of alan UNK
mm
me
and i almost sort of
mm
you know it i it's
mm
so two way
yeah yes
it's a lovely way of understanding how are your staff are feeling and getting on
mm
yeah
you know communication
right
wise
yeah
at the end of it i you know i felt mm well wh when i did the c os and the pilot
yeah
i felt as though i understood their picture
and you do talk about things that you don't normally
c os are probably more likely to open up and talk aren't they
than
yeah
but even so
even a bit of opening up
and people like that
yeah but even a bit
you see you're going to have all the UNK later on
don't say it's a bad thing
yeah but
some people like to talk
if he said that
careers officers have verbal diarrhoea don't they the other extreme aren't they
let's be fair
yeah but if it's a structured discussion because they've
yes
done
yes
some preparation
so it's what they want to talk about anyway
yeah
if it
mm
doesn't if it last half an hour
they're not coming into it cold
this is this is where deborah will then go back this is comes into your three hour training so you won't have this problem cos they'll all have been they'll all know that they're just talking about certain things
but they will because that's what you'll have agreed in your preparation meeting
you've got to prepare yeah you've got to prepare
the pre meeting i think is really quite important
mm
yeah you know
but we almost got down to saying the other day that probably need to have an action plan or a structure for the pre meeting as well
you've go to know in your mind what you're going to talk about
i think
yeah that's more or less what she was
yeah
saying
the mental picture
but once we've been through once we've had our pre meeting
mm
it'll take all the mystery out of it
actually it will
i mean
mm
th
ten minutes is all it takes
you'd be surprised
you can just
that was one of the UNK she was saying wasn't it
that if you don't talk frequently to your staff on an informal basis then there will be a mystery regarding appraisal
mm
because it seems as if it's a mystery
and deborah does talk frequently to
w
regulations does she
she was training sue that said one of the UNK
disciplines
was UNK er informal discussions with your er
mm
with your staff so
she just delegates the whole lot
i just i talk to often to some of them and not enough to others
to others
and i don't control that
never UNK my door
oh
yeah
mentioning no names
i mean we have no choice really some of these things have to happen you know it has to be done
well that's i mean that's what it boils down to
that's right
is going to happen it's a question of whether we g go for three UNK training we i think we're agreeing that some sort of preliminary training is going to come forward but not necessary three hours
yeah
i don't see how they can definitely say anyway this is going to take
no
guarantee lack of training
yeah
exactly
i feel that people like UNK
you know
think they're quite easy what you want
yes
but i'm just saying
and if it ends up being a fairly low key thing i it doesn't matter
with other people
no
it'll be
mm
mm
i me going to be a significant event well it
extremes while
that's right
yeah
whoever i mean it's going to be a day's job isn't it
UNK
if she comes with notes like that
yeah
well if i don't talk them all through five times there's something wrong
yeah
but if you're int limited to only three subjects surely she
no she ain't no there's no there's no way UNK just talk about three subjects
no
that's UNK
i thought you were supposed to
no
not at all it's UNK
that's UNK talk about what
it's true actually yeah
i think you i think what it's
it's just that most people have got m quite a lot so it's a limiting factor
so you want to limit it
i think you need to set a time actually
the targets have been limited to three cath around three
three or four
yeah
three or four
yeah
thought that the work areas were s to supposed to limit them because when you do the one next year in a year's time then you bring on board two more topics
other areas
and then the year after that two more topics
well that's going to depend on
is
a person's duties isn't it
is that yeah
i mean if UNK main role is
say that then
UNK and typing alright
yeah
says it's target
then really that that's an area that you've got to concentrate on cos
mm
okay she's got some time on reception as relief but the majority of work is n is not that varied is it
mm
is it
i would say that on reception is the one that probably needs more support let her down all the rest of it
yeah in which case in which case that's your one of your UNK in talking to her
mm
say you'll actually negotiate that in the erm preliminary meeting
mm
and you sort of say do you think it would be useful if we talked about reception because that's something y you're not doing quite as frequently but it's obviously it must be difficult for you to fit in to that because you're not doing it all the time
do you think it would be useful if we talked about that
and to be honest
mm
if she doesn't want to talk about that then you
yes i think she would do
you know i think she would do
but that's the sort of negotiation
i think she has to be one of the easiest ones to do
i mean like with kevin and bill we negotiated but even that we wouldn't talk about their professional work as a careers officer
mm
because that's really in a you know was far less appropriate
yeah
mm
we actually talked about the difficulties that it causes
combining them both
of combining the two things
mm
but we actually talked about things at an appropriate level
now with careers officers obviously that'll sort of come into it
mm
more
i found it invaluable last time i was doing i b you know if you say to somebody y you know come beforehand with what you're doing well what where the difficulties are what the UNK are
and they came and you know i find it difficult here and here
i mean that was really valuable to understand that cos ian thought oh yeah that's something that we really have to address you know
yeah
because if someone else says that and then all of a sudden i didn't know this and now i know it
a y it's really i
mm
i felt i got a lot out of it
yeah
even though initially i thought cor all this time where are we going to find it from
that's the two way
mm
thing you see
mm
i would a the difficulty is the perception of the person that kevin UNK would be well i told kevin about this and nothing's happened
but in fact
come in
UNK perception has been increased and he
and he does have a better understanding of that person's role even though
it might not be UNK obvious to them that there there's been an improvement in communications
i know it's what happens next afterwards
it's difficulty
yeah
difficulty in getting back
but the good thing about follow up is these targets
something very UNK
mm
mm
to follow up on
i mean i know in about four months' time i've got a meeting in my diary with alan
that we're reviewing what progress i've made in the targets that i've set myself
that's good that's good
mm
yeah
and i've not looked at them since i wrote them
but you know that you have to you know you can't just
but i know i've got to
ignore it and that you have to work on it and you have to
yeah
sort of really go along with the process
which is good
mm
so what sort of targets do you see yourself setting
i don't know i mean what wh
we didn't really
what are we talking about
increasing the amount of interview you get through in a day
i mean what
no certain UNK and areas where you feel you're not er giving you know you don't feel as though you're doing it the best for whatever reason
mm
you may set that as a target to try and work at it this way to overcome that or to do it better
yes say if you're looking at an e o that feels that they're really happy with the client group and things like that that's fine
but for some reason they feel that they're not as hot on employer work or something like that so one of the targets might be to get them more used to dealing with employers is to go out and see more and to set time
mm
aside
yeah
for them to be able to that
so a lot of a lot of the problems with some of the areas of the work is because you do it so UNK it's not that you can't do it it's that you feel
mm
mm
incapable of doing it
mm
it's this fear UNK when you
when have to do it yeah
when you have to do it
right yeah
so one of the ways to overcome that is to set yourself a target to do more
mm
so that you become more
yeah
familiar with it
mm
there's other that's right
there's other things you can do though like for example i mean once you've identified
training
the target yes it's if any training comes up to do with work with employers you as a line manager know that's your person that's got to
yeah
get on that training
that's the one
that's the UNK
yes
cos you have to negotiate
but also an another target would be to identify let's say a careers officer or a more experienced e o
or just a colleague it doesn't have to be someone that's m just
they may say
someone that's more confident to go arrange
arrange
to go out on an employer visit
mm
with them during the next two
mm
months
i see you see the way that they have
and that you know
fulfil a target yeah
yeah you're building steps towards actually meeting the need that you've identified
mm
i mean my targets were i can only remember two of them UNK
i'll perhaps remember the third one as i talk
one of them was to tackle the staff meeting problem in york
erm and that you know i wrote to i discussed that with alan as a problem but then i took it away with the pro UNK that says and you now the target pro UNK 's got columns you've got to fill in and i
mm
just i thought
mm
it through myself
then i met up with alan and he read though it and challenged me on a few things and we changed one or two bits but i've got my sort of target set out
and the other one was to strengthen the divisional management team
and by that i was looking at er things like discussing with alan that i felt we were un under had less management time than we should
so i've already begun to fulfil some
of those things and
write down on the target sheet
wh it must have been hard
yeah
i didn't find it particularly hard actually
so how can you in you know to increase
the only way you can do it is by pleading
so why do you fill in all the rest of them silly columns in
no it isn't the only way you can do it
it's by actually looking at well i in bill and UNK appraisal i actually tackled it through their appraisal because we discussed in quite a lot of depth erm what their workload and ways in which they could change their workload
mm
to enable them to have more management time like we're looking at trying to get them to reduce their work their case loads
mm
school case load work
mm
with both of you we talked a lot about delegation and things that you were doing that maybe you shouldn't be doing erm
mm
yeah i think i've just got a mental block about writing them
it certainly doesn't come easy until you've got a bit of practice in it but
have yours
i didn't find it as hard as i thought
have this discussion after you've had
yeah
yours
mm
and then if your st
mm
you'll find that quite a lot of what you're saying is then seen
mm
and you can see that
yeah
it's not a major problem
i mean was quite keen
mm
you say that she wouldn't she certainly wouldn't mind doing a follow up document and
yeah
and target setting
yeah
yes she did and i think that would be quite useful for people
i think a lot of it's fear of the unknown though until you've done it yeah
exactly
yeah
it is
exactly
yeah
it's fear of the unknown
once you've done about five you'll be alright
and it's fear of the
of the thing as well isn't it
yeah
i think that's the other thing i mean
mm
we we're easy enough to say right let's well we just don't get
i it
the time
mm
if you're gonna
well you've got to withdraw that time you've
yeah
gotta make sure it happens haven't
yeah
you
if you've got to do this you've got
mm
to do it right otherwise it's
well that's right that's right
i'm gonna have to do it
yeah
i'm gonna have to do it
yeah
it
yeah
it may be one of the ways th that
to get together and communicate that because it's set down as target you've got to do it so you will you will set the time aside where it's easy enough to
mhm
say oh well we'll do it a week on friday and that week on friday never comes
you can set as your UNK as one of your targets to er you know just t to sort of make it in smaller steps that you will have UNK two of your staff in th in
mm
the next six
mm
months
mm
and you know you could almost use the appraisal as an as an area that you wanted to concentrate
mm
yeah
it's not it's not me it's the ones that you're seeing that are target setting for
yeah
you feeling happy enough with the target setting to get UNK
yes
yes
i think that's a good point actually and that maybe target setting is sort of a training that we ought to do with all staff i mean and i don't know how much of that comes into this magic three hours
you know if part of that was target
exactly
relating
well it was
yeah it was actually
was it
w was yeah
it was b practising being an UNK and an UNK
yeah
and setting each
er an
other targets
targets
i don't remember doing much of that on the day thing
well we did didn't we cos sat 'em
yeah
all
ah yes you did cos i was with the actually mine was quite a good
oh yes
group i got
this is
er UNK and liz were the three of us that were
obviously we didn't he can get a third when we can only get when there were only two of us because there weren't enough threes to go round and i mean
yeah so i must admit
mm
i must admit that was quite good cos she'd got liz who was
mm
e she was used to putting ideas forward as well
i think UNK felt very much as well that she could have done with more training on target setting and things like that
it depends on what you've done before as well
this smart thing is really useful for target setting to bear that
yes
in mind
yeah
and you know you go back over what you've written and say is it specific
can
how can i measure it
is it really you know realistic
can i actually
yeah
achieve it
mm
mm
is it actually gonna help me do my job better
mm
and have i put a timescale on it
and if you've done all of those things
mm
then you've got a really good target
yeah cos if it's not achievable it's UNK setting it
that's right
in the first place isn't it
yeah if any of those things fall down you know that
that's right
mm
yeah
yeah that's a very yeah
i think that's really the key
mm
to target
yeah
setting
and at least you've got the questions
what do i need to do
and who can help me
how will i know when i've done it
how long will i allow myself to achieve it
who ne who else needs to know about it
they're the sort of things that you've got to know
answer those questions
yeah
as you put the target forward yeah
another thing that did come up at that training day the other day was that we all need a anybody that's going to do any sort of UNK will need to know what the erm training programme is
yeah
for next year cos if somebody asks for a specific training
mm right
mm
you say oh yes you can have it and then you look on the training and it's not there
i know no
i know that's yeah that's right
er then that's a problem
i had that problem last time
it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing really
yeah
mm
because we had a long discussion about training needs audits and all this sort of thing
whe whether alan should write out and ask everybody and we said oh no people have done that ad UNK and they'll only write back and say well i've done this before and you've still never listened to me
mm
and we thought we knew enough about at the moment there are still a lot of needs that people had already raised that had not been addressed
so once alan gets his er i
yeah
think after our meeting next friday he'll he will issue a dr a programme
yeah
so people will have that by the time you get
yeah
round to doing individual
yeah
staff
you've got to look at the other positive thing as well though that if it comes out as a target and there are specific training needs there throughout the
mm
county
you know say if you've got a number of e o saying well i would like training in this
yes
even if you have to say to them well i'm
that's right
sorry it's not available at the moment
it's highlighting what everybody is
i think what alan will
probably do that's right i think probably
yes
yeah
yeah
in about six months' time
yes
what alan UNK to do is write to all line managers and ask them to go back and review their appraisal erm documents for every member of staff they've UNK
erm and write a summary of all of the training
training needs
needs that have
mm
UNK
yeah
up
because even if somebody said i would like that training if it's not available you can't just turn around and say well tough it's not available you can't
mm
have it
mm
you've got to note that this training you would like this training
that's right
unfortunately it's not available at the present time
at the moment
yeah
but
well that's what i did wasn't it
when i did those
yes
appraisals last year
yeah
mm
we still didn't get yes
said i will put forward
yes and
but
we still didn't get it
but yes you di you did put it forward
no that's right i
i think i think the other thing is that if there is a need that's quite common erm you know talking amongst ourselves i think sometimes we're gonna have t just do more within the division you know i
yeah
a
something i've realized recently is that because i've sort of in a sense the c s m t side of things that i because that's a big area for me i tend to think county wide about everything
mm
that i do
mm
and i think that's right but it means that things are more difficult to achieve in a lot of ways
i think i ought to start thinking well never mind if everywhere else isn't doing it
let's
yeah just
get it right ourselves
here
first
mm
yeah
and i think you know that if th that we have got the skills between us to actually tackle some issues locally
mm
as long as we can get the staff together to do it
mm
and that we can try and meet some training needs locally
oh i'm sure we could
and particularly things like linking people up with other members of staff
mhm
you know getting employment officers to go on a visit with each other or with careers officers or whatever
and meeting training needs on an individual basis
yeah
rather than having to get people together in a
yeah
central venue every time
yeah
and seeing training only in that light really
yeah
a thing that i've heard from a few directions recently is erm the thought of work UNK
yes
actually going along with a careers officer
yeah
for a whole day and the careers officer
yeah
yeah
a whole day
that's part of alan's new induction programme
that's quite a nice idea isn't yeah
yeah
you know try for a better UNK total understanding of
mm
of each of us needs
mm
yes
yeah that's nice i like that
i think i think that one of the major
employment office because
yeah
they feel that c os don't understand them and they're probably
mm
i think that
won't admit it but they probably don't know all
mm
that there is to know about
there's a lot more mystery about what the careers officers do cos they don't do it in front of the UNK of the employment officers
i think that's
but that's a good it's a form of training that should
yeah
be easy to organize
that's right
yeah
mm
and i said this the other day that's
yeah
one of the major problems people don't understand the other person's role
mm
so they don't say you know it it's like in york you'll have it worse than somewhere like here cos we can see the careers officers running around
mhm
yes that's right
so we'll say so we'll say to them do you want a hand and they will also see
yeah
the c os may actually be working for a week or two and never see an e o
yeah
but they can they can
yeah
also see that sometimes even if we wanted to help them
mm
i the
yeah
UNK of it are just
yeah
impossible
yeah
whereas you don't have that you'll probably have the careers officers walking in when your e os are having a cup of coffee and they think well they do sod all
mm
and then you'll walk into the careers officers when they come in from school and they go ah
yeah
and the e os walk in and they think
that's right
they do sod all
yeah
so you've got this thing
it's true
that nobody understands what the other person's role is
absolutely yeah
come in
and that that's the most awkward
yeah
trouble is once you
and when you're very busy
don't worry
and you it's quite easy to switch your mind on you know
would it become UNK to your own needs kevin don't you
yeah
either sort of feel that the other is not as busy as they are
exactly
i've
and it's
the last student we had in er in york
mm
i had difficulty in fitting in
alison
any time to talk to her
mm
and she ended up spending it was the best part of the day with me and she came with me to a couple of meetings i went to
ah right that's good
and it was more like UNK me
yeah
mm
and i thought at the time oh i'd not done anything about it
mm
i think i'll say to yourself and to bill students in future
nice idea that
i'll identify a day
mm
or a co or a half day
mm
that the student can spend with me and i'll
that's great
try and talk to them in you know in the car
or whatever and
yeah
in between
yeah
but they'd actually get a
yeah
much better view
yeah i like that
and it's not taking you as much time either
no that's right
no manage to get on with your work
and to some extent i think we can do that with new
in fact
staff as well
i'm wondering whether we ought to do that with trainees anyway
in
yeah
while they're just you know whatever
do a bit more
whatever happens today
you're with that person
yeah
yeah
and similarly jackie
you reckon
mm
you know who
mm
it must she gets a lot of demand doesn't she really
yeah so i ask an e o a c o jackie and all the different sort of sorts
me
of people in the office to do to offer me one day for work UNK a
yeah
student
yeah
and they just work shadow for two weeks
yeah
and UNK
mm
interesting that isn't it
yeah
well yeah
oh
because if you've got
somebody again like you say to er some of the students that say can we come in on some of your interviews
mm
that's fine if you say yes but your client comes in you forget all about joe UNK sat at the back
yeah
mm
mm
and before you realize it you're halfway through your interview and you think oh god
yeah
whereas if they're with you
mm
mm
and they
and they watch you through lunch they
mm
they watch you writing up they watch you doing all the other discussions and stuff and they just sort of go with you
yeah
as opposed to going in for just the interviews
that's right
mm
actually that would be a better representation of what it's like to be the
a i was going to say they'd probably get a more realistic
yes they would
and i think it's less
yeah
demanding on
mm
the people because you know normally if a student comes to see me i sit down and have an hour and UNK discussion
mm
with them
mm
mm
which is not perhaps a very good use of time
the only trouble is when you're doing your administration and some days you know y you may have to really get stuck in
yeah
and what are they gonna do just sit and watch you
yeah
writing
mm
you feel
that's right
yeah
you've got to pick your day
that the day you choose
yeah
got to be more active
yeah
rather than writing
even though you've got funding for the first time for this i don't want to spend an awful lot on materials
mm
i want us to use we ne ee erm static resources
so it's more UNK
well less UNK more us teaching the tu teaching style will be you know here's a slide show
mm
i think we'll
oh i see
oh i meant
are you going out and about looking at i mean
mm
that's it's more
again it's time
we couldn't do that cos we've got an hour
it's inviting people in and
mm
i was trying last year to try to see if i could get a erm an indian you know when we sort of do looking at UNK
yes
mm
to try and see if we can get some sort of dance group in to get that culture over
yes
mm
mm
or get the UNK
yes to come UNK
that orchestra to come and play to them
oh that was er was super
they loved that
in fact they were on italy they were doing a concert in
ah
italy was superb
mhm
so there's all sorts of stuff
aha
like that
mm
ha
now then why i wrote this it was what about a year ago now since
mm
then i've been of UNK
mhm
and actually written about it
oh have you
aha
mm hasn't
mhm
been approved yet cos
mhm
it came through to the school
mhm
but i've written it in such an open ended way
that they can choose
that they you know any of us could use
mm
the unit
mm
aha
and tack on our own
mhm
er
aha
oh pattern round
mhm
it so hopefully
mm
could you know and the kids that also could
mm
maybe that's why i haven't had it back yet
maybe they find it
mm
too
open
open
mm
cos then anne comes back to you to ask yeah
that's right
mhm to modify things yeah
actually remind me to ask anne er
mhm
what's happened to it that'll be great
mm
okay is that fair enough
yeah
so can we go onto page three
mhm
oh we're not reading all the notes
didn't you read all that
oh
we've
so
only begun just turned onto this page
well that's what he
said let's go onto page three
page three
oh sorry
i i'm sorry
i am on page three
i thought we haven't read all the way down
mm
mm
so these are these are UNK of example units that we might do which either exist already or might be made to exist quite
mm
quickly and easily
anne was expressing concern yesterday that sh you know she doesn't want to have to you know a syllabus
mm
i said well that isn't right you know it's up to our individual personal styles
mhm
and so on
i happen to like giving slide lectures
mhm
mm
i erm er i told her
mhm
so erm you'll find that there's a UNK of suggestions of slide lectures here if you hate doing them there's no reason on earth why you should
mm
it's just that you know
these are the ones that are all backed up with notes
yes
da mhm
that's right
mm
but you'd have to do them yourself
and also you know you're not just limited to a one er to use as the resource area
mm
erm i have a slide UNK
mm
a big one now down the library
mm
which i'm trying to encourage that you know there's not sort of
remember how when i did buy it i consulted with you to se to show that we were both compatible
have compatible ones so that we can take
mhm
it's
mhm
a UNK isn't it
mhm
so we
mhm
we can take a UNK
mhm
loaded with slides
mhm
from the art department
mm
to the resource centre
mhm
be good
mm
and we've got a video down there as well working and tapes
yes
yes
so the
yes i mean UNK really is because i'm not within my area you know
oh of course
mm
right
yeah it's new for everyone really
yes
mm
we're all in the same
mm
mhm
mm
erm
right okay so anyway these are the suggestions and they're not UNK
mhm
week one a slide lecture right
on a
mm
subject
mm
week two an analysis written hand or drawn or painted of an example of pre UNK work
now it should say at the top there british painting the pre UNK yeah
mm
mhm
so week one is a slide lecture on the pre UNK
mm
mhm right
okay
the project will go on for two or three weeks
mm
so erm er the slide UNK er and it says week two but it means week two onwards
mm
you know
mm
th the
mhm
kid would do work
yeah
based on that
yeah
side lecture
yeah
the slide lecture will be pre prepared for use by any teacher and we would have it in a you know some slide boxes
mm
you know there'll be about fifteen or twenty slides
yeah
some notes and you'd UNK they'd be numbered and you'd lift them out and you put them in the UNK
mm
yeah
yeah
you know and we'd have maybe fifteen
yes
standard lectures
yes
available
yes
you know
yes
which between us we could write
yes
over the
yes
as george was saying yesterday before he'd done erm two or three big ones on
mm
and south and central american erm early this you know pre UNK
mm
er cultures
mm
the UNK being
also the UNK population of north america too
mm
that's quite an interesting
aha
one isn't it
yeah north west coast
north west coast particularly
mm
yeah
incidentally i made a personal contact of somebody who actually knows so some people who up there in the north west
is the no is that canada
you know
yeah
it's north america
mhm
erm
and canada
yeah
cos i tell you what i have got cos i went to an indian UNK and i've got a small carving which an indian did for
oh
me you see
right
so you know
anything like that cos joyce brought a lot of stuff in didn't she
joyce
in fact it's actually a little totem pole like you're talking about
it's still
mm
in the room we must give it
back to her
yeah
got a few little er UNK that er joyce back from canada
this is only a two UNK one though
that's okay that's great
in fact
anything that's fast made available like this
yeah anything you bring in
and
it's
you know in the UNK cabinet that colin used to be in charge of
yeah
there's a er a wa erm a UNK penguin UNK
oh yeah
anyway it to so
yeah
you know you
aha
it's a
oh
no
have you not noticed it
no
there's
oh
all sorts of things you can
yes i've seen that
where you're hands are
i didn't realise it was in the er
cos they love to touch these things
mm
yeah it's incredible
yes i've got one of peter's
erm
UNK
you have also
taped the wonderful programmes that are b c two last er no is it this year spring
mhm
erm about the north american
mm
that's right
i wonder if i've
UNK
still got all my stuff from the
i've got those programmes
from the victoria island museum because they're amazing
mhm
exhibitions in there of indian art and i had loads of stuff
mhm
yeah
mm so there's quite a lot of supporting material
i it's i'll
actually we have got
see what i can dig out
see what you can
yeah
yeah
it'll be grand if you could
cos even something like a carrier bag that's got the design on the front
yeah
yes that's right
of the victorian museum
mhm mm anything like that
mm
you know we've got to agree on what we're going to what terminology we use
mm
you just said indian and i'm always trying to say what i believe is the correct thing to say these
days is UNK
mhm
UNK
UNK
UNK
as in UNK american indian
american indian
american indian
american indian
yeah
oh
i just don't know whether that is right
they're often they're offended when they red indians isn't aren't they
that's offensive
that's offensive
mm
yes
a er whereas we're used to er
that phrase
yeah a phrase
mm
mm
yeah i suppose it's like saying black americans i suppose
yeah
isn't it
mm
mm
as opposed to UNK american or wha
mm
or whatever
or ca or
or UNK
yeah UNK
american wha happens
i'm
mm
gonna be
UNK or whatever
yeah we've
mhm
got to be careful to be right on in that respect i think
yes
yes
now doing this
yes
yeah cos of course i mean this is something that i suppose yo you're not for that yet some things that you UNK into your language which simply
becomes a phrase like i always said UNK brown
that's right
ooh yes
i never
yes
i never thought of UNK brown as being an offensive remark
remark yeah
it was like saying light blue
mhm
yes
and it was only till someone pointed out to me you shouldn't really say that
it's an ethnic yeah
yeah cos i didn't i've never associated it
prejudice yeah
that's right
mhm
so we this is a case of well
mm
we've got to
ha be careful of terminology
and not
yeah
use UNK words
mm
yeah
so i dunno if you're know we whether that is the acceptable term at the moment
mm
but i think it might be
didn't erm
UNK friend
friend what was he called
we wa was erm david
he was half yes
he was half UNK
he was yes
he said UNK was okay
you didn't he the often the offensive word was the red indian
that's right but UNK
that had yeah
UNK
yeah
was
UNK
was
aha
was an acceptable gesture
so this would be a UNK indian would it
he would do a lot of ca UNK if they're in canada don't they
cos though these are canadian these are canadian indians
they do salmon UNK don't they in canada
yeah
yeah
is that why it's called canada
no
yeah
never mind
UNK indian
very UNK man
he was very UNK actually as it happened
mm
it so happened if he got paid anyway
he got paid
he got paid did he
is he still
for work
our friend
oh yes he's still our friend
yes he's still our friend
mm
he got paid for the work that erm
that he made
he did er he sent a bill in a erm
to bill
to bill for that last bit
that's right
fifty quid or something
that's right
of course i'm glad
yes
yes he wa he was very unhappy
yeah is he coming back or has he gone the other side of the pond
no he lives
no he li doesn't
in britain
yeah he
oh
does a lot of work down in london he did a lot of work well they done UNK er and he evidently he was in a big job at what was it in it
it was some sort of stage show wasn't it
mm
erm anyway he may well come back as a visiting
yeah
erm artist erm if we require er request it they can afford him
mm
so ha back to the pre UNK
mm
the pre UNK a slide lecture and then analysis written about it so there's a slide lecture being pre prepared by the use for the use by any teacher hello there goes or something
three UNK oh or UNK went over three times in the night i thought i was gonna raped and UNK but no luck
mm
the analysis from e g get the card attached to your work card UNK the basic information followed up by research carried out in the resource centre
okay
oh we haven't done these post cards attached to work cards but we still
no we haven't
they did offer some postcards yesterday
mm yes if i can find them andrew
if you can find them i've got loads
mm
as well
mm
and perhaps we could have and evening session or two
mm
over the next few weeks
mm
mm
where i will bring in my vast postcard collection
mm
which like
mm
that one you've already seen laid out of the colour
mm
section of articles
mm
from the sunday papers
it's probably one of those things
yeah
because it's covered in blue tack
yes
and stuff they've asked to pick up and
chuck it
bung it out because
right
i'm talking UNK years now
right yeah well anyway
but hopefully it may be er i in
i it may be still be there
in the midst of the UNK and stuff
so if i bring the if i bring anyone of mine in which i do know exist
yeah
if we can sit around and actually make some work of cards
yeah
that would be grand
yeah
too popular arts right so that was a an example of the pre UNK right
number one british painting of pre UNK that would be a standard
right
you know a er a posh culture if you like
mm
mm
erm well you know because we're dealing with who are with and because
yes
yes
by culture we mean all of culture
mm
you might deal for instance with the popular arts and to erm such as erm you
erm
know er UNK design on for instance board games
mm
or UNK or UNK art i've got down just as examples
mm
so week one might be a slide lecture on the three themes plus erm a show and demonstration of board games right
so i happened to have got some slides of UNK and some slides of UNK er art and erm some slides of board games of through
mm
the ages and there's some real ones
mm
and they like to be taught a new board game
mm
and they can design the board themselves
mm
and design a game sort of
mm
so i go on the same as er weeks two to four an analysis written and or drawn or made of examples on one of these themes
right
so they might design their own UNK or they might design a UNK erm UNK based on what they've seen years ago
mm
the that kind
mm
of type style and
mm yeah
primitive UNK
yeah
and so on cos UNK remember they're not specialist artists
yeah
so we've got if we do give them work to do it's got to be stuff which they don't feel inadequate to do
yes
erm yeah well i suppose i mean they are quite familiar with the spanish city a lot of them aren't they
oh i should think so
and actually i don't know
differently very recently but along the front where these UNK which were the most horrendous UNK awful places
they've got a series of almost like ethnic UNK that somebody's done all along
have they really
and
i want to try and sort of clean
well
up that area and allow them to sort of do the UNK
and it's very nice
yeah
and the they're a cross between sort of UNK and er i don't know whether they are ethnic UNK but or whether they're sort of child like primitive drawings or what they are but
mm
and they they're just done in the UNK
mm
and all the UNK been UNK out
mm
but it would be worth the kids on their weekend trips going and having a look in there
oh yeah
i'm sure we can have a photograph
to you know and
of it show them a slide show and then we can go and have a look
i could i could go and i could go and take if there's you know if they haven't no nothing UNK to them i could go and take some UNK of those
mhm
mhm be nice
because they're rather nice
rather nice
well i've got film slide film
yeah
yeah just ask me and i'll give it to
mhm
before you go
right
film which i've bought already from the UNK
yeah
will that go in a thirty five UNK camera
yes
yes
okay right i can do that
well thank you
erm so a slide lecture pre prepared for use by the teacher the analysis carried out by the pupil using the slides and then the visual material and work cards made available to pupils
i think this is important
mm
you know if you sh given them a slide show that's all very well but they may well want to look at some of the pictures for longer
mm
don't be precious about it let them use
mm
the UNK it's very difficult to break
mm
and er you know if they wanna UNK long and hard at certain images
mm
that's well and good
mm
mm
so once you've given the them the lecture give
mm
them access to your
mm
notes and your you know material you've used for them
mm
and er they like don't they george
mhm
and erm
yeah
did that with the african stuff that happened
yes
a UNK nine man's morris board or an original game might be produced by individuals or groups of peoples or a description with illustrations of popular UNK like
nine man's morris is just erm one of the games that is easy for them to devise if yo if you want me to teach you how to play it if you don't know already i will
mm
don't know no
no i thought nine man's morris i thought it was a ga er a dance
it is
oh yeah
it's a it's a an
oh
ancient morris dance that's mentioned in
oh
UNK
oh
but it was one the er the village green
yeah
right
erm had a nine man's morris pitch
mm
mm
with UNK and wood sand one of the appointed places
mm
and they would be instructed to move in certain to
mm
other places
mm
when they did certain things you know that man was killed and he was off not really
mm
you know he was off out of the game
did i did he have the sticks or
they may have done the morris dancing type
mm
of thing as
mm
they passed each other and UNK them er nobody knows so it's lost
yeah
it's there's a re reference
yeah
to it but he actual dance is lost
yeah
er but it was then reduced to game with pieces and counters
oh
which is a lovely game to play it's
yeah
very UNK it's a cross between UNK and UNK sort of thing you know
yes
it's really rather
yeah
nice
and kids love to learn it
yeah
and love to play it
and then
yeah
they can design a board because the pieces can be you know UNK or
yes
mm
anything
anything you know
yes
yes
it doesn't have to be UNK or anything
yes
the great thing about the game is that you're teaching them a little bit of culture
mm
cos it is a you know the oldest english board game
mm
you're also teaching them to pass their time
mhm
mm
in you know in a UNK wa
a UNK
that's right
way you see
instead of knocking some old
because they can
granny about
that's right
they can create nine man's morris board on anything and use
mm
counters for anything
mm
broken in half match stick a shell and a stone
mm
mm
you know a UNK yo er you know a
mm
a ten pence coin and a
yes
and a te two
yes
pence coin
and of course they can UNK them can't they
if they if you've got
a small group
that's right
an and they have enjoyed
yeah
that very much in the
mm
past
but you can onto more ambitious board games er i think george and i both seen some
mm
very complex board games with er cards and things devised by people in
technology by
oh yes i've
even se even seven and eight years
yeah
aha
mm
and they can produce
mm
yeah
you know
yes
really very complex
yes
and er
yes
you know very sophisticated games
yes we do we do it in english you se with the with the text
mhm
erm UNK on the UNK and UNK principle they think of all the good things that happen or the bad
yes
things that happen
mhm
and
yeah
this kind of thing and the they enjoy going up
and the they pick up the text in that way
mhm
right
they pick up you know the essence of what's going on
it's a good that isn't it for literature to try and teach literature yeah
well that is the point
it's very good
yeah
because it's a very friendly user friendly way
mm
it's like a game as you say it's you're just playing
that's right make something into
yeah
a game
cos i mean that's how you teach a young child isn't it
a similar one
yes
yeah
yes that's it yes
teach young children through games
yes and they go through each
yes
page with a
yeah
fine tooth UNK actually
yes
looking for strategies to play
that's right
yes yeah
okay
mhm
so we go onto other themes here which is three half way down the page
so other things dealt with as above introduced by slide shows or demonstrations or videos or anything else
mhm
you know
mhm
mm
for instance some of the themes could be UNK civil engineering and art
mm
you know including the architecture that went with them
there's wonderful art work on the UNK in
mm
looks fabulous doesn't it
yes
and especially with
mm the UNK
that'd be lovely to take er a holiday a weekend for the kids er you know
yeah
along the barge
that's right cos they've never seen
mm
a UNK have they
nothing
oh you're on your own there now UNK
and oh
anne
where's the UNK spirit
even i have taken kids on the UNK it's great
mm
mm
mm it's lovely
falling into the locks and UNK it's wonderful
mm
make sure they wear their life belts
i went in the snow once
did you really
it was brilliant
oh yeah i went
ah
in the snow really dramatic
i've never done it in the winter
mhm
did you go to that one that says about eleven or twelve
yes UNK
mm
locks
is it
i hate the great UNK as you know
and the kids
but i enjoyed it
oh
yeah i mean the kids how they can be so UNK in jumping off the barge
mhm
to go and get the lock to open the lock and to
it's
yeah
lovely
incredible yeah
UNK swinging the key round you know hitting
yeah
each other over the head
they love it i mean it's marvellous
incredible yeah
another one here
it's superb
illustrated package of the products for instance the school there's a comma after sound there shouldn't be there sound recording UNK food and toys UNK illustrations UNK eighteen and nineteenth century painting the whole UNK the whole
mm
cross section
and there's a lot of erm new books that i got last years for the library
mm
which shows a lot of this they're beautiful aren't they the art
yes
books
they are
mm
indeed
okay this is this is the hard work for us now preparation necessary for year ten year eleven courses
each of three teachers UNK four to five topics per term starting with a minimum of two this programme to re be repeated three times per term to a b c groups UNK
that way you know we after one year we've got enough material to
yes
to see us
yes
through forever
yes
if we need to
yeah
that is if erm material for these topics should be lively and interesting for the broad range of pupil ability i e differentiation
they being always of sufficiently high quality to be UNK and UNK developing and UNK and justify potential of UNK
mm
sorry about the printing on these pages it's very bad isn't it
mm
can you read it
mm
mhm
mine's
mm
probably
is always just
yes
that's right
care should be taken to conform to a cross UNK agreed formula of presentation and content for instance work cards should conform in size style and presentation and pre printed questionnaires planning sheets and other documentation should use consistent layout UNK identification symbols UNK et UNK
and we can agree all of that so that it makes it easier for storage
mm
and easier for use and easier for
mm
kids to understand it
is that all UNK
mhm
so we need some evening sessions to agree on that and
mm
find out what's available yeah
mm
i'll have a good old UNK this weekend cos i got stacks of stuff
mhm
that may or may not be applicable but i'll just bring it in and dump it on you
good
that's alright
that's fine
thank you
you know because it maybe at sometime in the future
yes i'll lo i love car boot sales like that great
mm
but these should be designed with a view to be pupil friendly and easily used by non specialist teaching for example supply teachers
pre prepared units of work should be labelled and stored so as to make them accessible to pupils and teachers UNK
attendance registers and assessment sheets should be kept UNK and easily available
erm i'm getting at richard here erm instructions of the whereabouts methods of access to and operation of hardware such as tape UNK video and t v sets video tapes slides and UNK and other machinery should be kept with work sheets et UNK
you know because
mm
if i have to go and do the music i jolly well wanna do it
i don't want to sit there
mm
mm
feeling like an UNK
mm
you know without access to the tape UNK and without
mm
knowing what's going on
and i would expect that er all of us would feel much the same
yep
mm
master copies to be kept centrally and available for all creative arts staff in a one
mm
in a filing cabinet
mm
so that we all know what's going on and where it is and
mm
you know
mm
sure some of it doesn't exist yet we've gotta create this stuff but you know
mm
once it's created
yeah
then it should be available to all so anybody who goes to stand in when they're off with er broken legs
mm
third process teaching and learning styles should vary as widely as possible in order to provide maximum UNK for both teachers and pupils and care should be taken to plan programmes with a long term rhythm of change or variety the element of chance and UNK
he always chooses posh words doesn't he
but don't forget this is all headed
this bit for erm an ex position for a creative arts teacher senior management and governors
you know i'm trying to get a promotion here
show off
for
where is where is that
alright i'm showing off
the very first part
right at the beginning
oh
right
i'm UNK in other words by using a lot of words
don't worry about that pet
no
erm and though
you've lost your place now haven't you
i have indeed it's UNK we've got to haven't we
er through for instance spontaneous people involvement must be UNK for
and i say that because from time to time i've had lessons completely UNK by kids taking the ball and running with it and i've just sat there it's been brilliant
mm
mm
best bit of teaching
mm
i've ever done just keeping quiet
yeah
and it doesn't matter you know
mm
cos it's
mm
that's what it's about isn't it really
mm
that's UNK to a written formula for programmes is considered counter productive
to people motivation
mm
allowance should be made for the fact that these pupils are of an age where they UNK may either UNK ahead of expectation to an enterprise or remain UNK and static in their reception programmes
both steps are natural therefore either providing too little UNK or UNK pushing is inappropriate
each pupil should be encouraged to UNK beyond a status quo level but by encouragement to eventually identify personally interesting areas
many pupils may object that they find this kind of culture to be UNK and UNK at first since this is a non exam course there is opportunity for pupils to mark time without any serious results but to achieve personal development gradually or late on in the course at an individual pace
this process needs to be regularly discussed and recorded in consultation with UNK pupils so that they feel encouraged and not threatened where appropriate professional
mm
and advice should be sought by creative arts teachers when they are preparing programmes from special needs special interest multi school or multi ethnic organisations other departments and from parents with special experience knowledge and skills
that's the end of that bit
mm
then the next bit is list of er resources that i have at home
mm
mainly
mm
about erm everything
mm
and may i suggest that we add to the list on the computer type it into this particular programme be it's called arts list
mm
a word anything that we have at home such as your little carving that you had done
mm
i've got quite a lot of little UNK er from i got one from er
if you're prepared
the UNK
to bring them in and the and if you could sort of type them in
yes
with your initials like i've done there
i see what you done the a m
yes
aha
aha
yes
then we know that person has got that
yes
mhm
and that if we want to borrow it in a couple weeks time
mhm
yes
we can go and say would you mind bringing that in
yes i
mhm
yes aha
alright
cos they some of them are quite delicate
not leave them at school at all
no i not
but just you know
yeah
you know they're not UNK i no i wouldn't just
well
say they not in their expertise so i mean it's just an example of i mean the old see a tourist shop and then i
no but you just said that you buy every you know
every yeah
you're a an airport UNK aren't you
that's right
really
yes
that's it yes
but er it comes in hundreds of stuff like this
mm
shall we have a cup of coffee and then watch a bit of this
why not
yes
i've UNK for lo
okay i was expecting twelve but ten out of UNK not bad so i'll start
good afternoon welcome to a course which hopefully system that we have here
the course is divided into two parts first of all a part that i shall be conducting dealing with more professional use of the telephone that's how you use the telephone what you say and how you use it in that way how you answer the telephone
and then after that there is a film called UNK telephone UNK and then alex ross will come and talk to you about how to use our system
that's all those wonderful little codes that are on the cards in front of you
you'll get a chance to try them out
so you'll all learn how to divert your phones and camp on to other people's and all sorts of things like that which are rather jolly so you'll do that later on
first of all i want us to think about how we actually use the telephone how you talk on the telephone what you say and why it's important
why do you think it might be important that we think about what we say and how we say it on the telephone erm there is a gap here for you to respond
hopefully the person who you're speaking to
right yes anything else
to sound more professional
to sound more professional
why should we want to sound more professional
you're working for
that's right yes every time you answer the telephone for an external call when you pick up the telephone you are representing oxford university press it doesn't matter who you are and it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter whether you're in UNK in UNK street in UNK anywhere
when you pick up that telephone and answer it for an external caller you've become oxford university press and it's important that we create the right impression for our customers whoever they are
that we are UNK efficient and we are seen to be a caring organisation
i e we want to create the impression that we are good people to do business with so our customers come back and buy more of our books so that makes more money for the company which means they can pay us more money
all round good idea
so that's the impression you want to do
you want to create a good impression every time you pick up the phone to answer it
what sort of things go into the impression we create on the telephone
here is another gap
what you say how you say it
that's right
what you say and how you say it
what sort of things will influence the person on the other end of the phone when you say how you say it what sort of things will go into the impression you create on the telephone
whether you're polite or not
yes UNK
tone of voice
tone of voice yes
what else
confidence
confidence
UNK
what other things
think about phone calls that you've received from people that you haven't met
what sort of things about that phone call helped you make up your mind about the person at the other end of the phone
the introduction
anything else
okay all of those things are important when you answer the telephone and they're things to bear in mind
it's amazing how much we pick up just from listening to someone on the telephone and of course when you can't see them so you haven't got any visual clues as to what they might be like what you hear becomes all important
okay having said that all of those things are important when we answer the telephone and the way in which we answer the telephone what are the things that you find annoying on the telephone what UNK you
being left to hold on for ages and ages
being left to hold on what just sort of hanging there
yes
the little UNK
and someone cuts you off and you can't get back
absolutely yes
people being UNK
people being UNK mhm
people speaking too fast so you can't
speaking too fast so you have to say i'm sorry can you repeat that which makes you feel like an UNK because you didn't pick it up first time that's awful yes i know i know that one
people don't tell you who they are
yes
that's particularly important in systems like ours where you can divert your telephone so even though you're certain that you UNK the right number you could end up absolutely anywhere because the number you UNK could be diverted somewhere completely different so it's very important when you answer the telephone to say who you are
the other thing that's annoying about that is it then forces you into a completely useless small conversation such as is that so and so and they say UNK and you then feel like they say UNK as much as to say UNK why didn't you know that UNK and then you feel like saying UNK why didn't you say so UNK and you start off on the wrong foot
anything else
when they shout at you
when they shout at you
what because they're annoyed
no when they speak too loud
when they speak too loud down the telephone
yes that's true what so you have to hold the phone away from your ear and then everybody else in the office can hear the conversation as well as you can
yes
any other things that you find annoying
okay there was a survey carried out by british telecom and they asked some of their customers what were the most frustrating things that can happen to you on the telephone and this was the answer and some of the things that you've come up with are here
not getting a reply fast enough came top of the list especially when you know there must be somebody there so when there's a telephone just ringing and nobody answers it
UNK an incompetent UNK who puts you through to the wrong extension and or cuts you off and or isn't sufficiently UNK up about who's who and where to reach UNK
now the other side of that was a plea which came from our switchboard supervisor which i'll come onto in a moment where she said people will often think that of her UNK but in actual fact it's because they haven't got the right information from people at this end so there is another side to that story
UNK left hanging on without explanation of what's UNK that's your frustration
not knowing who you're talking to and what authority they have to help you
that's people who don't tell you who they are when they answer the phone
UNK called at an UNK time by an UNK caller who assumes that since you've answered the phone it must be convenient to UNK
erm the other side of that is that people who phone you up and don't say is it convenient to speak
a lot of people now will call you and say UNK this is so and so do you have a moment UNK or UNK it convenient to speak UNK
now i do agree with that if you phone up and somebody phones you and they just talk to you and then for about five minutes later the person at the other end of the phone says UNK in a UNK and you just thought UNK why on earth didn't you say that in the first place UNK so there is another side to that one
UNK jumping to an UNK conclusion about your needs before you've had a chance to explain UNK
there's a very good example of that in the film you'll see where somebody phones up and doesn't quite know who they want to speak to but they get through to a department and they say UNK i've left some UNK and the caller immediately and the person who's received the call immediately says UNK money you want the UNK department i'll put you UNK and before the UNK had a chance to say UNK no i really want to speak to you they've gone and they're back at the switchboard UNK
being forced to answer a series of closed questions that don't adequately allow you to express your real needs
again you'll see a good example of that where closed questions are good in a situation if you want to get a direct answer to somebody who tends to UNK but again if you're asked closed questions and you want to give information it is harder it's easier if you ask somebody an open question and on the film john UNK comes up with the starters to an open question which are the who what which why where when questions
in UNK ringing off leaving things vague and you uncertain about what will happen UNK that's where people haven't finished off the call by UNK what's happened and what you've agreed to do as a result of receiving the call
and finally one of the UNK that came out was UNK by an answering UNK instead of a real person
some people don't mind answering machines i must say i'm beginning to get used to them now i think the problem is that it sort of wrong UNK you so you get an answering machine and think UNK my UNK and you know that in about a few seconds time when you hear that UNK you've got to give a concise message which will be UNK to the person when they UNK it so instead of coming out with sort of UNK you're forced into thinking what the essence of the message is that you want to leave
and i think that's probably why people find it frustrating
erm somebody on this morning's course said that they quite like answering machines they use them like note pads and they ring up people they know have got an answering machine so they can just leave a message they say it's quicker than writing a letter and it's easier than talking to them for hours you can just ring them up and leave a message on their answering machine like a sort of note pad which i hadn't thought of but i suppose it's rather good isn't it
so those are the main UNK on the phone
now a lot of those UNK would be UNK by the fact that our callers go through a switchboard who will take out a lot of the UNK by doing some detective work before the call actually gets to you
and as i said i spoke to the supervisor switchboard supervisor di UNK when we were setting up the course and asked her what sort of things she would like to put across at a course like this which would make the UNK job easier
and she came up with a list which are UNK from the switchboard supervisor
and there is a hand out on this on the chairs at the back if you'd like to help yourself to them before you go
and i'll just go through them
the switchboard is open now from UNK to UNK
outside of those times there is a night line which is on so any calls that come into the press outside of those times will come through on a special number which will ring and anybody can pick up
and alex will show you how to pick up a call you simply just press a number and you then pick up whatever call is there
now that really does put you directly in the front line when you're answering the phone so that call could be for anybody when you take up a night line call
when the switchboard is fully UNK there are two operators plus a UNK operator who also operates the switchboard at peak times
and peak times are between 9 and 9 UNK and 1 and 2 UNK
so if you avoid trying to muck the switchboard up if you could between 9 and 9 UNK and 1 and 2 UNK
when out of the office at meetings or going on holidays please divert your telephone
and that's something that alex will show you how to do if you haven't yet worked out how to divert your phone
once you have diverted your telephone please check that you have diverted to the correct number
we have had occasions where people have mis UNK when they've put on their diversion and it's gone to somewhere completely different and the people at the other end cannot understand why they're getting phone calls for somebody who doesn't work in their office
there are two ways to check that you've diverted
one is to get somebody to call your number and check it rings at the number you've diverted to and the other is to call the switchboard and ask them because on the switchboard when they dial your number up will come the number that it's been diverted to
so they can check so please check that you've diverted your number by using one of those methods
at the moment the switchboard can only take basic messages because otherwise it becomes too time consuming
however there is an attempt to set up a message desk where if your phone at the moment switchboard will put calls through to you if you don't answer by a certain number of rings it will either divert to another number or come back to the switchboard
eventually when it comes back to the switchboard they will know that you've not answered and they can say UNK sorry there's nobody there would you like to leave a UNK in which case that call will then be diverted to a particular message desk where they will just take a very brief message which will be passed onto you
that's not yet in operation but we're hoping to set that up
now this might sound silly but people do it when leaving your name for someone to call you back from outside the press please leave them your full name that's your surname as well as your first name and your extension number
apparently they have had people calling in saying UNK could i speak to UNK and that could be anybody and then the switchboard has to go through the UNK of saying UNK it all about do you know where the person works can you give me a bit more UNK and it takes up a lot more of their time so please if you're leaving a message for somebody to call you back leave your full name and your extension number
switchboard do like to see people
they do like visitors outside of peak time so if you get an opportunity do please go down there and introduce yourselves so they have a face to put to the name
and they can talk to you and show you around so you can have a look and see at the way the calls come in and how they deal with them
if your whole departments going out for any reason for a departmental meeting if you're all out at a conference or if there's some sort of briefing or something going on please let the switchboard know which numbers will be UNK and how long you'll be out for
that helps them then deal with a call as soon as it comes into the switchboard
they can say UNK sorry there's nobody on that number but i know they'll be back after such and such a UNK which is better for all concerned
if there is to be a major publicity launch of some kind or you're going to have if you've got an advert in some magazine journal newspaper or whatever and you're asking for people to call in please let the switchboard know who to put the calls through to and what it's likely to be about
that makes their job a lot easier and also a lot quicker
so as i say those UNK are all on a hand out which you could please take with you when you go
as i say there is a film for you to have a look at we'll have a look at the film now it's a video arts film called UNK telephone UNK and it deals with the correct way to handle calls as with all video arts there are some rather funny little stories about ways not to deal with calls
erm and i hope you'll enjoy it and also pick up the lessons
i'll go through it again once we've seen the film and ask you to give me the main points that came out of the film
let's go through the points that the film made
what were the points to professional telephone behaviour
what was the first one
the verbal UNK
the verbal UNK
and what did that consist of
introduction
introduce yourself
and what else
asking the person
yes and then what
once you've established who you are and who they are what should you do then before you continue
something that we linked in with the UNK earlier
asking
yes
right and what was the second thing
being helpful
yes what does that come under
getting the message
right and how are you going to be helpful
when you were getting the message what did that consist of
control of the situation
controlling the call by and how did you do that
asking open questions
that's right asking open questions
and than what
what do you do with messages
write them down
record and
make the right noises
pardon
make the right noises
yes make the right noises
right record and repeat so that you make sure you've got the right message
and then what did you do
take action from the call
yes what did that come under
and how did you do that
how did you offer your help
UNK information
yes you volunteered information
and then what did you do
tell them what you're going to do
that's right say what you're going to do and then you do it
right okay so the three areas of professional telephone behaviour were when you answer the phone you give a verbal UNK by introducing yourself finding out who is on the other end of the line and asking them if it's convenient to talk
getting the message by controlling the call through asking open questions and also remembering to ask closed questions if you wanted to control the call shutting up a UNK as with mrs UNK when she phoned up about her UNK
and then when you've got all the information record the information and repeat it so you make sure you've got all the key parts of the message down
and finally to offer help
to volunteer useful information so that the caller doesn't have to go through asking you questions
you volunteer information and then tell them what you're going to do as a result of the call and do it
right
those points you'll find again UNK up in a hand out which is at the back on the seats there
there is a hand out on professional telephone behaviour a hand out on the UNK from the switchboard supervisor and also a form a course form if you could take that with you fill it in and let me have it back sometime
right now alex will take you through our wonderful system and show you what it can do
just leave the equipment i'll clear it up later
okay fine
my name is alex ross i work in information systems
you've probably heard of information systems already
are you all new
anybody not new
oh good
you probably think it's going to be a bit of a UNK this afternoon but it certainly isn't
it's designed really to show you how to use the telephone system how to get the best out of it so you're not wasting your time you know working out what to do
i don't think you'd better have cards in front of you
we only had six here this morning and i wasn't expecting so many as thirteen
these are facility code cards they are cards to show you each facilities codes to use
now can you each have a handset
if not move around so you can
we've got what six phones we've got 2 UNK 6 UNK people
so it shouldn't be that difficult
we've got one on her own at the end there so
okay
right the system we have at the o u p throughout the network UNK and UNK is a UNK system
it's not b t it used to be b t erm until about UNK when we decided that the maintenance that they gave us wasn't good enough and got UNK in
we think UNK
we've also had more facilities to play around with
the UNK there are the cream UNK and the grey UNK there are no differences that are worth noting as far as performance wise but the grey handset has i don't know if you've noticed a UNK button okay so that you can have a conversation and press the UNK button and you cut off the person at the other end
you can't cut off a conversation merely by putting your hand over the handset it doesn't work
i've tried it to my UNK a couple of times and it really does get quite embarrassing so that's a difference and of course on the grey handset there's a pitch control underneath as well as a volume control okay so they're a bit more modern but i don't like these actually because you can't UNK them as easily as the cream ones they just don't sit on your shoulder
that's the grey one
also on the handset you'll see there's an r button a UNK button and a star button
you'll see why in a minute erm these buttons are on the handset
now everybody knows how to get an outside line don't they
just nine first and you dial straight through you don't have to wait for a secondary UNK tone do you
does everybody know the difference between an internal and an external ring
how would you know if it was an internal call for you rather than an external
that's right that's right
shall we try that
can you just ring UNK
i won't learn everybody's names because there's so many of you
UNK and that will of course be internal alright
now an external ring sounds like this
okay
it's like the b t phone at home
okay so that's quite handy to know
erm has anybody received a beep in the ear piece not knowing what it is
did you work out what it was
i think it was probably a ring that sort of like went on for about a minute or so
oh that's called a UNK that's a UNK if you leave your handset off the hook for more than a minute UNK seconds or is it UNK i can't remember for a length of time you get the UNK
it just basically says put your handset back on the UNK
the beep in the UNK is when you're on the phone either to somebody within the press or outside the press and another call comes through for you from the switchboard and you're engaged obviously and so they camp onto your extension number and you receive a beep in the UNK now you can speak to these people if you key in r star 1
you can also get back to your previous caller by UNK r star 1 and you can say UNK sorry i'll speak to you UNK to whichever you like
yes so you can UNK between the two
that will become quite significant when i tell you about call forwarding
now within the press each extension number has a class of service and a trunk access code
the class of service determines which facilities you can use i wouldn't worry about that so much because the system is set up so that most people can use most facilities
suffice it to say that sir roger's got UNK out of UNK and most people have UNK out of UNK as a trunk access as a class of service code
erm the other side apart from class of service is the trunk access and this is the same principle erm sir roger would have UNK out of UNK so he would have a very high chance of UNK a trunk if he was UNK out
whereas normally people would have in the o u p u k which just happens to be 6 out of UNK
so it gives you an idea of the range that's available in the system
okay
right now i'll explain some of the facilities on the telephone system
one of the facilities is call forwarding and that is available to every extension regardless of the type of service okay
and that's call forwarding
right does anybody know what call forwarding is
i'm not going to say does anybody not know because we're all new
does anybody know what it is
when you want to pass it to somebody else in the press
if you're speaking to someone on the phone and you want to forward that phone call to somebody else
but that's a call transfer isn't it we'll look at that in a second
call forwarding
what do managers do to their secretaries phones for instance they have their calls if they're not there
it's like a divert but UNK i'd like to think of as separate from call forwarding i'll explain why in a second
call forwarding is completely different
call forwarding i need to put on for you need to give me a ring on UNK and ask me to change your call forward obviously with the other person's erm consent
erm let's take mine for example there are several reasons why my handset won't be answered erm but for now let's just look at two
which two situations would my handset not be answered
if you're not there
if i'm not there if it's ringing
if it's engaged
engaged it's busy
my number is UNK my UNK and i could forward to my boss
she has a forward elsewhere when you think you could break these two down even further
please stop me if you don't understand because it's quite a tricky one in fact it's the most tricky bit
there are two other ways in which we could break down those two UNK situations
how can you break it down even more
we've already talked about it
you're busy and what comes through
another call
what kind of call
an outside call
right so we've got busy with an internal call coming through and you're busy and an external call comes through at the same time
so that's two there and obviously this one's ringing with an internal and ringing with an external
it's only got UNK ways
now you might think great UNK ways what'll we do what are the parameters well you can have anything you like that's logical
so on the form there in front of you see there are please delete anything which is inappropriate so i just assume you want them all unless you say
alright in fact my handset is just on ringing external i don't want hilary to be bothered with any internal calls of mine i've got a call log if anyone calls me i know they've called me so i can call them back anyway
so all i want to do is to forward my external calls which aren't being answered
that's the most important and those go to hilary only
alright can you see why the beep in the ear is so important just a second ago
beep in the ear is so important just a second ago because if we had this on busy on the phone and the next caller comes through because it was my phone those calls would go through to hilary so i wouldn't get a beep in the ear would i
i wouldn't get the opportunity to find out who else was calling me at the same time
if you're really busy on the telephone it's very handy to have this off on UNK otherwise you won't know
is that quite clear
any questions
as i say UNK completely different
that is if you like in the background i'll put it on for you can change it anytime you like and there's no problems unfortunately you can't do it yourself yet
everybody knows how to call transfer
has everybody got an extension
not everybody who works in the press has a telephone to their disposal
everybody's got one
everybody knows how to transfer basically r plus extension number
it's very easy isn't it
erm let's do the call hold then
it's on the card again
i think we'll have two since so many have turned up
could we have UNK calling UNK and just hold the conversation and UNK calling UNK and just hold the conversation
okay
now what i'm going to do is show you the advantage of putting somebody on hold as opposed to trying to put your hand over the receiver
okay you can put people on hold with the handset down
don't hang up yet
but i would like you two forgive me for not saying your names to put the other two on hold by UNK r star 9
now do you hear a long beep and a short beep a long beep and a short beep
that tone is your successful switching tone you will get that with most of the facilities that you put on the system just to let you know that it's worked alright
so now you can hang up you can't okay
you two can go out
so basically you've put them on hold you're going to have a private conversation and the call is still held at your UNK
right you've got UNK seconds after which your UNK will start to ring with an external ring for some reason but it's an external ring
so i suppose one of them right we can make mature so if you'd like to put your handset by the side of your phone don't put it down we'll let that one mature and prove that after UNK seconds we can't lose them and with the other one can we just prove that we can go back to the conversation any time we like
pick up the phone key in r star 1 and you should be back talking but with the other one we're just going to wait and see what happens after UNK seconds
alright thanks very much
somebody's got a UNK
is that you
you shouldn't have a UNK
it hasn't worked then
shall we try it again quickly and then leave it
r star 9 make sure you get the switching tone no well if you like yes
alright yes
so you're putting her on hold yes so you can put your handset down
right if you can leave your handset at the side you can see that it UNK after UNK seconds brilliant
erm call parking right
okay right call parking
this is the most useful facility i have known on the system
it's very under used i use it a lot when i receive calls from engineers elsewhere in the press and i want to go back to my office but continue the same conversation
it only works if you realise that your own extension number is going to be vacant at the time if somebody's using it then it won't work alright so if you try and transfer a call then you must make sure that the extension number you're UNK is free
let me show you how it works basically
erm this is the central message call parking call park 1 back to your office
let's say you receive a call in your UNK office on your UNK phone it's just come through to the wrong one
but you want to be in your office to answer that properly yes
so you say to the person you must say to them i'm going to put you on call park don't worry about it don't go away i won't be a minute or two
here you put in r star 6 plus the extension number and you'll get that successful switching tone which hopefully all of you will have experienced before we go the long beep and short beep like that
so if you want to see if it's actually worked alright
so you can't lose the call in other words
so you get long beep short beep long beep short beep that's the successful switching tone you'll know it's worked and you go UNK back to your office you get UNK seconds again it's like the hold before it starts to ring or you can access it by UNK in what
r star 1 r star 1
so you can either r star 1 or UNK seconds do you want to do that quickly
right can we have UNK calling UNK so that's UNK
right UNK not in her office right now she's in UNK so it'll take all of UNK seconds to get there so she'll make do with call parking it anyway
UNK great put your handset down alright you UNK there get your coffee get your and erm okay we've got UNK seconds we can either let it mature or we can access well i suggest we access because UNK seconds is a long time
are you speaking to
hello
that's right well done
if it doesn't work always try r star 1 again it can't go wrong
alright so that's the ordinary call park
alright it's a bit boring
call park 2 exactly the same code different situation
how many times have you written messages for people who've been engaged when you try and transfer a call to them
and you've gone UNK round and you've stuck these silly little stickers on their things that always fall off
and then you get blamed for not passing on the message when in fact you've done your best
it really is not very nice is it
what you can do instead is park the call very like the switchboard park the call at the desired handset so take my extension UNK i receive a call for hilary UNK i don't know how it just happens or perhaps it was you know an easy mistake
what would i normally do or anybody normally do i can't see hilary
transfer it
transfer it yes that's right
so i try r UNK what would it do
engaged
you try and call park them they so you call park r star 6 UNK then long beep short beep long beep short beep
now here's the crucial bit what happens after UNK seconds if hilary hasn't finished which is quite likely because she's on the phone a lot
ringing
that's right it will ring me back
do you see that
so there is a UNK in the sense that if you're UNK around here there and everywhere as i am i can't readily do that if i know it's engaged and it's on call park and i go off elsewhere the call comes back to my handset there's nobody there of course eventually where would it go
switchboard wouldn't it and that's not very good because they'd be answering a call twice
obviously i'm just giving you the down side if you're going to be there in your office and you know you're going to be there you're not going to dash off or if you are you can hear your phone ringing erm it's very handy and in fact it's UNK because the person phoning in gets to speak to the person they want to speak to not half a day half a week later alright
and you don't have to write silly
we'll try that though shall we
let's have somebody engaged
erm what about UNK remember off the hook
alright
now we'll have UNK you can call somebody on UNK okay and ask to speak to jo
jo you want to speak to jo
hello may i speak to jo please
mary you must try and transfer it don't you because you can't see that UNK off the hook we'll assume that we know that okay we'll UNK we'll try and call park it
would you mind just holding on please
yes thank you
okay did you get the successful tone
you didn't
right
try and stop the UNK that's okay if you just keep UNK the erm thing to stop it UNK that's fine
how are you getting on
it's stopped working has it
no it hasn't
star 6 UNK there you go
right so you have got the successful switching tone
we've call parked you UNK by UNK phone so as long as you know that you won't be too UNK about the length of time hopefully so you put your handset down and we can either wait UNK seconds in which case what would happen
UNK start to ring
that's right or erm actually jo can you hear any UNK in your ear now
you should be able to occasionally
it might take a bit longer than
i think actually you have to be set up in a conversation first
let's leave that for now
let's assume that you've finished your conversation alright
there is a difference between picking up your receiver and actually being connected
so actually finish your conversation put your handset down and we'll show you what happens
alright so you can see what happens somebody's engaged on the phone and you call park the call to them and you finish the conversation and immediately it rings
so i've shown you the good points and the bad points of it i think it's well worth using
may i ask you something
yes
erm what happens if erm your boss isn't on the phone and their boss has transferred all their calls to the other phone the other phone rings as well as the secretaries ring so you pick it up on your phone which is r star 3 and then you want to get it through to the boss but when you ring the number it comes through to the other phone
course it does
how do you get it through to the boss
the only way to if you've a diverted phone right erm we might as well talk about UNK now since you ask about it
erm the only way to get through to a diverted phone is to call it through the number it's diverted to
mhm that's what i meant
alright so if you're talking on the phone of course you'd transfer it to the secretary phone wouldn't you
yes which is in your office
and then use that one to call the boss if it was really important
yes okay
UNK
no one's talking about call forwards please don't confuse the two
alright
as i said mine's only on ringing with an external call isn't it
so
now if i don't go to this phone what would that look like it wouldn't be just UNK would it she UNK i'm just trying to compare the two because they are quite different
it would be everything wouldn't it
there'd be nothing my extension number couldn't receive unless you've got a very high class of service telephone that UNK you can't get through it's impossible to get through
so in that case i would get UNK be bi re in fact busy you can look at busy it'll just assume anyway yes
in fact these are irrelevant
it's irrelevant once you've got a divert
i wanted to do that to show you UNK completely UNK what is in the semi permanent background
you can ask me to put this on for you change it however many times you like that's not a problem
UNK you do yourself and take off yourself and they completely UNK anything that's written on there
okay yes and the only way to get through to a diverted number is to call the number it's diverted to
let's try that
it sounds a bit funny doesn't it
UNK can you put on a divert to UNK
it's on the card as well isn't it
anyone you like really but as long as we know which one it is
it's got a tone
is it long tone short tone long tone short tone
oh yes
that's the successful switching tone
now you know it's worked
okay now anybody apart from the one who did you actually divert to by the way
UNK right
anybody apart from UNK phone try and get hold of UNK and you just you can't do it
it's UNK doing it isn't it
alright
it just doesn't work
that's highlighting i guess one of the points sue made that it's very important when you answer the telephone in the o u p to say exactly who you are or which department you work in or something to do with your identity on the phone because in the system you could see that if UNK now diverted her phone to UNK you want to call UNK and you'll get UNK
so you can't sound surprised at the line you know if somebody calls for fred UNK and you haven't got a clue who he is don't sound surprised because it's probably this divert train
alright
now UNK you can get UNK say you're fed up with the UNK now take it off which is what usually happens
alright
camp UNK
horrible term probably made by engineering or something
there are two sorts of camp on just like two sorts of call park
the first is quite boring and the second is less boring
why do we camp on
why do we do it
because they're engaged
right that is the most common sort of camp on because say i call hilary who is engaged the codes on the card which is the code for the camp on
r UNK 1 that's right
so UNK and UNK and i want to call her but she's engaged
r UNK 1 successful switching tone replace my handset UNK can you call UNK please
sorry i was going to say UNK
sorry
don't worry
i forgot to ask you to just take the handset off
can you call her again no just leave it that's fine you're in effect engaged that's right
okay so you've got the engaged everything
now the interesting thing about this is you don't actually put the facility on unless you've found out that the extension is engaged first if you think about it there would be no point
so you can put r as opposed to a call park or a hold or something
that's it
alright successful
now we're just waiting for UNK to finish the conversation
alright
and as soon as they've finished the conversation don't leap to the phone alright
i'll show you why alright
now you've got three calls
if you pick it up you've got a chance to speak to them
if we did it again we won't do it again but if we did and you got the ringing and you ignored it you've got about 9 seconds to ignore it just goes away
don't think that because it's actually ringing that it's somebody ringing or whatever
does that happen when you're say your extension rings and somebody rings and in fact nothing happens
we'll have to get rid of that noise
this UNK going to be no longer they're moving everything
it's part of the UNK
it's a bit of a shame really because it's quite a nice room
erm where was i
so when you if someone camps on to you is that what happens if i take my desk there's an unusual amount of ringing and nobody there when i actually pick it up
someone's ringing when somebody's UNK on to you and they then decide they don't want to call you
you would be totally UNK by it okay now there is one way that you might think camp UNK are quite strange and that is if you've got a camp on right and somebody's engaged but they're engaged for longer than UNK seconds you get a ring back but you don't get a successful ring back you get a ring back of the same long say 2 and a half seconds it might ring engaged okay if the person's still engaged
well you might think that you have to re input the camp on but you don't the camp on only UNK itself if you choose to ignore it or if it UNK
can i say something about camp UNK
i had not here but at home a very awful experience of somebody UNK on to the electricity board because the power was off and i was trying to ring them up and you can't get through to somebody who's UNK on to them
alright
somebody else can't get through
so this person thought he was terribly towards the electricity board and i needed to get through in an emergency and you can't
well i don't know anything about star services what b t call their own services
they are UNK erm they're not sort of based on these internal facilities
but they are quite similar
i've no idea how they work because i've never come across them
can you camp on to somebody who's UNK on to somebody else
certainly yes you can phone somebody whilst you're camping on to somebody else as well
what happens if you get two to three phone
well you shouldn't
alright
what if you camp on to somebody and then their phone becomes free and this starts ringing and by the time you've picked it up and answered it they've made another outgoing call so they're busy a second time
there is one way to avoid getting camp UNK on the telephone which is
erm you know you might be very busy and you don't want people to call in internally
so you finish the conversation and you just flick the handset you flick the black button in other words you don't fully put the handset down so you flick the black button and you make another call and the camp on doesn't mature it doesn't seem to mature because it doesn't seem to be long enough for the computer to recognise that the conversation has ended
is that what you meant
no what i meant is if saying that if i UNK onto that number over there UNK and if that phone becomes free this phone starts ringing and i might be doing something so by the time i've picked it up to make that connection suppose UNK is then making another outgoing call do i have to camp on yet again to UNK
yes if it was erm if it was ringing through alright and it's a two seconds ring that you get okay you can either get it because the party is engaged still alright in which case it's not successful
so if it was you wouldn't know that of course if you'd picked up the phone would you
but if it's ringing because it was successful i e the camp on has UNK and you've chosen not to look at it then yes you will have to re input your camp on
if you don't actually pick up the handset and either get engaged meaning that the other party's engaged you won't find out
so the only logical answer is to put it on anyway if you're worried because you can't put two camp UNK at the same time it won't allow you to
alright
oh i see
any UNK
right
the other kind of camp on is erm the UNK no UNK camp on
it's exactly the same code it works in a slightly different way
if you're desperately trying to speak to somebody and they're out of the office i don't know they're just not there you can camp on to their handset even though you just get ringing
so it's not engaged but you can still camp on to their handset basically the computer tell them when it's next used
alright
which is why it's a very good idea when you next go into your offices this afternoon to rock the receiver like this because any camp UNK put on the wrong extension on the UNK no UNK camp on will be UNK on a first come first served basis so that's how people get to talk to you
if however you go back into your office and completely ignore your handset then the camp on will be cancelled overnight
alright
so we could try that if UNK rings UNK and don't answer please alright
okay did you get the successful switching tone
yes
right now we're aren't we we're because the next time that handset is used the black button in other words is UNK and lodged by the way it will send a signal to the computer saying UNK it's your turn to carry out the camp on if you want to again you've got the choice you don't have to nobody has to answer a camp on
nobody has to answer a telephone so alright
so it could go on all day in fact it wouldn't mature would it overnight because the computer doesn't allow it
let's assume that you've come back into your office from the training session and you go up to your handset and you rock it
alright it's a lot of fun isn't it
the problem is trying to get people to go into their offices and rock their UNK
i never remember
mind you i'm lazy anyway because i record i receive the calls from anyway so it's not a problem
but it's very difficult to say to people UNK back into your offices and rock your UNK because it's the last thing on your mind especially after a boring afternoon like this all you want to do is get in there do as little as possible and go home
right so let's talk about diversion
we've talked about it a bit didn't we where is it connection how to check whether you've got the right diversion
how you do that if you put a diversion on of course we know it UNK the call forwarding how do you know you've got the right diversion to the right extension
this is very common this is one of the common problems that di says to me
she says UNK am i going to get round all these people phoning me up saying UNK am i not getting calls it's all your UNK you know all the rest of UNK when they haven't diverted their telephone to the right extension number
how do you check
yes that's right a lot of people don't do that and it's so simple isn't it
it's very easy
remember to un divert your phones as well because you'll probably get fed up or quite like the fact that you're not getting any calls
and the code is on the cards as well it's UNK 9 to un divert
alright
if you are in a UNK don't worry about it because you can always phone di up on the switchboard or me but i'm usually not there
di
so you can phone her and say UNK terribly sorry you know i don't know what i've done something silly can you tell me is this phone diverted to such and UNK or whatever
it tells you on the screen alright any of the phone calls from the switchboard
they're very helpful
they don't mind helping you out getting the UNK in the right position because the last thing they want is to put the calls through to the wrong person
these system UNK numbers anybody know how to use them
UNK 6
yes
they're in the telephone book aren't they
they're published
we found that we went to go to the telephone system that there were a whole load of numbers not being used
it's criminal really
so what we're doing now is and we'll do again this year when we publish the telephone directory again is to send out to divisions any numbers that they want saved on the system
UNK got them as well UNK got their own system
can you use our oxford numbers
yes
you can
since we went d p n s
yes data packet networks i mean it just means that we're talking as if we're one site and not three
erm so we've got UNK using oxford numbers oxford i don't think can use UNK numbers i could be wrong there never tried it never tried UNK or whatever it is
but there we are
these have six numbers and they're designed so that everybody in the press regardless of trunk access can use the numbers described
alright
so obviously managers who've given some members of their staff trunk access 3 which is very low which is oxford can say to their staff UNK phone new york phone florence phone this phone that and get me a list of all these UNK and they can do it because the system doesn't look for their code doesn't look for their limiting UNK erm trunk access code UNK everybody can use system UNK numbers UNK 6
we want more people to use them from particular divisions i e if you've got common numbers you can't really say numbers to the handset adequately the system has been proved to be so it's a lot easier to have common numbers and publish them in the telephone directory so look out for that when next the lists go round to update it update the telephone directory
put forward your suggestions say UNK i want this in i want this UNK be UNK instead of UNK all those figures all you have to do is UNK 6 and the number
alright
incidentally any of these phones here has got absolutely no trunk access on it it's got class of service UNK got no trunk access
to prove it that obviously the trunk access is UNK anybody can ring up UNK 6 UNK is new york isn't it UNK 6 UNK somebody try it
i mean it didn't basically say go away and don't do that did it
you can't speak to a computer
erm night call pick up
erm i don't know if anybody's noticed but before half past UNK in the morning and after half past UNK you get screaming night bells around the press they're not the blue phones they're the emergency phones it's the little square sort of socket like thing above most of the corridors and that screaming away tells you that there's an outside caller ringing UNK
what we've done is we've set up an answer phone to pick up these calls after UNK seconds after UNK rings sorry about UNK seconds which is quite a long time
we've had to set it up like that because sometimes people working late would like to pick up calls expecting a call or pick up calls on a different handset
to pick up these calls all you need do when you hear these screaming bells anybody can do it doesn't have to be within your area okay
any call coming in call for UNK and UNK could be answered by arts and reference i mean it's UNK numbers that's all the criteria is
pick up the handset key in UNK you can't do this can you
you've got night service UNK
r star 3 and then UNK
yes does that happen quite often because i've noticed people go home at about half past UNK at UNK
i don't know there's someone there till half past UNK and the girl on the switchboard is there till quarter past UNK
oh is there
oh right
so is that quite adequate or would you rather have night bells
i don't think you can have night bells actually because the system is too small
i think it works quite well
yes because you've got UNK phones now haven't you on UNK two downstairs and two up
well that's good if it's working well it's working well but here if you're here say for a late afternoon meeting or something and you're wondering what these screaming bells are they're the night bells and you can pick them up by picking up your handset and pressing UNK and that is it and you're through to the outside world
so it's best not to say UNK alex here UNK
i've done it many times and they're wondering who they're speaking to is it the press or is it some private number they've got instead
it's very important to try and answer UNK university UNK because otherwise you know it's not good form really
hopefully you've got the up to date telephone directory beside you and you can transfer it and we all know how to transfer it
it's probably not a good idea to try and call park things late at night because the movements of people are rather different after UNK o'clock their UNK usually aren't UNK
if i try what to say to them if you can't get through
if i can't get to the person they want i try and say to them UNK can you please ring UNK because if they left a message that message would have been lying on my desk until the next morning until i get round to actually phoning that person internally saying this person rang
now that's okay i would do that but it's much better i think to say UNK i'm sorry they're not there would you like to ring back when the board is UNK because they won't realise you're not switchboard
there's nothing to tell them that you're not the switchboard
as long as you're UNK people will quite appreciate especially if they're working quite closely with members of the press they know the hours of the switchboard and they know what goes on
just because they're outside callers it doesn't mean to say they don't know what hours
right erm i think that's it really
is there anything you think i haven't explained please say now
what is the UNK not UNK thing for
that is for sir UNK and people like that
i mean i tried it once and it didn't go down too well even though i was on lunch
i put a do not disturb on my phone and hilary came through and said UNK are you doing putting UNK not UNK on your phone for UNK
i said i was at lunch
UNK well fair UNK it's not really a good idea
what happens to it then does it just or what
no it just rings engaged i mean you can try it you can try and get through but it won't work
in fact the switchboard can UNK it
there's only a couple on there that you can't use
one of them is i don't have UNK trunk access codes on them if you want to try them i only have 6 erm direct extension select basically i was saying that only very top managers and stuff can UNK well this is the thing to use
there's no point in using it
it'll work here but not around the press
switchboard use it a lot again to try and get to the bottom of you know calls that are going through to the wrong place and things like that
save number UNK
i've had a lot of problems with that so i basically say don't use it whether you try or not is basically up to you
it might work for you with a lot of people it doesn't because there's a lot of r UNK involved
right
i won't say any more because a lot of it in the back of the telephone manual on facilities so it's all explained there
if you haven't got the telephone manual bit at the back which shows you all these facilities then let me know and i'll send you one
it's not been updated it's about UNK it's quite UNK
but if you can forgive the printing bits and things like that system admin and things like that then it's not too bad
erm extension UNK don't use
it's a strict UNK just don't use it doesn't work properly
you'll upset a lot of people if you try
because people who've been in the press for quite a long time were using this before we took over the telephone system
little did we know that g p t didn't actually write the software properly and what was happening was that people writing new numbers in were knocking out the old numbers alright
so i won't say too much about that either
everything else you can use
and the only thing you have to ask me about is the group pick up which i haven't mentioned have i
group pick up which i'll just mention in a second and call forwarding
i need to know about call forwarding and any conditions you want changing there
group pick up is very handy if you're with a large bunch of people in a large office you can get together and say UNK why don't we answer everybody's telephones if they're not there let's not just leave them UNK okay so you get together and you ask me and say UNK this UNK it could be up to UNK all want to be in the same group pick UNK so what happens is the phone rings but another one rings
the first person can key in star 3 the first one ringing will be answered
the next person to ring star 3 the next phone ringing will be answered
the beauty of the system is group pick up is that you don't have to know the extension number of the phone ringing obviously star 3 that's it
right
call pick up as opposed to group pick up call pick up should be on there is star 3 and the extension number and as you can imagine you have to know what the extension number is before you actually access the facility
you can't say UNK god there's a phone over there UNK pick up your handset and go star 3 UNK my god what is it UNK something that'll do UNK
because it won't work you have to know the exact extension that's ringing
it works with any phone in the press but it's quite limited
it's quite nice to know in an emergency if there's a phone ringing say in your UNK office or you know in a UNK office or something like that you want to answer you don't want to let ring and ring and ring and you know the extension number quite well then use it
it'll work on any phone not just your own
so that's the difference between group pick up and call pick up
group pick up you'll need to ask me about group pick up with call forwarding
anything else
if you want to get through to the operator or directory enquiries is it necessary to go through the operator
no directory enquiries is actually on UNK 6 it's UNK 6 UNK
operator is slightly different can't do it in other words
you can get international directory enquiries on UNK 6 as well that's in the book and i think you can get the international operator
no you can't because otherwise you'd be able to call through the operator
it's just directory enquiries both national and international
if you want to speak to the operator then yes you must phone and ask them to get the operator for you
i don't know whether they ask you if you've got a reason or not i don't know
does anybody want to know about the cost of telephone calls
who pays for it
no
oh alright then i want to go home as well
is it the same as normal prices or is there a bit
oh the pricing is very similar yes it's not exactly the same because we don't have a meter policy here that's b t
we've got an internal call log which works it out for us
but i was talking about internally
i s used to pay all the phone bills and now we've got wise to it
now we bill out the divisions okay and the divisions bills have to be quite accurate and obviously we one or two extension numbers which are new
erm and basically the divisions pay for their phone bills
we still pay for the equipment
i s still pays for the installation and the equipment and you know the maintenance of the system as a whole
it's the calls the calls are charged to the divisions at the moment i mean that's just stage one
they charge it by each phone or generally
no by calls by calls made on the phone
what calls are being made
oh yes oh yes i mean that's the purpose of the call log really to split down to every extension number the calls made
it's not used very often actually it's only used for security purposes really
do you record calls
no we don't record calls no
heavens no
we wouldn't get the chance to listen to it all
i wouldn't even know what the purpose would be for doing it really
no we don't UNK any conversations
i don't know what the engineers get up to mind you but no i don't think so
have you got everything have you got all your pieces of paper and everything
well thank you very much this is quite historic really the last training session in the john hall room it's rather sad
yeah that's it working
that's just lovely
mhm
i'll stick it under there
that's just lovely
now is this just is this to mind me
aha
i was gonna ask you
and the first one would be where
that would be sanday was it
aha he was sanday
mhm
at that time the erm there wasn't he wasn't undertaker
he was a joiner and on the islands the UNK had to do undertaking
mhm
and any join well not anyone but most of the UNK did the undertaking more or less in the area they were in
so would like the three different sort of areas of sanday the parishes each have a joiner
cross
well there was one well father was in cross but er there was one in what we called the south end
aha
and he was getting to be an old man and he had actually stopped and then father would take er would be asked to do the undertaking in that part
mhm
and er there was another m man a mr peace who had been
mhm
an undertaker and he lived near the centre of the island
mhm
near the village in
mhm
and he did but then he was a lot older and he eventually stopped and er there would have been one at UNK in UNK
but eventually
mhm
it came to be that it was the older men usually that were asked to do it i mean the people i suppose maybe felt it was more suitable to have older folk coming in to their houses
mhm
mhm
and er and then he was the only one who did it
i see so the older chaps would just gradually
well he star i think probably the first he must have been a joiner for a wee while before he was you were just asked to do this the same i suppose as any other job any other joiner job
mhm
mhm
on the island
mhm that was just part of the job then
it was really part of the job
mhm
mhm
so did he
do you think he served time on the island with one of the older ones
he served he served his time on the island
he was actually the oldest son of a farmer and er was expected to stay at home and the firm
mhm
but he went and got himself an apprenticeship and then his parents saw that he
mhm
was really serious about being a joiner so he went and he served his time with a mr at UNK
mhm
and they did a lot of things just the old way you know where they had the
mm
the pit and the circular with a saw you know the wood they had to go down in a in a pit
i don't really understand it but the apprentice went down in the pit of course and the older man was above and they worked this saw all this UNK was coming
oh i see
yes something like that you know
was it a UNK
it was a hand sort of saw that they did this UNK of the wood with
good grief
but that was but a again he served his apprenticeship as a joiner
mhm
not as an undertaker
he'd have been undertaking with this man
i see
but it was all part of the job
