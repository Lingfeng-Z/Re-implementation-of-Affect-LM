a chap on sanday was in sanday
aha this was a man who had been a joiner there for a long time
mhm
and was his son going to be a joiner as well
he didn't have a son this man no he didn't
he didn't have a son
so he's be able to afford
aha
to take
oh well he had to take on a oh he could easily afford it because he was paid about five shillings in the year
and he got the p he i think he said his first years pay was five shillings
mhm
and they got a harvest
so they were allowed to go they were allowed to go and work a harvest at a farm
mhm
to make money
but then father didn't do that because he was staying at home and he was expected to do his harvest on the farm so his money was five shillings
and that was that
yes that's right
that was it
and his keep at home
he didn't have to
aha yes
yes i've heard of that in south ronaldsay
it was a chap that was a UNK and they got to choose when they were in their in either the harvest or one season at the fishing
oh it'll be the same idea aha
yes
aha
mhm
and then how long would a apprenticeship take then
aye well i think it was three years
and then they had to be a for a certain length of time before they would be a master joiner
mhm
mhm
so he would did he
i'm not certain about that
aha
did he have to kind of sort of did he look on that as a profession to do beside the farming or did he
oh he just wasn't interested in farming
right
mhm
so did have to take them
and he was yes aha piece work on the farm
aha
aha
i see right i get you
and then he would serve when the other was the mr he trained under was he one of the two older UNK on the island
he would have been one of the older UNK
mhm
there might have been three of i don't know how many there were but he was one of the older UNK
mhm
so would you be brought up on sanday as well
yes i was brought up on sanday
aha in cross
in cross
in cross
and yes and how long would did he serve his whole er time on the island
worked all his time on the island
he worked he worked all his time on the island apart from the time he was in the army
he was in the UNK so he was called up
mhm
the friday before the war started and was there until
mhm
he was UNK
mhm
he while he was away there'd be just the older folk on the island
i suppose so
mhm
and he came back after and carried on
aha
and he came back and carried on
mhm
so the er the other UNK on the island they acted as UNK as well we discussed that
it was just seen as a normal part of the job then really
it was indeed aha
you just did what had to be done
and it
yeah
it had to be done
ad what happened then when somebody died did you hear
well s mm
oh there's somebody that lived in the house in
aha
and you would he used to go to the house and
mhm
and er had to measure up the body because the UNK were made to measure
oh i see
he had to go and they would i think actually sometimes had to lay out the body as well
really
aha
aha
i because we didn't have any part of this being children i mean we just knew that he
no mhm
somebody had died and
mhm
he used to go to the house and he'd measure up the body and i
mhm
think they laid it out as well and
mhm
then er they'd come back up
mhm
so he would maybe get word from the head of the house or the nearest UNK call on them
yes the person most yes would call on him and
aha
oh would this be sort of formal would the p other person be dressed in sort of black clothes or aha
i would imagine they would have worn their black cap anyhow that would be the UNK thing to do
yeah
aha
so you would kind of know when you saw what colour th that it would be that
well yes aha
yes
they were they were calling for
and how much time did it take to make the coffin
well i was just talking that over with er his apprentice and he said
mhm
it took them a long time to begin with when he started
oh really
aha
it took them i can't remember how many hours but it took them a long time
but then by the time they were UNK he retired and they were finishing they were ta they were taking about less than half the time
because they had UNK and before all the
oh i see
UNK everything was UNK
aha
and it took a lot longer
aha
so just the new the sort of technology coming in
aye it would probably help a bit
and the two of them working together over a long time they would work
aye
together more quickly
mhm
so when he heard did he just start immediately then
oh yes
everything
aha
the whole household just
really
mhm
the whole household was needed because the well he had a store of big boards
mhm
mhm
for the sides had to be shaped
mhm
well these had to be bent you see and they saw a wee bit through them
mhm
mhm
but they also had to bend then
yes to make them
and they used hot water
they had er boiling water
mhm
mhm
and the only way of boiling the water at that time was on the stove in the house
so everything that would hold water was put on the stove and er he did and then it they took it out to the
mhm
workshop and they would cover this board with UNK like s what we call UNK
mhm
mhm
and they poured the water and that held the heat in and then bent to the shape
for the sides
oh i see
aha
the bo the bottom would be cut to the size and shape
mhm
and then the sides were UNK with the hot water to fit
UNK mhm
so you didn't need to cut the sides at all
it was enough just the hot water and the UNK
they i think they made small UNK in it
i can't remember because we weren't in the
no
really paying much attention to that
mm
so that would involve your mother as well
oh yes
she would
aha and also they had you see they had glue a glue pot
they had the glue had the glue they did a lot of UNK i suppose fixing on the material
oh i see so mhm
and er the glue pot was also in the one this stove
it was a metal container
aha
with wa water boiling in it and a wee pot that fitted in the top
oh i see
and it was great big lumps of glue
looked like huge UNK pieces of UNK that he used to put in here and it UNK and
and was it sort of dark
it was dark brown
UNK stuff
mhm
i can imagine a baby would just delighted
yeah
aha
yes aha
UNK a brush in it and UNK it UNK it round
so would he call in extra help to make the coffin
no
just himself
just him just him himself and his apprentice
and er would you usually was there a special time of anything that he would be told
was it usually a
oh no they would come right away you see because the body would have to be laid out when it was er
oh of course
mhm
when it was
he went right away
be practically the first person to know then wouldn't he
mhm
first
aha
yes i would imagine so after the doctor
so in the beginning do you think you were speaking about a whole afternoon and an evening to make the coffin or all day
oh much longer
much longer
between because before they got he went away and measured up the body and he also had sometime then you see he would have to go and put the body in the coffin
and before the funeral the they would he would probably have to take a window out of the house
oh
because the coffin had to come out of the stayed in the house the b the
aha
UNK
and
yeah
aha
i mean you like the ordinary houses are there's no room and you could not bend the coffin with a person in it so they would have to take the window or the bedroom or wherever the UNK was
mhm
they took it out and sort of temporarily fixed it in so that they could get this out at the funeral and then he had to go back later and fix the window in
good grief
well that was in a c certain houses
yeah
and
if they didn't
just to put the coffin into the house the wouldn't have to take a window out to put the coffin in
i wouldn't oh no they would get in alright
i would imagine yes
well in most cases i would think so
yeah
mhm
so erm as well did you have any
oh yes we used to get the job of sewing up the wee cushions
mhm
inside the coffin that went under the head and the arms and the feet
and it was made of a sort of very i would think cheap UNK er cotton
be white
yes white and
aha
very UNK
there was sort of UNK that went in
oh
as well they were they was not just plain yes it was bonny
so was
and er we they used to fill there they were just filled with UNK
mhm
and they would be sent in and we would sometimes UNK up the cushions
oh good heavens
and stuff them
mhm
so was the material already with this UNK on it or was
oh yes
aha
aha
that didn't have to be UNK on by hand then
mhm
everything was
mhm and was it UNK on UNK or was it printed
the UNK
i would imagine the cushions maybe were more plain
mhm
but they had sort of UNK that was UNK on or on the inside of the coffin
oh i see
so was the inside of the coffin lined with cloth as well
it was lined
mhm
and then covers and UNK round the edge
ah
so would it
and the outside then was covered with black
ah
a sort of well it looked like black wool but i mean it obviously was a UNK cotton i would say
mhm
mhm
mhm
and er that then would be UNK round the edges with a sort of heavy lid kind of UNK
mhm
it had gold markings on it
mhm
mhm
yeah
and then they had the UNK and the UNK and then the top there was a tin sort of plate
mhm
with a name on
and that also had to be done by hand
father used to do that he would sit in the evening then and he had to scratch on this b it was a like a tin plate with a black sort of area to scratch
mm
out the erm the name and age and whatever details wanted on this
and then it was painted with gold paint
i see
and would this metal plate and the strip of metal that went round the top would that be sort of like ready made
i yes aha
yes came from some
aha
ready made
and another thing that sometimes had to be done was writing out off er the they didn't put er notices in shop windows or anything
they always bid for funerals and i can remember folk on in being horrified at the idea that folk would put a notice in a window
in writing telling folk about the funeral
mhm
they always had bidding for the funeral and sometimes the family would write out the bids
oh i see
and it was all it they were they were special forms for it
ah
mhm
and you would the name had to be filled in and the time and the details
mhm
and then the wee letter went in a envelope
mhm
and it would be relatives that would do the bidding in a certain district
mhm
depending on where the person was known
i mean if they were known widely through the island they might have bids going further but it might just be your own district
mhm
but sometimes that had to be written out as well at the house
mhm
and sometimes it's just the person or the family would come and they would want i think they used to by these from the shop
i see
the for the bids
mhm so did they give them up to the folk
they went around and oh well they couldn't post them because there was no post at the time
and post on a wednesday friday and saturday
mhm
so they didn't post them they people did the bidding they just went round like a UNK and
mm
handed them
and handed them handed them to the people
handed them to the
aha
mhm
and they would have a
they were all dressed in the navy blue suits and their white and their black UNK as well
mhm
yeah
and would women ever be UNK
no women didn't go to funerals
aha
in sanday
mhm
cos i've asked a few folk
aha
you know and they've all said women had no part in that s er at all
apart from women apparently attended funerals in
but i can't find out why
women attended funerals in i s did they not do it in UNK
i don't know i don't know about that either
i don't know either
but er i can remember being in UNK and a funeral there and to me it was very strange because they carried the coffin from the kirk right down to the UNK at the pier
mhm
well you see in sanday they didn't do that
they took it first of all it would be in a cart drawn by a horse
a horse drawn cart
mhm
mhm
and then in er in a vehicle
it could even be a UNK very often a school bus
och really
you don't think
long enough
mhm
and the UNK what they call the UNK was a smaller car
mhm
and with the back door off you see they would get that on that
mhm
but they're quite long distances in sanday you see
yeah that's right
while on UNK it was shorter distances
mhm
and the funerals were i would say nearly always from the house
yes
not from a church
not from the church
mhm
so the women of the house would be involved
yes
mhm
but er they just didn't go to funerals
to me
it was very strange
mhm
i remember one funeral when i was a little girl at the school was an old man who died UNK he was i think he must have been the best the last in orkney
and he died at we call it in sanday and it was snow
mhm
so they couldn't get along the roads and i think the UNK the probably the funeral was put off as long as they could put it off
and then they carried the remains across the fields to the lady UNK and that was past the school and i can remember us watching this UNK going across the fields
but that was the only s and then of course in sanday in the what we call the north end
mhm
of the island
mhm
they had the UNK
the ho the old UNK that er
yes there was a picture and that
mhm
mhm
mhm
so you wouldn't you would just er mind er the kind of less fancy it wouldn't be particularly made like the one in the north end it was cart and a horse
no it was just a it was just a cart and a horse
yeah
mhm
and who would drive it you know was it a special person that drove it
no it would just be the person that owned the
whoever owned it
who owned it
mhm
would lead the horse i would imagine
mhm
erm i meant to ask you about the inside of the coffin was that plain white material or was it did it have this u pattern on it as well
or did just the UNK have the
i would think it would just be UNK
but i i'm not right sure about that i don't remember
mhm
but the UNK er the inside was w they had wax as well the put on it
oh really
on the wood
at one stage aha
mhm
what kind of wood would they be made from do you know
well i would imagine it would be a very rough sort of wood i don't know
aha cos it would be covered
they were never left UNK i see
oh no
they were always covered
mhm
and a children's co a child's coffin would be white
ah yes mhm
and i don't
mhm
s remember seeing one of these
just
mhm
was there
white coffin
any status attached to the kind of wood you had
oh no status at all
oh yes well you see very occasionally i'd heard of somebody having an oak UNK coffin
mhm
mhm
but there was no oak UNK in sanday
i see
except i mean if anybody thought they were oak UNK th coffin that would have to come from somewhere else
oh i see
that wouldn't be made then
enough to have a oak coffin that would have come from somewhere else everybody got the same
in sanday
yes
occasionally someone who'd died another type of undertaking was where somebody had died out of the island
yeah mm
and that again all the arrangements would be made
mhm
but you didn't have the coffin making
the arrangements would be made and er oh well i never saw an oak coffin but we you'd hear
mhm
that and it probably wasn't oak at all it was probably just
yes
stained wood but er
yeah
it would look
aha
they wouldn't be covered then
no
if they were
i think that would have c been very of course but nowadays the
yeah
the black one would be more
yeah
so what happened if somebody die off the island did they have to send them
an undertaker on the mainland and then the remains would come on this boat
in a coffin already
in a coffin already
and the
aha
funeral company would meet the boat
really
and er they would proceed from there to the
i see
to the UNK
so would it be what was the boat serving sanday then
wouldn't be
it would have been the old
right
when i remember
mhm
i see
so would there be any special arrangement then
somebody to get the coffin off the boat or would it just be
i don't well i imagine it would just come off with any other cargo
yeah
mhm
and then be straight onto the
probably
probably
it would probably come off first i would imagine i don't know
mhm
i don't really know because i was never at the pier when a
mhm
i'd gone out on the boat
but er
mm
but all the bidding and the would be arranged
mhm
before they came up
mhm
and there would be a funeral when the boat came and i mean when the boat came is just when the boat came
i mean it might come
yes
the boat didn't come at any scheduled time
you knew when it was supposed to leave kirkwall and it went past this island or that one but
mhm
and it came roughly at time
mhm
and what about moving the if it was a sort of UNK on the island how was the coffin moved to the UNK house
was that moved in the cart as well or was it just carried across to the UNK house
oh well it couldn't have been carried because it was long di i don't know how cos i can't remember
but i guess they just got some way
just
father would have arranged that likely
aha
would was it er
i imagine that he would take it when he had a vehicle later on he would
yeah
probably take it in the back of that
yeah
but early on you see he when i before the war he'd nothing was first of all a push bike
mhm
and he went to his work on and then a motorbike
mhm
and UNK but
mm
maybe the folk there'd be some arrangement made to get there but what it was i can't remember
do you know if there was a special time that they did this at
or did they choose a kind of evening do you know or did it not matter
it would be UNK a pre arranged time
so that the folk were
aha
there was no sort of accepted time
i don't think no accepted time i don't think so
no
no
no it wasn't a particular occasion or anything
no
oh no i don't think so
mhm
and
i think if they
yeah i've heard of that mm
but that would be when the aha
so it probably would be arranged
aha
so do you think that the would happen as soon as the coffin got to the house
i would imagine i would UNK i would imagine so
oh i see
that's another
i didn't think but i would imagine so
and then you see the family would be there
mhm
so the coffin would really arrive and then you
aha
would have the dressing
i would think so
mhm
but that i think they were
no women would really see that of course
aha
oh well the women of the family would
yeah
everyone in the house
so the women would be at the
yes aha
yes
they just wouldn't be at the sort of UNK side UNK
aha
and er of course the UNK left open and folk would go and
mhm
well people would to the house to offer their
mhm
UNK and they would people were always asked if they wanted to see the remains
mhm
or do you just want to remember him as they used to
yeah
aha
but
mhm yeah
that's true
mhm mm
and would the undertaker also be responsible for the to lift the body into the coffin
no that would be they'd be expected every person would have i imagine they would al well everybody had a white sheet just for this
mhm
yeah
yeah
in case somebody dies
it was part of the equipment of the household
yeah
the some of them made their own UNK
i would imagine so
yeah
the UNK to be the suppliers you know
aha
but i imagine some person would want to use their own
mhm
UNK
mhm
but mostly i would think it would be
mhm
and would the would your father be at the funeral as well or would he
oh yes
yeah
he would
he would he would be organizing the taking of the salt and the he would stay until the
mhm
until the grave was filled in
mhm
so did he take part in that as well
he'd fill the grave in
yes
i remember once a cousin came it was a trip day
mhm
and this a c a cousin came out for to sanday
mhm
and he asked at the pier for my father
mhm
because he was he we didn't know he was coming
so they says oh that's this was pointed out to him
so he said oh i w yes but he says just come along with him so he went to the funeral and then he
yes
first things first
so he always remembers the time he went to this he's no idea who's funeral he was at but he just went along and then he was taken to see the family
that's quite good
and another occasion father said erm he said the UNK weren't very well laid out
mhm
i mean they'd UNK here UNK there and
mhm
sometimes when the grave UNK dug the grave they would find er that it was somebody else's grave and they had o start again
i've heard of that
aha
and er on this particular funeral er the grave the whole company was there
mhm
and this man came up to me father and he says that is not the right grave you've been told
the family had you see the family had to come and tell him where the grave was
mhm
and then he would arrange for the grave UNK to dig the grave
i see
mhm
only they'd been told the wrong grave
on no
so father says well just keep quiet about it until the UNK over
mhm
and then when they're all away we'll get the moved
so the funeral went on and the person was UNK into the grave that had been dug and the grave UNK was asked to stay behind and they quickly got it put where it should be
for UNK
aha
the person who told him was actually i suppose the person who's family owned the grave that
yeah
it was
so er that that's quite amazing there wasn't even more mistakes like that made
well there might have been that nobody knew about i don't know
yeah
but that was one case that he said and then he said it was getting quite dark by that time when the boat came in it was quite dark
so they were it was quite dark before they got the
mhm
oh i see so this was a UNK off the boat
the boat the body off the boat
aha
aha
good grief
so there wasn't any overall plan of a UNK arranged
well very poor plans
aha
i think for but then families moved and
yeah
mhm
i think better now but i think there's probably it's still quite still difficult quite difficult in the old er
mhm
UNK where they're not really marked out
mm and i don't think there was any real proper records kept of who was where
no i don't think so
cos nobody was responsible for that really
no
but i think it would be i don't think that could happen in the UNK
no
but it was just the fact i suppose that maybe some of the family had died out and the person that was wasn't just quite clear where it was
aha
so would coffin making stop on the island when your father stopped
no
no
there was a man a mr down in the north end leslie who used to be the apprentice he took
mhm
he started up on his own when father stopped
mhm
when he retired and this er mr did the undertaking
mhm
i don't know if he was a joiner he was a joiner certainly
mhm
but i don't know if he was a time served joiner or if he was just a he was really a very good UNK
mhm
and was a joiner
mhm
but whether he really was a s time served one or not i don't know but he did it then
mhm
s
and now you see UNK still done on the island
oh really
but the UNK are they come from the mainland
mhm
they probably have a supply of them
mhm
you don't know when coffin making stopped on sanday then
roughly what date that would be
i don't know
mhm
i know that father he used to you see if he was going away from the island
mhm
and he was away april he would always have a half made coffin a sort of standard sized one
mhm
in a underneath his workshop
so that the apprentice
oh right
they could he could carry on and do it just as a sort of emergency thing
i see was this
that was in the very end
mhm
but before that time i guess father didn't leave the island
that's right yes
so there was no problem
mhm
aha
emergency
yeah
i see so there would be if he was this would be at the end when you know this wasn't he didn't ever do anything like that before he went off to the w during the war
he didn't
no i think it was just straightforward
yeah
but then towards the end of this w would this be to help leslie
just in case anything happened
i don't know
because i was away from home by this time
but i do know that er
mhm
he would have
so it was probably about the nineteen what early seventies coffin making would stop on sanday
i don't really know but leslie could well be able to tell you
yeah mhm
did you did you know what your father ever thought of the modern UNK
oh i suppose he yes he was a very modern minded person
aha
i guess he thought it was fine
aha
i don't think it'd been very UNK work with the amount of time he took to it
no
no not if they would what spend about a whole day making it would they
oh well there was a lot of more time than that taken up you see
aha
because there's all the other running as well
yes it was a whole
aha
it wasn't just coffin making
he probably would get a sort of wages out of it but er running i would imagine would be for nothing
yeah
mhm
you'd probably would it sort of maybe be a set amount for making a coffin
i would think so as i would have think so
aha
aha
and i don't think it would be very UNK
mhm
but
two more drivers fall victim to highway robbery
and a UNK every week in the new national lottery
as the chancellor of the exchequer approaches the key judgements that will shape next month's budget he gets better than expected news on the state of the economy
the latest figures show that steady growth continued over the last three months and that as a whole the economy is growing at a rate of two and a half percent a year
the figures go some way to counter fears that the recovery is UNK but they reveal also that not every sector of the economy is gaining
in manufacturing output is falling
fears that the recovery might be running out of steam now seem to have been over done
UNK by stronger high street sales britain's service sector two thirds of the economy is reporting faster growth
retailers like the house of UNK army and navy stores have seen rising consumer demand
business is certainly picking up er not only in central london but erm throughout the entire country
and we've noticed that up to and over the last two to three weeks not only because our sale is on er but we're far more confident about the general economy
but while the services sector is UNK factory output fell in the last three months
the firm that makes the ties sold in the country's department stores is optimistic about prospects at home
but with more than two thirds of its products sold abroad the company's concerned at the continuing UNK in its export markets
we see the u k certainly coming out of recession and we are something like twelve percent up on same time last year in the u k having said that the e c is well over twenty percent down on same time last year
the economies total output its gross domestic product expanded for much of the eighties and UNK in the middle of nineteen ninety
in the recession that followed output fell UNK off last summer
since then production has started to climb back and the government now estimates that in the last three months the economy grew by nought point six percent
UNK the most important things is that these figures show that across the economy as a whole er economic activity is on a path of steady but UNK growth
opposition politicians were UNK by the government's claims
these figures show that manufacturing output far from growing is beginning to UNK again and that the growth rate is not enough to start seeing serious UNK into our high level of unemployment
the evidence out there in the real world and i'm a london mp is that people are not yet certain that there is a secure economic recovery
they hope it's there they believe it may be there they see a UNK sign here and there but they need other encouragement
the chancellor is gradually receiving a clearer picture of the state of the economy as he UNK next month's budget
the figures suggest a gentle recovery is continuing but at a rate that's unlikely to create many jobs
it remains uncertain whether it's a recovery that could sustain a tax increase on november the thirtieth

there was more gun violence in the capital yesterday a man apparently involved in drugs shot dead at UNK bush
for a police force still largely UNK it highlights fierce opposition to the UNK proposals on police reform now before the home secretary
they claim their work in dealing with violent crime cannot be linked as UNK attempts to other jobs
the home secretary in east london was reported this morning to have serious doubts over fixed term contracts and performance related pay though he wouldn't confirm this
the police service themselves recognize that there has to be a need for change that they have to be brought up to date er and er i think you'll see when i a announce my decisions on the UNK report er that er i am taking the need to er reform the police service very seriously indeed
police UNK including tory mps say UNK could run into political trouble
i think that parliament will want to look very carefully at the proposals he makes and if parliament is not happy with those proposals then i'm sure it will try and persuade the government to modify them
police and their supporters say officers UNK contract renewal might feel UNK to boost their arrest records and they wonder how the work of barry UNK and the late patrick UNK low key potentially dangerous can be measured against higher profile colleagues

in the latest incidents an UNK dealer was attacked at UNK services on the m six shortly after midnight and yesterday a woman driving along a quite country road in UNK had her car UNK by a gang UNK
last nights theft took place when an UNK dealer stopped to change a wheel on his car on the hard shoulder of the m six near the UNK service station in UNK and was attacked by three men who escaped in a white van

well with a knife sort of stuck under your UNK

police say the UNK van and the antique UNK car were both seen at a service station near manchester last night so the crime could have been planned
that is a possibility we're looking at it's a possibility that it may be an UNK crime

police today investigating the robbery in south wales say the increasing number of crimes against UNK could be UNK cases
that is quite possible when you get er this type of crime happening er nationally
it always UNK the idea in criminals minds that they might like to have a go at something like that themselves
this recent police video reflects the increasing number of UNK thefts from drivers in heavy urban traffic
and although the police say that crimes against UNK are still relatively rare all drivers should be on their guard

thousands of domestic servants like UNK have been allowed into britain under a UNK in the immigration act which UNK foreign visitors to bring in their own staff

at their small home she worked nineteen hours a day seven days a week and was paid seventy five pounds a month

commonwealth leaders meeting in cyprus have agreed to set up a special mission to lobby key UNK holding out on agreement on the gatt trade negotiations
it seems mr major and the australian prime minister paul UNK will be members of a team hoping to persuade other leaders that completion of the gatt talks by december the fifteenth is UNK
there's little doubt the commonwealth sees france as the main target of the mission but as a mainly english speaking organization its influence on president UNK may be limited so the french speakers among them will be pressed into service
mr major leading a group of prime ministers to make the announcement was aware of the need to engage france rather than UNK it
and even the sometimes UNK australian prime minister was watching his tongue
the point of the delegation is to impress upon er selected countries the importance which a representative group like UNK believes er is important
the leaders say they'll decide exactly where to send their mission during informal discussions this weekend
but the prime minister believes commonwealth acting together must be heard
countries from every part of the UNK of all sizes developed developing rich poor all see a practical advantage in UNK this round this year
i think that is both a substantial amount of peer pressure and also the UNK possible indication that there is an expectation right around the world that people will put the UNK benefit of a gatt agreement before purely domestic interests
this decision represents something of a final throw
the commonwealth believe that there has to be an agreement before december the fifteenth very little time to close such a complicated deal
but whether the french will be any more UNK to being UNK up on in this fashion remains to be seen

the supermarket giant UNK is urging the chancellor to freeze the tax on beer in next month's budget
it says cross channel shoppers UNK cheap beer from france are already costing british off licences and supermarkets nearly five hundred million pounds a year
and if the price of beer goes up the worry is more shoppers will go abroad for their beer
imported beer down from fifteen pounds a pack to under ten pounds in this south of england supermarket
UNK having to slash priced to compete with french stores

higher excise duty accounts for most of the difference stores like UNK reckon it's losing them sales of half a billion pounds a year
and it could get worse if the duty rises in the budget next month
if duty were to be put up in the budget then the UNK of the market would be greater than it already is
it is already working to the disadvantage of the exchequer some four hundred million pounds a year of lost tax revenue
it will affect jobs in british UNK and long term it may affect jobs in british UNK
UNK problem is what's bound to happen when you have a single european market but not economic union
that means that tax rates on products are different in every country
the number of cross channel shoppers has already risen by forty percent this year since restrictions were lifted
france is in the depths of recession so the UNK of UNK love this UNK of free spending english shoppers

it UNK missed the terminal building and it was only luck there wasn't another plane or vehicle on the UNK
the incident was almost identical to a similar mix up which happened six years ago
and once again it happened when an airline pilot became confused by UNK three parallel strips of concrete
these are the main runway and emergency runway normally used for UNK purposes and a small UNK
on wednesday night the main runway was closed for maintenance and flights were switched to the emergency runway

UNK in wood green this afternoon three hundred and fifty UNK were UNK their luck
the average UNK spends two hundred pounds a year on UNK but only thirty six pounds on charity
the government hopes half the nation will take part in its lottery giving people a UNK and financing good causes
the idea would go down well here
yes it would i'm a big UNK and i go into any UNK
it's a game of chance innit i mean you pay your money you come here to lose but if you win UNK a bonus
i mean and everybody's looking for that dream amount aren't they
and with the lottery you're getting the little bit nearer
and would you do the lottery
oh i don't know about that cos i've got to understand it haven't i
the bank executive named as head of the lottery will decide which business UNK gets to administer it
it could have a turnover of four billion pounds a year with weekly prizes of fourteen million pounds
our er primary objective in setting it up er is of course to get money to good causes and on a on a large scale certainly in terms of er the prizes er on the on my forecasts my conservative forecast there's ample opportunity for there UNK for there to be a UNK a UNK every week
if an entry UNK costs a pound half will go in prizes then charities arts sport and heritage get their cut as will the UNK fund earmarked for major projects like new UNK
the tax man will get a large slice leaving the rest for contractors to pay for administration and potentially massive profits
people could fill in forms in shops or supermarkets choosing random numbers which would be UNK and fed to a central computer with the results announced live on a weekly t v spectacular

the international trading company UNK and the al UNK brothers the owners of the UNK company house of UNK have settled their long running row over the ownership of the UNK store
both said cooperation was a better recipe for long term benefits to their respective companies
a committee of mps is to conduct and urgent inquiry into the running of the child support agency the organization set up earlier this year to track down absent fathers and extract maintenance payments
in its first six months the agency has handled half a million cases but there've been hundreds of complaints about the way it operates
police sergeant dick howard here with his second family is typical of the angry ex husbands UNK at new maintenance orders
the courts had set the sum he should pay for his child by his first marriage at seventeen pounds fifty
now the child support agency says he'll have to pay a hundred pounds a week
his ex wife and child and her second husband have been living on benefits for a year
that hundred pounds represents one fifth of his income which the agency thinks is fair but he doesn't
i feel really angry i mean i'm you might say because of my job that i ought to be law UNK but i am a law UNK person and i like to think that i would go along with all the laws because they are they are brought in for the benefit of all
but law should be fair and just and this cannot be
ex husbands are holding protest meetings mps UNK and newspaper columns have been UNK with such cases
hardly surprising given the huge number of people affected
in two years time the agency will have a case load affecting some ten million people one fifth of the population
the agency is in a UNK mood fighting off what they regard as a male backlash
many men have regarded the payment of maintenance as optional
not as an ordinary everyday obligation
they have also felt that if they make a payment at all that they're fully meeting their obligation whatever the level of that payment
or that they are in some way UNK
the agency says fathers were paying much too little ninety percent of the mothers are living on social security so are be definition far poorer than their ex husbands and that the formula always leaves the second family better off than the first
average maintenance is running at fifty pounds a week
the UNK been accused of targeting UNK fathers who already pay something to meet its five hundred and thirty million pound target in benefit savings
but they deny it and say that in well over half the cases they've taken on the fathers were paying nothing
UNK fathers have been making the running
less has been heard from mothers for many of whom maintenance is their only chance of getting off benefit
i'll be able to guarantee that money coming in even when i go back to work
it'll make the difference between me going back to work and not being able to go back to work
the fathers most justified UNK is the UNK of the new demands on their income
mps are getting letters complaining that fathers may have already taken on commitments they can't get out of and they were only expecting to pay whatever the courts had fixed
it is they say UNK retrospective
however the agency says they'd always intended to make a radical redistribution of wealth between fathers and their first families

he went to investigate and was murdered
his UNK are said to have run off laughing
the other man was found dead nearby he too had been shot in what may have been a drugs related killing
police are tonight questioning three men
home beat police constable patrick UNK didn't have to deal with the reported UNK last night at twenty eight UNK road UNK but knowing the area he said he'd go on his bicycle as ever
while there he heard shots from across the road at number thirty one stepped out to investigate and by what the metropolitan police commissioner called a tragic coincidence of events was shot dead almost immediately by one of three men
another man apparently the victim of a drugs dispute had been shot dead inside thirty one
a police UNK operation had been taking place at the house though not last night
patrick UNK was UNK forty four and came to the police late after a teaching career
as UNK built up it became evident how much he was held in affection and esteem by local people
he was loved so much it's unbelievable that it's happened
it really is
he helped everybody in the local community
you know in my opinion it's like i've lost one of my own family

he was a good honest kind gentle local bobby

he was a total gentleman

UNK b c news UNK south london
police say a battle for territory between crack UNK dealers has been behind a series of recent UNK in south london
there have been four drugs related UNK in the area this year
p c UNK murder has again raised the question of whether more police should carry firearms
although UNK road in UNK is not a known UNK of crack dealers police suspect it's the violence associated with this drug in particular which has now claimed two more lives including that of a policeman
the officer leading the murder hunt used to head a special ongoing operation in south london against so called UNK gangs from UNK
over the past three years raids have been carried out as police target crack dealers who've been behind many UNK and violent UNK
there have already been four drug related UNK in south london this year and more than seventy incidents involving firearms
experience in the capital and manchester has shown the level of violence linked to crack make it very different from other drug UNK
what we've had in parts of london are so called UNK wars between crack dealers crack sellers fighting for territory
and we believe that several UNK have been as a result of that sort of tension
the police response to the increasing number of criminals prepared to use guns has been to train firearms specialists and make sure they're available all the time at short notice
in that sense britain already has an armed police force
but drugs related crime is UNK an ever bigger challenge
individual chief constables may in the light of particular circumstances consider that their drugs officers should in fact be armed and that is for the decision for as i say the individual chief officer
so there could be cases where officers on particularly dangerous assignments need to be armed and in which case they will be armed
few would favour police officers being armed as a matter of routine but work at the sharp end is undoubtedly becoming UNK
it reminds us of the deadly risks which our police officers run on our behalf day and night
er and i would want to express my UNK sympathy to police constable UNK family
er i'm sure that er the metropolitan police will be doing everything possible to track down those who are responsible for this evil act and bring them to justice
many police officers will want to remind the home secretary as he UNK his response to the UNK report that they take special risks and deserve special treatment

the chief inspector of prisons judge stephen UNK has published a UNK report into the causes of the riot at UNK prison in lancashire last month
he said the prison was close to UNK and it was widely known that there was a strong risk of violence
it's estimated that the riot at the low security jail caused damage costing twenty million pounds
the UNK lasted eight hours
four hundred prisoners were involved in the worst prison UNK since UNK
fortunately no one was seriously hurt and no UNK escaped but the risk of trouble had been spotted and little done to stop it
that night just seven prison officers were coping with seven hundred and fifty UNK many violent street gang criminals involved with drugs and too dangerous for a low security jail
there'd been incidents of violence between UNK type er UNK between UNK
manchester liverpool don't get on very well and there was a drugs problem a very bad drugs problem er which had been brought in from their normal way of life outside
the UNK accommodation blocks workshops and classrooms
it will cost up to twenty million pounds to repair the destruction
judge UNK went to inspect the jail next day and he said his overwhelming impression was of the UNK of UNK staff in the face of organized criminal activity
in his report judge UNK said the prison had been very close to UNK in the months before the riot
he said his original inspection had found a world of drugs drug dealing and bullying
and he described UNK as no more than an open prison with a fence around it
tonight the prison service UNK to judge UNK report
of his forty seven recommendations for action at UNK thirty five were already being put into effect
no further building will be commissioned without UNK accommodation
so in other words all new accommodation will be of a UNK type
but it's the it's the present estate if you like that will take us time
government figures released today show that like UNK at the time of the riot nearly a third of prisons in england and wales are UNK several housing seventy percent more prisoners than they were designed for
but the prison service sees the underlying problem of drugs in the UNK like UNK as a priority and action has already been initiated

business leaders here have welcomed an unexpected cut in UNK main interest rate
the UNK reduced its discount rate by a half of one percent to five point seven five percent
the move should help stimulate economies on the continent where recession has been UNK the market for british exports
UNK rate is now below britain's and that's adding to pressure for a cut in rates here
the news UNK shared prices to a new record
the UNK has never been an institution to bow to public pressure
it's been slow to cut interest rates believing UNK four percent inflation is too high
but with inflation there on its way down and the economy UNK along the bottom of a recession the UNK council decided it could tolerate another UNK step
the city welcomed the move believing the rate UNK be followed throughout europe particularly on the continent where german decisions still dominate economic policy making
despite pressure from its european partners germany has only reduce its rates very slowly
while britain was in the e r m until september last year our interest rates could never UNK those of germany
but when we left our rates fell and they fell quickly
today's move means though that he german discount rate is below our base rate for the first time in a year
so will britain now follow the germans down
this latest cut does shift the balance of arguments in favour of reducing u k rates but there are other factors that the chancellor will need to take into account
if the recovery is UNK he'll clearly want to be more keen to cut interest rates and also he'll want to take into account the effect of any tax increases he may introduce in his budget
a rate cut would not be an easy decision
the bank of england which has less influence than its german UNK has been reluctant to advise rate cuts over here
the bank is worried about inflation which has been UNK up recently
on the other hand industry wants rates cut
car production and trade figures released today highlight the difficulties that british manufacturers are having in selling their products overseas
lower interest rates would keep the pound down and keep exports competitive
most of the advice kenneth UNK receiving is to cut rates his job now is to decide whether britain's economy is more in danger of boiling over or going off the boil completely

the law lords found that she should have been fully informed by the bank that she was UNK her whole house by UNK a loan to her husband's business not the limited amount she believed at the time

UNK say four thousand specialist teaching jobs could go if the government reduces the grant for teaching english as a foreign language
this is going to be your UNK now what about another UNK
have you got
anne UNK is a section eleven teacher funded by a home office scheme to promote racial equality introduced by section eleven of the local government act
she works alongside the class teacher helping pupils who don't speak english as their first language
almost all the children in this school in UNK east london need help with their english
children here don't lack any sort of ability it's because th they english isn't their first language so they need support in learning english to help them with the everyday UNK of the national curriculum
the government meets three quarters of the costs of section eleven projects but that's being cut to half over the next two years
in UNK that could mean UNK over a quarter of its section eleven teachers
UNK say that'll damage all pupils since without support class teachers won't be able to teach the rest of the class so effectively
the effect on a school would be UNK erm the school has already lost one teacher the s the actual demand is increasing erm if we were to lose yet another teacher then what would we would be denying is education to the children the best possible education
which is what we're trying to provide
today UNK gathered at westminster warning thousands of section eleven jobs are threatened nationally but the home office says painful decisions are necessary in the current public spending round
at a time of UNK racial tension cuts in english language support teaching are particularly sensitive
many ear that when the home office cuts its grant from next april local authorities won't be able to make up the shortfall

UNK commonwealth leaders have been attending the first day of their summit in cyprus and UNK by greek UNK
thousands of women formed a human chain along the route to UNK where the opening ceremony was held to protest against the turkish occupation against the north of the island
the summit will spend the next four days discussing issues ranging from the division of cyprus to the war in bosnia
the greek UNK have UNK the conference agenda
government heads driving to the UNK opening found the fifty mile route lined with women hands linked in protest at the world's and especially britain's failure to reverse the nineteen seventy four invasion which has left thirty seven percent of the island in turkish hands
inside the conference hall delegates were UNK with a highly unusual presentation mixing UNK t v images of hitler and the UNK with UNK to that turkish invasion
some UNK president UNK propaganda coup but other delegation heads were immediately UNK
why can't the same methods that were used by the commonwealth yesterday vis a vis rhodesia vis a vis UNK and vis a vis south africa not be applied in respect of the UNK and UNK situation here
elsewhere with many teachers engaged in the fifty mile protest hundreds of youngsters used their day out to protest at the green line barrier UNK greek and turkish communities
UNK no man's land in a UNK which left three british u n peace keeping soldiers injured before tear gas from the greek police dispersed them
later john major UNK commonwealth heads to drive on world trade talks and UNK a UNK to ease poor countries debts
apartheid arguments over the UNK now seeking a new role spreading democracy but the assembly lacks stars and so far the UNK have stolen the show

john UNK has been given one of the key posts in the new shadow cabinet
he moves from transport to employment UNK jobs with frank UNK
but UNK stays as shadow chief secretary to the treasury despite being voted off the shadow cabinet by her fellow m ps
our political UNK john UNK reports from westminster
for john UNK today not a UNK silence while waiting for the UNK call he was making it clear that he wanted a swap to one of the top economic jobs
and having saved john UNK skin at the labour party conference with his UNK performance in the one member one vote debate mr UNK knew he was in a position to call in his debts
but tonight the new employment spokesman is putting a rather more modest UNK on it
well i didn't demand job nobody demands of john smith
but i wanted to do employment i want to get on with this kind of job it's going to be a major political issue and by god i'm gonna put it right up front
the prediction had been that these elections would result in more women and fewer scots around the shadow cabinet table as a result of the voting system
but with the loss of one woman and the election at last of george UNK the reverse has happened
but john smith has kept faith with some of those who've been most UNK criticized
anne taylor the education spokesman keeps her job and there's a big promotion for clare short who was sacked because of her opposition to the gulf war
while UNK who lost her seat on the shadow cabinet and has been strongly criticized for he commons performances over the past year keeps hers
i know i do have the confidence of the UNK to carry on with this particular job as well as the confidence of the leader and the shadow chancellor
john UNK always made clear that he wanted to make the minimum number of changes to his shadow cabinet and with the exception of john UNK move he's shown his determination to do that by making the minimum number of changes
but some are also saying it's been a missed opportunity to make a more radical shake up to a shadow cabinet where some members performances have been UNK lack UNK

toxic chemicals contained in sheep dip may be banned after complaints from some farmers who say their health has been damaged by the dip
a government advisory committee is meeting to decide whether UNK or o ps as the chemicals are known are safe for continued use
manufacturers of sheep dip say there's no evidence to link the UNK with ill health
UNK sheep in a bath of UNK is an annual UNK for farmers
the work is hot UNK and very messy
but far more UNK is mounting evidence that the chemicals which poison sheep UNK may be poisoning farmers as well
at the weekly UNK farmers come to compare prices but they also compare experiences of sheep UNK
on the way back from moving the sheep i felt as if i'd had a night in the pub started feeling very UNK and oh this is good
anyway i finally got back washed the lorry out and i just couldn't finish washing the wagon out
i started to feel sick was UNK i had very bad diarrhoea and i sort of stayed in bed for like a couple of days very poorly
at twenty nine UNK farmer UNK fears his working life may be over
he was UNK this summer after UNK sheep which had been UNK in o ps
i was laid up for five weeks couldn't do any work whatsoever and just sleep UNK the family be generally UNK tired and UNK
when i took him in he was at such a stage he had to go in a wheelchair
erm he couldn't walk at all
he was i think he'd passed out in the car
the mobile dip UNK worked on now lies abandoned
the man with the power to ban o p UNK is professor james UNK vice principal of glasgow university and chairman of the government's UNK products committee
it's whether they will be withdrawn or not
i obviously i can't UNK a discussion but if we think on the evidence we see in october that er that is the course to take we would do so
but if we do not think that er or we think there are possibly problems in relation to using protective clothing we will also do that
the agriculture minister UNK will make the final decision and it's expected she'll do so within a month
affected farmers will learn then if o ps have been UNK or banned
only then can the battle for compensation begin

scientists in france have found a new way to bring the past back to life
they're using computers and UNK reality technology to interpret historical records
and as our science UNK david UNK reports it means we can now see what cities and building looked like hundreds of years ago
today they're just ruins in a paris UNK it's hard to imagine what these roman baths looked like when they were new
but thanks to UNK reality we can come as close as is possible
using historical records computer scientists have UNK the building fifteen hundred years after it was ruined
inside these roman baths the marriage of archaeology and computer science is complete
british scientists are UNK by this new way of bringing ancient buildings back to life
i can stand in front of the screen i can look at the UNK i can stop them whenever i want to stop them and look at them it gives me ideas about how the buildings might have looked at that time and it gives me a whole range of variations as to as to what can be done in terms of their UNK
UNK ancient buildings involves a lot of UNK work UNK archaeological records into computer code
i b m u k are at the forefront of the new science of UNK archaeology
first you make a fairly detailed ground plan and then you essentially turn that ground plan into a three UNK plan inside the computer
and that's quite a time consuming step
i believe in the case of these baths it took about one man year to do that transformation
but then once the UNK got that you just have to say pretend i'm standing here and the UNK capable of saying this is what you would see
but the most ambitious example of UNK reality is UNK abbey also in france
built in the year nine o nine for six hundred years it was the largest UNK building in the world
torn down during the french revolution little remains
but scientists have UNK it showing what it would have looked like
using almost three thousand hours of work on a major computer the result is a UNK walk through the abbey as it would have appeared in the eleventh century
scientists are excited by this computer approach to archaeology and they've plans to UNK other great buildings of the past bringing them to life once again

how you got started singing
how i got started singing
aye
well me oh how i got started singing it was really just i didn't sing very much really
my dad was a good singer
he wasn't a trained singer or anything it was just happened that he was a good singer
my younger brother he's a good singer as well
but er us
did he sing at home your dad
he just sang round about the house aha
and we just he knew a lot of the he was interested in si singing and he just knew the words and just sang round about the house
mhm
and he just sang too
you know that's how he learnt
so what were his favourite songs
oh dear he was what would you say i don't know he liked the kind of UNK er he was a more a kind of bay he liked a UNK so i really couldn't tell you who was his favourite singer or anything like that just if a song interested him he just
what do you mean by UNK kind of songs
well more the slow er songs not the fast
the love songs and things like that
things like that
mhm
but i never sang anywhere i just sang round the house as well
mhm
and it was really er i think it was really the UNK that i started singing
was it
here oh yes
i never i never went out
were you were you in the drama clubs here when you were younger then as well
i was in the drama club when i was when i stayed at home but we didn't do UNK we did plays one act plays and three act plays we did three act plays
we never did UNK
and er but that's the only time you sang at weddings
so i said come on UNK sing
or my father would sing
so how long did you live in for
we've into the village we lived out in the countryside till i was eight and we come down into the i should say town shouldn't i we come down into the town when i was eight and i was there till i was twenty two and i came up here when i got married
mhm is leslie from this part of the country
les is from oh well he was i think he was three when he came up here
he lived in he was born in castle douglas
mhm
but i think he was three when his father was sh came up here to work
what did his father do when he came here
electrician you know he still worked for the electricity board
did he come with the start of the scheme then really
no well it wasn't the scheme he worked on he would go round and sort your cooker or you know he was that maintenance the maintenance side
er other thing and they lived down there opposite the garage that was the electricity board house then
so would that be about er the late fifties or something you would you came here then yourself
i ca i came here in nineteen sixty one
sixty one
mhm
that's when i got married nineteen sixty one i came up
what did you think of when you came
well it was just a quiet wee village just i had come wasn't much different it was quiet as well
mhm
and er there wasn't there wasn't much difference really
everybody was very friendly it didn't matter whether you were an UNK or not they always spoke
mhm
you got to know people very quick in
that was one thing about the village and your neighbour would where jane is the now i don't think she'll have hardly seen her neighbour in UNK but here they were always you know
you couldn't get away from them
oh they were in or out
so did you do any singing when you came here first
what was the first kind of thing you got involved in
oh the rural choir i forgot about that yes i joined the rural choir and
and er i couldn't sight read or anything like i can't sight read
but i can remember once when i was at the school mrs was our music teacher and we were to go from UNK to far you know UNK to far and they used to s she used to say listen to UNK the only one of you that can go from UNK to far
but er so when we came mrs the sight reading of course i was lost because she used to
is that mrs john
no mrs billy
billy
she used to take the rural choir
how long had it been going then when you came
oh it had been going for quite some time i don't know really when they would start
was it all ladies
mhm yes oh aye all ladies
she was nearly retired billy
she was nearly retiring by the no still the girls go to her at the school so she must have been going for two or three years after we came up here but i would be in the choir just maybe two or three years
and then it
and did it
it fell the choir fell folded up
folded up and she
aye oh
retired
there was nobody else took it on
was there a church choir going at that time then
yes aye there would be just the same ladies that have s been in it for years
but there were men in it for quite a while i was wondering when that kind of UNK out
oh that was UNK out before
that was a good while before
aye before we came up here
i wonder if it mr was it choir or his father or something that had it i can if i can remember somebody saying
so what was going on in the way of UNK and things like that when you came to
when i came up to live here
there was quite a few dances in er do you mean dances in the town hall
ah there would be there well just one or two not every week or anything like that as far as i can remember
just a few over the winter
just aye oh they didn't have them in the in the summer and of course in them days well the bars shut at ten o'clock which meant you know they came into the dance hall just after that where nowadays the bars shut at twelve o'clock and
it's hardly worth having a dance
it's not worth having a dance
but i heard the town hall was having one not the town was it the town hall or community council having one between i think it's the town hall between christmas and new year and really i don't think it's worth their while having them then
do you think that's been a big thing contributing to there being a less dances and things then
do you mean the bars being op oh i think
and clubs
i think so really
do you think it's the main thing
i think that's what's really it's killed them as far
mhm
as the dances are concerned
and another thing is the young ones don't dance
they can
do you mean by young ones my generation
i mean yes well maybe you can but i do but the younger ones are ever er you know younger ones like carl and them they can UNK but they can't UNK or er UNK or
how did you learn to UNK then
just by going to dances just by going to dances we just you just picked it up your partner could do it and you just learnt from there
mhm
that's one thing i've always been a quick UNK which has been quite
mhm
i think jane's got er that as well
she seem to be able to pick thing UNK
does she like dancing
not as fa not the dancing but when she was working in an office you know they just needed to show her something once and she could pick it up
mhm
it was the same in the UNK when UNK has learnt the dancing i could er after she had showed us about twice i could i could have it no bother and the rest of them were still struggling away trying to learn the steps
so it's quite an advantage
so did you go to dances quite a lot before you were married
oh yes in aye
was that the place where everybody went to
to the town hall
young lads and UNK would get together
UNK would yes aye to the dances
and they used to run er buses to different places you know you used to go to different places and
and what kind of band played for the dances when you were in then
bands like what tommy has you know UNK bands
that er they were all more or less that kind of band
so by the time you came here it would mostly just be tommy that was playing
roundabouts er the only one i can remember is tommy round about you know playing er in the hall
and it was just these kind of bands that
mhm
were in those days the UNK bands
so but we fair enjoyed them they think the younger ones don't like them nowadays but
mhm
we enjoyed them
cos i like i like the UNK i like country dancing
did you go to the country dancing club at all
oh yes
went to the country dancing club used to go all over to the country dances
oh
to different places
it was supposed to have been quite good up at
aye it was UNK yes it was still going when i came up here
mhm
aha
was it mrs from took it
and were there men went to the country dancing as well
oh yes oh yes aye
not so many men as went ladies but er
do you think
there was a lot of men
the rise of the country dancing clubs was maybe be to kind of try and compensate in a way for the dances themselves going down ordinary dances folk were wanting to do the scottish dancing and things
it could have been but you found
you found at the country dancing it was different people that was at the country dancing than what than what it was at the more at the ordinary dances
folk that maybe would have been shy to go to a
mhm
a big dance
yes er maybe but
would come to the country dancing
or some of the older folk maybe that
folk i think yes it was more mhm
right
but you get country dancing that's very UNK really
yes
but i oh i used to go to the country dancing
so was there a drama club going in when you came here
no
that would be finished up
that was finished up mhm
what about the one was it still going
when you came here
i don't think so i can't remember eh it going then
because i think it was tommy that said it was really after the one finished and there was nothing else round about that there was a gap of a few years and then you got started again here
yes but er it was actually mike that got it back up here mike and grace john 's first wife that started it up
i can remember leslie coming home i think i must have been expecting UNK at the time that was in that was early on nineteen well that was nineteen sixty three and he was he had heard that had i had been in the UNK drama club and er he said would i be interested in com in coming to the drama in if they started
leslie said he would need a special part for me then
but that it took another oh quite a number of years really to get it started up
they were very good for it's first
oh the first concert oh yes
those kind of people
the f i often find that really the first year it was more fun and er then when they started on the plays and that it got more serious and
a bit more like hard work really
it was really there wasn't so much fun in it was all more serious
and when bobby was there it really was
i remember
oh yes
he and andy together were very good
mhm yes oh they were aha
bobby was really he just kept it going really
sometimes just one person like that or a couple of people
it just needs a character really just to keep it going
and he really was a character
somehow in the drama even though it's so long since he passed away
there's nobody can replace individual people
there no nobody at all
and do you think er the others feel that like you do about doing the plays that it's maybe a bit more of a strain you know the competitions and
i think some of them do yes i know s er some of them have said how much they enjoyed it when it started off first but er but now it's just got that wee bit more serious
we're with the plays with going to the festival of course you can't you must be serious when you're practising for something like that
do you feel like it's almost like doing a different thing that you're not you know when you're actually acting in the play you're more self conscious and you're more conscious of what you're moving and you're speaking and whereas the likes of the UNK you know you just be yourself really with a bit of fun thrown in
yeah yes oh yes aye the plays the plays you've got to think what you're doing UNK if you miss your UNK line you're putting your the person next off as well that it is more er serious and you've got to think more i think
mhm
really
but however
so you just kind of kept on singing after the choir and that finished
aha when the pantomime started up that was just carried on in there
not that i'm a great good or great singer it's just i seem to have a strong voice
unfortunately you can always hear me above everybody else
oh dear
that's you can
but if er if folks spoke about you know they would they would say you were a singer
because you're seen in public and you do sing in public there's a lot of people that sing but as you say it's sometimes just in their own homes or they used to but they would never sing in public they used to sing in the choir
yes sing in public no
i've i wouldn't i don't think i would go out if somebody said would you come and sing er at such and such a thing
i don't think i would go
but in the pantomime well you're singing with everybody else you're not er on your own really
and the UNK a different thing altogether
mhm
and i UNK that i must have words in front of me if i don't have words in front of me even though i know it i still forget it
but er
that's right just nerves
i think it's the UNK that just knocks the words coming out of your head
oh
it's easy to do
aha
oh aye
but er do you quite like singing for folk that know you
do you like singing in the village where everybody knows you or would you in some ways be less nervous do you think if you were singing like even to folk who just don't so well
quite know me so well
do you think that makes any difference
i think it would really in a way and yet the people in know how you sing so the whereas the maybe wouldn't know
mhm
and you would you would be more you'd be more nervous in case they thought well she's terrible isn't she
but it would also be UNK for them you know
oh yes
folk that know you either w might be too critical or they might just switch off because they have heard it before
they have heard it before mhm
but i've never well i've never really
you've never
sang in anything other than the pantomime that
mhm
int he village you know except maybe at the social or something like that said come on up and sing and then i forget my words and that's me
do you like to know where for quite a while in advance what you're going to sing then
i do really
aha i do really
if somebody's would l if somebody wanted me to sing i really would like to know er because
do you not have a wee store of your favourite things then that you
oh i have a wee store yes but you see you don't carry them i don't carry them with me if i carried them with me i could sing i could well that's it
if you did it more often maybe
i feel if yes you would remember them an awful lot easier
aha
but er
what how did how did you collect the songs that you sing then i mean were they just things that
just taking aye just songs that i liked and i just er take them off tapes and records and i just write them down
do you do that all the time
are you always when you're hearing something
mhm
you're listening
mhm
thinking oh i'd like to sing that
and i'd like to aye and i just write it down in a if it's on a tape you can put that pause on and just take line by line you know
mhm
but erm and if you listen to the tape long enough you can i can pick up the tune
mhm
as well and just and have the words
and then as long as the UNK or the UNK know the tune i'm alright
can you take it off the
mhm
music as well though if you had to
if somebody gave you a bit of sheet music
no
no i would have to learn the tune like by listening to the
aha
to the person singing
aha
that's the only way i would learn a tune i couldn't sight read the
mhm
the music off a sheet
right
do you have you ever had a go at the piano or that
no though i would like to have been able to have played i can remember saying to my mother once i would like to have been able to have learnt the piano
and er but of course they couldn't afford to buy me a piano to learn on so
mhm
that was it
any other instruments
mhm
you particularly like
i that i like
or would have to listen to
to listen to listen to mhm
i like the UNK i like to listen to the UNK not the classical stuff i'm sorry to say but i like to listen to the UNK
or er a clarinet i like the sound of
aha
oh i like the sound of a clarinet mhm i think they're lovely
but er the UNK the only one i would of like to have learnt to play
mhm
i often feel sorry that i never was able to play but
oh you still could
plenty of adverts about
yes oh yes aye
practice in the town hall
well we had a piano actually we got it for UNK and UNK she started to learn she went to mr
remember mr that used to live at
she went to him and then he UNK away
and er she just never went anywhere else and gave up
and carol liked to come through and just UNK but she never got lessons or anything so we just sold it
mhm
but as long as the music had UNK ray UNK written on it i could play with one hand but
mhm
other than that i was lost
mhm do you think it's quite good
mhm
that they're getting a lot of music at school these days and
i think it is yes i think it's a great thing really
do you think it's important
yes erm i can't give you a reason why i think it's important though
but i think it is
i think it's a it's the lighter side of the their schooling
they have a serious side but they must have a lighter side as well mustn't they
in the school
but you must really enjoy singing to yourself you must find that something
oh i do
you get out of singing that you don't get anywhere else
UNK no i do enjoy i r i like singing
i like the music
i i'm really interested in music
do you feel as if you're really expressing something
in the music in the song
even if it's just a simple wee song
mhm it is it's lovely
everybody should be able to feel that they can do that you know
aha
aye sure they should
so is there an what kind of things would you like to see in the village and round about int eh way of more music or less music or a different music
would you like more dances
or
myself i'd really enjoy dancing er so does leslie enjoys dancing as well
but er
you would go to more it there were more do you think
well nowadays i don't know whether you should record this or not but nowadays erm they'll not go unless they've been to the bar or something before that well unfortunately UNK not able to drink now he can't after his operation he can't take it just UNK him altogether so he can't go to the bar and all the rest of the company have been to the bar and they're in a different mood than what leslie is so UNK just not go and it just it's kind of cut him off
mhm
there you know
that's a shame
may i have your attention please
the UNK will now start and i don't think i'm out of order at all if i asked all the three ninetieth UNK to give a real round of applause to these beautiful british people have come have come out this after this after th this afternoon
thank you very much
well now i have the principal speaker for the day
this is a gentleman who started out as a co pilot in the five UNK
he stayed the entire time
he ended up the operations officer
he has numerous awards and UNK crosses air UNK et UNK
richard h dick thank you
er ladies and gentlemen and guests i'm er very honoured an to be able to participate in this historic dedication
i want to first of all express our extreme pleasure for having the arrangements that were made by our good english friends especially those associated with the three ninetieth missile well i'm sorry but i'll get that missile UNK out three ninetieth memorial air museum
and i should also mention that this couldn't be possible without the UNK and help of UNK and a UNK thank you UNK
we former three ninetieth er bomb group members er our relatives and guests appreciate the fine treatment we've been offered here in england er we love you all
we're very happy to be here and we're particularly pleased for you people from UNK ipswich and other locations joining us today and i would be UNK in not mentioning the fact that we have representatives here from the existing three ninetieth strategic missile located in UNK
this group is doing a UNK job and we are very proud of them
i could spend a great deal of time UNK the history of the two countries
er we could talk about the customs the english customs that have helped to er guide us as a rather new nation in our growth
i'm gonna leave that to the UNK so i won't bore you on that one
where i could also spend a great deal of time talking about our common UNK our mutual friends and some of the similarity and our aims for world peace and again i'm gonna leave that for the UNK and the politicians
prior to getting around to the job i have to do and that is to honour those men that gave their lives so that we could be free i'd like to just share a few things with you as we return to this wonderful country
as i look around at this beautiful countryside i'm my mind UNK back about forty years
and could i just ask you just now to take a minute and listen UNK
what did you hear
you know it was rather quiet
i can remember and i think the rest of us from the three ninetieth can remember when there were very little time when we had it this quiet
there was always that UNK of aeroplane engines
they were either taking off landing forming in formation going and coming from targets on the continent
and then we can remember when there was so many of the british aircraft going and coming
and some of us i'm sure UNK can remember when we had enemy aircraft overhead
isn't it wonderful to realize that when we hear that noise now it's because people are either flying for pleasure or business purposes
i hope that future generations will never have to suffer the and UNK the noise that we did for the same purpose
i was a rather young man like many of the people in the three ninetieth that grew up rapidly at station one fifty three UNK england
we former three ninetieth bomb group members are very feel very fortunate to have served in this most impressive and best UNK unit in the eighth air force during world war two
and that last er UNK er UNK was authorized by dutch or you can blame him if we aren't the best
during an a very intensive training and organization period in the united states during the first half of nineteen forty three and that does sound a long time ago er we er the three ninetieth bomb group under the able direction of colonel er arrived at UNK right here in july nineteen forty three
we were assigned almost immediately to carry our share on such missions as UNK and then there were those shallow missions to north africa and of russia
the record of the three ninetieth was very impressive
we flew three hundred and one combat missions
from our photos aerial photos and actual er on site information our bombs totalling about nineteen thousand tonnes that's a little small for what you folks are dropping nowadays colonel but and general we have
don't wanna don't wanna down trade you
we understand those bombs did tremendous damage on the targets that we were assigned
but er the group was UNK with three hundred and seventy seven enemy aircraft destroyed fifty seven probably destroyed and seventy seven damaged
this was by no means without losses
a hundred and forty five aircraft missing in action another seventeen lost on the continent and in europe
we will never forget this sacrifice
the group and the men associated with it were honoured with two unit UNK a thousand of individual UNK and many UNK from allied countries
the aircraft we flew the b seventeen flying UNK was the best of its kind in its time
it was the rolls UNK of its time and those of us who flew it knew of its UNK and its capability to do the daylight bombing
the success of the three ninetieth was due to a great team UNK together by superb leadership
the team UNK of listed men officers air ground people all with one aim in mind the success of our nations
despite our successes there were UNK experiences
we lost as i said a hundred and sixty two aircraft fifteen hundred and twenty three men killed or missing in action
many of these were prisoners of war or UNK and er we're very happy to report that these got home after the war and we have many of them here today that were prisoners of war
we do appreciate those of you for that sacrifice
we can think of no more appropriate location for a memorial of this sight than on english soil in a country dedicated with america to the ideals of democracy and the freedom of UNK
this memorial er UNK the close relationship of our two countries in the past present and the future
it is very difficult to find the proper words to acknowledge the hard and dedicated work that went into the restoration of this control tower by the three ninetieth memorial air museum
we the three hundred and ninetieth bomb group members are very proud of this effort
colonel our form commander was not sure he would be here about a month ago and so he sent me a statement that i would like to read
i should mention that he is here with us and i'm sure you'll be hearing from him and his wife dorothy and we're very happy to have you
this is the co UNK statement and i think it is very appropriate
the UNK of our control tower and the field from which we flew so many missions is a beautiful reminder and a lasting memorial to all the men in three ninetieth
it is without doubt the most UNK the most gracious and the most UNK living UNK our english friends could possibly UNK upon us
the time the effort and the loving dedication of those who conceived and carried through this project to completion make us the three ninetieth sincerely grateful and UNK to each and everyone of you our friends
i've had this er UNK and i hope it'll be mounted in the tower so future visitors will be able to see it
it's now time to UNK the memorial plaque which will be located in the control tower
this plaque this memorial plaque is in honour of those men who gave their lives during this memorial UNK period of history
we UNK to them and all people who contributed to the success of this never to be forgotten UNK unit
god bless that their death was not in UNK
please could i ask for a UNK silence and look to the north er we UNK where we will have a dedication fly past by a tens of the eighty first tactical fighter wing
in the name of god the father UNK of all UNK
in the name of jesus christ our lord who died for all men
in the name of the holy spirit who leads all men to faith in the love of god
we UNK this memorial to those of the three hundred and ninetieth UNK group who were stationed here in world war two gave their lives in the fight against UNK
amen
we will now call upon mr UNK president of the three ninetieth UNK group memorial air museum
thank you ve thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
er extend a very UNK welcome to the members of the three ninetieth group
it's been a long time since you left us but you're more than welcome though on your return and don't be so long before you come again
er i'm often asked what it was like to live in those UNK days and as colonel just said well you used to make an awful lot of noise
er but er most early morning and we got a little UNK at the end of the day but we were always welcome when we when we saw the group returning again
we used to wonder as they UNK off how many are missing today
unfortunately that empty but we had a little light entertainment when you first came here er especially the way you UNK your bicycles er we sincerely hoped that you could fly your UNK a little better than that
erm that might interest you to know that during the past ten years i have personally UNK something like a hundred visitors from the states who are with their families er of course er returned here for a look round
erm i'm thinking that some of them are going to forgive me if i say welcome again to you
er now the field itself
you'll see i'm talking to the three nineties er you'll see a bit of a change since you were here before
most of the concrete has gone and er well we tried to tidy the place up a little bit
er that's been a hard old grind though i can tell you
erm if you'd like to look behind the UNK you'll see the sort of thing we're up against
there was there was just UNK acres and acres like that and er but er that's been worthwhile and er so hopefully we'll still improve it
erm now the tower itself
i don't want to say too much about the tower because i'll leave that to two chaps who done most of the work ron and colin
er i think that's wonderful work they've done er they're absolutely dedicated they've so much as spent all their time in the last four years working here
er i just can't believe it now
er well i don't want to make a long speech ladies and gentlemen but when you return to the states i hope you'll take some happy memories with you and remember we have not forgot you especially those chaps who failed to return
thank you
ladies and gentlemen excuse my notes hope to get it over
ladies and gentlemen it is my great privilege on this UNK occasion to welcome you here today
american guests are famous for deep ties and they hope they will consider themselves at home as long as they are in this country
in fact i know that they will be
being themselves so UNK as i have through personal experiences
americans are proud of their way of life as we are of our own although there are differences there are many more similarities
with regards to basic ideas of freedom and justice we are as one
we fought as one nation during the war and of course those UNK here today old enough to remember the period will recall i'm sure the young american g is who were part of our community
since that time there has been an UNK peace in the world the price of which has been constant UNK and in keeping that peace our two countries have continued together as the witness of young american UNK men currently stationed in this country
i am sure that our joint efforts are one of the strongest UNK of peace in the modern world
thank you
of the three ninetieth bomb group museum
ladies and gentlemen erm about three years ago we finally decided to restore this car that you see behind us and although it was er an impossible task at times we carried on regardless and i hope that you'll agree that everything you see today plus the fact that seeing everybody out here i think we you'll agree we made the right decision and er we feel that as long as this car is in this position that UNK erm have any doubts who the three ninetieth group were and er i think er i think we're all proud of this day particularly
thank you
was quoted as saying words to the effect that we don't do much talking until the fighting is done and we hope when we when we are gone we'll be glad we came
well i tell you now
good afternoon and thank you for inviting me
i was erm asked to er speak on behalf of the locals as it were and er so er what can i say but welcome back welcome back to the where there's nearly forty years ago you were and erm we do welcome you back here again today
when you were here before i was only a UNK and er just er old enough to know everything that was going on as you might say but young enough so as i didn't get too involved
and er my memories really go back to er the probably the more pleasant things in the erm mission parties that we were invited to the film shows in the UNK mess er going to a UNK dance erm which was held in the UNK up here erm i don't think we really or i really appreciated them so much at the time as i do now
as i've got older i realize much more how important and significant they were
and of course as children erm er so i think i can speak for the rest of the children around the base the erm cigarettes er not cigarettes beg your pardon
the er sweets and er UNK etcetera that er we received erm i think we in fact er erm yeah well i we obviously appreciate them very much because er they were something that we a lot of and erm i know that er that you must know that when you er were out in ipswich UNK or around about that er you met up a group there was a group of children and i'm sure you heard the er familiar up UNK
but erm what i did mean to bring in was th was the that our parents and er our er older erm UNK who appreciated the cigarettes and them sort of things
course there was also the UNK times
er we didn't always know what was going on but erm we did catch the planes when they took off in the morning and we watched them come home in the afternoons and we got some ideas sometimes when things hadn't gone quite right and i'm sure we did share with you in your grief
particularly also of course the planes that erm UNK erm the one in particular that UNK in our village on the erm twenty seventh of december i think it was nineteen forty four
erm UNK nobody in the village was hardly UNK but as unfortunately your whole crew UNK
but erm we such as myself and the UNK and the older ones have a lot to remember from those years ago
but i've been surprised over the last erm few years of all these young men erm who have restored this museum who although were not even born in those years have taken a tremendous interest in what went on and erm well their results some of their results you can see here today
speaking of young men erm i have a letter here from mr john who is our local m p who is not able to be with us today but erm he in fact would not of i think been born at that stage but erm he did write to me a little letter i've got this morning from the house of commons in london and he asked me to read it out
it is to our american friends i am so pleased to hear that you are coming to UNK to celebrate your anniversary
we in britain owe so much to our american allies not only for their support during the last war but also today
in this area we have your UNK at of UNK as they continue an honourable tradition
may i send you my very best wishes for a most successful UNK
signed john
well i've spoken about how we remember you but i know you have far more memories of being here those years ago and i know you're really UNK to get up off your seats and go and have a good look round to see where you were stationed and if it's at all possible to see the UNK the UNK or anything where you were
so i won't really delay you any more
i would like to say that we the locals will be very pleased to show you round
the if any of the ladies would like to go down to the village or anybody the church is open and i think there's somebody there who would welcome you to show you round the church down in the village which i know during the war years at different times quite a lot of you chaps did attend and er so we do hope you will see and of course later on i hope you'll be coming down to mine for a cup of tea
so all i can really say is i do hope you enjoy your visit here to england and that when you do go back to the states you will feel that it's really been well worthwhile
thank you
played rather a dirty trick on me because he didn't tell me that i was expected to make a speech
erm i find this afternoon brings back lots of memories i'm sure it does to you
i came to UNK just as you were going
i came as a UNK and i'm told that suffolk people were stand UNK difficult to get to know and you'd be a UNK for years
i think you know and i know that this is just not true
they are extremely loyal friends and
i count it a double honour to represent UNK this afternoon and to offer you a welcome back a welcome into our homes which we look forward to seeing you on saturday and we are so UNK to think that so many of you have made the journey back to visit us and i echo the UNK of another speaker don't let it be so long before you come again
do enjoy your stay and as john says please ask us we're here to help we're here to show you round
welcome and thank you for inviting me to your ceremony
thank you martin ladies and gentlemen
it's certainly a day of reflection an and great appreciation on a part of all of us the reason we're here er for me personally i need to back up for a moment perhaps
i don't think we americans are particularly known for our sense of UNK
er certainly pilots of any measure are seldom known for their sense of UNK
commanding UNK rarely are known for their sense UNK
you need to understand that i have as we watch the raf a beautiful aeroplane er colonel and i just exchanged a thought on it
it reminds us in lines and capability er not unlike the er UNK of the UNK of er and times of world war two a very clean a very highly effective aeroplane
but this er american pilot commanding general stands before this group with a great sense of UNK and a sense of great honour recognizing the only reason i'm here is because i have to be the commanding general
a day of reflection and appreciation certainly to the living and the dead members of the famous three ninetieth group and most certainly to our very close and dear friends the british people have shown this sort of involvement and appreciation in memory of those times and UNK
we've heard a little bit of about the three ninetieth group and we could go on and on because it certainly is indeed er historic organization
but i'm told on this day may thirteenth thirty seven years ago and that should bring back a lot of memories for many of you the three ninetieth flew its hundred and fifth combat mission from this station and many of you remember that day
it was to in germany
this time you hit UNK er UNK
you led the thirteenth combat wing with your twenty seven aircraft and suffered er no losses
that was a fortunate day for you
you know all too well that other days had their heavy toll indeed
this plaque and this tower and museum we have dedicated it as a memorial to those days when you suffered severely yet still struck your targets
the three ninetieth had a reputation on the record that enemy fighters never forced you to turn back and that's some special form of courage
i think i'd like to make two quick points relating to the three ninetieth UNK group
regarding your UNK you were born in battle on august ni eighth nineteen forty three
no occupied france but a target into germany
a week and a half later you struck UNK and UNK to africa
on the this your third mission you won a distinguished unit UNK which has been pointed out
that day was the one year anniversary of eighth air force operations in england
from the humble UNK of the previous year you flew the first great test of concept of long range strategic UNK
it was a test that the three ninetieth passed with flying colours destroying thirteen enemy aircraft and achieving excellent bombing results
three hundred and one missions
nine thousand three hundred and thirty one UNK and a year and a half later you flew your last mission on the twentieth of april nineteen forty five from this field
everyone of who was alive during that day still remembers it vividly the day of the last mission
i am sure of many of you ground and air crew members of the three ninetieth as well as the local UNK remember what was happening on this very spot
in celebration i'm told you shot off every UNK you could get your hands on
er probably the u s government's still paying for all those UNK
i am told the sky was brilliant and alive with red and green and white UNK
to the citizens of england and the rest of the free world the sky will remain bright indeed for what you men have done and your fellows had done
the UNK you fired thirty six years ago are still burning UNK today for in that time we have not had a world war
that is probably the greatest UNK to you and your comrades
those UNK you fired for the war you ended are still burning for the peace that you won
with your mission you pr proved that air power can strike any target on the UNK
that cap capability has been carried on by our own UNK and indeed the royal UNK and our fellow partners in nato
and it has UNK any potential UNK for the last three decades
you not only the won the peace for your generation but for your sons and your daughters and your UNK and UNK
your efforts have to be one of the most remarkable achievements of UNK
in the american UNK near cambridge england there is an UNK over the great wall which lists the men missing in action
a portion of that UNK serves us well today and it reads and i quote all who shall UNK live in freedom will be here reminded that to these men and their comrades we owe a debt to be paid with grateful UNK of their sacrifice and with a high resolve that the cause for which they died will live UNK
we do owe a debt to be paid with grateful UNK of the UNK you and your comrades made
we owe another debt to the local english citizens who have restored and UNK this building as a UNK memorial to those men
to the UNK who have used their time and UNK to restore this control tower we are most grateful
because of you the cause for which the men of the eighth air force paid the UNK price shall live UNK and may we all pray that may our UNK ever be preserved between these two great nations
thank you
for a very gentleman
this gentleman has the silver four distinguished flying crosses the bronze star eight air UNK the french and the polish cross of the
UNK army our own fighting colonel joseph
i have a one UNK i would like to try
at this sort of a UNK one looks to another and says i don't look sixty do i
and the other says no but you did when you were
you know the tower the tower was the focal point
it was almost easier to fly a mission than it was to come out here and sweat the boys back in
and this is the sweat box for every commanding officer every UNK commander operations officer and even a group commander
pounds gallons tons of sweat are in that building and on the roof
everything that's been said about it i would like to simply say we owe a great debt of UNK to our english friends for preserving our heritage of the past
we who flew in the past here sincerely thank you
i'd like to pause just a moment and talk about the future
you see these young men here
those of us who have fought those of us who have fought still have one job we can do and that is to see that the military capability of the united states is such that no potential UNK will ever dare attack us
we must build UNK military strength and that is the way to peace
i leave you with that thought because i think that's the job for all of us old pilots
lastly i would simply say that for weeks before the war was over general whom i would like to call your attention to was an operations officer and during the night when we were laying on missions we'd say to each other when this thing's over we're gonna get UNK drunk
and the night that it was over we met in our quarters we poured a drink and we stood there and looked at each other and he said well we made it
we UNK the drink and both of us went to bed and sleep
i have a UNK i would like to read from colonel george which we have received
george unfortunately had a heart attack a few weeks ago
please convey my best wishes to all members and guests of the three ninetieth bomb group on the occasion of this the thought comes i'd rather be up there than down here wouldn't you
i'll start again so you'll get his thought
please convey my best wishes to all members and guests of the three UNK ninetieth bomb group on the occasion of the anniversary of the dedication of the flight tower
i still feel a sense of pride at having been a member of the three ninetieth
i deeply regret my being unable to be with you and to join the memorial service and the dedication together with the related activities
signed george
we have a few UNK i am sure you will agree are UNK deserved
i would like to first call in UNK order robert
erm colonel has supported very actively the current three ninetieth missile wing like he supported us and he is UNK known to them as uncle joe
er he actively supports them he UNK er UNK a lot of their missile competitions out at air force base
er he gives them a lot of moral support and in their blast off parties when they're ready to go out and conduct the missile competition er he really UNK the pot and gets the guys moving
er in addition if you were to walk into the headquarters there today in their UNK case the largest and most prestigious UNK is the UNK
not too long ago colonel and a new present commander of the three ninetieth strategic missile wing agreed to establish a memorial a heritage programme between the bomb group UNK and the strategic missile wing people erm hopefully for a long time to come
such a programme is under way and consists basically of the establishment of a memorial air museum at air force er a UNK of a b seventeen g which has already been done a UNK b seventeen g and the establishment of a foundation
er all this takes a lot of effort on a lot of people's parts and we're very fortunate today to have three of the professional men who are doing the bulk of the work present with us and their wives
er i would like them to come up gentlemen
captain geoff is the overall co UNK er not only for the UNK er missile UNK of the b seventeen but he's put the foundation together and he's going to be a UNK of the museum
and if you recall when my colonel read john plaque it UNK to him er the aid in UNK us at in the establishment of that memorial museum john gave us a er and sort of took that apart and UNK it over to and it was flown back to the states and that's going to be a briefing operations room for the museum itself
er so geoff has really put all that together fr er and UNK captain UNK is the UNK one project officer for the memorial and would you believe it or not he's already ha secured a UNK missile and two rocket engines for it
and er lieutenant les is doing all the work on the b seventeen the restoration of it and we're going to have a UNK
our next UNK is march eleventh through the fourteenth in UNK and not only will we UNK the museum at that time but er les UNK me he's gonna have the UNK ready done be er flown again with a
er these gentlemen have a presentation to make and i wonder if ron would come up here for a moment please
geoff
strategic missile wing one of UNK we feel
i'd like to present on behalf of colonel centre a plaque from all of us at the three ninetieth at d m museum
i'd like to read its UNK
we pray that by the efforts of our armed forces and our UNK there may be peace
but we remember that peace can only be maintained while we have our UNK and perhaps even more important our armed forces
in the name of god almighty father son and holy spirit we UNK this museum to the memory of all those of the eighth army air force who served in the second war and in our dedication we pray to almighty god that there may be no third
amen
i will now ask the UNK of UNK for the closing prayer
in the order of events this afternoon you see part of UNK one hundred and three printed there which is part of the UNK at the occasion of the funerals of the UNK
and so in memory of all those men who did not return to this base we UNK them to the keeping of almighty god we read these verses together
like as a father UNK his own children even so is the lord UNK unto them that fear him for he knows UNK we are made
he UNK that we are but dust the days of man are but grass for he UNK as a flower of the field for as soon as the wind goes over it is gone and the UNK shall know it no more
but the UNK goodness of the lord UNK for ever and ever upon men that and his righteousness joy be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost
as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end
amen
finally as a prayer which men and women of every faith can say the lord's prayer
our father who art in heaven UNK be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our UNK as we forgive those who UNK against us
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for UNK is the kingdom the power and the glory for ever and ever amen
the grace of our lord jesus christ and the love of god and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with you all
amen
that last prayer concluded the dedication of the three ninetieth bomb group memorial air museum at UNK airfield
at er approaching the er six o'clock er that same evening er b seventeen flying UNK performed er a very impressive UNK er and the cameras of anglia television the er local television company in the east UNK region were there to cover the ceremony and also the UNK
er on the following day the er programme UNK the memorial er dedication and er UNK were shown on anglia television
here is that coverage by that company
many UNK of the men who flew to the airfield all over east anglia but yesterday saw the biggest ever get together of combat UNK in britain
it took place at the former american base at UNK in suffolk
UNK had gathered to celebrate the UNK of the base control tower which had stood derelict for over thirty years
was there
they came from all over america the men of the three hundred and ninetieth UNK group one of the most UNK and UNK sections of UNK wartime military machines
for many this was the first time they'd been back to UNK in thirty six years
it was a UNK occasion made even more emotional by the memory of the fifteen hundred men who flew from here never to return
now the control tower of this famous wartime airfield has been restored by local UNK who form the three hundred and ninetieth memorial air museum
a visit reminds you of UNK past when even UNK used to play here
i would say that my most vivid memory would be the erm thought that we were erm came here as just young flying boys
i was a flying boy came in here and all of a sudden was involved in an operation that was er quite intense erm the noise of the aircraft erm the erm UNK and UNK that we went through the UNK and the er experience of erm having a meal that could've been your last meal
what was life like here back in forty three forty four was it a depressing place to be
a twenty two year old young fellow with a
this is lieutenant colonel dick speaking
the last voice you heard was andy
i think i previously i think it was just a i needed UNK
i got my wings and i'm gonna do my share but as i got almost two years here i found myself worrying about some poor UNK that wasn't feeling well as he went on the UNK
the UNK went down
you flew a total of forty three missions it says here
correct forty three missions
i flew two tours
two first one and then one other
so you're lucky to be here
so they say
after a UNK of more modern military life it was down to the business of UNK the plaque which UNK the role of the three hundred and ninetieth
for some the occasion was a moving reminder of fallen friends of UNK that often ended in tragedy
the missing man formation demonstrated here by the a ten based at nearby UNK was often a daily sight when UNK was fully operational from nineteen forty three to forty five
coming in from the south we now have a welcome from the raf
and if recent reports are anything to go by it wasn't only aircraft which were paying their respects to UNK yesterday
i personally came one morning and erm the building up
this is ron the museum organizer
i UNK fresh UNK smoke and i called out like you normally would to anybody there and no er reply so i UNK all round the building not a soul in sight but there was this distinct smell of UNK smoke and my colleague er mr martin he had an experience er a year or two after he joined us
one morning he also opened up the building went upstairs and came down and there was these fresh UNK on a part of the building which he hadn't been at that time and he like myself looked all over the building and not a soul in sight
and on a er visit to a museum a few weeks later he also discovered flying boots of exact prints he'd seen on the wet floor
but the most UNK sight at UNK yesterday was the return of the b seventeen flying UNK which was based there during the war
it had been specially flown in from UNK air museum in UNK and for the UNK and locals of UNK it was a picture they'll never forget
on the twenty fifth of may nineteen eighty one the hundredth bomb group memorial air museum located in the former control tower which is er now completely UNK was dedicated by major UNK united states air force retired
er he er was the former ground executive officer on the base from june nineteen forty three when the hundredth bomb group started daylight operations against UNK germany until erm august nineteen forty five
let us pray for all who ha who served on this airfield during the second world war and the relatives of those who died
oh lord who to see that all the world we thank thee for those who fought and those who laid down their lives in the cause of righteousness and freedom
especially we remember those who served on this airfield and we pray that the peace they fought to obtain may not be lost to us but as we may live and work to bring it to thy world that christ the prince of peace may UNK in the affairs of men
we ask this in the name of him who lived and died for us even jesus christ our lord
amen
our father our father which art in heaven UNK to be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread and forgive us UNK as we forgive those who UNK against us
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for UNK is the kingdom the power and the glory for ever and ever amen
our reading is from john chapter fifteen
jesus said i love you just as the father loves me remain in my love
if you obey my command you will o remain in my love in the same way that i have UNK my father's commands and remain in his love
i have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete
this is my command love one another just as i love you
the greatest love a man can have for his friends is to give his life for them and you are my friends if you do what i command
i do not call you servants any longer because a servant does not know what his master is doing
instead i call you friends because i have told you everything i heard from my father
you did not choose me i chose you and appointed you to go and bear much fruit the kind of fruit that UNK and the father will give you whatever you ask of him in my name
this then is what i command you love one another
i'm UNK and i bring you UNK today from the hundredth bomb group association in the united states and particularly to the hundredth bomb group association in the united kingdom with which many of you are associated
the two hour speech that i was going to make i cut down because of the weather so i think even though the sun is out i'll continue with the UNK version of it
er i do bring you UNK not only from the association but from the many of us who served here during world war two
er i myself and many others were here for two and a half years and i submit to you that this is a considerable portion of one's adult lifetime and consequently the experiences of the last three days have been very meaningful and very moving to those of us who did spend such a portion of our lives here in this place
er as i think about all of us today it seems to me that the that which UNK is human relationships
the instruments of war the machinery that was necessary to UNK what i think was if any war could be just a truly just war these UNK and machines are tremendously important but they are passing they are UNK
the things that UNK and that matter i am convinced are the human relationships and i think as i represent the group here today i am joined by six other people with associations with the group
bob and florence and er john and rose and stan and UNK and the three of them and i are just very happy to be here and together to represent the hundredth group and what remains of it in the united states
so i think today as we UNK this UNK restored control tower and UNK to the hundredth group that we think about three groups of people
those who served here and went back to continue to live and serve at home which we represent
er those known to so many of us who gave their lives here from this base and finally er in honour of those who have done such a tremendous and magnificent job in the restoration of this nerve centre of the hundredth group and as we UNK this plaque and this building today we remember before god and before one another all of these people who have had a part in what we do here today
as i UNK this plaque to the glory of god and in memory of all those who served in the hundredth bomb group in the cause of freedom from this airfield
in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit we UNK this memorial plaque to the glory of god and to the memory of the men of the hundredth bomb group who served in the cause of freedom and through from this airfield may we pray
now lord we ask that the peace that you promise that passes our understanding will keep our hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of god and in its son your son our saviour jesus christ and we ask for the blessing of you of the father upon us as we continue to serve in your name
amen
i would just like to say a few a few things to er especially to UNK and mr david er without their help and cooperation we would never have had such er UNK would never have started this project erm we thank you very much
i'd also like to thank colonel for coming today from er UNK in UNK and also thanks to the reverend for being here as well
thank you very much
i'm personally delighted to be here er it's almost er like er page out of the first chapter of er i think the should be expressed to those of you here and any who are missing er for undertaking this magnificent project
there's nothing that we can say or do here to add the distinction to add distinction er to what was done here forty years ago
er certainly the people who worked and flew from this field er gather distinction honour and glory unto themselves for their er
but what you're doing here i think it is er an example of the partnership a partnership that goes back for many years certainly during world war two and i think er it is still strong and er holds firm today the partnership between the united states and great britain
once again thank you for being invited and thank the people who have the UNK and er tremendous energy to undertake this project
thank you
i hope all of you know or have met this good friend of the hundred i'm sure that most of you have and he has with him today a guest from germany UNK and his UNK daughter er and mr was a member of the and has provided invaluable information here who as you know is doing a comprehensive book on the monster mission and in UNK of what we have done today we have a letter addressed to er the hundredth bomb group memorial association u k from the most reverend doctor the bishop of UNK which i would like to read to you
dear ladies and gentlemen on the occasion of the dedication of the museum and memorial to the fallen service men of the second world war both the german and the allied forces here at the former control tower of the UNK in england i send you my UNK and UNK
all nations are UNK from the terrible UNK of the second world war
we cannot overcome the past by forgetting the UNK and sorrow which war has brought but by willingness to UNK we can ensure peace for the present
so it UNK me on this day of the dedication to represent the bond of friendship between our peoples
may the UNK god hold his hand over us so that we are guided in his way and seek for peace which he has prepared for us
with my UNK blessings yours doctor the bishop of UNK
and a copy of this in the german language will be in the er museum
thank you very much
this is a continuation of the er story by er while we were at UNK as usual a lot of UNK things happened
i remember the time i came out of the engineering UNK and walked over to the gas tank er trucks and which was on used by UNK number two
UNK number two was so little that we couldn't get an UNK on there so we parked the gas trucks there
there was a small young man there and he was really smiling and real happy
he wanted to show me his new washing machine
he'd acquired a UNK engine from somewhere with an UNK that run and he had made during picked up from UNK and stuff and made it so where he had a tub right on top of this UNK engine
and he come up and he had some dirty UNK in there and he was washing them
this was fine
the only thing wrong was he was washing them with a hundred UNK he had a UNK engine firing UNK underneath it and he was parked among all our gas trucks
needless to say i got a little excited and told him to quietly shut the engine down and if he wanted to wash the UNK tonight in UNK to go about a hundred and fifty yards over there
but i never wanted to see that UNK engine UNK on this UNK again with the gas trucks parked around it
another incident happened up on UNK number thirteen
this was sergeant
usually it was cold working on the aeroplane and in so each tank had a little stove in it
there was no coke so we got these old two piece army stones army UNK and by putting a brick or two inside it we had a five UNK of mixture of engine oil and hundred UNK
sometimes it was pure hundred UNK with a gas line coming into the tent with a little valve on it
we don't we turned the valve off we take a bunch of newspapers and put it on top of the bricks then we light the newspaper then we go back and turn the valve on and let this hundred UNK mixture of oil drip on the bricks and it would burn
well after a while the bricks got hot enough that you could just adjust the valve to where the stove would get almost cherry red and it was a very nice fire
it was a good supply of used engine oil and hundred UNK available so we did it
well it seemed like the morning of everybody was using it they use them to cook
i know i that and i never said anything about it but there was many a UNK which got too close to a tent wound up in the pot and was cooked by these fellas on these UNK
the same with the potatoes
some of the local fellas would trade cigarettes to the local farmers for eggs to UNK and a lot of other stuff
well anyway getting back to on UNK number thirteen it seemed as if he was filling his it ran out of supplies so he was filling his supply tank and one of the flight crew of the UNK into him so he UNK this mixture of UNK and oil over the stove and naturally the tent caught on fire
well it so happened that two of the UNK were burnt enough not real serious but burned enough that they had to use the ground spare from another UNK they couldn't go on the mission
well within two hours after the mission took off there was an UNK come down from group no more UNK in the UNK
period
no UNK or UNK
needless to say sergeant was not in very good held in any esteem at all by the remainder of the crew UNK
in fact he was subject to a lot of dirty UNK and anything else they could get away with
er like i said about the i named all the crew UNK that were master sergeant at from UNK one to thirteen
we had at least seven other UNK sergeants and maybe a staff sergeant UNK which had been returned to us two or three month after the deal and at times we had as high as twenty aircraft in the UNK that according to the er UNK that you were only supposed to have twelve but er nobody seemed to say anything about it and we didn't get any extra men but there was at least six or seven men doing the work of master sergeants getting paid for getting UNK sergeant and staff sergeant pay for which i'm very grateful
they did a they did as good a job as the crew UNK
in our UNK was a man i call an elderly because at the time he was about forty to forty five years old and we were all a bunch of kids
his name was
he was a real sharp well built man but he was a good UNK
he was responsible for all the painting that was done on our aircraft and er he did a real good job on it
somewhere they've got a there's a picture of him and i've named him out of one of the photos i brought over
there was another man by the name of
he was a UNK that used to help us make up er special tools and things to break down tyres with and the little four UNK trailer with it b seventeen wheels on it that billy has in was made by him
when we came overseas that metal trailer that we had heavy wheels on it
as soon as you got that thing off of the runway or a hard surface it sunk without any kind of a in the english mud
excuse the UNK but that's what it was
it would sink and we'd have a hell of a time getting out
so i would i and a couple of the fellas went to pull them to the aeroplane UNK
we brought back four tail wheel UNK complete with the tyres and UNK and everything else on them and i got to UNK this high strength steel onto that carbon steel that was on the wheel and we wound up with a nice trailer with four b seventeen tail wheels on it
this could go across the mud and it easily
the main job of this trailer was to haul parts back and forth
on days when wing inspection would come around and check our tech supplier for spare parts we would load this trailer with all the illegal spare parts we weren't supposed to have cos they like the couple of it might call it for three starters and we had six seven or eight
they called for so many generator we had double of them
we'd leave just what the couple had called for
the excess starters generators regulators and anything else that we weren't supposed to have was put on this trailer was tied neatly to the UNK we put a man on the tractor and all day long he drove around the UNK strip with it
when the inspectors left we'd call him in and we'd put the stuff back in the shelf
we also stored a lot of stuff in billy 's barn
that was too big to put on the on er the thing
tech sergeant was a supply sergeant and he was responsible for getting us UNK plugs and other spare parts
well he was as good as they come as far as i was concerned because if it could be had UNK stolen midnight UNK or just purely ordered from some place when we needed it we got it
he was he was really good about that
we lost one man from the ground crew during the whole time we were overseas
the UNK name was a UNK and he was killed in a train UNK at ipswich while he was going on leave going to london
but that was the only man from our ground crew that we lost
for a short time he was buried at cambridge at the military UNK but since then i've checked and he has been sent his body sent back home
and that's about
management meeting in the chair is superintendent UNK
the date is the first of february nineteen ninety four and it's the crack of dawn
good morning everybody thank you all for coming so early
for the purposes of the tape i think er we ought to explain that our management meetings are always run on very serious lines with no jokes allowed er first of all i think we should just place on the record that this meeting is being taped everybody UNK that and the purposes are for to analyse everybody's UNK ability and later on UNK going to UNK her piece her presentation for the purpose of the tape
an and i i'll keep me mouth shut
that would make a change
sec secondly we must welcome paul to the meeting as you know he joined us at the beginning of january to run the neighbourhood watch schemes and as office manager i thought it appropriate he attend the management meetings
er any apologies dave of course who's looking after UNK mi UNK all day
i like saying that UNK i've been practising
i'd like apologise for the room it's er too cold really
i booked the conference not UNK it was gonna be the control room by this time and then this morning i turned up to find out we can't put the lights on without getting behind the bar and we can't get behind the bar so that's why this er
uh can i say ten for er effort
for fixing that light
i think it's excellent
oh good heavens
dear me pass me the UNK
right er minutes of the last meeting has anybody brought them with them
on account of the fact that somebody's mis filed my folder
there we are
we've got some
er i i'll skip through it UNK most people haven't got the copies with them er we looked you'll remember that the a c UNK meeting UNK us for providing beeston with a u v lamp for m o t examination
it was a success in so much one did out of fifth m o UNK that prove to be UNK and was identified very quickly
somewhat UNK that committee came back to us and asked us very nicely would we provide about twenty five for the force which we thought was a cheek but having said that we've actually looked at it and there may well be a way that we could afford it
w we've i've already ordered 'em there's forty four wanted actually
forty four how much is it gonna cost us
about erm you get four for hundred pound so we're talking
four for a hundred pounds so
seven hundred quid then
seven hundred quid that's why paul's been invited to this meeting
yes he's right
er work placements yes susan ann and john have started
are there any major problems with susan and john at all tracey
no
could you just er speak a bit louder
no
right
none at all
am i right in saying that UNK with us for a full year every wednesday and john is supposed to be with us for a term but it's been extended hasn't it
yeah but if we can get him onto the computer system he'll do two days a week if he can do it
right okay just as a reminder to everybody if they have admin jobs that are pretty basic if we can save them til a wednesday or a thursday like photocopying and things like that then they will invariably be able to do those for you
i mean david it will certainly save er ann standing at the UNK
can i put in a bid i'm working with er dave williams on the launch of this drugs UNK and there's a need to do quite a large UNK of the posters in the
right
in the next couple of weeks so if we can use them
right
to help ann
can you liaise li liaise with tracey then
right okay
cos tracey plans their day
yeah
erm
this is a very difficult form to fill in relation to who's attending the meeting
which room actually
right er we mentioned at the last meeting that richard was on our side in our attempts to bring back the schools liaison officers into the fold
the er his report has gone to the policy group it's been UNK discussed by them and it now goes to the policy advisory group
we're quite fortunate because there will be four chief UNK at that meeting to discuss whether or not the s l o's should come back to the centre
david doesn't want them in the first place and he won't argue i've discussed it with robin he won't argue erm richard who's the only one that could really be regarded as a UNK daren't argue 'cos it's his report that recommends we they come back to us and john won't understand the item so i think we're alright there
i think we're almost certainly guaranteed to get the s l o's back into the fold although bearing in mind the recent developments with the c p o's it's unlikely that they will be coming back to the fold
can i chip in there
we've had a meeting paul keith and myself looking at er planning for the future of management supervision of the s l o's and got a plan together which will regular meetings
i'll put it under a o b cos
can i mention er that i'm very disappointed that c p o's aren't coming back under the fold i understand the arguments for and against but when you look at erm the knowledge that two of our new recruits have got in relation one in relation to fraud and one in relation to UNK it seems UNK that they're divisional staff and can't go round the force giving their expertise force wide rather than just on er a basic divisional
yeah er well put it under any other business erm nothing more about that one other to say that we seem to be on course for finishing er about the zero mark which is what we're UNK
er UNK is keeping records of private security companies that's unchanged just as a reminder that everybody should keep in touch with him please
p c UNK actually has moved to force headquarters as you're all aware
is that six months
just for everybody's benefit it is his plan to retire in july although we have had dates before that have run er over with p c UNK erm
i thought he retired in september
well it's he's now he's now got marriage plans
oh right
which er change everything
this tapes gonna be worth a lot of money isn't it
thank you paul
just thought i'd better remind people
yes that's an agenda item now
regular c p o's meetings have we got one fixed
yes UNK february
right erm new areas of responsibility sergeant UNK nothing more on that one
very keith was
i don't think there's any more items on there that er need updating
anything on social security at all
that's on the agenda
displays use of the UNK at gala day spending money er that's coming up later on
yes please
long term sick i think we all know now that er pat is going to be retiring on a pension in er beginning of may is it
three months from last week
and dave is now cast with the problem of replacing pat
er i think that's the end
will it be me and dave that are doing the interviews then cos he'll be doing the what is it the race relations side and no doubt i'll be doing the
if you want to do it with david then that's fine by me i UNK leave it to you to discuss with him
right
but you need to speak with UNK well it's an internal vacancy isn't it yes and you speak with personnel and they'll rubber stamp the post or position rather age
don't any of the existing sergeants want to take it before it gets advertised UNK i mean i don't but
david i don't suppose you want to be doing that for
i think that's it er three sergeants spoken for
any other sergeants i've forgotten
yeah
you're sitting right across from one but never mind
he always thinks of you as an inspector
any more points on la last year's agenda that need to be discussed
thank you very much
right item four crime prevention a l o work what is the way forward or backward as the case may be sergeant
what does a l o stand for
david you allowed to hit him now he's only been one for UNK eight years
i've never seen the UNK before you see
it stands for UNK
i put this on the agenda erm the phrase at the moment seems to be UNK things up and my concern is opposite dave is the but as everybody i'm sure is aware we've got erm divisional a l o's based within as crime prevention officers the main concern for my particular area is bill although based at has actually for the last three years built up a good working relationship and UNK staff from and
erm two things now have UNK up number one of course is that there's a fair chance within the next year we're gonna lose bill anyway through UNK and secondly er the fact that er his boss er UNK has said to him look i don't want you going up a division any more to do erm a l o work quite reasonably he's not being funny about it it's quite reasonable cos its mileage
so what i'm saying is erm i happen to think that the a l o stuff is some of the most valuable stuff that we do it's really one of the main ways forward and if we just sit back and do nothing about it it's gonna just be wiped out at a UNK
i don't think we're gonna solve it today but what i'm saying is did we ought to look at some sort of action plan UNK call it what you will for the very near future to look at how we're gonna tackle this problem
if we are gonna tackle it
this is one of the major problems of the UNK program
er as we know round about july august time the remaining nine p c's will be er turned into civilians wave of a magic UNK the biggest problem there is the total loss of our skills base overnight effectively the second thing is it'll take a long time to get them trained particularly in relation to a l o work
add to that the new guidelines that suggest that all er plans for major developments must go through the hands of an a l o and really we don't have an answer for it and if we are going to be getting 9 new civilian c p o's they're gonna have their work cut out learning their basic craft before they even develop their a l o skills
it could take a number of years before we get them all on a l o courses and in fact there's no way w i assume there's no way we can put them on a l o courses til they've done a crime prevention course at is that right david
er yeah
so we will not have the capacity to deal with a l o work to the extent that we would like there's no doubt that poor david over there is gonna get a lot more work on his desk as a result of that and it's just something we're gonna have to live with in the short term
we've UNK up those problems to command and i'm seeing mr on UNK tuesday afternoon i think it is and UNK put a report into command and i'll put on it as well and we're saying to them what is the answer
em
there are a number of problems of course highlighted by UNK there will be nobody qualified to do firearms dealers er inspections and inspections of firearms ranges and so we've put a report in saying would you please tell us who's gonna do it which department will take on responsibility for it
and i think the way forward is perhaps to have a meeting with r and d and for them to come to us and discuss with us the aspects of work that we will not be in a position to do come the revolution
in fact i've put it in that report haven't i
wouldn't it have been better if they'd done it before
yes right i agree entirely and one of the points we're making to mr is that we were never consulted we were merely told this is happening now we're trying to put the report in a positive way
we're not saying you can't do it because we're trying to say you need to be aware of these problems because we need to find solutions to some of them erm and a l o work is definitely one of them that report from the home office and the d v suggests quite UNK that er that there should be a crime prevention input into all planning applications
now whether it means that in the short term they all land on your desk and you give them just a UNK examination i don't know
it's not the way we would like to do it but
it will only happen if you do because the credibility
that's right
will go straight out the window and they won't bother with us a very short time it's taken five i mean six years to build up the credibility
yep
for them to start consulting us now we've done it
yeah
we're
yep
it's just
that happened that happens with all staff changes where you need a degree of skill its UNK by the fact that all nine will be changed at the same time and as i said before is a total loss of the skills base
and what the force will say to us is that the force has overall priorities and they take precedent and that is to get sixty four p cs back on the street and our problems they will be looking to us for UNK solutions
but i don't think the force recognise just what this department does up front in that way
er yeah
it's alright saying sixty four p cs on the street end
wonderful but it doesn't actually mean anything
an and its time that top corridor were made aware of just what sort of front line work we are doing to save the sixty four officers on the beat that
that's right
need to be there
yep yeah
in the first place i just find it
yeah
totally
the decision
disappointing an and frustrating th that this type of thing is happening i'm pleased i'm coming to the end of me service because the time will come when somebody's got to speak out and i think the time has or come when at i can speak out damn the consequences
i think public relations is the reason for doing it isn't it and to UNK the politicians
yeah but cos the politicians aren't being made aware of what we're doing
but nationally and locally because it seems that the answer to crime is the decision was reached with the chief constable and the chairman of the police committee with very little reference to and the deputy and we were not consulted on whether or not it should take place or ask what problems we would encounter we were told it was taking place
in fact it's only recently we had anything on paper telling u in fact we've had nothing on paper other than police committee minutes
and er sort of phone call one afternoon at half past four from the deputy oh by the way in fact if we hadn't been talking to any UNK on a we would've been interviewing people and telling them that they'd got a three year and these are all points that are gonna be brought up next week but i don't see there is any possibility of them doing an about turn because they've gone public on it
and they went public on it before consultation
i l o's than c p o's
they've been doing that anyway
it's just that unfortunately c p o's are on a home office list that say they are suitable for UNK
which home office list because
h m i c
it's been tried and tested
h m i c's list so the deputy tells me
lincolnshire are following suit
they're just having a just having a review and they've told mick that his lads are going to be UNK
an about turn
accepted that then
are we saying as a department therefore that we are just gonna let the wheel come off i l o work
no we will not have the capacity to do it other than a UNK examination by david
yes
the only other thing that may be an answer to the question is erm i know it seems an about face but are we gonna say that er the other two sergeants that are now managers become a l o's and use them in that capacity and train 'em up
i don't think you've got the opportunity to do that all the time
you might be able to do the odd one but i don't think that you've got the time i mean bear in mind you've gone from four to three to two there's two of you now UNK all of us if you tell me you've got spare time then great and you want to do one or two equally great however unless you tell me to the contrary
yeah but the thing is that well they most probably could do but could do some but what UNK be UNK would be the management skills y you know and then
you can't take on board a new commitment like that without UNK something
no
and i'd want to know what it was you were going to shed
some of these projects i mean just are ongoing you don't just go to a meeting and
you don't just put a two page report in and it's resolved it's probably a three month project that you need to go continuously once a week to a trial meeting or three months once a week to a two hour meeting
i mean some of these projects you're talking about thirty seven million pound projects
yeah
over a five year period i mean they don't just happen overnight
well if we draw UNK and don't go to them and somebody writes to the chief constable and says i'm very disappointed that your force no longer is gone a l o's then i shall be very happy that letters received by the chief because we can say well we told you so
we UNK it up we've now told the force that we can no longer meet our a l o requirements and that's it's not a question of being awkward we will not have the a l o's the a l o's to do it
it's the members of the police committee at the end of the day UNK had endorsed what the chief constable had done and it's their councils that are gonna suffer
well it isn't because th the police committee county councils and the one's
aye
of the district councils and the city councils
yeah
yeah
i mean i've worked with the county council but not on the same sort of budgets as the district councils so they're making decisions that are affecting the districts that they haven't got any means of
in the long term in the long term
in three years times all of the new c p o's will have been on courses and probably most of them will have been on a l o courses
so in three year's time we'll back to where we are today
we won't sir
you will only get one or two a l o courses at most per year
alright but given time we will eventually build up that skill base again
what we're saying is that in this two three four five year span we're gonna have some real problems
it's the contacts
it really is credibility
yeah you're blowing apart as well because we aren't servicing our part of the partnership cos it's not only just talking about the projects he's bringing in an and getting him involved with projects like that
we're blowing the whole thing out the window
yeah
so bill for instance is he to just carry on as if it's ongoing
yep
so is he to be he doesn't know whether to just carry on or to put a stop to it now or what the hell to do
no he must continue doing what he has got time to do
he's a c p o stroke a l o and that's what he should be doing
but th the thing is that ashfield and mansfield are still UNK sending him plans
yep three
we'll have to say sorry bill you know w send them down to dave if UNK got time to pull 'em in he will do if not we'll you know we'll have to reply negative
and also bear in mind that we can argue this is divisional problems as much as a headquarters c a problem those members of staff are owned by division
those resources will still be there on division long after july nineteen ninety four
and it's perhaps up to the new civilian c p o to go to the likes of mick and say i can't do this i have not been trained to do it yet until i have been trained to do it perhaps p c should continue using his skills
yes but bill's hop hoping to go to
UNK
mhm
which takes him off
yeah
they're all gonna
yeah but there will still be those nine c p o's somewhere on divisions perhaps it's advantage
there is no easy answer
no but it don't work that way
i know
maybe it's the personality
yeah
it's the person in the post as much as the post itself th that
i think one thing that we've got to do is UNK post one is that it's got to be eye UNK and c p o's right
yep
and the other thing is that to get this kind of continuity even at one post he's got to work with dave for at least six months and UNK going in march next year so we want a l o in post by september of this year if that's possible
so we're gotta start talking with personnel in the near future about david's post
yeah
right
don't
no but UNK
yeah
UNK er a latest date really
so
six months with you is a minimum
i'll tell you now we'll never get a six month's overlap
mm
but i shall be asking for one and we'll see what personnel says
it's one way of reminding them how complicated your task is so with six months overlap so we're talking about september aren't we
yeah because he's got to go on a month's course for a start for just general and then we've got to try and find him a week's course somewhere as a l o i don't know where but er in that time
look you're going to finish up with nine c p o's and an a l o
mm
why don't you have now to get to come over here
i've tried they've got no they're struggling for staff at the moment for external training and the they've said that er
why can't they give us i mean christ i can't do a up there
whatever
out of a five day course
do it ourselves
why don't we er get there erm package and do it ourselves
yeah but
we'd better at doing it ourselves
we've got the expertise yeah
i mean it it's only external speakers that we should er i mean they come to the university for a day i can set that up i mean we can do exactly the same at university
my input over there together with erm who did it last time erm norfolk and UNK the a l o from norfolk and UNK erm UNK from UNK so i mean i can't see why we can't
i think that's a good stop gap
yeah
do a five day course ourselves
you're talking about a five day a l o course now
yeah get em get em to do some sort of training
i mean i know we're UNK it again but i mean
it's better than nothing
but it's i'd rather see it UNK and some credibility left with district and city councils than er a hole that
i think it's a priority i do and
we can do that towards the end of nineteen ninety four then couldn't we ourselves
well soon rather than later
could do it sort of december january time
erm
got to get all these c p os selected and in post for a start
i just feel that to rely on UNK to them in there is they only run a l o courses a year
right
i mean they're probably booked up now for the next three or four years anyway
yeah
mm
no they do it year by year
i know they do UNK but i mean what i'm saying if priority states other forces have probably been waiting and rather than us sort of trying
what i've got i've already booked one this year for paul in july well that's a waste of time now so er at least one of them will be able to go on a ye UNK you know there'll be a there'll either be john
or alan been on the standard course that can go on the a l o course
mm
let's move forward
we're not gonna get them to change their mind
we've got to make the best of a bad job we've got to find a way of training both c p o's
change their mind there must be there must be nine other posts that if they look round they could UNK not i mean they haven't got to tell the public much it have they you still talk about the same amount of officers being UNK
i mean er i think if you put a good
it's been approved by the policy group and it's been approved by police committee
it's unlikely they're going to do an about turn
it is unlikely but i mean that
those decisions were taken through without the proper input from the department concerned but you know i mean surely if we can go with
i'll
a cast iron logical argument you could you could then even phase it over a longer period
now that's different you'll not get em to cancel it but to get them to spin it out over a longer period is a possibility and that's what we're gonna be working towards
i think
but if we say to them er we can't argue against the principle of UNK of c p o's that's been there ad UNK
that was approved three years ago on policy group stuart was there and he agreed that it was a feasible option to UNK c p o's
my argument is it's being done all in one go that we're trying to do nine on one day
that evaluation exists in group three
mm
it only reached there by chief superintendent knew what he was bloody talking about
mm
well the principal of having civilians as c p o's is one UNK been
accepted nationwide not just force wide
now having done that if we were doing three a year i would suggest we can cope with that
my big concern is that nine in one go all at the mini divisions and they're all very much on their own out there and there's nobody to hold their hand through any for through the UNK period
how do we know at the end of six months whether they are performing well or not
what i've said is that i'd like to see the existing c p o's become divisional staff at the division that they are working now so that the divisional commander can allow them to stay there holding hands with the new civilian c p o for up to six months if necessary because it then becomes a local decision as to when the when the two have that UNK cut
that and i appreciate one or two might want to go and work on other divisions but i if generally they were kept on the division that they are now then it could be a very gradual process of going back into uniform
anyway perhaps if i come back to you after next tuesday afternoon when i've got a meeting to talk just about that subject with the deputy and see what options are going to come forward
the was just UNK in my ear would it be a good idea for the UNK to have er a community affairs meeting to
mm
i mean i think we've only ever met him once since we've been here he's our head of department its an issue that affects not just you as the bo as the head of department
also the people on the ground i mean er surely it wouldn't do any harm to actually sit down and put some UNK forward from the whole department
yeah yep
it's our credibility as well you know we're being told quality of service etc and i think it ought to be a department meeting we all ought to have the opportunity to put forward what we're doing and where we're going
yeah
can i shut this window dave
yeah but i think i think it's right are you using your expertise now dave
yes
you do realise he's locked us in can we break into the bar
right i will invite the deputy to an emergency meeting on this one subject not with a big agenda like that
no
but to talk about the way forward to do with a l o's so can we all address our minds to the problems that we perceive ma make some notes so that we can draw up a proper agenda of all the issues likely to be UNK through the UNK programme okay
i'll get him i'll get er jane to give me a few dates and we'll suit choose a suitable date and we'll try all of the aspects everything about a l o work about the training some of these we've almost got solutions to ourselves we ought to be careful erm if we can er draw up a proper agenda and discuss with him all of those issues
by discussing reasons with the deputy i mean we had the meeting on public relations before christmas and the scrutiny was promised and nothing's happened erm we still soldier on we're not
it was we need
it was on the agenda and at seven o'clock the at night they eh they adjourned the meeting cos they only got half way through the agenda
mm we expected to perform in a professional way particularly after incidents like last week when we had an horrendous twenty four hours and we don't get paid for it
yep it was scrutiny wasn't it
yeah he mentioned to me about a month ago well i think it was at christmas it was probably at christmas time
he mentioned it to me at christmas as well
and of course now that the chief is er
p l o ing
it doesn't help existing staff though does it helps staff from
a l o ing p l o ing
i think that just puts it into bloody perspective
UNK strip
more interested in designing the bloody UNK strip than
why don't they UNK chief constables could be a job for you in UNK
if we start at the top instead of the bottom it'd be a bloody sight more efficient
positive suggestions that's what i like
that's how it used to be though
aye
well and we're going back to basics so yes
if they're keeping the politicians happy by keep the UNK troops from the ground nobody looks at those at the top
mm
bu but if anybody wanted to UNK anything properly you could actually start UNK from the top
because the managers are required at the top not policemen
mm
you could look very carefully at personnel
certainly could
er i think i personally would UNK the day that we had a civilian stone cold with that sort of post because its priorities would be so different to ours
if you had a bloke like john tha that virtually ran the force for several years whether you liked him or whether you didn't he was efficient in running the force erm especially when charlie was into the erm in a big way and he spent very little time with nottinghamshire john ran the force made the decisions and cracked on with it
mm
mm yep and a lot of people would agree with you
can we move on
er notts UNK news david
yes we had a meeting a few weeks ago to discuss the future and it was agreed that we should have three issues a year rather than four i think this would be welcomed by local police stations gotta change the dates to act on market research which indicates certain months when certain security devices sell well
we've talked to the existing UNK and this was now eight weeks ago and they still haven't written despite many phone calls from me to put suggestions forward as to UNK and so on
we've also approached nottingham evening post who've expressed an interest in taking it on but again we still haven't got a meeting so i intend ringing them both this week and UNK that we need to get a move on because really we need an issue out by march
we did discuss themes for each issue but this will be security themes and it would help the people who are producing the paper to sell because this is one big UNK they've had they don't know what the content is until the last moment if they knew it was say er car security they could approach garages and car security device manufacturers etc
so that's the way forward we hope to retain a sixteen page issue three times a year a bit more thinking behind it and er hopefully produced at erm no extra cost to us that's why we've gone to another supplier
er UNK is due out again four times a year er in its same format as a eight page a four
i mean i would love to see a newspaper but the current staffing of the office doesn't permit that also the costing of it erm but i've very little input from this department and really while all out and about in the force and just a tip off about something human interest or whatever would be appreciated
our press stories in general and working with keith now over and also the launch of dare which has got a few problems er are there any other major
yes
sold secure on the seventh no er seventh of march
of march
seventh of march yeah
have you a location for that yet
hopefully
it's er booked for
yeah that'll be fine mike yeah right we need to talk about that
UNK free and i've booked him for the launch
what time will that be
er ten a m
ten thirty
ten thirty
right so i haven't had a briefing on that so i can
well we've we only went to the if you like the training session of the er erm participants yesterday and we've got our next meeting on the UNK february that i've invited you to at
must check me diary
great
er any other new coming up
drugs UNK you obviously included that
yes er we're going to the drugs squad dave and i the launch of a new UNK which is where people can report dealers a little bit sceptical about its success but we've spent quite a lot on posters and business cards
the business cards have been left in custody UNK and so on for people to pick up but the problem is i think are the drug squad going to service it properly they are so busy er that's going to be difficult
the launch is going to take place at central police station
well it's their initiative and
that's right
so presumably they've got to manage it themselves
erm
they asked for it they got it they can't turn around and say we're too busy to deal with it was their idea
i don't think they'll say it but they might find they are
what about victim support
yes erm nineteenth twenty sixth of UNK victims week several meetings now with erm publicity they're gonna contact you
it's the first i've heard of it
yeah it only happened last week thursday
erm we've got some publicity material produced posters we intend doing several displays county hall headquarters all police stations will have posters sent out to them probably libraries will be circulated with them er it's a last minute job typical we only just found about it we do what we can we need some sort of press exercise don't we you know
get you some victims to be included because presumably they want to appeal for more members
that's right more recruiting
and possibly money
well not so much money they've got the money they want really resources human resources paul's gonna do a article for us in the herald and post
who is
paul
oh right
with his your column yeah
yeah my column
i'm gonna talk to dave to see whether or not he's finished his erm neighbourhood watch article whether they can put something in there about and then we hope to have a meeting with you to discuss victims and some erm press releases for that week
that's a late warning though isn't it
yeah received it last week chief brought it to the meeting on tuesday evening last week but the quickest like most national organisations somebody was sick right e b p week is the twenty first march
what's that
educational business partnership which is part of greater nottingham tec major UNK so they are er taking over the erm design centre on for a week
what was the date of that again
the twenty first of march
UNK the links between business and education and i have said that we are a major business in the area we have probably stronger links with education than any other business that i can think of and they are going to be sa singing our UNK so we are going to putting quite a big display in the in the fashion centre
mm
well that's the week of john drama project the twenty fourth of march which done with
that's north notts then
yeah which is but it's still education
yeah erm
w we were putting the er kitchen and the display in there for the week
and also don't forget nottinghamshire show is the UNK and UNK of may
did you submit the plans for that kitchen to the a l o group
yes that's right we did
i think we can say that the a l o er washed it hands completely
well clear
especially when it came to UNK it into the van the a l o was nowhere to be found
can you make a note of the north notts drama festival
yeah
what was the date of that
oh sorry the er the drama competition is UNK march
yeah
it's sponsored by north notts tech that for publicity as well
the nottinghamshire show is the UNK and UNK and as most of you know now we're going to build the equivalent of UNK street on quite a large area UNK a hundred years of er of burglary that that's the theme
once again david will be tremendously involved in it
a UNK again
with UNK coming out the UNK
any further initiatives moving on later in the year which we can diary at this stage
there's certainly over may day may bank holiday
oh the weekend
the city UNK
i've had three letters now one from david one from you and one from beeston all assuming that i seem to be dealing with this subject erm it's a beeston commitment
yeah
i've left a message for UNK chris to ring me back about it and as yet he hasn't rung me back
i will ring him again this afternoon but it's may day and i i've no doubt that beeston won't be UNK their c p os to work on a bank holiday
that's it ain't it in a UNK
erm
because it's their money that's gonna be
ah to be fair terry is one of the better UNK
yeah
he's not caused us any hassle at all er he's been very helpful
yeah
but i can't see him UNK bank holiday workings and so bank holiday exhibitions are almost a thing of the past
what is the commitment like for display unit during the year i get the impression it's not used as much as it used to be
no it's not
it's not
ain't got time
have not got the time to be doing
but when you think about it and i i'm not being UNK here
mm
crime prevention officers are traditionally and it's a public relations exercise ain't it it's nothing to do with crime prevention
they want to talk about anything other than crime prevention
yeah and it's a public relations exercise and we've been UNK with it you know over the years we've tried to push crime prevention and people come in and they do take notes of various things you know there's obviously some people who come in and talk about crime prevention which we can answer fully there are other enquiries about everything from bloody
UNK
yeah recruiting dog UNK on their street etc that we do our best to deal with in the UNK know time honoured tradition of a policeman and a and we're police officer sorry trace er and er we just you know i think it's more a p r o thing than er anybody but i don't expect you to man it i don't expect jenny or ann or jane to man it
the work wouldn't get done
no but this is
it is a shame it's a good facility
yeah
can't you offer it to divisions you know and say well
we do we do
come and
it is it is being used so
i'm using it for tottenham fair on third second or third of er july but only because i've managed to get a p c enthusiastic about doing it and he's gonna man it for the day
we also use it for consultations of use it for UNK and UNK
erm yeah
it gets collected and don't get broken into and bloody generators stolen
unfortunately when other divisions come and use it they seem to think they can pick up the caravan and there'll be a wonderful display in there
yeah
ready for them to use
mm
and the posters will all be there neatly in rows and all they have to do is smile is smile and er shake a few hands
it's probably UNK by your staff
well at the end of the day somebody's got to get it ready
it's never not been cleaned for six seven months
but we haven't got a pat at the moment and its in and it's his responsibility
but in the plans for the reorganisation of community affairs there was an exhibitions officer wasn't there there's still a need for that isn't there
that's right entirely
it would save you all a lot of time
there was a was er an exhibitions officer listed and a burglar alarms inspectorate
inspectorate
erm and neither of them have been brought here they've done the bit that suits them of UNK the er crime prevention officers but the bit that actually needed doing they've not done
yeah
but when you think of it the cost of the superintendent doing display work is enormous isn't it
that's right yeah that's right
i appreciate i shouldn't be spending my time up a ladder
mm
but sometimes it's the only way to get things done
but they wouldn't allow it in industry or commerce
no but as often as not
i disagree with you they do nowadays
they encourage management to work on floor level they do well it's certainly in modern what is it
a month a year where they go back on the tools
that's right a month a year go back and do the basics
anyway yes which is once again a divisional commitment er it's a programme of course
what's the date of that river thing
operation trent
no the boat show in nottingham
oh aye
yes four day boat show
is the UNK which is sometime in may although mick will be involved with that knows about that paul has offered to help and ray will do a lot of the running around so we have got people involved in that
but ray is on the on the river all the time that it's on he can't man the caravan
no but he will do the UNK work and he's taking photographs now for us that can be blown up for display purposes and he's linking with UNK to find equipment so
september nineteenth and twenty sixth two weeks
is that going to be
no
severn UNK work to
nine months or a year's time we may have a different animal working in that office and it may well be some person who has who does some j l o work to supplement john and does some project work now er jackie has indicated she'd love to fill that role and we all know what project she'd want to be doing it but er if we do put somebody in that role they will be project officer as well and on the wall will be a year planner and it'll have things like crucial crew gala day and all these major things and that particular officer will work quite closely with the new pat and they'll be able to take some of the weight off our shoulders so when we start planning for something like crucial crew you can delegate some of the work to the project officer and perhaps the other sergeant now i know things don't always work out quite that UNK but you know the last year has been a UNK of a year for us in terms of sickness four s l o's have been on long term sick we've lost pat for all that time UNK was off for quite a while
yeah
dave was off with his hernia ross UNK we've not seen for a year i mean i know things have been difficult for the last year
joe
yeah we've lost an enormous amount of staff probably a third of our staff disappeared in the last twelve months and i think y you we must recognise it's bound to make an impact and here we are sitting here feeling a bit shell shocked and that's no doubt one of the UNK factors
perhaps the year UNK gonna be a lot easier for us
certainly i hope they take that into consideration when we do the er annual report and what we've done because we haven't been half as active as what we have in the past
the annual report has got nothing to do with
no i
work
don't mean work i mean the h m i's report
ah because the annual report this year is all they want to do is plug er three or four little topics that we've done er on a UNK basis
they don't want a report of the years work they just want us to talk about one or two things we've done any more events
no
just move onto the next one then media trainer i started talking to the training school about doing some training for officers it started with c i d cos you often find that a d s is an acting d i and when we asked them to do an interview about a crime or incident they say we've not done radio interviews before so phil has er supported it and we're gonna run some sort of training scheme one day courses for them
also er saw er nick last week and he's agreed that we can offer a similar sort of training scheme around the force people apply just for er a one day course so what i'm saying to any community affairs staff
certainly the new c p os need to be
yes yeah
alan is he going an all
he's gonna run it
he's another one for UNK
my wife my wife heard him on the radio on saturday morning she said who's this why does he keep saying motor car motor car
it wasn't me
no
don't start david off
i don't got time cos he's so busy running these man management courses
oh
quality of service
inter personal skills
somebody's asked the price you pay for UNK
oh yeah he's very good at solving big jobs but er that's the price you pay i'm afraid
right so we've got paul and the three new c p os who would like to go on some training right
i'll get round that somehow i'll let you know
yes right if anybody else has got any feelings please let me have them
how is em is diane yeah
yeah diane
yeah we probably could run one course for community affairs staff actually we take about twelve people on it normally
it'll be the new s l o perhaps
probably the s l o
i mean the new ones if and when selected there's a new post there
just to mention one more thing the force video a number of community affairs staff have mentioned to me that it's out of date cos it goes back to the previous organisation
it's also sexist
sexist
is it about policemen
it says about scenes of crime officers cos most burglaries happen er in the early afternoon when UNK gone out to pick up the kids before she comes home to cook the tea
oh
i wouldn't know that
now you play that in the school and watch er fourth form girls sort of you know
i'm gonna start wrong
is that when the teachers have walked out
probably be as well to start teaching em that again
oh
that comes from er an officer that's very shortly retiring
UNK it to use some of the existing film and to include new film and new voice over and new look it's about five or six thousand pounds
can you sort of have you looked at the federation videos that we've got now
no
federation have got some super videos very good model
have you got em
we we've ordered ten
steve has got one that he played at the last s l os meeting it lasts about four minutes it's as long as the song he ain't heavy he's my brother
are these national videos
yep yeah
the problem is videos done well can cost you thirty forty thousand pounds
the last one we had we had a budget of ten thousand pounds the company which did it said that it would normally not take on a project of that sort of cost but they found a junior member of staff to take it on and the end product i mean that's going back nearly five years now was quite er acceptable and welcome but now it looks very much out the force has been UNK we need to give it a new look
erm can i say that it's only last year that we organised that video for secured car parks and employed a blooming outside UNK to do it and that cost us twelve thousand quid and that were at derby and they made an excellent bloody video of it didn't they
yeah
an excellent video and it was twenty five minutes long
yeah
and they normally say that a minute of erm that is gonna be a thousand quid don't they a minute of video is a thousand quid
yeah but you see by going to the same supplier we've got a lot of the film we can use that er there's been several days UNK
do we want to use it again
well it's either that or start from scratch and we're talking fifteen thousand pounds
right
i dunno i mean i'll mention it to the deputy again and say look we're getting towards the end of a financial year there will be some departments UNK because er suppliers can't meet UNK and really you should keep in mind that w we haven't got er we can't just UNK five thousand pounds out of our budget
i mean it would indicate that our budgets five thousand more than we really need on other years
er and it's a force commitment it isn't i mean short of saving up over a period of years which we are not allowed to do
personnel uses a lot i mean for career shows and open days
let's have it out of personnel budget erm
yeah good
what i was going to say yeah i've been involved in a lot of videos over recent years and erm central er and there's a UNK budget which a caravan for central they usually charge about three or four thousand pounds depending on how long the video is
they shoot it and they will then arrange to er edit it and produce about five thousand
i find that these people who are so called on the cheap that the product is not very good well if you say you call it by one of them
and it were crap
yeah i mean on the burglary project we did a super video about victims they did one for school which steve was involved in which was excellent and you know so the quality is not in doubt
but i think the best recommendation is when big business has used that company to produce a video for themselves you know the companies with the big budgets and so on it's an indication of the quality
cost a lot of money
yeah but if it's going to be shown to ultimately thousands of people and to last at least a couple of years we should invest in it
em
but as i say that i recommend them because they were er excellent
they did all the shooting in two days actually and er they made a blooming good job of it
well i've got a feeling that if you do a video we're gonna UNK anyway in the light of er what's going to happen in near future getting rid of chief UNK and things like that we might be wasting money again
as the review of the nineteen ninety three year alteration been complete
of the authority
well no if you remember they they've just started now a review of nineteen ninety UNK reorganisation because everything that moved from newark to west UNK has moved back again
yeah
ain't it
i can't see them keeping that division together for very long
well as i say they're reviewing the whole lot again
the whole nineteen ninety three reorganisation is being reviewed
that's it it's been done
is back with the chief now
yeah it's back with him but as i say the overall implications haven't er been sorted out
i think from the UNK point of view the s i hardly ever use it UNK
er right
they've agreed they're gonna use this federation one as a short stop gap an i think paul's point is spot on it might be a bit silly to jump in just at the moment
there's a lot of stuff happening nationally which could affect us and for the sake of eighteen months we might be as well waiting
mm
by the way there was one thing that we didn't mention when we were talking about c p o's that is very pertinent is that already i've got it on authority that one of the c p o's that we've employed as a civilian has been offered a job with an alarm company at fifteen thousand a year
has he
mm
and that's without any training
that that's dependent on him trained
quite frankly the salaries you offer these c p os is if they weren't retired police officers you wouldn't get the UNK of person
that's right
and that's not fair quite frankly with the current job situation
now we might get some very good qualified erm civilians apply for the post if it was fifteen thousand a year plus
mm
well they would say hang on you had one hundred and thirty seven applicants as it was
yeah i know but a lot of them were crap
mm
yeah
right we seem to have gone back to subject four there don't we eh where are we now
eight
eight keith sounds like an interesting one computer training purchase for c a staff
yep there's been a lot of occasions in the last two to three months when i could really have done with access to a computer
erm to sit down it's alright saying that i've got alf and i've got tracey there are times when i need to sit down and UNK stuff about and look at something
posters and things
well not posters the UNK is a prime example where i wanted to look at setting a format in a particular way and to sit at the side of either alf or tracey well now alter it to that or to that i'm sure they'd do it but nevertheless it's putting them off their work
what i'm saying to you is erm i don't expect for one minute to have a computer installed in my office UNK alter it to that a particular way and to
uh
mind you've got access to one
when i'm trained i'm going to in my office in the near future
i thought i thought you were going to get one on your desk one like UNK that UNK all the time
it is UNK
that's
well okay i need to say that when it's long reports i have no problem i mean since i've lost UNK and come under tracey the quality and speed that i get typing back is much improved
i'm not saying that to UNK her
i can put fax stuff to tracey and have it back the next day but i've got to physically fetch it that is the only disadvantage or arrange to get it picked up
what do you want to use the computer for
but i mean stuff like UNK small UNK and things like that by the time i've sat and written it out i could've put it straight onto a word processor myself and got it typed
this stuff like em er storing things lists mailing lists er mailing lists for the sold secure which i'm the secretary of
get yourself on the course that paul went on and you're gonna be getting the kit soon anyway as part of the network it won't give you stand alone but you have to have somebody on the network
yeah
cos people are going to be sending you messages on it
oh right
get yourself on the course ring er sue or somebody at the training school tell her your problem
it's jeff you write to
is it jeff right get yourself on the course it shouldn't be difficult to get on the course paul got on it without even knowing he was on it
they rang one up in the morning to say why aren't you here
well what about the kit who's i mean are you responsible
on the list to get one
yes em
another terminal cos when you start to use it you realise the value of it
presumably my printer would be one of those linked back to the apple
yeah
the printer would do that but your machine here would be linked into a storage computer storage system here at mansfield which every now and again it sends all the information down the telephone lines to headquarters and it's done every is it every two hours
yeah
or is it two hours in the morning
they do it every two hours
but the thing is that your er particular area you know if you wanted to do one and not save it you don't have to save you know you know you can print it off and it's done but you can send mail to tracey or headquarters c a you wouldn't have to print it out once it's what you want you just press a button and it goes
but in theory you could do posters here at mansfield and you could send out we could print them in colour for you
right
so i mean there are other advantages and the answer is that in the long term you are getting your name down for one so clear a space on your desk
it's a week's course
yeah cos i think UNK been two courses now and we've picked her brains so we can have basic use but er you start to realise it's only a little bit of the system you know you could do a lot more
well they sent me i went on a computer course two days before i went to in hospital and was away for eight weeks and i forgot totally
well so the answer is yes you'll be getting one if you check with them they'll tell you what the timescale is i wish all items were as easy as this
number nine
oh this is a good one
diet and behaviour project
don't think there's any truth in this at all
okay that's finished that then
right then next one number ten
about
go on then
when was it november
er no
recently
dave and i er were grabbed by the throat by em a woman and her husband from UNK called and woman called barbara and she's been involved with er a fella called superintendent er in west yorkshire
um
i see right
in west yorkshire they do a lot of studies university type studies on UNK problems in kids affecting being affected by what they eat and they've done trials on all sorts
so she came and talked to 'em we had a long chat and actually i mean it er does sound very interesting
we'll probably take this on paper so the reason it's on the agenda is to tell you as a department that we've had this sent to us erm we've got a meeting later this week to actually sit down and analyse it and to put something on paper to send up to command
my theories with it my er great cynical look at it is they need a hundred offenders and a hundred non offenders to be referred to them for these tests
i mean the offenders aren't named or anything it's all UNK but of course in west yorkshire they've used the juvenile liaison officer
there's no way i can put this onto
no
certainly john there's no way erm
first of all has this project official backing from command
our command no because it's not been put to them yet
yeah
yeah but what are we gonna word it in such a way as they're not gonna give it
probably
UNK of the cos of the er
well the new the new demands on the just don't i mean just don't allow any scope
no
any leverage at all
i i've got to say that it's somebody that's got a personal project that has done it in one force ain't it
now that particular force if they're anything like the other forces that i deal with ain't under the stresses and strains that we are
when you look at lincolnshire and they've got a chief inspector as a force crime prevention officer and they've got an inspector as a deputy force crime prevention officer and their crime is a third of ours or well less than a third of ours y you start getting things into perspective and i think they're trying to put too much work onto a too over worked task force already
this is leeds where they've done this so i wouldn't have thought they were under worked
no
er the reason we wanna get it right is because er this superintendent erm he's obviously got his interests very much on it and he's keen to know what our response is going to be and if it were just a member of the public i think we could we could being crude i think we could UNK 'em off but i think it's gonna have to be a very structured answer as to why we're not gonna do it
we might look at it and think it's worth doing it's interesting
what we say is that our juvenile liaison officers are working six or seven between six and ten hours UNK overtime every week just trying to do their normal core work
to start giving them new projects is unrealistic and we can't UNK it
it would incur large overtime commitments have they any idea who is likely to pay it
cos we can't
i'd love to do it really because i think you know er there's a lot of evidence pro and there's a lot of evidence against and i like to
i wonder if they would supply us with a researcher
oh yeah they do they supply the researcher
all we do is allow them access to
that's all we do
files
oh
well that's but the referral has to be done by the juvenile liaison
no i mean actually come to one of the officers and sit there and they do the work so it doesn't bother us at all
all we do is make sure that they're not taking anything
because it's home office funding
it er could lead the way open to a major UNK in crime prevention really
and it as well
they could chief inspector williams from here
we will know that certain UNK will stop crime is a good example
in the cell block and we and somebody was causing trouble many years ago
the on thursday at one o'clock if you want to come to the meeting
sometimes you can be very radical
he's always radical
the master's done it
yeah
somebody's having UNK at
right very interesting
in fact it's got your writing on it sir
next one initiative er UNK sold secure
we're progressing at great rate of knots at the moment
all our twelve participating garages received their initial training yesterday
it was excellent training
i tell you if i'd have know what the content of the training was gonna be i would've arranged for our twelve crime prevention officers to go across there and listen to it because there was a UNK there that gave a lot of sound advice in relation to security of homes as well cars that really was good basic UNK for a crime prevention officer
i did shock him with one answer cos he was expecting a totally different answer to the one i gave him which was correct and you know that is unusual for me but er i did shock him with one but other than that it was erm it was er an excellent input all the way through the day and they explained the differences and why they er approved some products and not the others things like that it was er spot on
and he made one or two of the garage men you know really the you could see one or two were taken UNK by the things he were saying and it was er very professionally put over
our next meeting of our local group we refused to launch it on the day that we were doing the training and if you'd seen the launch yesterday it was absolutely bloody UNK
erm all it was in the middle of a training session the chief inspector at lincolnshire got up and said er erm you know the members of the press who were there erm
how many press did you get
one lincolnshire echo er the thing was now open
er the yorkshire television did phone up and apologise for not coming but er that was it
erm the r m i f bloke was there and he said that's the second one he's been to where they've been doing the training and the launch at the same time and neither of UNK gone well
erm but like i think we've done it right
we're gonna get em trained up in the garages before we actually launch but they are able now to say they are approved UNK so they will be getting all the stuff everything in relation to it i've given em a list of the people involved in nottinghamshire and it's the launch is on the seventh march at west UNK and basically the system is ready and up and running thank the lord after hard work by er keith and us all at various times but it's been mainly down to keith
it's the twenty seventh march is it
no seventh of march
seventh
at west UNK police station
so i've got to er one i've got it UNK to meet you and keith about a press launch and er a you know a press release
yeah
then also er a talk with the UNK about what he's gonna say and i'm gonna put at the beginning please do not refer to this as being prepared for you that's two times he's been to a launch and said that and he don't give it such a spontaneous thing so er i did meet him and tell him
is this reading your script
yeah so er i'll give him notes this time i think and let him put the meat on the bone
bullet points
mm
okay force watch keith
yes it will be launched a bit late next wednesday the ninth february at the section not a big UNK at all it's just a photo call for the press to come in and take such pictures and what have you
it will be split into local authority areas erm it'll be a telephone UNK type system a handbook which is being printed i took the dummy did you drop the dummy back to steve yesterday
the dummy was dropped back to steve yesterday at the printers and that's now gonna be done
obviously it'll not be done for the launch but he's made a smart job of it looks really smart done it in yellow erm and really later on this week i'm just UNK up i've got to go and see f i b just to make sure everything's in place with them in the mounted section and really this time a week tomorrow it'll be launched
who's launching it
er me i mean it's just it's just a photo call
right
has jane prepared the press release yet
she has done i went to speak to her about it last friday but she was diverted cos
she's on a course next week so i'll
i'm seeing her
i'm gonna go and see her on she doesn't know but i'll call in and see her on thursday
right i'll tell her you're calling in
right
right er on to any other business david do you want to just give a ten minute summary about parish special constables
mm yes erm since the home office secretary's initiative it's progressing quite well with interest from certainly UNK newark UNK on the UNK and some other of the rural UNK areas were interested in going forward UNK looked very interested we went to a meeting last night eighteen parish councils were represented er UNK is going to be the first one they've got a special that lives there who's gonna take up the work superintendent came down last night to do a circular of em a questionnaire around the village and parish to get find out what people want and then go and see what the UNK able to provide and meet the two together and get some sort of UNK agreement he'll work from the police house there he'll have access to the car when it's not being used by the rural officer also his radio
problems that we generally will be hopefully er UNK by that er action by the superintendent
so that'll be the first one
when will that be
no dates have been arranged yet
yeah
but it'll be the next few weeks
well i'd like to get involved in some sort of launch for it
i think derbyshire have done quite a big thing and had some publicity for theirs
yeah it's rubbish innit all they're doing is team policing with UNK
mm
they drop off a van load of UNK in an area and walk round with their UNK on
what's the difference then what's our scheme
well ours is a proper UNK job david as you expect
yes
is there a blue print for what a parish constable should know
no
the guidelines are put out at home office but they really know what they were doing
right
so that's why we haven't he wanted twenty the home secretary wanted twenty up and running before christmas he didn't say which christmas but we UNK he meant last christmas and we said no we'll do it properly and get it started up right
can i just i thought that my perceptions of this was there were twenty schemes already in existence er split between parish UNK and parish constables and there was gonna be a report put back to the er home secretary for him to decide the way forward and er that er we would wait for the evaluation of that scheme before we went further
no totally wrong jim
well that was that
that was my original they had a competition to look out for people who've got ideas about this new idea it was a ridiculous idea to do a competition cos people didn't know what they were entering for half the parishes weren't notified about it
er mm
