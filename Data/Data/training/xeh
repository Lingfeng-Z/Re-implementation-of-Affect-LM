erm i could go back to commerce although er that side of my life is some way behind and it it's always been very successfully done by er my colleagues in the company that i started
so er you know i i've never had a sort of er a one way track about politics although i UNK it and i've er i've enjoyed it UNK am enjoying it and i
ah i was going to pick you said i have enjoyed it UNK i was about to leap in and say ah that means
yes ye no
how kind
well that's the value of a programme like this you can correct
otherwise that'd be over the headlines
heseltine says future
quite
is in the past
you know
which is not exactly what i am saying
erm no the fact is that er i love politics
it's er and i have always wanted to be president of the board of trade
but what about more ambition further ambition now
well that's a sort of wary question but all politicians
but you'd expect me to ask it
i know you're bound to ask it
and you i'm not going to give any different answer i've ever given
i my belief is that john major will win the next election
i helped to win the last one i shall help to win the next one
and er i think that er all this sort of chat about leadership challenges and all that i think that's for the birds
i don't think we shall see it
i especially i don't think so after the very er impressive speech he made on friday
but there is we can come to that in a moment if we may
but there is something about you that is a bit different to politicians
apart from that but well th that's true that's true
trouble
trouble
and you've had plenty of that
plenty of trouble
and yet you keep UNK back or
yes
swinging back
i mean er
i wrote a book called where there's a will
precisely
you resigned over UNK you er you were defeated for the leadership
you've had your heart attack you've been out of action for three months and yet when you talk to people when the UNK go out with their UNK they say who do you think is most likely apart from the prime minister to lead the tory party
and they say you
still
so what is it about you
trouble
it's got to be a bit more than that
ambition
long hair
long hair tall
you know
been around a long time
erm i what is it who knows who cares
you know if i'm president of the board of trade i'm a loyal member of john major's cabinet
i intend to go on doing that as long as he wants me
and the inevitable qu you'd expect me to ask this to you
if john major fell under a UNK train would your hat still be in the ring
or
well
would you say i've had it all now i do
i mean i you know you never make these er you can get every sort of UNK answer to these questions
and they're all lies you know they may sound nice and they may UNK people but the truth is any politician that i know and respect when it comes to the crunch if they think they have a chance of UNK and obviously ultimate UNK take it
some of them do it UNK and with UNK and say it's never what i ever had in mind
but they always do it
others are honest about it
ken clarke i like him i trust him i admire him
what does he say he answers the question straight just the way i always answered it
which is to say yes given another chance i'd have a go for it
no i no i don't say that cos what i always said is you cannot do what your friends will never let you do
that's the real test
you cannot if you're in the house of commons and there's a vacancy or something of this sort for a job i mean we don't need to invent a hypothetical situation
your friends are the ones who say well you're the guy who could do this
and if they don't say that or if they positively say you're not the guy you're wasting your time
the only reason that you can make progress in that sort of situation is if there's a body of opinion that says that you should
but somebody like you could always find friends to say yes you ought to do that
no i don't agree with that
i d i do not agree with that at all
i mean there could i mean i think the house of commons is now some way past in my life in the sense i haven't been there since er june
i've no idea about the mood i've no idea what people will think of er maybe large numbers well one journalist said to me in blackpool and perhaps this says it all he said michael you're the only really popular person here this week
you see they've nothing to be frightened of any more
but they're wrong
ah but they
aren't they because you're saying i'm still around
no they may not be UNK i mean the fact i'm around doesn't mean to say that i'm frightening
and i haven't changed
i've never been frightening
people have UNK me
so you're not going to write your memoirs
you know i i'm unhappy about this UNK business
i mean they're self serving aren't they
and they're all to put the person's point of view
and erm i find it i mean i'm not going to be sort of UNK than thou about it all i mean perhaps i myself might be tempted er one day
erm but the idea that someone is putting it all down all those private conversations all those UNK and it's all being recorded not to present the historic truth but to present the truth as the person wants history to read it
that's what always happens they're self serving self pleading self UNK
er perhaps they're helpful to the UNK because they can then put them all in a room
although i must say i mean one of the most fascinating pieces of politics i was ever involved in was when i had to defend mrs thatcher over the UNK incident
and people were very kind about the quality off the speech that i made that did it
i believed she was one hundred percent right
i believed then and i believe now
i must make that absolutely clear
but i had to get together in one room the UNK the intelligence people the civil servants all the people who'd played a critical role in advising her
it was only six months before they couldn't agree
i wonder what each of their memoirs would look like
so what about mrs UNK memoirs
the timing
well i UNK yeah
you know look i did a deal with mrs thatcher in nineteen eighty six that i wouldn't open up many of these issues and if she sticks to the deal i'll stick to the deal
but she hasn't
as far as i'm concerned personally so far she has
what was the deal then
that i wouldn't pursue the issues of nineteen eighty six
and i haven't i with the no it's very simple i left it to the select committees of the house of commons
but we're talking about now we're talking about mrs thatcher having written
i deal
a set of memoirs er critical of the prime minister while he's still in office
erm er i'm she hasn't been critical of me
no but she's been critical of lots of other people
well we don't know for sure yet about what she's said about you
do we
if
that's what i said if she sticks to the deal i'll stick to the deal
s but y what you're saying is that if UNK have you seen the book by the way
have you read the book
right
no
no
so if somewhere later on in the book she says michael heseltine was a rotten old so and so
erm
i'm sure we know that she thinks that so that won't actually sort of UNK great reaction in me
what would it need to UNK you then
we'll just see
what about what she has had to say about john major
well look let's stand back
my interest is in the unity and success of the conservative party
i don't want to see i deeply UNK the divisions between left and right and the UNK of often very UNK and UNK that goes on
it's a development that has grown in my political lifetime over erm i suppose twenty years now
and i don't like that aspect of politics the UNK of it all the personal sort of er UNK of it all
i know it's there but i thought that john struck with me a very powerful note when he said in his conference speech i should share these things first in private
and i don't think it would do any good for me on this programme or any of my colleagues and of course the media will be now all over the place trying to achieve this
to get instant reactions instant comments which will blow the thing up
but you're clearly unhappy about it
i you you've made that quite clear
i cannot i cannot believe that it is w within the standards of the conservative party that i joined that this sort of diary writing UNK history er is part of the convention
i think er one of the papers made this erm i think UNK douglas UNK er has set a sort of standard which i would admire
er there were always memoirs but i think that the nature of them has changed
and i and not sure it's well i am sure that it's for the worse
it's causing damage
i don't think that the people come out of it well
any of them
including the authors
er i think particularly the authors
should there be er a change in the rules
what rules
that says well there aren't any rules at the moment obviously but should there are rules for civil servants should there be rules for politicians
well there are rules but UNK
that say
UNK enough they seem to have i mean i have
yeah but they have only to do with things like national security and
yes but er i think that erm er the little by little the UNK have been stretched
and of course there's huge
do you think they should be tightened up again
there's huge money
dramatic money
you know
and have no UNK the money and the contents are very linked
that it's no use going round saying well here's my view of history as i wrote it
er and it's factual it's UNK it's erm UNK of the sort of UNK of politics
cos you won't get enough money
you mean people UNK them up
oh yeah sure
you think mrs UNK done that
i have no idea
i wouldn't dream of making such an observation
but it sounds as though you suspect that
i i'm not going to be drawn even by your UNK questioning
alright but the rules
in this direction
but the rules ought to be changed
there UNK the rules ought to be UNK up to stop this kind of thing going on
i doubt if you could have rules
i doubt any more whether we live in the sort of society where you could have such rules
since we're talking about rules what about erm mrs thatcher lady thatcher wanting to change the rules so that a sitting prime minister can't be challenged
oh no certainly not
certainly not
certainly not
i w i personally er made it clear at the time when they changed the rules er fairly recently that i didn't think they should
erm i think that er erm politicians understand full well the nature of the profession in which they're involved and the parliamentary party is erm more than able to exercise a proper judgement er i don't think there's any case at all for er changing th i don't think there was a case for changing the rules and i don't think there is a case for changing the rules today
so you're out of step with people like douglas UNK and norman UNK
well i mean i you know the let's have a discussion
i don't think it's not a not a complete you can't get a headline tories divided over rule changes
you know it's
i don't know it's an interesting
no i don't believe that
i think it's perfectly reasonable that the parliamentary party should have those sort of powers
and i'll tell you why i think it's reasonable because they would only use them seriously in extreme circumstances
doesn't matter if i'm not going to name any names but i mean i've seen some people who it's been suggested might stand two UNK of a flick of a finger whether someone of the sort that i've seen mentioned stood or not
you are you thinking of mrs theresa UNK there
i'm not going to i'm not i'm not going to be drawn into discussing the names of any particular person i'm merely saying it would be of no consequence
it would be a joke
erm anyway i don't think it's gonna happen and i don't think it should happen
let me make that absolutely clear
but nor do i think that you should somehow try to UNK the position of the leader of the party
in the extreme circumstances
cos otherwise i can tell you what the alternative is the alternative is the men in grey suits which is a equally arbitrary process and it can as actually concentrate power in the hands of a very small number of people o sometimes perhaps UNK of the parliamentary party
is john major UNK now
yes i think er i mean my own view is that he well er erm lead the party at the next election and he'll win it
er w i think there's a there's a desperately boring feature about the present political circumstances from the UNK point of view
and the more you stand back and look at it the clearer it is
every political leader of an advanced democracy is in deep trouble whether it's in america japan france germany or britain
they're in deep political trouble because the electorate is simply UNK from the messages they have to put over
for very obvious reasons
the electorate is going through a very difficult period
the economy has got huge problems associated with it
people's lives are UNK affected
so when a politician comes and says well it's gonna get better we've gotta try harder this is the policy we're gonna pursue
they're all saying it's not doing me any good
and it's not until that economic climate changes that people are l are able to relate to what the politicians say
there's nothing new in any of this i remember nineteen eighty one
but the media can't say that they can't interpret that because what they've got to do is sell to their readers a story which the readers want to hear
and so the media are constantly giving the impression that there's something that the british government should be doing
whilst there's a world economic UNK
not sure you can blame the media altogether i noticed you said there in almost these words er john major will the lead the conservative party into the next election and the conservatives will win
you said exactly that i quote word for word in november nineteen ninety and a week later what happened
you challenged mrs thatcher and brought her down
well it's interesting that er i mean these quotations get it must be very clever research
well you offered it
yeah well okay well i haven't i mean i did i did actually think that mrs thatcher would lead us into the election
er i thought that it was wrong that she should as everybody knows
er and i think frankly erm we won the election because she was not leader of the party
that was my view and still my view and i think john major fought a very distinguished campaign er against the UNK it has to be said
er i hope i did everything i could to help
as i did mrs thatcher
nobody worked harder in the nineteen eighty seven general election than i did
yeah but the point i'm making is that you thought that would happen then
you say it may happen it is going to happen now
why should we believe it now any more than we believed it then
well i mean there i thinking back i didn't think at that stage i hope i'm right about this th that i had any idea that geoffrey UNK was going to resign
i never had the slightest intention of challenging mrs thatcher
there was never my view and one day i shall if i ever get round to it i might set this all out
my view was
write your memoirs
yeah
in nineteen eighty six my view was a very clear one
to survive
i mean nobody thought i could do that
i mean not many people who'd UNK with mrs thatcher did survive
but i did that was my determination
john major is UNK with problems you wouldn't
yeah
argues that
in fact you said er again if i may offer you one of your quotes erm if you have back UNK who won't support you that limits governments abilities to take decisions
you said that a few months ago
since
yeah
then he's lost er you've lost another seat so his majority is even smaller it's down from nineteen to seventeen
so his er abilities to take decision are even er take decisions are even more limited now than they were then aren't they
he is in greater trouble now than he was the for all sorts of reasons
well no that doesn't follow
no
er what i said then was true
but it doesn't follow that he's in greater trouble now because
smaller majority
er no
it isn't a small majority in any serious sense of majority
smaller majority
it is only small because a very limited number of conservatives on the back benches are not totally reliable on too many occasions
and it tends to be i'm sad to have to say it tends to be a limited number of colleagues who are totally i think removed from the UNK of what the majority off us want to see who are to prepared to UNK their voted in the house of commons
and i think that there's going to come a point
d i think john er put this question fairly to conference if the tories want to behave like the labour party did then we'll pay an electoral price for it
i i'm not against i can't be against the right of a c of a member of parliament to UNK their vote from their government
i have done it on about three occasions in a third of a century
and i wouldn't change that vote and i respect people who are prepared to do it
it requires UNK and integrity
i'm not against that
but for the sort of college green psychology and the and the
for people who don't understand college green is the bit of UNK outside westminster where people rush out to be interviewed on camera
the dash the sort of headline dash out of the house of commons the moment the news breaks to get on television with some quick quote
and then to UNK one's vote as with almost a matter of habit and routine that cannot be in the best interests of the conservative party
and you have to realize none of us are there cos we've got happy smiling faces
we're there because the conservative party chose us and put us there
yeah but
and so we have obligations to them
but you're not there you're not in parliament to represent the conservative party you're in parliament to represent your constituents
i think you've got to just look at that constitutional concept
the constituency that chose you was the conservative party
that chose you
but you represent every individual in that constituency
the no you were chosen by the conservative party
you then stand for election
the reason why you're elected is because a sufficient number of people wanted a conservative government
now it's perfectly true they understand i hope rightly within the framework and philosophy of the conservative party that you have to respect the integrity of the individual
but it doesn't mean to say that you are sending somebody who says he's a conservative going to support a conservative government and the moment he gets there is to be found all over the place
yeah but if you feel strongly about a particular issue erm elizabeth UNK during the er coal pits erm dispute when she was very upset at what your you were planning to do closing down all those coal mines and she went public about it
she it was for her a matter of conscience
and she was representing the interests of her constituency
you're not saying she shouldn't have been allowed to do that she should have gone to john
no i'm
major quietly or to you quietly in some back room and said look i'm a bit bothered about this
no
i've made it clear i personally like virtually all colleagues at some stage voted against my party
i and that will always be a right and proper thing for a member of parliament to do
but it has to be done with great care UNK it is if you like a nuclear deterrent in that sense
and i don't UNK with elizabeth UNK who i like and admire and get on very well with
and actually have been to support on many occasions in her constituency
erm but i i'm not think of elizabeth as a matter of fact
and there are some colleagues who are today much more UNK with their UNK
and
and i mean you yourself you know during the UNK you left a cabinet meeting apparently mrs thatcher thought you were going to the loo and you went on television to say i'm UNK because i think she's got it wrong over UNK
she didn't think i was going to the loo
well so we were told
i dare say that's what you were told
it's
not what she thought
did you say to her i'm going out to re i'm going out and i may be gone for a long time
i if i remember correctly those are words that led to the death of a very distinguished UNK
i had no intention of dying the political death
er the erm er fact of the matter was that er as has been recorded by those less emotionally charged at that moment i didn't UNK out of the cabinet
i had made it quite clear
but you went on telly minutes later
oh there was a television camera as you left UNK street
you went to a press conference
er that was four o'clock in the afternoon
no i mean the i mean when i've g been drawn er down a road i don't intend to go
no because the point i'm trying to make is that it is unrealistic surely for the leader of the party to say to his mps who aren't delegates after all but who represent the interests of their constituencies shut up come to me privately if you have any concerns
that's not realistic is it
i think he said first to me privately
in other words you talk it through you try to resolve it
not dash for the television cameras
that was the point that i heard him make in brighton
and even there will come a time after the private dialogue where he people have the right
i let me give you an example i've always respected erm teddy taylor and john UNK who have taken the extreme view on europe
er i think they genuinely believe their case it's not a case that i believe but i i've always genuinely respected them for the case they take
er so i don't find it in my in myself to condemn people who as conservatives take a different view to myself
but there has to be a degree of discretion a degree of responsibility
and you cannot have a situation where the sort of almost the norm is any difficult decision the government is gonna have to take there'll be a dozen colleagues who say not for us
i mean i just do not really understand whether people fully realize the gravity of the economic situation that we face
we're gonna have a very difficult set of decisions to take they're gonna be tough there's no other government would take these decisions
and there is a division within the party isn't there a real ideological divide within the party over how to deal with that whether to raise taxes whether to cut spending further
well this is the what i keep reading about the right left divide
well i didn't use that phrase but
first no you didn't i mean no there's no reason why we shouldn't
er every party is a UNK
it consists of a whole range of interest groups a whole range of people with great integrity but approaching politics from a different point of view
and the only basis upon which you can l lead a party of that sort is to find a UNK th where you around which you can UNK
if ever you get to the stage where the left of the party or the right of the party either extreme wing feel that they've got such power that they can pull the whole thing their way the danger is that the bits at the other end will snap and that of course is the UNK danger which had absolutely UNK the labour party where the left did exactly that and the moderate centre that's if you can call it that UNK off
for the conservative party which is in essence a party of power huge historic perspective huge experience of power ever to get itself in a position where it's perceived to be struggling to the point of self destruction would have its political consequences and they would be dire
let's look not so much at the left right divide but at the tone of the party
some people say that since you've been away and the conference illustrated this quite dramatically particularly the fringe meetings
the tone of the party has changed
on europe for instance we've had er mr major telling the europeans to get the your UNK off our UNK
david hunt calling UNK a jumped up socialist UNK
that sort off the language the tone seems to have changed to have got harder
on europe first
well er i hear what you say i my views on europe are very simple
it's impossible to UNK the economic relationship we now have with europe
two th nearly two thirds of our trade goes with europe
i don't mind the sort of the use of language that gives this or that impression if that's what contemporary politics demands i'm as guilty of that as er the next man
but if we create a psychology in this country where to the men and women who earn the UNK upon which we depend our business community are switched off to the significance of europe there's only one people who'll suffer and it is us
and when peter UNK says for instance
i am not prepared to yeah yes but you will not get me to separate myself from my colleagues
half well let me let me finish the quote because well there are but well alright but peter UNK is saying is suggesting in a in a speech at a party conference that half the population of continental europe are UNK
i mean one wonders how that helps this kind of partnership
that you obviously think is so important
well i'm not prepared to become involved in er discussing the speeches which i didn't hear or er which may well be out of context or anything of that sort
i'm not prepared to do that
no but john frankly
oh come on you heard that
you know that wasn't out of context
it simply it simply doesn't serve a purpose for me to allow that division to open up
i will only use my words to describe my circumstance
and i know that whatever the rhetoric mrs thatcher used all the rhetoric nobody took us further into europe than mrs thatcher
all these regulations that we're now having to i'm having to with expert er help from my colleague er neil UNK having to look at and UNK do you know where they all came from
most of them came from the single european act
from the UNK agenda
that mrs thatcher
which mrs thatcher rightly committed us to and rightly UNK us through the house and it and it
right so we're to ignore all these things that we hear at the conference
there is no difference between the endless bad UNK between local and central government as one tries to blame the other
and central government trying to blame the europeans
the fact of the matter is every directive that comes out of europe comes with the agreement of the british government
that's where it comes from
it comes to us we have to put it through the house of commons
and often we are the people who UNK it and UNK it with all the UNK that are that are part of it
and do you know where a lot of the erm the directives from brussels come from
they come from british pressure groups who go to brussels with their particular case and argue in brussels to start the process of creating these regulations
alright let's lets look at some something else where people will say are saying the party has shifted clearly shifted towards the right
and that's social policy
erm and i know you i'm not expecting you to comment on your colleagues but let me quote something else that peter UNK said the massive expansion of the welfare state since the war has not been UNK by any UNK of social problems
any UNK of social problems
that's sending quite a signal isn't it
well i'd go further
they're worse
so poverty is worse
er not relative not relative poverty because obviously the tide of prosperity has brought up the living standards of er the western world
it's better not to have to have pensions than not to have pensions surely not
but look at the look
oh no oh no that th er i that is not in er what i was talking about was the social values er not the existence of the welfare state
that has i mean most of the welfare state has been er it'll either created or extended by conservative government so
but UNK achieved nothing
er no UNK did but he never intended to achieve what we've got
er i mean you will know that i wrote a book called no time for UNK in when i was on the back benches in favour of work fare
er i think that with three million people out of work we have an unemployment problem which creates erm a disadvantage group particularly in some of the stress urban areas where we have to look at more radical solutions to what is basically the payment of cash for nothing in return
now i have said that it's not government policy perhaps i'm stretching over the UNK of saying it but er those these ideas are around
but clearly what you have said in the past has led us to believe that you think self help does not solve all the problems the government now seems to be telling us
you can't how can how can you talk about self help solving all the problems when you've got an UNK population who'll never work again
i'm talking about people who are already retired
there's absolutely no point in saying to some sixty five year old or seventy year old who's living on a state pension in a council house what you've got to do is help yourself
what's it mean
so the government must help
the state must help
well what c what a what does the language of self help mean to a seventy year old living on a state pension in a council house
what does it mean
and unless you answer that question you're just UNK to people's emotions
now if you say to me this is i go back to my work fare if you're talking about the young kids of sixteen or who've left school haven't got a job and they say well i want my welfare benefit
you are entitled to say well okay we understand you've got a problem we know that there's an economic er difficulty across the world what are you gonna give us in exchange
and UNK would have been perfectly happy with that question
peter UNK wouldn't
well
oth alright i won't use the name peter UNK if you don't if you prefer i didn't
others in the cabinet would not
well s but why so why should
so many of those speeches blackpool
why should we be worried about the existence of a debate in a cabinet
i mean this is so n i remember i used to go to nato UNK er di discussions as defence ministers
and people would sort of say there's a division in nato
as though it was a crime
what was it was an alliance of democratic nations
if you can't have a debate there where can you
well if
if you can't have a debate in cabinet what's the point off cabinet
i y c yes debates in cabinet perhaps but we're not talking about debates in cabinet we're talking about speeches made at blackpool or at fringe meetings of blackpool which lead people to believe that the government is moving substantially towards the right
now that's significant that isn't just a this isn't just a debate about some vague ideological UNK how many angels on the head of a pin
this is fundamental to the way british politics is going
well you should y i er these la these labels are so difficult to fit because if you say moving to the right you then have to show me what policies the government is pursuing and you'll probably find that i either play the part in thinking off UNK arguing for them some years before some of my colleagues
well i'm talking about policies that haven't yet been UNK
i mean
sure
we've got we've got michael howard now talking about maybe it's better if er if the UNK children of single mums erm are adopted rather than stay with their mothers
well i mean that is i something that well to the best off my knowledge the government has not announced or taken any sort of decision on
but the home secretary is saying you know this is something we will think about
well i you'll forgive me the disadvantage i'm not trying to UNK out but the disadvantage of not having been immediately involved is that i haven't seen that quotation from michael
alright but if but you would not approve of that kind of language of that kind of er expression of government intent if that's what it was
i would i think that would be something that would be controversial
er i would like to k to know more about what michael is saying before i got involved in any discussion of that
and when mrs thatcher when lady thatcher talks about the thatcher inheritance that much more UNK being that much more secure
i have always been worried about the UNK of er what i believe is the great traditions in the tory party
i know i've worked for UNK heath thatcher we never had this UNK of the great traditions until very recently
and frankly i think it and i hope to god that john i d i know he doesn't want to see it happen to him i hope to god it doesn't
because it it's a i mean frankly it gives the impression that this remarkable political force which has governed a democracy longer than any other political f party in history has somehow or other created a new philosophy in the last ten years
mi
what have we been doing all this time
michael heseltine i'll have to stop you there thank you very much indeed
thank you
michael heseltine talking to me a little earlier today
and now to the government's plan to sell off british rail
before the summer holidays the house of lords carried an amendment moved by lord UNK a former conservative minister which allows british rail to bid against private companies for franchises to operate services
the transport secretary john UNK has been totally opposed to that because it would mean nothing changing in effect
b r would still run b r however as david walter discovered he may not have enough troops in the commons to reverse that amendment
the gatwick express on the fast track to the private sector
today this becomes the first railway shadow franchise its operations UNK off into a separate company ready to be sold
these plans are running to schedule the rest of rail privatization is not
the problem is lord UNK amendment in the lords last summer
that allowed british railways itself to bid for franchises something the original bill rules out
the government fears that it UNK the bill that b r with an unfair advantage over its competitors could keep lines like this in its UNK
but lord UNK has many fellow travellers in the commons
since we had the debates in june we've had the unfortunate experience er of UNK
which basically found it couldn't make a railway service run and dropped it
we've had the winter timetable which er proposes some quite serious cuts in services and we've had of course the constant UNK off fairs increases
so for all those reasons i think my colleagues may be more inclined to go for a cautious approach that's UNK in the UNK approach than they were back in er june
i think the government should slow down on all its activities at the present time and concentrate on getting the economy right and everything else put on the back UNK
and that should apply also w with the railways
there's no great enthusiasm in this country for railway privatization
the railways must be kept together say on the on the UNK amendment and they could raise money on the private market
but it keeps together the idea that they're going to broke up br broken up into competing er items worries people in my constituency and it also alarms me
tories who feel UNK about the railways may not have to push their protest to the point of voting against the government
a UNK defeat which he suffered at the hands of lord UNK in the house of lords has concentrated john UNK mind
and he's promised to look again at the case for allowing british rail to bid for franchises
the UNK have been conducting intensive negotiations with him behind the scenes
and they're hopeful that he will give way
UNK railways provide a model of the kind of system that britain could have if the UNK amendment stays in the railway privatization bill
this line winding its way between the isolated communities of UNK of UNK was one of twenty one regional railways offered for sale five years ago
a private operator won the first five franchises but after that the state company s j won all but one of the remaining sixteen
on this line they beat off two private sector competitors
this line goes to UNK seat of the regional government of UNK which had the task of UNK the franchise
they chose the state railways because theirs was the lowest bid
they gave them a three year trial period to see how attractive they could make the service
we had to see what happened to these railways er is more people going to er to go by train or are less going to go
and er we got the results now and er we more than doubled it
it's more than double as much people who is today going by train than before
UNK railways are among the world's market leaders
their pride and joy is the x two thousand a UNK passenger train that operates at high speed on conventional track
britain abandoned a similar project eleven years ago
in the five years since they were first subjected to competition UNK railways have UNK both their efficiency and their performance
some experts believe that british rail would respond to competition in the same way
it is possible to consider a situation where most franchises remain being run by groups of b r managers and a few franchises are run by private sector companies
the advantage of that would be that if the private sector does have things to offer in the way of better labour practices better marketing ideas then these will be copied by the b r system and in UNK it's quite evident that although very few franchises have gone to the private sector it has had a quite drastic effect on the way in which the state railway goes about its business
certainly UNK railways have taken to acting as UNK as any enterprise in the private sector
while improving the quality of their service to passengers they've cut their staff by thirty percent
since they were first expose to competition
the customers enjoy all the benefits of private sector efficiency from a state company
we have UNK the whole company and we are working exactly as a private company
and we have also done introduced the same working methods er as you can find er outside in the private industry
cos there are people in britain who simply don't believe that the public sector can be as efficient as the private sector
i think we can show that this is possible
er and as you said the only goal we had to start with was that we should turn the big losses into profit
this was going on
and this was just enough for us coming from the industry
in UNK introducing UNK had a dramatic effect on the state run railway system
the experience here suggests that a publicly owned operator can provide a better and more efficient service than private enterprise given the right conditions
and the same could apply in britain
at least a growing number of tory mps are coming round to the idea
the key question is how many conservative m ps are on board for the UNK amendment
the tory UNK are busy counting heads to work out whether there'll have to be a government UNK
for a start they can't guarantee the UNK be on the government tickets this time
the bill could create an precedent for irish rail from the republic to buy northern ireland railways
as for tory m ps some of them prefer to remain anonymous but on the record has now found twenty one members who've told the government they back UNK
on top of that there's the UNK mp george UNK who's likely to UNK on the whole bill
and there are enough tory back UNK who's names are in the open to force the government to compromise
i know that certain of my er west country colleagues er are UNK about the bill
i detect a very considerable UNK in the home counties
where as i say the railway is a very important issue
erm and i do not detect talking to colleagues say on the right of the party any great enthusiasm for this measure in the way it's presently er designed
so i think that er we are in quite a strong position
you only need a handful of colleagues with strong views er opposing an issue you immediately create a UNK
there's very little that the that the chief whip can do to avoid that situation
on a matter of importance but divided opinion like privatization
but i think there is room for compromise here
i'd be surprised at the end of the day if er we didn't find a solution that would enable john UNK to go forward
the privatization bill will probably have to go back to the upper house whatever happens in the commons
lord UNK has the right to stick to his guns and he's UNK to give in after the majority he won last time
his amendment was carried by thirty eight votes
they have voted contents one hundred and fifty not contents one hundred and twelve
so the contents have it
as far as i know the all the people who voted er for the amendment will continue to do so and a great many of those who voted against it and were quite UNK were not at the time a fully aware of what is proposed er may well change their mind
so i think the government would have quite a task on it's hands
there's certainly a lot of passion about this in the house of lords
er the house of lords is not a particularly UNK place but er nevertheless it is capable of strong feelings and er i don't think it expressed a fairly clear opinion on this occasion
er and i think it's likely to hold to it
back at victoria passengers who want to travel to gatwick now have a choice of fare
on the gatwick express there's the luxury price
eight sixty please
alternatively they can travel on the slightly slower network UNK for only seven pounds fifty
tory UNK argue that the UNK amendment would UNK this sort of competition because it would UNK b r managers from leaving the public sector to stage management buy outs
i don't think that i could ever support the UNK amendment the amendment in the house of lords which if i get it right would permit b r as an organization to bid for franchises
i don't mind managers getting together and having in a sense management buy outs
UNK up with private individuals to bid for franchises
but UNK you actually allow b r as an organization to bid i think it's making a nonsense of privatization because you're saying in essence there isn't anything wrong with b r management at the moment and we'll let them take over the network
and in that case why UNK
all the same mps from the right of the party are boarding the UNK train along with left wing tories
if john major intended the bill to convince the right of his radical UNK he may have UNK them
i don't think rail privatization has ever been really debated inside the conservative party
most people prefer privatization on the right of the party where i stand but it's not something that we get up early in the morning and actually pray for at every day
and i think at the present time all of us on the right are more concerned about getting the economy right and cutting government expenditure that carrying on with er schemes of a privatization that might or might not succeed
what do you think the position of the transport secretary would be in the house of commons if he was forced to drop what is after all a very major plank of his programme
well er they would er knowing the house of commons as we do there would inevitable be some UNK and some UNK of UNK
but i don't think go governments or ministers should be UNK by them
indeed i think that the present secretary of state for whom i have great respect and regard i think he would be very well advised to think again because i think that the temporary UNK that he would meet in the house of commons would be nothing as compared with the er the UNK that he will sustain later if and when things go wrong with these proposals
at the end of september a flight across the channel achieved a UNK victory on the issue of airline subsidies for the transport secretary john UNK success for his team on the railways bill may prove more UNK
a climb down wouldn't be easy
they've already spent two hundred million pounds preparing for privatization
but with the government under fire from so many directions the pressure to give way on the UNK amendment could be difficult to resist
i'm not sure about a u turn on a railway line more of a UNK perhaps
however now for the return of our resident UNK john UNK
so it's unity then
well only up to a point lord copper
returning from my UNK summer break i was initially almost as sceptical as the tory faithful at blackpool that john major faces a leadership crisis
and the UNK reception for his speech might confirm that view among the politically innocent at least
so might the way in which this week has gradually UNK margaret thatcher
a senior minister looking at the vast new platform which turned the winter gardens into a television set suggested that it really ought to contain a UNK for past leaders
ted ought to have been there years ago he said and now it's time for margaret to be UNK
we could UNK them as UNK
a bit chinese
i UNK
no he answered this is UNK worship just the tory variety
the crisis only seems to UNK because of UNK conference management and because tories have looked over the UNK and seen the disastrous consequences of UNK
at least some of them saw that
others on the right saw the UNK prospect of a kenneth clarke leadership
clarke himself believes the party simply couldn't bear another leadership contest coming so soon after the thatcher dismissal
tories are not much given to freudian analysis but one minister said the party remained UNK after the trauma of three years ago
the victor presumably ken clarke would be like a UNK or UNK into the smoking ruins of rome
but what if john major's party does badly in the european and council elections next year
this loyalist replied ah well if john were blamed for that he'd be in trouble
another major enemy said with UNK sadness that he UNK once the public decided a prime minister was not up to the job he'd find it all but impossible to UNK that impression
one UNK whether if party opinion remained against him major would like the more sporting of his UNK walk from the wicket even before the UNK finger went up
those who know him best think he's more of a fighter than that
the received wisdom is that if the leadership crisis does UNK it'll happen this time next year
meanwhile prospective runners move with studied UNK into the UNK
UNK the UNK hero of one nation tories
michael howard the senior right UNK now might not have as much support as the more philosophical michael UNK
two junior ministers complained to me of UNK ideological UNK in cabinet committee
when others urge caution for electoral reasons he argues that it's not worth being in government if you can't do the things you believe in
the minister himself recognizes this portrait but UNK in the political UNK he has as the treasury man on many such committees able to range over the whole field of policy
but UNK whose spanish name meaning the narrow gate is very UNK to a man responsible for UNK public spending bids would need a department of his own before he became a serious leadership candidate
UNK if the p m risks giving him one in the next UNK it might be a sign that his own confidence is returning
ministers and UNK are worried what the mood of their mps will be when they get back to westminster
most fears centre on whether the maastricht UNK and UNK like the UNK tony UNK
good afternoon mr
good afternoon to you
now you're going to tell me all about your experiences in the police aren't you
yes
what can you remember about your first week or when you joined the force
well i have made some notes since you j can i just walk down and get them i want this to happen i made some notes here
now i joined the force in june nineteen twenty three at ipswich and the force strength at that time was eighty seven which was one thousand no one constable per thousand population
now the training at that time was nil
yes
er on appointment like other recruits i had to serve the first month on night duty
the night duty was made up of nineteen areas they made the nineteen beats and er i had to go with older policemen learning each of the beats
often i had to learn two beats per night
i was always with an older policeman
yes
not often the same policeman and i gained that experience when i found the way that they were examining property the way they attended to accidents and street UNK and they were pretty tough customers and i learnt a lot
now that went on for a month
now the first twelve months of anybody's service is a period of probation
yes
during that twelve months you get extra supervision and at the during that period the chief constable is entitled to dispose of your service at a week's notice but after you get over the UNK period only the watch committee could dispose of your services the onus was on the watch committee
well now during this twelve months i went out on the beats etcetera i just merely picked it up if i was in doubt about anything my sergeant would put me right and the atmosphere the amount of discipline was quite severe for instance i always we had always to parade at least ten minutes before the hour to be UNK with what had happened since we were last on duty
yes
we had no facilities for food in the police station
we had to take our own meals at all times even when we had cups of tea we had to take to the station our own tea sugar and milk but there was always a large kettle during the winter months on a coal fire and during the summer months on a gas ring
the only thing given to us at all in that line was every policeman on night duty was given a pint of coffee
oh yes
every policeman was given a pint UNK and on night duty we were haven't we each of us was given one pint of coffee
to keep you awake
yes and erm no food whatever was UNK in the police station
when we arrested people if we arrested them and if they were in the police station for many hours the only food that they were given was supplied by UNK restaurant just inside street
now they were provided with a meal for which the police at that time paid sixpence and for the sixpence for breakfast they got a thick round of bread UNK a piece of cheese and a UNK of tea
for sixpence
now they got much the same thing for the dinner but if the prisoner had got any money of his own and if he cared to contribute an extra sixpence he got a hot meal at midday
yes
for his tea for the sixpence he got bread UNK and either a piece of cheese or some jam
that's what happened
and erm yes well now as i tell you we had no motor cars at all we had about fifteen bicycles which of course were UNK twenty four hours a day and after each night duty through riding over rough UNK and etcetera they used to get UNK and damaged
your own UNK
then the next morning they were taken for repairs at a garage in UNK park corner
he was the man who supplied the new bicycles UNK and he undertook to keep them in repair
and of course they got knocked about a lot
well now i UNK eye lamps that we carried at night they were merely UNK oil lamps
yes
and during the winter months we wore UNK and UNK
yes
we used to be glad to put our hands underneath the UNK onto the UNK eye for a little warmth
yes
well the er night duty was difficult
we had a lot of walking to do bicycles were only used by the policemen on the UNK of the borough
they had such a long distance that they were allowed to have a police bicycle
well now that happened all of this happened in nineteen twenty three
well now in nineteen twenty six we had the general strike and the conditions in ipswich were so violent that our borough police we couldn't cope with them and our chief constable he had to apply to the home office and he got permission to have men from east suffolk and west suffolk police cambridge county police huntingdon police sent some and they were UNK in hotels in the town centre
i see
and what these strikers were doing they got really out of hand they were UNK motor cars what few there were
they were preventing UNK from sending out flour from our two mills UNK and UNK
they just wouldn't let them come out with the flour
they the da the harbour master's men at the lock gates came out on strike
there was nobody to open and close the lock gates
yes
we some special policemen to go down there and open these gates and of course you can just imagine that the policemen who came into ipswich they were pretty rough in their dealing with the strikers
yes
we in the borough we dare not be rough because we had to remain in ipswich after the strike was over
and would the people they were being rough with know the difference
yes they got frightened
there was some policemen from cambridge county and they were UNK two brothers came among that little group and they each weighed over twenty stone these two brothers and of course everybody referred to them as the two UNK
yes
they were stationed at a UNK number two police station which was the custom house at the ipswich docks and they spent most of their time when they were off duty just lying on UNK lying about then of course evening time when there was er more activity course they came out and my word if they told strikers they were not to go to this part of the town or road
they didn't
if they were told they didn't go they certainly got some help
it didn't matter t who it was
it didn't matter if they were town councillors or what if these policemen said not this way this way and they said no i live this way they got a clip in the ear as quick as anything
the ipswich borough police couldn't have done that
yes
no
could the ordinary people tell the difference between the borough police
yes
and the county police by the uniform
yep no well they would have different cap UNK in the UNK
and that was the only difference
that was the only difference the cap UNK they all UNK you see
well now because we were in the ipswich borough police we were in the fortunate position of knowing that we would serve our full thirty years in ipswich which enabled us to buy our own houses through building society
our children had in they went to schools here and what with the friends and neighbours and former UNK we got on UNK well with the general public
yes
but when i talk about that good feeling between police and public it UNK more for the local policeman
for instance i was one of several born in ipswich you see and i had advantage over a lot of men who were released from the guards to come here
you see you take mr splendid policeman he came straight from the guards into UNK in ipswich
no
now when he became a detective he hadn't got the advantage of the local knowledge that i had
yes
but i was in a position to help him as i was his senior
that's right yes
and that was why he said and he's always said he UNK me such a lot
that's right
but he was such a UNK keen man
yes
i was only too pleased to help him
help him
oh er he was a rare worker
yes
and because he was only in UNK he felt in his spare time that he would come with us if we were visiting lodging houses or something
he would be glad to come with us
i didn't like taking his spare time
yes
now when i tell you about lodging houses we had four registered lodging houses in ipswich that they had at that time
pretty rough
and what exactly was a lodging house bed and breakfast or
no just a combination sleeping and combination only
yes
now the main lodging house in ipswich was afterwards taken over by the salvation army UNK
yes
but before the salvation army took it over it was a borough council property which was UNK to a f jewish company in london and they used to send a manager at this lodging house and these were then let UNK at about ten pence per night
i see yes
and all they di provided but there was a big kitchen where they could UNK their own food make their own UNK and so on but the UNK the house UNK they didn't provide any food whatever
they were required to leave their beds and get out of the UNK by nine o'clock in the morning and they were not expected to hang about any more until about five or more in the evening
so if they hadn't got a job they got nothing
oh no of course ver very few of them had got any work
no
it they were at these lodging houses because they hadn't got the work nowhere else to go
they was only they'd either got to pay for accommodation at a lodging house or go to the UNK they called them then which is the casual ward and at the casual ward they were required to bath on admission which a lot of them didn't like they were UNK to do certain work
yes
and they were often not released until they'd been at this casual ward for two days
now some of them used to find that a bit UNK
where actually was the casual ward
well which is now where the borough general hospital is at
was the casual ward part of the hospital
yes
i see yes
yes that was run separately
but part
but the same building
there was a half of the premises and the casual wards there they course i tell you they used to have to bath and then they used to have to do UNK wood and sort of work like that
useful work
yes casual work and when some of these UNK felt that they didn't want to stop there two days they used to tell the authorities that they had got promise of work at UNK and could we go soon you see
and of course the authority was glad to get shot of them and then the tramps they used to go round the country and they used to walk from one village to another and mainly people who had arrived in ipswich casual ward had previously been the night at UNK
they used to walk the twelve miles UNK to ipswich they used to go to the police station after five o'clock and they used to get a ticket which they used to take up to the casual ward
i see
now policemen we used to have to give these blessed people these tickets and we used to have a book and they just merely gave name age occupation which was nearly always UNK where and they had to tell us where they came from and where they intended going to and more often that was from UNK to or the other way round
yes
and we found that over a period of oh about a couple of months the same people almost used to come round
go round in a circle
they did nothing else
and we go us got used to them
we didn't like them coming in the police station they used to come into our parade room where our men were having food and you can imagine them coming in a bit UNK and so on
yes as i was going to say UNK
yes i mean you know they were not too welcome
then occasionally when we had houses broken into and so on if it was thought that a tramp could have been responsible it used to be a great help if we gave out nine tickets for tramps and only eight of the nine were admitted to the casual ward then we should clamp down of course on the one who failed to turn up
the reason some of them failed to go to the UNK ward is because they used to do a little bit of begging and if they'd got enough money they would perhaps pay to go into a common lodging house
yes
well now
you were telling me about the common lodging houses
yes well anyhow that more or less covers the early part of me being on the beat
well then
you were saying you had to visit each of those four lodging houses
yes
and i UNK you about the casual ward so you didn't really finish that
yep i'd finished the lodging houses they were rough my word they were rough they used to get drunk and fighting and of course they used to be amusing really they used to get fighting at a lodging house quite close to the dock and after when the windows was smashed we would find that they'd been temporarily repaired with a coal sack taken from the coal yard next door and all that sort of business and anyhow nothing particular out of the way happened until three years later of course when we got the general strike and the strikers used to meet outside the labour institution headquarters in street
yes
that's where the union headquarters were you know and because i was a local man and had worked at UNK loading trucks at the UNK i knew a lot of the dock labourers and they knew me and i used to know each morning what the strikers were likely to do where they were gonna hold up eastern counties buses and so on i used to know all that and of course the duty inspectors used to UNK send me along
to find out
to find out you see
well now it was largely i think as a result of all that three years later now that was in nineteen twenty seven towards the latter of nineteen twenty seven there was an opportunity for a detective to be appointed on a series of UNK
superintendent retired he was replaced by of course detective inspector
yes
sergeant was made inspector was made detective sergeant and of course i became detective constable
yes
and when the UNK were made before the watch committee i was the last one to go in and the chairman of the watch committee that was john he said to me chief constable has recommended that you be given a trial with the detective staff
he said we agree with that he said we have decided that you will go on the detective staff on probation for a period of six months and that means that if you like the detective staff and if the detective staff like you will continue
well now at the end of that six months i'd had varied success sometimes i had poor periods when i wasn't UNK much then i would have a little break do better but at the end of the six months nobody told me whether i was stopping there but twenty years later i did go back to uniform as an inspector
yes
inspector but anyhow now when i went on the detective staff i'd only been on the force just over three years
yes
and i i've felt at that time and since i went on too early
i don't really think at that time i would have had enough experience to justify going on the staff
i
they must have thought you could do it
i couldn't type we hadn't got anybody doing the office work in the detective staff the detective sergeant used to do most of it if he was not available i used to have to get an older detective to type a report out for me and because i was a junior they were not so careful in typing my reports as they were theirs
yeah
and i mean it was a difficult start and i was in fact a junior detective for five and a half years before any alteration was made in the staff there was no UNK or leaving so that as junior detective for five and a half years i got all jobs that nobody else wanted
unless if i was in the detective office on my own and there was a decent job reported i went straight out on it
sometimes i was lucky sometimes i wasn't for instance if anybody came to the enquiry after the report that the theft of a bicycle from outside the library
yes
our detective office was two flights of stairs above the enquiry office and they used to ring up to our office and say i'm sending a mr upstairs he's lost his bicycle from the library i'm showing him up
when he knocked on our door the older detectives wouldn't answer it
so guess who did
now my desk was not too far away after he'd knocked twice i used to get it
it was a hopeless job go to the library nobody would know what happened to bicycles and also we always circulated a list of stolen property to all UNK garage owners and cycle agents about every week
not only property stolen in ipswich but from surrounding areas and it was a long job
cycling in you know and of course because nobody else wanted the job sometimes we were supposed to share it with another and nearly everybody else except me would be too big you see
they'd all be doing something else
or that they'd got to attend court or something
oh yes
so i finished up doing the lot
well now although it was not much more of a job really than an UNK boy's but as i did that for five and a half years i got to know the people at the UNK the cycle agents i got to know them so well i knew the staff i got to know the people who were UNK clues and that regularly i was getting more information every year
so it did you a lot of good although
of course it did i was able to i was able to pick up and i used to clear up crimes which i know that some of the others wouldn't have cleared up at that time
mm
everybody liked to get in the UNK
yes
if a very serious offence was reported the detective inspector was well he used to go to deal with it personally because it was very important
if he found after two or three days that he wasn't really making much UNK he would then after he'd left the police courts say to me i think you'd better go down street or somewhere and see if you can find
see if you can find out who's spending money down that area and then a occasionally not too often jobs that he's fell back on and dropped i've been able to get a little start on and very UNK i used to tell him sometimes of the progress i was making that was where i made a mistake
that was a mistake was it
he used to say well now i'll come with you and from that time on after the UNK were made
who got the UNK
he got it
yes
oh my word and of course the more important the people the more he wanted it
that's right
but against that although i know that he'd took three or four very good jobs that i ought to have had but he was a very good detective a hard working inspector
i've taken UNK to the police station when i haven't been able to break them down and i've told my inspector exactly what's happened he's got the whole picture and then he's closed the door and called the man in closed the door
and if he was a man with who had never been in trouble before and perhaps with a young family and through being hard up and through illness or any other reason he would speak to him in a UNK manner
yes
now that you're in trouble i want to help you you've got children i've got children i know what the position is tell me what you got into and see if i can help you out
of course they would for a start i haven't done anything all that sort of business but he was extremely good and i think the reason that he'd got admissions quicker than we did was partly by virtue of the fact that he was the boss of the department
yes
that's what i really think as well but he was extremely good and i used to listen sometimes to the way that he interviewed people
get some ideas
and er yes i used to try and follow him as much as i could
well then of course i've told you about having these trials up and down and then out of the people i've dealt with mostly of them were local criminals i should think nearly ninety percent of crime in ipswich was committed by local people
we didn't even take fingerprints in those days
no
if a stranger was picked up in ipswich
with a long record we knew nothing about him
we used to send them to norwich take them to norwich prison with the request that they be UNK
UNK section in your own
oh no we hadn't
you had to take them to norwich
at that time we had we didn't have any UNK
no
but we knew all our locals you see we knew all their UNK
yes
but when a stranger was picked up for house breaking or shop breaking or something a complete stranger we used to send them to norwich pending further enquiries and with a request that they be UNK and of course they used to UNK send to scotland yard we used to then get the record if they had a record with a photograph and all their previous convictions
we hadn't even got a photographer
oh dear
you knew you knew your local criminals but you haven't got any pictures of them
no we hadn't we hadn't got a photographer
so when scotland yard sent us photographs of criminals that we were dealing with we used to have to take this descriptive form and photograph to UNK the UNK in plane and he charged sixpence to copy the photograph
goodness
it doesn't seem UNK
it doesn't does it
but i mean you just imagine we've got no cars no photographer
no
and er when i tell you that i went to the detective staff in nineteen twenty seven then we started with our first mobile help
the watch committee agreed that we should have not we the force should have a motorbike combination
now mr he is the garage UNK who used to supply the bicycles he supplied the UNK and UNK that was a start
the watch committee then this was what round about nineteen thirty perhaps then agreed that we should have a police car
now that car was bought that was kept at garage which was about quarter of a mile distance from the police station kept in the garage
who drove it
there were only two policemen allowed to drive it
police constable george and p c jack
and they had some experience or were they engineers or something
oh they had i must tell you now that at the time that we hadn't got a car at all on the occasion of a royal visit or some very important action being taken my chief constable used to hire a chauffeur driven car from mr of lane in ipswich
oh yes
he was a very smart man
and he always provided a very smart car and the first policeman to drive the police car was his own chauffeur who left him and joined the police force
i see well
so that er his former chauffeur joined the force p c he was in he drove of course our first police car well which he shared with p c then when our cars got to number two three and so on he eventually came up so that he retired as inspector traffic inspector
traffic division
he simply came up with the number of cars
traffic division yes
yeah
yeah
and er what was i going to tell you i told you about i talked about we had nine UNK shops i didn't did i but that we did have nine UNK shops in ipswich
there were six lodging houses were there
yes that's in addition to the lodging houses
means of communication
oh not very good
not very good at all
no UNK
no nothing like that at all
there were very few places in the town where we could use telephones especially at night
very difficult indeed you didn't like calling up people at a private house and ask if we could use the phone
what about post offices
so what they did eventually they put sort of call boxes occasionally in different parts of the borough so during the night you could ring up the station
you could ring up the station
yes
now i know on periods of night duty we had two fixed points
there was always a policeman on the
yes
and that was quite a good idea because late at night following wedding parties and other if anybody was behaving in an UNK manner and people were returning home they would always tell the policeman that they saw that a UNK crowd were coming along
further down the road
but they wouldn't walk a few yards into the police station and tell anybody
no
but they wouldn't take that trouble but they'd always speak to the uniform policemen if or if they heard anyone smashing glass but they wouldn't go out of their way
no i understand
but the relationship was extremely good i think that you might say that for many years in my service it was almost a case of the law UNK citizens in ipswich coping with the UNK
we got plenty of help
i suppose that's the best way really
oh we got plenty of help and of course it's always been said that you don't reveal a man's past until he's been found guilty of an offence but our magistrates were all local UNK you know
know them as well
and they used to know the UNK and when UNK allegations were made about any violence on the police they would know the policeman pretty well and more often than not they could tell whether a policeman might be of the type who might UNK anybody they knew the policeman very well indeed and my word if the policeman was assaulted in my early days he'd got to have a jolly good excuse not to be sent to prison
yes
the magistrates they if they were satisfied that it was i don't sound very
no
clip of the ear nothing like that but if you'd got a black eye
yes
and you'd got a little bit of plaster you could show the court the next morning he was going to prison
the magistrates would tell you that they were du they were going to do their UNK to pr to support the police at all times
yes
and i must get back now to
communication
communication yes so that we used to have the difficulty and we used to rely on the odd person railway people drivers and their guards they used to be knocked up during the night for early duty by call boys we used to make use of them if we wanted a message sent anywhere
you know anyhow
yes
but er we had quite a difficulty very difficult we used to have to walk a long way before we could get to a telephone
now you all had UNK did you use those much
oh we had UNK and UNK enough very seldom did we use them simply because there were other traffic about that time if you were a long way away er you might be nearly to if you blew your whistle there were nobody to hear you i mean people in houses and they were only few and far between
i don't hardly think that i can remember blowing a whistle
i don't really
yes
we have i told you about the policeman who was fixed permanently at the
yes
the town centre
there was also a policemen all night on bridge all night
he was relieved of course by the policemen from the neighbouring beats
was that because of the docks
yes that faced the dock and in case of fire or any emergency he used to always be there and he'd be able to see it
in addition to watching the dock there'd be a policeman on patrol at the dock
yes
but he would be fixed at the bridge
and people from the town centre who were going home to stoke had to go over the bridge
yes
and the if there was a street UNK or a UNK in the house everybody over there used to come to stoke bridge for the policeman
yes
and er we used to get all sorts of calls
supposing he got called away from his post would there be somebody ready to take his place
no if you got called away there wouldn't be anybody to take over until the next relief if the man was coming up the dock with two yo well you wouldn't be able to get in touch with him either
no
but if he was to come on at three o'clock in the morning the other man called away wouldn't be replaced
no
and er you used to get UNK for all sorts of things often a UNK family UNK
yes
i was called away one morning somebody came along to me and said will you come along to street there's a chap playing up old harry he's trying to build a shed or something and it's two o'clock in the morning none of us can sleep do come along with me
well i went along to street and this chap was UNK away and the people were UNK from windows and i realized the chap was mental
oh
oh i knew that night i was in a very difficult position if he had been on the public highway i could have taken him to the police station and taken him
i could have taken him if he's on the public highway i could have taken him to the police station
but not in his own garden
no and i had i er i had tried to appeal to him to be quiet he said well i've got to build this shed i said well it don't have to be during the night when other people are trying to sleep he said well that's up to them and he started UNK again while i was talking to him and then i kept on and on and eventually i think while i was talking to him i'd kept him quiet while i was talking to him
mm
and then i told
told his wife to get the doctor and that sort of business in but er imagine a man knocking up his shed during the night
he must have thought he was UNK
no
on another occasion
what would you have done with him if you had been able to arrest him
as he was mental i mean would you have taken him to a hospital or the station
no take him to the police station
yes
and then get your police sergeant
i see yes mm
and if he come along he would want to know who the man's doctor was
yes
so he got his history and then a magistrate can UNK him and he can be handed over to er what is now st UNK hospital
they used to call it the asylum years ago
yes
but they changed the name of it
well then while i was serving as a detective you can just imagine i made plenty of UNK and i got along reasonably well with most people but there was one man i hated yes i hated him i i'd only been a detective i should think for a period of about oh five or six months and a man he called on the reverend who was the vicar of st mary where
and this man said that he was a lay reader and that he'd retired he'd come back from australia and he though that he would like to help out in the parish
reverend thought oh yes he'd be very glad of you so he said i'd be prepared to visit the sick i'd do anything like that and he did in fact start doing some visiting and among other people that he called upon was a person living in road not very far really from where i'd been born and i knew the area well
yes
now he called at this house and said that he was er visiting for
for the church
and while he was talking to the woman he saw in the hall an elderly woman and he said to the woman at the door is that your mother she said oh yes she's with me now she used to live at UNK
he said well did she get the er UNK loaf
she said you never get anything here she said she did get the UNK loaf once when she was at UNK he said she'll have the UNK loaf now
and he went on just across the road to road co op and he bought a small loaf of bread which at that time would be about tuppence and gave the old lady this small loaf about ten days afterwards he called again he said he said i've come to see you again now are you alright and so on he said i've done a foolish thing this morning he said i'm responsible for the flowers UNK flowers he said and i've left my wallet at my UNK and my UNK has gone down to for the day
he said
con man
he said i'm properly on the spot so he so the woman volunteered she said well can i help you i've got my UNK rent money here so she let him have the rent money
course i don't have to tell you any more she didn't see him no more
he then went and called on a mrs who'd got a UNK shop corner of road and road and a hard luck story there he got a few pound for doing out the sacrament he got some money from her
and then when they eventually complained when other people were involved complained reverend he hadn't seen this chap either
his name was but i found he'd been lodging in a house in road close to the railway station
yes
and when i saw the UNK there she said that she did have a mr there but he'd left a few days ago didn't know where he'd got to
i said well now can i see his room she said well really i've cleared the room since he's gone but i found some papers in the room which indicated that he was a UNK on licence
yes
well that gave me a start of course so immediately i got a warrant out and he some while afterwards he was picked up in london
well they i had to go to road police station london it was quite good the detective took me around that little area and er then when i got ready to collect to take him to liverpool street station i saw him for the first time man about sixty one and he'd got two UNK one lighter than the other and while i was signing for him and his property i said to him you take that light one and i'll take the bigger one with the view to getting on the bus to get to liverpool street st but the inspector there was very good he said i'm not going to oh and i said to you take the light case i'll take the high one he said i can't carry anything i got a UNK
ooh
the inspector said i'm not going to allow you to leave here with a prisoner and those two cases
yes with both hands occupied what could you do
yes so he then called in a constable who was living in a section house nearby
he said now go to go to your section house get a sports jacket or something and go with this police officer he said i'll get a police van he said go with this police officer to liverpool street station he said and take charge of this prisoner while he gets a ticket for ipswich
very wise he might have disappeared
he said get that he said and go with him onto the train and see him safely in the UNK ascertain the time of arrival in ipswich and go and telephone ipswich police telling them that they were to meet this on arrival at ipswich and i thought that our chief constable really

patrick kelly who's forty one was also found guilty of attempting to murder one of the police officers who UNK the plot
p c UNK hall was shot last november in north london when he tried to arrest kelly and an UNK who were in a lorry which was found to be packed with more than three tonnes of UNK
the UNK of two UNK policemen UNK the i r a's attempt to plant the biggest ever bomb in the capital
on patrol in north london in the early hours of the morning they became suspicious about a seven tonne lorry
part of the number plate was UNK and it had been badly UNK
it was hardly surprising the two occupants made such a quick UNK when stopped
three and a half tonnes of home made UNK were inside needing only seconds to prime
the device was three times the size of the UNK exchange bomb and would have UNK buildings within three hundred yards
giving chase down a side road one of the policemen challenged two men
one of them pulled out a revolver aiming it inches away from p c ray UNK nose
he UNK and the bullet UNK his head
he felt a second shot hit him in the back and knock him off his feet
he survived to tell an old bailey court of his UNK escape
p c hall a former royal engineer who served in the UNK war before joining the police said he was convinced he was going to die
police believe patrick kelly was the driver of the lorry in north london rather than the UNK
he had an unlikely background for a terrorist
with convictions in england for gross UNK and UNK
although he was found guilty in dublin of UNK he was not a known i r a man
but he and the suspect who escaped were intent on repeating the UNK of the city of london explosion eight months earlier
passing sentence mr justice leonard told kelly the public needed protection from him
his bomb would have caused enormous damage and more importantly could have killed anyone in the area
the judge said p c UNK in preventing the attack deserved the highest UNK
er i joined the police five years ago with the intention of helping and serving the public and i think er last year i done it
and today the public have er returned their gesture in honour of me in the returning of the guilty UNK
what i done on that night was no more than any other police officer does or would do in the same situation

neil UNK b c news at the old bailey
a twenty one year old student has been cleared at the old bailey of UNK another student after a UNK christmas party
austin UNK went on trial at his own UNK because he said he was unhappy with the way the disciplinary committee at london UNK king's college was dealing with the case
cleared of rape austin UNK stepped out of the old bailey and stepped into an angry UNK of UNK and UNK fighting to get close to him
his case involving an UNK that he raped another student after going out with her has attracted wide media attention
almost UNK in the UNK he UNK everyone who'd helped him in the case
i'm especially grateful to my friends who supported me by giving evidence
mr UNK who's twenty one and the woman were students at king's college in london
the court heard how last christmas they both went to a dance the woman got very drunk and they ended up back at her room
the court was told she'd alleged she was unconscious when he had sex with her
but he told the court it was quite the opposite
she was not a dead piece of meat he said but very UNK in bed
she encouraged sex
UNK said that if at any time she'd wanted him to stop he would have done
the court heard the police became involved in the case at mr UNK
the woman student and king's college wanted the matter dealt with by the UNK disciplinary committee
but mr UNK claimed they wanted him to admit a lesser charge to get him out of the college quietly
he said he refused to accept this because he was not guilty of anything
the college were going to try the issue before a pr private almost secret little disciplinary committee containing UNK and students
and he didn't want that
he wanted it tried out in the open and for his name to be cleared
UNK and that's happened now
mr UNK tutor said the case was important because it dealt with such a sensitive issue
the key point to me was as soon as he said n as she said no he stopped
in my book that's not rape
and it seems not in the UNK book either and i'm very glad of it
moved by the UNK mr UNK mother said she was proud he'd taken the case to the police in order to clear himself
the family are now celebrating at a secret location
UNK b c news the old bailey
women's groups have responded UNK to the UNK decision to clear austin UNK of rape
and the case has again raised the question of what UNK consent to sex
scenes like this leading to brief UNK between couples who may UNK know each other can some say cause confusion about sexual UNK
is it reasonable for a woman to invite a man to her bedroom even to UNK and get into bed and still reserve the right to refuse UNK sex
it shouldn't be okay we're in bed together we're gonna have sex whether you want to or not
if someone changes their mind they have that UNK
er and if someone UNK someone might be getting into bed and not intending to have sex then that's fine as well
however others of an older generation say women should know the risks they take once they take their clothes off
the male sex drive being what it is the chances of his being able to stop are less perhaps than she realizes
there is a point for many men which they regard as the point of no return
and as i say if they are perfect men maybe they can take a deep breath and stop just like that
but some men can't
students at london university were almost unanimous today in saying a couple going to bed together didn't necessarily mean the woman UNK to sex
if the woman has asked him to stop if she has changed her mind and doesn't want to go through with the action o of UNK or whatever then the man should stop
everybody's very confused by it
most sex is probably nearer to rape particularly in one's early years
and we might like to give credit for and i think it's really hard to learn to read the signs
both parties the man and the woman should always be in control of the situation and if for some reason they want things to stop should have the authority and the power to do that
but some were less sure
i think if a girl got into bed with you er no clothes i think the intention to have sex is very clear
i'm against rape but definitely if a woman er goes to a man's bed then it's quite er sensible that if a man expects to have sex with that woman
simple as that
however social UNK say couples having non UNK sex goes back a long way
a practice called UNK was quite common in the past
with an UNK couple in a bed with a UNK down the middle
they'd just be in their UNK and er it's er there's certain evidence that they engaged in what we would call heavy UNK nowadays
some women say the old idea that a man is UNK past a certain point is absurd
consent from a woman needs to be gained at every stage during sex even once a couple are in bed
but others say that this definition of rape will undermine the progress made so far in getting the courts to take rape seriously
it was only two years ago that rape by husbands became illegal

the prime minister has again made it clear he has no intention of UNK plans to put v a t on fuel and power
during prime minister's questions
the labour leader john smith UNK the government to abandon what he called these foolish proposals
but mr major said extension of v a t was a vital part of policies to reduce public borrowing earlier the prime minister UNK over a cabinet discussion of the options for next month's budget
the UNK discussion was UNK by deep uncertainty about the strength of the recovery
views UNK on how much any increase in taxes could threaten the move out of recession
the most UNK remarks seemed to have been made about the health of michael heseltine who was making his first appearance at the cabinet since his heart attack
the prime minister led the welcome there were UNK of hear and a ritual UNK of the cabinet table
the chancellor kept his cards very close to his chest
he UNK to wait until the last moment before making the vital decision on taxes
mr major told the commons that the recovery does seem to have taken root
and he made clear that despite the government's small majority they would be prepared to take difficult decisions about how to reduce the enormous government deficit
the reality is that we need to cope with the UNK deficit and we have the courage to do so
the labour leader opened up an autumn offensive against the extension of v a t
does the prime minister have the UNK appreciation of the overwhelming UNK throughout this nation to imposing v a t on domestic fuel
in addition to its obvious UNK is there not now evidence that the governments tax increases UNK consumer confidence and any hope of a recovery
in these circumstances will the prime minister now abandon these foolish proposals
well i think the er right honourable gentleman knows for both i and my right honourable friend the chancellor have made the position quite clear that the extra value added tax is a vital part of our policies to get public borrowing down but that we will be offering help to people who are vulnerable
if the tax madam speaker is as UNK as the right honourable gentleman claims then why did the labour conference vote and i quote for a general shift in taxation towards energy resource use
what is that other than vat
the UNK of the v a t increase was a key factor in the liberal democrats victory in the UNK by election
the government's majority is now down to seventeen
getting a tough budget through the commons won't be easy
john sergeant b c news westminster
the chancellor's team of independent economic advisors the so called seven wise men have UNK him not to do anything in his budget next month to damage the recovery
they've called for the gradual introduction of tax increases balanced by a reduction in interest rates
the chancellor's plans are always the subject of intense speculation as budget day approaches
at the conference of town planners today he expressed the UNK for most of it
strong UNK that i'm about to tax everything that moves and doesn't move
and this has er been an experience of every chancellor before
er most of the accounts of what i'm discussing er are pretty well near fiction
er a and er they will certainly remain secret until i produce my budget
but the UNK reflect merely what everyone knows events are UNK to make this budget a particularly difficult one
the chancellor's major budget headache is that the government is fifty billion pounds in the red
to reduce that borrowing figure he could cut spending
but the overall expenditure total for next year has already been agreed and it's unlikely that much more could be UNK from it
that leaves mr clarke with the option of raising taxes
but higher taxes mean that consumers and businesses have less money to spend
and that could damage the prospects for recovery
in their UNK yearly report the UNK panel of independent advisors express concern about the economies UNK
they're against large tax increases next month
instead they want to see a more gradual approach backed by a cut in interest rates
we do think that there is a need to increase tax receipts further over the medium term from nineteen ninety five onwards by about one percentage point of g d p about seven billion pounds
but we do not think the chancellor should raise taxes much next year because the recovery is too weak to accept that
figures out today suggested those fears about recovery are well founded
consumer spending appears to be slowing
the panel believe lower interest rates are needed to boost UNK demand
but they think the chancellor will have no choice but to increase taxes in the longer term as the economic climate UNK
the message to the chancellor is a clear one don't tax now tax later
but he knows that later means closer to the next election
and while it may be economically desirable to raise taxes then it might prove politically impossible

inside the walls at UNK gate the shouting could still be heard as the queen was presented with the key to the city by the mayor of UNK
those opposed to the queen's visit had demanded that she be refused the honour both here and in UNK
it was an uncomfortable affair the mayor used it as an occasion to condemn what he called the turkish occupation of the north of the island and douglas UNK looked on clearly anxious that the whole thing be wound up as soon as possible
the chaos continued as they reversed the queen's rolls UNK for a quick departure
her press secretary looked worried
as did her driver

he was UNK as well
the queen emerged to more UNK but finally forced a smile before she was driven away
elsewhere in UNK there were several UNK and in one incident police fired tear gas to UNK a crowd
it was a day in which the queen was anxious to leave the past behind and to the end she made a point of meeting UNK soldiers who form part of the u n UNK here

a doctor who gave cannabis to her sick daughter has been cleared of criminal charges at liverpool crown court
dr anne denied supplying cannabis
she said she gave it to her daughter because she believed it was the only drug which could help UNK her condition
she said she'd been following a higher moral law
the trial lasted a week
dr always UNK that she wasn't campaigning for the UNK of cannabis
for ten years anne who ran a g p practice from her home at UNK tried to UNK her daughter taking cannabis because she thought it would do her harm
the court heard that lucy who is thirty three has suffered a serious and UNK illness for thirteen years
eventually her mother became convinced cannabis could help after reading evidence from doctors in the united states
the UNK family priest says the conflict between medicine and law put a tremendous strain on the doctor
as a doctor she would be i in the dilemma of trying to give her daughter something which er is not allowed and yet as a as a doctor she could UNK other things for other people and here she is as a mother with her own child in her own house unable to do anything very much for her
it took the jury less than an hour to clear dr
what she did she did clearly for the benefit of her daughter who was UNK as any normal natural mother would in the circumstances
what are you going to do now

two men who ran britain's biggest UNK gang have each been UNK for twenty four years at UNK crown court
the men UNK and UNK headed an international operation UNK drugs worth and estimated fifty eight million pounds
two UNK were also UNK for their part in the operation
the supermarket chains UNK and UNK have applied to the high court to try to stop the opening in this country of an american style warehouse club
UNK is due to open a club at UNK in essex next month and is able to cut prices by keeping overheads low
it's classified as a UNK but the supermarkets say UNK should be subject to the same planning rules as retailers
this is the development that's UNK britain's supermarket UNK
a huge warehouse that's UNK completion at UNK in essex and which offers the kind of discounts already enjoyed by millions of americans
like this boston store warehouse clubs are open to members only and though they're pitched at businesses individuals can join too if they can show they've a steady income and pay their thirty dollar subscription
for that they get access to anything from food to car tyres
mostly well known UNK at up to fifty percent less than they'd pay elsewhere
i need to have three of four hundred dollars because before you even get through the store you just buy
i believe that the large supermarkets have had it too good for too long
they've had tremendous power in the market place with no competition
american supermarkets have hit back by cutting many of their prices and printing more money off UNK
they save this woman over twenty pounds a trip
like our own UNK they stock a much wider range of goods than the UNK but experts say supermarkets in britain should be worried if the clubs do take off here
unless they dramatically change the way they do business they're going to have problems they won't go away certainly
i mean people are always going to want to want the convenience of er driving to a nearby established supermarket but their profit margins will decline
but the big three supermarket chains deny their high court action is to kill off UNK
they say they simply want clubs to be subject to the same planning restrictions they face
they're promoting themselves to a very significant extent on the basis that they're selling at cheaper prices to the public
that means in my book that they're er doing UNK
er if they're retailers then they should er comply with retail regulations as does any other UNK in the united kingdom
UNK has already put in a second application to answer some of the criticisms
but supermarkets have UNK that they may challenge that in the courts as well

UNK growing speculation that the treasury wants another billion pounds cut from britain's defence budget ministers get a UNK warning against UNK grave damage on the effectiveness and morale of the armed forces
the warning came from the all party defence select committee whose conservative chairman said the country's defence capability had already been UNK to the bone
the fears were repeated by conservative back UNK in the commons this afternoon when the defence secretary announced a number of measures including the UNK of a new nuclear missile for the r a f the selling of UNK and devonport UNK and a new role for the reserve forces
mr UNK was opening a two day defence debate which labour said was being rushed through before cuts in next months budget
labour's defence spokesman david UNK said any reductions should be justified on defence criteria not on a passing UNK of the treasury
defence workers turned out in force at westminster a reminder to the government that if its determination to UNK spending means cutting the defence budget jobs as well as the armed forces will suffer
these royal UNK workers know that much depends on an UNK order currently frozen by the treasury
inside the commons the defence secretary malcolm UNK wouldn't be drawn on his battle with the treasury
only making this coded appeal for the armed forces not to be left too stretched over too many tasks
the white paper that was published some months ago indicates i think very clearly the kind of commitments that we have and the way in which we are meeting those commitments
clearly any UNK of future policy has to look and look very UNK and UNK er both at the question of the commitments that our armed forces have er and the best way in which we can carry out those commitments
these are matters on which it is quite proper that there should be an ongoing er debate
but the opposition accused mr UNK of rushing today's defence debate because everything UNK on the public spending settlement to be announced next month
the truth is they're rushing through the debate because they know that in the budget the next month the chancellor will announce further defence cuts
and i emphasize it'll be the chancellor it will be the chancellor making the announcements and not the defence secretary
in his battle with the treasury mr UNK won valuable backing
a report on the royal navy by the commons defence committee gave a dire warning of the impact of the cuts already under way let alone those that my be in prospect
the mp said the fleet is too small to defend britain's sea lanes in war
a potentially fatal threat to the country's long term security
even as they gathered their evidence the defence committee members knew they had no power only the hope of influence
so their intention is to warn fellow mps and the public of the dangers of cutting the armed forces too far
i hope that people will sit up and take notice of it
defence isn't always at the top of the political agenda and in periods of long time peace as we have now enjoyed people tend to forget the dangers are still genuine and still there
and what message do you hope to carry to the treasury by this report
hands off our defences
mr UNK seen here in bosnia needs that support to resist a treasury threat to cut another billion pounds off the defence budget
in each of the next three years
defence committee members believe the government must decide on a foreign policy first
our investigation UNK that we're continuing to ask the armed forces to meet a series of commitments and all the time we're reducing the resources available to them to meet these commitments
i don't think that makes any kind of sense
we must get a balance between commitments and resources and we'll only get that when we have a full scale review of britain's defence obligations both present and future
one decision was clear today the r a f will not now be buying a new nuclear missile
this french system was one UNK for a weapon that would have cost two billion pounds
a rare defence decision not to be controversial
david UNK b c news westminster
UNK the plan to sell off the UNK and devonport UNK mr UNK said that privatization would benefit the navy the UNK and the yards themselves
but union officials say they're worried that the sell off will lead to more job losses
the decision to sell off the yards come nearly four months after devonport won a contract to UNK against competition from UNK
for two years UNK and devonport UNK fought a bitter battle to land a five billion pound contract to UNK britain's UNK
devonport won but UNK was promised surface ship UNK contracts as a UNK
since then both yards which are run by private firms under contract have announced hundreds of redundancies
devonport workers thought today's announcement is bound to add to the uncertainty over their future
yeah we had five hundred er a couple of days back and i would think there's probably another five hundred or so to go
with this shock news as well there's going to be a lot more redundancies which has got to be bad for plymouth and the economy of plymouth as well
but managers of d m l the devonport management firm were optimistic about the future
there would be a short UNK period er it would have to be UNK but from where we sit we're going to actually submit a bid that sees off the competition
local unions were less enthusiastic about how workers would be affected
this is really UNK the bottom of the barrel selling off the defence related industries of our country and i don't believe the people of this country will be prepared to put up with that
once both yards are in the private sector the danger for UNK is that devonport UNK by its secure base load of UNK contracts will be able to UNK the scottish yard for surface work too
there has always been the issue of is there actually enough royal navy UNK work to keep two UNK in full employment
erm do we need two full UNK
now from an economic point of view you probably don't
for some years the naval UNK have been operating in a UNK land
halfway between the public and the private sectors
but there's no clear idea of what they will be worth or how many private sector UNK there will be
meanwhile for the workers there's added uncertainty about their future
UNK b c news
the queen has arrived in cyprus for the commonwealth conference to a row over a series of UNK thirty years ago
her visit has UNK memories of the UNK bloody struggle for independence
UNK nationalists say the queen should have stopped the UNK of nine UNK fighters arrested during the fight for independence
the queen flew into UNK airport and was met by the greek UNK president mr UNK
she will be here for a week and her visit is already UNK in controversy
over the past week small groups of UNK have highlighted the hanging by the british of nine UNK members during the fifties
they claim the queen refused to intervene and as a consequence she must be denied the keys to the cities of UNK and UNK
the demonstrations have been small but memories of british rule here are still vivid
in UNK museum pictures of british troops when they tried to fight off the UNK
these UNK guns were used to kill more than fifty british soldiers before the republic of cyprus was formed
today this greek UNK author is in the eleventh day of a UNK strike
he's calling for more street demonstrations when the queen arrives in UNK tomorrow
but more importantly for the republic of cyprus shaped by the late archbishop UNK the conference will concentrate minds on the division of the island
it is a recognition that er the republic of cyprus is clearly one entity despite the attempt made by the turkish UNK side to declare a separate state
it is a recognition of the UNK of the republic of cyprus
the president of north cyprus UNK said the conference locations was a bad idea
well i do say that er this is merely an encouragement of the greek UNK side to continue in its er policy of to be the government of cyprus at our expense
they should not have done it
this evening attention centres upon the hotel in the u n UNK zone which UNK
where there was to be a meeting between the two presidents and douglas UNK
the greek UNK got wind of an idea by mr UNK to meet UNK on his own and they say that would be an UNK act
greek UNK anti terrorist squads meanwhile concentrated their minds on UNK for any hostile threat to security here
as the UNK over the queen and the conference continues

health officials in UNK are contacting more than seven hundred women after UNK that the doctor who carried out UNK tests on them had not used the correct procedure
the UNK family health UNK authority says it's known about the situation since may nineteen ninety two
but the doctor's stopped carrying out UNK tests only a week ago
seven hundred and forty four women patients at this surgery in UNK are being UNK for new UNK tests
four have yet to be UNK
their g p UNK had been using a faulty technique for the past five years
UNK family health UNK authority admitted it had known what was going on for more than a year but action was taken only after a patient contacted them
we to say was aware of the practice in may of nineteen ninety two but i am not clear er as to what took place at that stage because we haven't as yet looked into that
doctors carrying out a UNK test should use an instrument called a UNK to open the UNK to ensure that they can see the UNK when taking a sample with a specially shaped UNK
but dr UNK failed to use a UNK
in this case dr UNK did not do that and he took the sample by using his finger and a UNK in what you might call a blind manner and doing it by feeling
so the sample may not have been complete er and once the sample was taken one could have lost some of the material
although the risks to patients are small not surprisingly some visiting dr UNK surgery were anxious
i'm quite shocked
they're professional people i mean they don't really explain to you what they're doing
even though it sh they should
this is the latest in a series of clinical errors which have UNK the national screening programme
last month more than a thousand women in birmingham were UNK after a nurse was said to be using the wrong type of UNK
earlier in the year laboratory errors at a hospital in UNK led to twenty thousand women being UNK
officials in charge of the UNK screening programme say women should not be UNK from having tests although they couldn't rule out more mistakes
we will see maybe some more of these
we'll UNK got to keep on getting it in proportion that ninety nine percent of them have been done right and that's as to the seven hundred tests in out of four point five billion is very small numbers indeed so the vast majority of women can be UNK
health officials in UNK are now investigating why firm action wasn't taken earlier
to prevent a g p in their area UNK national guidelines with the result that hundreds of women now face the distress of further testing

british UNK network UNK which covers many of the most heavily used routes in england has announced fare increases from january UNK six percent
some fares in scotland are also going up by six percent
the rises are between three and four times the rate of inflation
rail passenger groups say they're disgraceful
fares in other regions are due to go up in may
network UNK carries passengers three hundred and ninety million passengers a year more than half the total for the whole of b r so although off peak increases have been UNK at four percent today's announcement affects huge numbers of UNK
it'll hit travellers as far apart as exeter peterborough and king's lynn
on some lines season tickets will go up by eight percent
the cost of an annual season ticket between cambridge and london rises from two thousand three hundred and forty to two thousand five hundred and twenty eight pounds
between london and brighton the cost goes up from two thousand on hundred and seventy six to two thousand three hundred and eight
b r says such rises were inevitable given the present state of its finances
we've got a two hundred and thirty million pound gap to make up and just to put this into some sort of context the fares will give us slightly less than fifty million
so most of our effort is actually going into reducing our costs
we're UNK that network UNK is seeking to put up season ticket fares by up to four times the rate of inflation on some lines
that just cannot be justified er by the quality of service being provided
the fare increases would have been bigger but for the governments last minute intervention
even so faced with a possible back bench UNK over privatization of railways the latest increases are embarrassing
the prime minister and every member of the government wants to hold fare increases down to reasonable levels and i'm pleased that er at six percent average that's a reasonable contribution by the travelling passenger on british rail and london transport to the enormous investment sums that are required
next april b r will be split into twenty five separate businesses and lose control of tracks and UNK
but however it's divided the financial dilemma will remain

west midlands police have formally cautioned a UNK for stopping his car in the fast lane of the m six to change a tyre
when the police arrived to rescue the driver who'd parked on a blind bend of the motorway he'd explained that he hadn't wanted to risk UNK his tyre by driving the extra distance to the hard shoulder
the entire incident was captured by police video cameras as liz UNK reports
the UNK had been travelling UNK on the m six near the walsall and wolverhampton UNK
he decided to change his flat tyre in the fast lane on one of the UNK of motorway in europe
as dozens of cars UNK to avoid him some just UNK missed UNK with other vehicles
the scene was captured on police cameras and watched in UNK by officers at a nearby control room
motorways are dangerous enough place at the best of times
to actually stop on the hard shoulder is very dangerous
but to do it in lane three to get out and change a tyre is beyond belief
that particular stretch of the motorway is in is very busy where he stopped was just round a fairly blind right hand bend and traffic was approaching that at their normal lane three speed and they were faced with a stationery vehicle
a police car finally arrived at the scene and officers spoke to the UNK
he told them he'd stopped in the fast lane instead of moving to the hard shoulder because he didn't want to UNK his tyre by driving on after a UNK
the police had to UNK their patrol car down lane three to try and warn other UNK of the danger
a policeman then had to bring the traffic in all three lanes to a UNK while the UNK and his passenger crossed to safety
the police simply cautioned the man but they say that with so many vehicles having had to break and UNK it's a miracle there wasn't a serious accident

the time is six seventeen and still to come the pop singer george michael goes to court to try to get out of his recording contract
he says it's too restrictive
plus hundreds of jobs to go as euro UNK troubles continue
one of britain's most successful pop singers george michael has asked a high court judge to declare his recording contract null and void
he says the contract with UNK music is too restrictive and the company takes too much of the profits
even if he loses the case the singer has said he'll never record for UNK again
this case if george michael wins could UNK the music industry by increasing the independence of artists
he claims the great record company he signed to as a UNK has become part of a giant electronics corporation
and though his contract has been UNK he wants it declared void and UNK
contracts like george UNK can last a professional lifetime the artist gets the security he UNK early in his career but hands over the copyright and much profit from his recordings
he's had a series of UNK with UNK which his counsel says was unhappy when he wished to play down his sex symbol image and didn't put its back behind promoting recent UNK
it's gone to it's got to a stage where he made that statement which he very much means he will never ever give them another album of his to market worldwide
but that could mean that he never UNK again if he loses this case
his attitude is so be it
central to the UNK case is what his q c mark UNK calls the unreasonable UNK of the contract
which has now run for five years and could continue for another twelve to fifteen years until he's supplied the remaining six UNK
but UNK is expected to argue that this contract has moral and legal force was freely negotiated and is of a type common in the industry
george UNK counsel told the court that UNK has made worldwide profits of over fifty two million pounds from the UNK recordings whereas mr michael has made profits of over seven million pounds
an UNK of seven to one
but he said that this case is not about money but about the contract which effectively it's argued is a restraint of trade
the court heard of UNK that vary widely between countries and of a UNK deduction for packaging in excess of the actual cost
but the big record companies say they need elaborate long term contracts to invest in new talent
these could be threatened
if george wins erm a lot of artists are gonna be looking at their contracts and erm those that are signed on similar terms will no doubt want to er UNK
george michael will be giving evidence and the case could last till christmas

britain's so called special relationship with the united states has come under strain after president clinton claimed that britain had let america down by not backing its policies over bosnia
he made his c his remarks in an interview with the washington post
today UNK thatcher who formed a close relationship with president UNK while in office said any breakdown in the relationship must be UNK
lady thatcher wasn't making the point but others were
when she was prime minister relations with the united states and in particular he personal contacts with president UNK were far more special than they are now
and as she took part in the publicity drive for her memoirs she stressed the importance of close ties with washington
whatever is wrong now between the americans and europe and especially britain it must be UNK
the anglo american UNK relationship has done more for the defence and future of freedom than any other alliance in the world
soon after president clinton took over after talks with john major he claimed a continuation of the special relationship with britain was not in doubt
but serious trouble UNK when his secretary of state UNK christopher tried to get UNK approval for lifting the UNK arms UNK
britain and france refused to back the plan and in the washington post at the weekend president clinton complained the french and british felt it far more important to avoid lifting the arms UNK on bosnia than to save the country
john major told me he wasn't sure he could sustain his government is he agreed to american policy
UNK christopher was even more UNK
western europe he said is no longer the dominant area of the world
it's no secret that we had UNK with the british and the french on how we should best approach the issue of bosnia
we had one position the british and french had another
er in august er at er at nato we managed to resolve those and get a combined position
the foreign office were also keen to stress that this was old news
officials insisted relations with washington were now excellent
but a former official who had been lady UNK senior advisor warned of the dangers of america turning aside from europe
in the future we've got to keep the united stated engaged in the world
it's got to go on playing a world role
it'll be the more willing to do so if britain is alongside it
of course not on the same scale but there helping supporting
the government takes the view that president clinton was simply addressing domestic critics of his foreign policy and that his complaints shouldn't set the alarm bells ringing
but the incident has drawn attention to the fact that since the collapse of the soviet union europe with britain as UNK main UNK can no longer expect to be guaranteed a place at the centre of united states foreign policy

euro UNK is cutting nine hundred and fifty jobs from its workforce of eleven thousand
the company says that most of the losses will be in administrative and management positions not among workers in the companies paris theme park
it's the latest UNK for euro UNK which has been losing money since it opened eighteen months ago
the UNK hasn't quite worked this side of the atlantic
ever since UNK largest theme park opened eighteen months ago it's been UNK by financial problems
at the start they had over fourteen thousand people working in the park after today's announcement they'll have just over ten thousand
and then there's the problem that visitors to euro UNK are UNK the shops
UNK to spend their time on the attractions
unlike in america where much of the revenue comes from spending on UNK and in UNK
and there were cultural UNK too
this summer UNK finally UNK and allowed alcohol to be sold after they realized that the french were not interested in eating if there was no drink on offer
as the french UNK went up so did the cost of visiting euro UNK
and then came UNK worst recession since the war
the park has tried to repair the damage by cutting prices at the gates and in the hotels but visitors still complain it's too expensive
i think er when you go to the hotels it's UNK
the hotels are very expensive
i think it's er i think for the summer not for the winter
here it's very cold
and the empty car parks are a testimony to that
it can only get worse as the long winter UNK ahead
on a freezing october monday like this the visitors aren't exactly UNK through the gates
UNK had considered closing the park during the winter months but instead they're offering a whole package of cut price deals
it may not be enough to save them

a new type of television service that allows the UNK to select videos on demand is causing friction between cable television companies and british telecom
the cable companies fear huge competition from the system and the hundreds of new uses for the domestic television sets that are being developed
our media UNK nick UNK reports
it sounds like the stuff of science fiction but soon you'll be able to order up concert tickets while watching television using your set just like a computer
to see if there are any tickets available you click on the arena
it's called UNK television
huge amounts of information can now be compressed UNK and sent in both directions along television UNK
so you can play along with a television quiz show using a handset like this or shop from home
already cable television companies have installed their telephones in place of british UNK in more than two hundred thousand homes
telephone television and computer technology are UNK and high tech companies are UNK for a slice of the action
b t's developed a system for sending television pictures down telephone wires
it hopes to use it to run a video on demand service
you ring up order a film and it's played down to your television set almost immediately
but b t has yet to prove it works in practice
i think a lot of people are getting too excited about a technology which is which has been UNK up by people who wish it would happen rather than prove it can happen
at their annual trade show today cable companies expressed alarm at the prospect of competition from b t there's a government ban on the phone company sending television pictures over its network but the regulators believe the ban doesn't cover video on demand
the government's quite happy with that
i think it would be very foolish of er of the government to stop that kind of er innovation that kind of er research going forward without knowing what the end results are going to be
meanwhile cable companies are pressing ahead to develop their own black boxes which will turn the humble television into a UNK communications centre
nobody knows quite what services the public can be persuaded to buy or how big the market may be but nobody neither the cable companies nor british telecom wants to be left out

the next national news is the nine o'clock news but from moira stewart and from me good evening
any plans
well i obviously want to try and attend meetings if and when possible er i've been to one last week which basically was er because i don't feel i'm qualified to get up and david got up and spoke very well actually he was always at the police not neighbourhood watch er to do with the UNK telephone system which we found out afterwards after a three quarters hour debate a man came up to dave afterwards and showed him a memo which said this UNK system has now ceased in november nineteen ninety two and that was the abuse on that particular meeting
i do intend to er to attend UNK meetings with each of the c p o s er with a view to looking i mean obviously at some stages you said to me that i would probably have to attend at short notice
mm
probably by going to these meetings i can pick up the be best practice for ideas which can be passed on to the others
if anybody hears of any neighbourhood watch group meetings i think make sure paul knows about it so he can attend where possible
yeah
like him to go and look at the one at er the at er which seems to be a successful one
well i went to the last week and i did say that i'd like to go to that one i'll go to as many as i can
yeah
what i would like and i'm sure it happens with the previous c p o er and i have been notified by telephone and i keep saying to them let me know but i would like probably a memo from each c p o to say that there is a meeting on this particular night
do you mean UNK meetings
well an any meetings really because i think if i can er show my face at these meetings it might er i mean i think whether or not it's because of the increase in burglaries or whether it's because of the publicity via david we seem to have had er a hell of a lot of er enquiries about the schemes
more than normal tracy ain't it
yeah i think so
yeah
okay er
it's amazing that he's
what you saying that for UNK how long you been saying that for
yeah i know but there has ain't there you know but i say that and i live in an area where there's not a neighbourhood watch scheme and i ain't setting one up to until i retire
as crime goes up people see it as a way of protecting their property don't they
yes
seventeen per cent of reported crime is up
mm
erm may i make a comment on neighbourhood watch i went to er a job the other day it was a theatre i was off duty and er i got UNK on the shoulder by my local neighbourhood watch co UNK who said nine months ago i resigned i wrote a letter to headquarters i wrote a letter to the divisional commander and i wrote a letter to the local constable and nobody's replied to me and they still keep sending me papers are you gonna get your act together now i have brought this up before we never ever have let a neighbourhood watch scheme lapse it's nothing to do with you this is all before you came
no
er we just kept them on and there's i know quite a few schemes have stopped working but we've still got them written down somewhere
probably now we started it might be well worth while g getting rid of some of these schemes that aren't operating
are you saying then that when one's UNK for six months or over a given period of time we should actually go out there and remove the signs
yeah
well that's one of my next questions because i think it's UNK either way a lot of people and i'm finding this just want to be in a neighbourhood watch scheme to take advantage of insurance er and also to have the sign up once the signs are up and they got insurance they're not bothered and you can tell that by the er UNK of the conversation on the telephone
the other the other thing is i've discussed this with c p os as regards the signs if a scheme UNK then we take the sign down there are arguments for and against
no
say UNK or nay at the moment
no
but if the UNK left up surely that's erm
deterrent
towards crime prevention on the other hand it might make some people realise that if they're no longer a scheme then they don't get the er the
yeah
once a co UNK retired or resigned who do you actually communicate with to find out if the group wants to continue playing
well it should be in the file and i asked for this and keep it before me when a scheme is set up a we have a map which i must have sent out letters
em
i've received very few replies so the signs can be UNK and b either a deputy co UNK or the UNK that should come in now some UNK a lot of them don't
right well let's find one or two of these schemes that appear to have UNK send some letters to the names in the file if we don't get any positive response within a couple of months let's go and take the signs down er and then wait for the UNK
we'll do it ourselves although the council are the only people who can put them up anyone can take them down
all you need is a pair of wire UNK
wire UNK and we'll have them down have 'em back here and they won't be wasted cos although you can't use the UNK again we're always short of UNK because of damage cos you can regularly replace the UNK but not the UNK
well we can buy UNK or always order some more UNK if that's the case
yes
it'll also if we start to take action UNK somebody else to take over the schemes
well that's right
at the moment nobody's interested
but i think we need to prove that we've actually UNK with quite a few people to say that if we don't hear from you in two months then i'm afraid the scheme will lapse
is that down to us or should we notify the division to make contact
no if we notify the division after the end of it
we can only write to people we know it might well be twenty out of thirty houses wanted
well
i think you'll find but they might be more up to date than mike
well then in that case let's send a copy letter to the local station
i think so
for their information
i intend o go through all the files in due course i mean it's
well
it its a big task em er the thing is that i think that the first point of call is one is that we get the questionnaire out and see whether you know the one where can we can the questionnaires to all the neighbourhood watch is it w we prepare the questionnaire and we get on and send it out right
depending on the replies from them in relation to those that have UNK we then send a second letter to them saying is there anybody that will take over the scheme if not right we intend to remove the signs from the er from the area and then if there is no reply to this letter within fourteen days we you know we'll come and remove the signs
i think there's a lot of them
that UNK will bring out a couple of dozen schemes that have totally UNK and people will write UNK letters saying i've told you this once before
mm yeah
so great let's communicate with any other UNK and say if you're not prepared to take it over we'll close the we're afraid the scheme will have to close down
and
and remove the signs
and any claim and please inform your insurance companies
and depending on the area we'll give a photocopy of the map and derek will fetch 'em in derek can take them down
who'll doing
no
we have that many er applications i mean i've just gone through a division and i've got er a pile of cards literally an inch thick with people a made an initial inquiry or b they've been UNK with questionnaires and not been returned so i'm sending those er right through the divisions
mm
that's the task of the moment in between the everyday work
mm yeah
then of course there's this insurance thing to do as well when david's er free and sorted out
yeah well it's a lot of that
yeah at least we'll end up with a scheme that's up to date and accurate
yeah
well we could also from that by photocopying the er the addresses erm and sending these letters out we might well get updated on the schemes anyway
that er a scheme isn't operating
what about
UNK of the system to come back to us every twelve months if no contact
eventually yes
eventually yes
i think we only want to be on the mainframe so that the divisions can access details in the middle of the night
i think we still have priority at the moment to computers in effect paul is going to
we might as well
i still think we have to have the system as such perhaps not so UNK but certainly keep the file probably with the bits in
we might cos you won't be able to put maps and things on them
eh
but certainly the main co UNK er
almost like the burglar alarm you just have scheme head co UNK you know deputy co UNK number of UNK and that just a basic so you go in
we don't want really is street co UNK because
no
that'd be a UNK task
if you have somebody like somewhere like that
i'm not talking about that i'm now talking about UNK but it's eight hundred properties it's a small village but there are twenty seven street co UNK so you know
erm yeah so say all you need is just access to that field so if they do change you can just
at the moment you do i take it you're recording people who sort of ring up say i'm interested you send out a package to them you record them
yes
i would think about giving up that send the package out and forget about them
well this is something i've just done myself
yeah
but i mean you send the package out and you get a phone call er it's mr UNK and then you get card out and then you send him the questionnaire it's merely a record UNK on the form but
it's i can't see any other way to do it at the moment i mean probably when i
yeah
think about it but
i mean you don't start a file at that stage do you
no just a card in er a pending tray and that's it
so you know who they are yeah
er a sheet of paper for tracy to get the initial erm out and then they just go through the system
and you also get sometimes two people off the same street
well that's it
it's just a reference they want you mr smith two doors away
well i've had one for UNK or UNK
oh i spoke to her yeah
yeah i've had three applications all for the it's only a small village albeit it's spread
and that's a
you know for the er village
well have you spoken to sergeant to UNK all the paperwork and
yeah
and incur any additional expense
three farms and there's only te ten properties altogether in about two hundred yards
but they're building some more aren't they building another seven
building some yeah building some massive houses there
and a happy UNK as well
well that's it
do they include that in the scheme some of them on the rate i won't bother with that anyway it's not our problem
yeah
okay anybody
i've got one i meant to put on the main agenda and i forgot and i wrote the agenda
i've been offered the opportunity by er bob in training er in force have taken this on er the tactical unit have taken it on the chance of er one day erm assessment or appraisal training at erm probably at exeter for those of us that do it and erm i think that perhaps with the way that the UNK way that our UNK spread out the proper ways of assessing people which i've never been shown how to do and i don't think many of us have
erm i mean he it sort of went through our staff inspector wise and er paul was sort of chatting and he wasn't being UNK he said yes they'll be UNK because it's a long time since you've had er any training like that
what about civilian staff i have to assess my staff i haven't had no training
yeah
right yeah
i also said that erm my i expressed that the fears that i expressed at this meeting last time about er the fact that paul and i now UNK civilian staff er which i've never been sat down and told what the civilians term of contract are and what i can or cannot say or whatever so erm i feel it will be quite valuable and brought it for me to see if anybody think it's worthwhile pursuing
a one day appraisal
yes it's a one day
just write it on a memo form paul and send it round with a circulation slip and those who feel they want to get involved put their name down probably the quickest way of doing it
right things are on hold though with assessments aren't they at the moment cos they
aren't they always don't they change every ten minutes
i ain't got time to do assessments let alone a one day course
yeah that's true
i think that your two waiting for signature on his desk
you haven't seen mine have you
well why do you want one you've just bloody had one
no it's derek
first time he's said anything nice about me i thought i'll get in while i can
derek it won't last
right anyone else want to bring any points up
took me took me about bloody two days to do your last one
stuart is having a social event on the eleventh of march for the media and the police i'll circulate this round with a er slip on it erm it involves a conducted tour of the police station and some bits and UNK

mm
couldn't find the keys anywhere
well they were hung up on the board in o s d on friday when i went down there
which office
in the a in the
no you know you know as you're going down the corridor before you get to the doors to go down the next set of stairs i mean in o s d the last one is er for the p c that does all the man er you know all the duties and things like that and in his office there's a great big board with all the vehicles on and the UNK hung up at the end and who's got 'em out and the bottom one is that green van because he went up and picked 'em up when i was there
i was coming to david
tomorrow morning if it's still there

you have to wait until all the transit vans are out and double parked put it across the transit van UNK
so nobody can get in at all
mm or their UNK
let's throw the keys away
i was saying to david this morning there was a on the police that was good
probably terribly naive
oh it says something like j r green a number which doesn't exist and any UNK could have the name address type of trade and a real phone number
course they would
yeah
you could change the signs quite regular though couldn't you
UNK and UNK one day and er butcher the other
quite easily
throw some paint over the back and everything paint running out the back
mm yeah
detail like that
hear that
rubbish really not our problem anybody else want to bring any points up
no
we've got dates for the meeting i've got two suggestions one is that i can't see any point UNK why
here
and it's to one
yeah here
better headquarters
yeah where
s thirty one if we book it in advance we can get in s thirty one downstairs in the canteen cos we're only an hour and half two hours meeting
yeah
we can be finished by quarter to twelve
good idea any items of agenda for sergeant who will be organising the next meeting in s thirty one

hang on
he's on holiday
bloody right
the meetings
coming for comments like that
there's an s l o's meeting on the twenty eighth of march
oh good i'm in UNK

mm
yeah
i mean i think the thing to do i mean we most of our lot are within the corridor what we need to do is get headquarters find out when the rooms free and ring everybody round

s thirty one is it

okay
are you ready
oh
right
okay oh no i've got to be able to
okay
okay
yeah it's running now
it's running
mhm
mhm
okay mr UNK thank you for that information erm
yeah
tell me what arrangements have you got your with your employer if you were on long term sickness
erm well i'm in the scheme the company pension scheme and i think they give er i think it's six months' full pay and six months' half pay
right
so have you got any after that
er what after the twelve months has gone you mean
yeah
no
no i thought erm the state will er will cover us then as far as well cover me anyway
mhm
do you know how much the state pay is
erm i think it's about two hundred pounds a week isn't it
erm no you're just a little bit out there actually it's fifty six pounds and ten pence
no
no we've had er because this was erm a of erm concern here that we felt you know what's gonna happen after the twelve months and i'm pretty sure we had a circular round that said we would get two hundred pounds a week
i'm pretty sure
can you tell me where you actually got that information from
from our wages and salary department
right
and have you got a copy of that
er i haven't unfortunately no but i'm pretty sure it said two hundred pounds a week
right
well the actual state er the statutory sick pay is fifty six pounds ten pence per week erm it is no more than that but i would be interested to see the leaflet that you actually got from work
but are you sure of that then
so where so how do you know you're right and i'm wrong
well that is the that is the erm the government guidelines that are actually set down and that's what they pay out is fifty six pounds ten pence per week
yeah
and that is UNK it wi it will not change
mm
and erm obviously i mean that is only for employed people as well
mm
and er it depends on whether your national insurance contributions
right
yeah
well i felt sure it was two hundred pounds a week
no fifty six pounds ten pence per person
mm
okay well i don't really but then carry on
okay
if we can go on to what you think you would need in the case of long term sickness how much do you think you would need per week to get by
to get by
mm erm ooh how much would i need
i suppose well my salary basically
as much as i'm on now i would've thought
okay
your wife do you know what your wife's cover is
erm well she has got a small policy she took out with
but what about the employment arrangements
erm i think it's on a similar basis to er to ours a similar sort of six months but i think it's er roughly about the same yeah
okay
well it's either three or six months but er it's similar to what we have but i know she took her own little policy out
right
and in ca erm in the event of long term sickness you reckon your wife again would need salary
erm yeah i suppose you could sa yeah i'd say that yes
okay
you say your wife's got erm an insurance policy to er to cover for long term sickness
yeah she has yeah
do you know the details of that
i think it's with sun alliance she took it out with
okay and er do you know what the benefits will be paying
it wasn't a lot not a lot erm i think thirty pounds a week something like that
do you know if there's a deferred period of payments
what's that
right what that is erm usually when you take out erm health insurance cover the payments will be deferred for a specified period of time that could be four weeks eight weeks it could be six months twelve months so the
oh right
payments would only start after that deferred period
right i think it's about twelve months i think it was
okay
okay and do you know whether it's erm a level term or whether it would be increasing term
whether it would
what does that mean
be she would get the same amount paid per week or you can have the increasing one where it would increase erm in line with inflation
i think it's level i think the benefit just stays the same cos the cost hasn't increased it's been like that for oh she's been paying round about twelve pounds a month now for as long as i can remember
so i'd assume all things being equal that if the premiums are the same then the benefit doesn't er increase
okay
when does that policy UNK do you know
er when she's sixty i think
when she's sixty
okay what about yourself have you got any health insurance
well the thing being you see i mean there's no illness in my family i really don't see the benefit to be honest with you
not at all
sorry
not at all what
you don't see the benefit of insurance
no not really no i i'm UNK and UNK erm there is no history of illness in my family my father my grandfather lived till he was about eighty four i've never really given it much thought
the wife's a bit different but i you know i see no need
okay if i could just give you a brief a small diagram okay
mhm
just to explain this is well i actually find this the easiest way of actually describing erm the needs of a health insurance
right
okay
and if i can take this as this being your okay and you've got this thirty thousand pounds a year coming in
right yeah
okay
just looking at yourself not taking your wife's salary into account just yourself
yeah sure
and out of that thirty thousand pounds what do you have to pay out
monthly
well everything
so
mortgage
you've got your mortgage and your
bills er holidays UNK card erm car running the car clothes er what else
well
food
ah yeah well yeah food i suppose yeah to a degree entertainment holidays have i said holidays have i
yes
oh yeah
going out we like to enjoy ourselves you know we live our life to the full
quite a bit i suppose
so and then entertaining and your social life
yes yeah a fair bit yeah
okay
what about your children
i mean plans for education
erm mm yes i suppose we should er we should cater for their needs yeah i suppose private education
okay anything else that you can think of
that maybe you pay out on
UNK i suppose
that's all i can think of to be honest with you
okay
if we can just look at that now and all
yeah
of those come out of your annual salary of thirty thousand pounds
right
okay
well for the first six months if you were to be taken seriously ill you would
yeah
be okay and all of these would still get paid because you would get your full salary for six months
mm
that's right yeah
after six months you would only get half your salary so this would then go down to fifteen thousand
bearing that in mind which of these do you think you'll have to give up
your UNK been cut in half
well knowing the wife none of it erm
well i suppose erm
your social life would go first mainly
yeah okay yeah cut down the entertainment that's not cut down on the clothes we wouldn't buy so many expensive clothes i suppose
i don't know perhaps not eat so much rich food
might do me the power of good lose some weight
so that would UNK
yeah i suppose so yeah
but even so i mean fifteen thousand pounds it's still a fair bit to live on
it is but bearing in mind the lifestyle that you've got now you've got a very good lifestyle
yeah
yeah okay yeah
holidays
yeah i might need them more mind you but yeah i suppose holidays would have to go yeah i'd go along with that yeah
okay
if we just take those so basically what we've done is we've cut down all the UNK in your life
mhm
and the things that we're left with are all the bills
UNK
that you have to pay out
okay
take that a step further after the end of twelve months you then lose this fifteen thousand
yeah
and you get fifty six pounds ten pence a week which proves to you
are you sure on that
are you absolutely sure on that
i'm UNK yes i am
cos then cos we've been mislead
i wouldn't mind seeing the information that you have on and i'll
mm well i'll dig it out for you
and i'll certainly look into it for you
right
er to see where the actual statistics were go were got from
cos we were working on about eight hundred pounds a month which is i dunno maybe ten thousand pounds a year which
yeah
i agree okay on my lifestyle isn't enough but i didn't think it was of any concern because i thought well okay so what are you s what are you suggesting then
well if i can just draw your attention to that figure now just concentrate on that figure
yeah
and we've already given up the UNK in your life the two nine one seven per year which of these will be left to be paid
erm well the car
you want to keep the car
oh i see so what are you s well what i'd
the car would go
the education would go
well the insurance would have to go as well as i couldn't afford to keep that going
would that pay the mortgage
no it wouldn't but er we could go to the d h s
and they help with the mortgage is that what you're saying
mm it's a possibility well i mean it's not it's not an option i'd want to explore
mm
but nevertheless it still exists
and again with the bills that is another option with the bills
mm
well they wouldn't cover them all but erm i see what you're getting at
okay
if i can if you can just concentrate on that figure now
mm
i mean ideally you wouldn't want to have to go down to less than three thousand pounds a year
not at all
okay
not at all
and the other side of it is that obviously you don't want to be going to the d s and asking for erm state benefits either
mm
if possible you want to avoid that so you don't want to and you certainly don't want to leave it until a time when you have been taken sick and you can't do anything about it
no
you certainly want to look at doing something now before you actually get taken sick
mhm
yeah i'll go along with that yes
okay
so if we can just look at these again
mhm
look at the things that you would want to cover
yeah
and how much do you think you would need on an annual basis
well i spend everything i earn so i'd say a hundred percent of what i'm on
okay
if you were to take out erm health insurance cover
mhm
okay which would be an option to make sure that you didn't have to resort to this three thousand pounds a year
mm
the maximum that you could be covered for would be seventy five percent of your annual salary
right
which is twenty two and a half thousand
now on twenty two and a half thousand bearing in mind that you wouldn't have the costs of going to work erm your travelling expenses and everything that you would occur in work you would most probably be able to keep all of these
mm
and your standard of living
right
okay
i mean the exercise that we've done is purely working on your salary
mm
i mean why can't i have a
which is
hundred percent of it then if this is so good
well what they do they make sure that you're not better off when you're not working than you are working
oh right
so the maximum that we can cover you for is seventy percent of your annual salary
oh this is the government then laying that down is it
that's yeah
oh right
so it would be twenty two and a half thousand
okay
so do you agree with
yeah i agree yes fine
okay so if i can just go through what i've just talked with you about
you agree that come twelve months er of being out of work
yeah
you will have a great shortfall er of earnings
yes
going back to the six months one erm where you've fifteen thousand
mm
do you want to
no we can get by on that
okay
yeah we'd get by
so you you'd manage on fifteen thousand but then after the twelve months you'd most probably want to go up to say seventy five percent of your earnings
yeah that's it
okay
will i still get the state benefits state benefits
what would happen with the state benefits you've got thirty two and a half thousand
mhm
okay
we would take the state benefits of just less than two thousand off that
right
okay
and the remainder is divided by fifty two and that would be your weekly salary
okay yeah
that makes sense yeah i'll go along with that yeah fine
okay
okay is there anybody else that you would need to talk to about the recommendations that i've just given to you
no i don't think so
no
so you're happy with everything that we've discussed today
yes i am yeah
okay
well what i will do is i will go back and put a proposal together based on what we've talked about today
yeah
and then if that's okay with you i'll come back in about two weeks' time and
okay
talk to you erm and just explain about everything and the benefits that you
right okay yeah
would that be okay
yeah sure fine
okay
but if i can just go back to where we were talking earlier erm and i asked you about anybody that you may be able to refer me on to
mhm
okay
have you given that any er any thought
er not to be honest with you no i haven't
okay
but you mentioned earlier that you played tennis and erm and a and a lot of other sports
mhm
and you mentioned your partners that you played with
yeah
do you think that maybe they could benefit from this idea that you've been talking about today
i don't know i wouldn't be in a position to answer for them to be honest with you
right
but would you mind me giving me their telephone numbers and i could ring and ask them myself
i'd rather i didn't to be honest with you
okay
i think i'll talk to them first and if they're UNK then i'll then i'll pass them
well i'm coming back to see you in two weeks' time so could i maybe get the information off you then
i'll see what they say and if UNK then yes
okay
but if not
okay
right if i can just go back to erm i've lost my place now
just do the needs
okay
right we'll stop there
thank you
right
right
that was very good joan
excellent
erm the ex er ex exploring the needs was er was very good excellent
i mean he initially didn't wanna know and then you went on about er and came up with the idea of well i'm very fit the family's fit never have any problems health wise erm the o the only thing there you i don't think you actually mentioned possibility of accident
no
or accident that was that was
yeah
the only thing but i mean you know you accepted what he said and then went on and by using your picture with the with the cheque i mean you had him eating out your hand at the end didn't you
erm went through and got into take out all the things you have to do away with and so on
erm as far as his sort of doubts as to as to what er what the actual state benefits are i'm interested to know what the answer is to UNK overcome that one unless you actually got a leaflet with you know the
well i did ask him sorry i'm not supposed to talk
no but i say i think you know i is it may be well worthwhile us carrying around leaflets which gives an idea of what the current limits are but yeah we'll find out about that
erm i thought you summarized the needs very well and got that over
erm permission to proceed and product recommendations you went through
erm you spoke about the second appointment and say you were coming back you didn't actually arrange it but you spoke about it
i did say in two weeks' time
yeah that's right
i'm sorry
erm yeah that's fair enough
it's hard not talking
that's alright
erm as er you went on as er as far as referrals were concerned and the objections that were raised you UNK really and went through and overcome those and at the end of the day you got the you got really what you er what you were aiming for that er to get him to speak to these people between now and the next appointment so you could er you could come back
erm you didn't actually get as far as anna i don't think did you
no i didn't
but so that's where er where it got to but you know the structure of it was excellent
erm the on the only bit of information i got down there is as far as the maximum limits are concerned i don't think it's a government i think it's an insurance company agreement actually of seventy
oh is it
five percent
yeah i don't think it's actually
oh right
a government but all insurance companies really come up with much the same thing so i mean that's purely for your technical information rather than anything else
but er no i thought it you know it went very well the use of your little pictures as i say excellent
mm
william
in the pictures that was er that was one thing er i was quite happy with
mentioned the d s and i think you could've disturbed him more do you really want to go down there and be means tested and er that'd be a possibility er to disturb him a wee bit more
er bearing in mind they've also got eight thousand pounds of earnings and so the eight thousand pounds of earnings they've got to use that up er savings sorry savings not earnings er before they can actually get means tested erm and there's a s a sliding scale between three thousand and there
referrals er he was UNK it was two hundred pounds he was gonna get so there was an opportunity for referrals at the end from people that work with him
i mean you mentioned the tennis club which was great you know you went back there but you know that was a wee thing to pick on depending on the company
yeah
that er martin worked with
erm i wasn't quite certain of the wife's p h i there was something about twelve months and she was getting a hundred and thirty pounds er i lost it because i was looking at the clock at the same i must confess but erm
where have you got this eight thousand pounds savings
no that's
d s
oh yeah i it's alright i thought it was on
so that's a d s
form and i'm thinking
no d s
did i miss that
that's just information i
yeah i mean the part about the er about the savings erm if UNK done or were doing a complete fact find that would come up anyway wouldn't it
mm
oh you'd identify that they've got to use their savings first
yeah
before they can even qualify for anything
so i mean er i think one of the points we raised earlier is that there are there are bits of information which we either assume or are missing so on that
ron
er yeah well all those things er and i thought the diagram was marvellous and you sort of to start with you were thinking ahead to doing this diagram and you could see that that's what you were waiting to do and then once you did it you were up and running
that is the diagram
yeah i know
then you was up and running
and then it sort of you lost your track slightly with the referral side
i know
at the very end i
instead of sort of going over and saying what a marvellous job we did here er and then saying yeah fantastic
