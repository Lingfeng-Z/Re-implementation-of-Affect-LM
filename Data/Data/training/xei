it's alright she can't keep quiet ron we're not laughing at you
oh sorry
saying fantastic erm and then you can say look as it's been of some benefit do you remember what i said earlier
mm
you know because you sort of lost she lost her track going in to that on how to get him back into the referrals
you know she went straight in for it without sort of seeing how well
that's right
anything else
no that's basically it and the other points that you've covered of course
but erm yeah okay
martin
right yeah erm not much more to add really i sum er summary of needs i think that's okay and you explored and UNK quite well the picture was good and all that i could see where you were coming from
the two hundred pounds per week was in fact my misunderstanding it's two hundreds pounds per month just roughly fifty quid a week that's where i got it from
erm but you're gonna come across some people who are UNK of themselves
mm
who say well no you are wrong and not being UNK but so some men like that
er i think you UNK it appropriately and have sales aids with you
mhm
and we do provide you with sales literature to say well actually strange to say but it has gone up recently it is only fifty eight pounds a week
and then that will just let me down ever so slightly yeah
but you did come back and you had the figures to hand
er but what i become i thought you might become more UNK but you didn't so you dug a hole for yourself that you could've dug out of you sat in there but i think you handled that quite well but there are people like me out there who think they know it all and will have a go at you
erm didn't say you'll go back and work out a plan of attack for me or did you
i did actually say i was going to put a plan together for you and come back in two weeks but i mean
the second point was that yes you mentioned it but it wasn't really arranged
the first was a good attempt but yeah you missed UNK or confused then there could be several others i felt you could've picked up that would be highlighting the second appointment that carried the whole process through
mhm
erm when you that you intend going back to plant the seed how have you found today's been some benefit etcetera and
but i thought good structure control overall painted pictures well erm and i think perhaps just probe a bit more just a little bit stronger than you are at painting pictures but as you see a picture UNK a thousand words
mm
to try and explain that verbally would be very hard
yeah it would
and you just you can't mentally cross them off keep a picture in your UNK eye of what you've crossed off
yeah so well done
and the fact that your wife is erm there was something that could've possibly been done for your wife and that is something that maybe i would've mentioned at the end do you think this would of be any benefit to the wife only as maybe an ending statement or something
mhm
possibly
maybe so maybe so
yeah well done
it's your turn now
or have you said all you want to say
erm i don't think there's much i don't think there's that much more to say actually other than erm i didn't i missed the erm the employee link completely i mean
yeah
i didn't until bill mentioned it i missed it completely
mhm
erm but er i think when you say about being UNK there's if you've got a client in front of you the last thing that you want to do is have erm a UNK with them
yes i agree with you
you know you just want to sit back and er as far as i would think is to keep calm and say well i am right you know erm but without being too UNK in that way because then that would put them off
mm okay
so erm i don't er i wouldn't see the point in being too UNK over an issue like that
yeah
as long as i know that i'm right er and say well i'm quite willing to look at the figures that you've been given but these are the figures that are right but i will look at them erm and i and i certainly wouldn't er UNK it much more than that
right
i think
i don't know whether that's right or not but
well i'd go along with that but what i was saying was i thought you might become more UNK and if you were then UNK got into a bit of a tennis match there and but then you didn't go down that route that's what i'm saying you didn't actually go down that cos if you UNK done UNK got nowhere
yeah
cos UNK got further and further and there's no way he was going to tell me i'm wrong
and you would've just dug the hole bigger and bigger wouldn't you
yeah
yes there's lots of us out there
okay well done
any other comments thoughts
statutory sick pay UNK state invalidity benefit that was the other thing
that's right yeah
that's for twelve months int it
twenty eight weeks
well twe twenty eight weeks
oh twenty eight weeks yeah
that was the thing
er
is state invalidity benefit means tested as well
yes it would be now yeah
because the state er if he were covered for twenty six weeks full pay
yeah
that's UNK augmented from his er
it'll be paid to his company and his company will swallow that
his company er so he doesn't really get that
well
i mean he gets it in
he doesn't get it over and above his current
mhm
but he may get it over and above after six months depending what
right
well after two weeks it becomes the statutory sick pay er then becomes the state UNK the state invalidity benefit
but the benefits are being reduced and our means tested and will get harder to pay out because of the UNK recently erm UNK claims and we're a healthy nation but more people are claiming invalidity benefit
er most people who claim invalidity benefit i mean don't need it anyway they're people who've got you know the existing bad backs people
yes
like that and that's i actually feel very strongly about that because i wouldn't mind paying more money if the people who needed it got it
i certainly wouldn't
but then the UNK there to be abused and people abuse it
well i know but it a it just UNK me
yeah i agree
it just UNK me
what are we doing for time now are we er on track ahead of
five o'clock
we're about right i think aren't we
yeah
oh good
yeah
is this well it's bill next
well if it's steve that's coming in steve interviewed me
it may well be alan
are you quite happy with that
yeah i'm just no cos this fortunately there's not four role play cycles to work through so yeah there may be somebody left again
right
but what i wanna do is to i'll get you all eventually
no i'm not it's not it's not UNK me
no it doesn't bother me
actually with the carpenter being self employed and single
yeah
that is it
er no just say the same
right
okay
right because the other thing is er his age is important to me
he's thirty five
thirty five okay
are you tired as well martin
yeah
i think everybody is
sorry
i think everybody is
yeah so imagine how you feel if you've got another two role plays to do and then try and concentrate for two hours again
okay
right
six down two to go
how did the other group get on with their exams
er two failed but i don't know who
two out of there oh
and one got seventy nine percent
oh what out of the two
er one of the two seventy five
mm
so he was quite UNK to miss it by one maybe one well two questions
one or two questions anyway
yeah
it's a bit sick is that
and he sees his feedback he'll kick himself
yeah
cos okay you won't believe he got several of those questions wrong as you know as we looked at the end of last night's you can't believe
no er the most annoying thing about last night was when martin was actually reviewing erm some of the topics that we hadn't got right erm and martin was UNK us with questions and we answered them
and you give the right answer
yeah
yeah
do we all get to see our papers again or
you won't see the papers again but you'll get i mean you shouldn't really see them i have
no
i have to say because erm but you'll get technical feedback on the areas you've got wrong
fr what from the branch manager when we get back
no from us er yesterday well last night well this morning rather yesterday morning i UNK all the figures through to my head office figures this morning
right
they'll have rung all your branches and given the results
right
erm obviously the priority is to get the feedback to the people that have to UNK the exam
yeah
and you may find that they've been done and they'll be posted to your branch so they will be there when you get back on monday
and then take it from there
gonna be there monday
no
we might we might be wednesday but
yeah whatever
they will come back to your branches
so the feedback we get will be from
from us
the branch yeah
i erm i hope i pass on thursday because i've got two appointments on wednesday
you will do
i know i will do but i've got t i've got a few appointments for next week
have no fear you will pass
have faith in your abilities
i was quite pleased when i got appointments between christmas and new year

right pensions isn't it
yeah i'm afraid so
this is when i'll dry up but never mind i'll try
we shall try
is that is that UNK
it's UNK
good
it's UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK
i'm billy he's bobby no i'm bobby he's billy
is she alright
eh
right
can't believe you've been watching all this television
right tell me when you're ready
roll
roll
don't want me er don't want me to just check it
have you moved the chairs at all
yeah tell me when it's going
are you going
that's fine
the mike the mike it's too far away there we go
is that is that comfortable
are we UNK here
no we've actually got
have you got a wide have you got a wide angle job on that
the luck we're having with cameras you're UNK it'd be wonderful if it's actually working
how we doing now
yeah
good
right
yeah that's fine
okay
aha
now you switch on then
okay are you are you ready now bill
mm
yes
thanks very much for that information mr russell
that's okay
we've now moved on to
just call me steve it's alright
fine right steve thank you very much
i'm bill by the way
okay bill
right now you've told me you're self employed as a carpenter how long have you been running this business
er about seven years now
fine
er what did you do previous to that
i was a bus driver
a bus driver
did you have any preserved benefits from your previous employment
sorry
did you have a pen were you of UNK salary
oh yes
er as a bus driver
yes i was yes
that's good
yes i had about ni i was there about nine years
right so there's so something waiting for you what we call preserved benefits sitting here er that's good to know
you you'll have details of that somewhere will you
well i've got it somewhere i mean
right
it'll take me an half an hour to go do you want me to go and get it
no not just now no that's alright it was just er it's important that you do have
i've got it somewhere filed away
right that's grand
now you've told me that er your net relevant earnings is twelve thousand pounds and your take home pay is seven hundred pounds
mhm
what other source of in of income do you have
i haven't got any
none at all
no
so you're ploughing everything into the business at this moment
that's right
in time and it's been going for about five years
mhm
that's er i w i'd like to come back er to that a little bit later
have you made any pe er pension er provisions meantime
no none whatsoever
okay er have you thought about it
i've thought about it but erm it's another one of those things i guess i keep putting off to the er a little bit later
right
sometimes it's a difficult thing to explain er why you should start early with a pension but very simply what would you be looking for when you retire
two thirds salary
you'd like a hundred percent obviously or even more
yeah i well hundred percent why not
right
okay
right so what you're looking for is twelve thousand pounds
mhm
and if we draw a line it's the analogy of someone UNK on a bicycle if you reach thirty five and you're going up on a bicycle like that it's reasonably steep but not too steep you can cope with that on a regular basis
if you wait five years it gets slightly UNK so the force to you becomes that and so on and so forth forty five fifty and you can see at fifty five if you want to retire at a certain age er what's the age that you actually want to retire
well sixty would be nice
sixty right so if we do that at sixty we can see where that where i'm coming from
thirty five you can cope with that on a reasonable basis forty there forty five fifty and so on how does that feel to you
making er provision for a pension
i can see what you're driving at i mean what you're saying is you know start it as soon as you can really
the sooner the better
there are two ways of doing that because in actual fact you could do this o over a period of thirty five to sixty which gives you twenty five years
mhm
if your business picks up and hopefully it will
yeah
it's looking good
then you'll be employing other people
yeah
that's good there is what we call compressed funding
now that's quite technical but what you can do as you're making pro profits you employ these profits in very quickly
mhm
for a short period of time which will have the same affect of building it up over the twenty five year period and you can use the money for er other things
i don't understand
i mean well can you explain that again
right
okay
instead of taking it over a thirty five year period what you would then have is that you go up very UNK let's say by putting lump sums or er regular capital premiums erm which you'll receive a tax refund and then it stops but the benefits of the fund keep going so at age sixty they would have the same effect of reaching your pension there with no contributions
surely that that's not possible is it for people in my position because i'm putting all my money into the into the company
i mean i
i haven't got money left over to start UNK in money into a pension scheme
fair comment
at this moment in time i would agree with you entirely
mhm
now that's perfectly valid but if the business actually UNK it takes off you could have this advantage to do it over a shorter period of time maybe in ten years' time when business is really
so should i wait
there are there are alternatives
right
if you wait
shall i wait and then put in er would it be better for me to wait and then put in a big lump sum
that's the sixty four thousand dollar question because you've now lost ten years and the UNK getting a wee bit UNK again
but isn't this com compressed funding as you call it gonna sort of taking it into that into account
it would do because in actual fact that would UNK this particular steep hill
right
okay
but er you mentioned that there's er there's no er retirement er UNK been made
mhm
is that of great UNK priority to you
well your little diagram shows that i really yes ought to be doing something about it yeah
right okay
erm so if i could pu come up with a plan er to fund a pension and take this away and look at your particular situation over the twenty five year period would you be quite happy to er look at that providing you're happy with the er the money the sum in involved and all the rest of it
yeah well why don't you erm show me some er some proposals on that
make some illustrations right
yeah i'd be happy to look at some illustrations
okay
well what i would like to do is obviously erm when would be convenient to come back and see you
oh you want to come back
well obviously i'll have to give you the illustrations
oh
couldn't you send it to me
er i could do but then again would you under er so that you can understand er what the actual recommendations are the important thing is again that we see you face to face
well your UNK a pension isn't it
my recommendation would be a pension yes that's right because that's your priority you've chosen
sure
not i er
yeah
and what i want to do is to look at it er over that particular period so i can explain everything to you in full because there are benefits to you in terms of tax savings
sure
because that is important
isn't that in don't you have any kind of er literature to
we can do
send me and i could read that
yes er that that's no problem but what i would like to do is obviously keep er face to face er contact so that we can explain the thing fully because you may have other questions that you want to ask once you've actually read it so therefore i'm on hand hopefully to answer all these questions
mhm
at that moment in time
okay fair enough
okay erm when would be convenient er to see you
er next week's no good i'm really tied up at work i've got lots of jobs on erm
good thing
yeah we we're very busy
that's good
i would say er say a UNK time
a UNK time at the same time six thirty
six thirty yeah
er wednesday evening
mm
fine i'll just take a note of that thank you
right
now providing your happy with these recommendations er do you have to consult anyone else er
erm
in order to do so
i think it might be wise for me to talk to the accountant before i you know put these plans into effect
fine that's no problem because at least you've got a fortnight in which to make contact with him and put your intentions up
yeah
well i i'll wait till you bring back your er illustrations and then i'll talk to him
right
er are you happy with the way we've addressed your particular need today er namely the pension
er yeah i mean a UNK a pension isn't it
so
yes
i don't need to worry about that
erm what about er if you're happy with that particular product erm we hope that you will understand if sorry er you're completely happy with the arrangement then you'll be happy to er go ahead with it er at our next meeting
well as i say i i'd like to run it past the accountant afterwards
fine
yeah good and what amount er would you be happy to put into your pension
well obviously as little as possible because
at this moment in time
well i mean i don't wanna put in er a great deal of money because most of it's UNK back into the business
right
er have you set a sum
well what's your minimum
erm twenty pounds
er well twenty pounds sounds alright
okay
right
what i'll do for you deliberately er if the situation changes between now and a UNK time after you've sp spoken to your accountant i'll probably look at twenty thirty and forty just to give you an illustration of what the expectations er are by putting a sum in there
but again bear in mind they're only for illustration purposes only
fine erm now you mentioned earlier that er you played er squash and tennis
mhm
can you think of an remember when i asked about introductions and things of that nature
are any of your colleagues that you play er squash with or tennis with er in the same boat in terms of self employment
yeah there there's a number of them yeah there's a solicitor erm there's a chap who's set up his own business his own erm antique restoration business
good
er could you give me the these names please
er and the
yeah
telephone number
yeah sure
there's er jim brown and er fred smith
fine
well i'll be contacting them in the next fortnight er if and to make be able to pass on my card i'll leave you two cards so that they know to expect a phone call from myself
mhm
that's grand
erm thank you very much for your time UNK and close
okey UNK
what number
oh that was that was the one
what
cut
ron do you wanna start
yeah sure
erm
ooh
er you were going you were going well with the pension you wanted him and your diagram was good and he was going for it but directly you showed him the diagram then you started on about this er
compressed funding
compressed funding so you were giving him too much
ooh
yeah at once
now it would've been easier for you the part that you missed out which would have brought all that in to play would have been how much do you want to pay do you wanna pay a small amount over a long time or a big amount over a short time and then that would've brought that into play
and then there's the other diagram the it's the hours of the day
yeah that's right
so i mean you could've got round it but you know you was good what you were doing but that's where you lost yourself didn't you
mhm
and er and that was that
erm you also dug holes for yourself by sort of UNK some stuff in the post
erm you know you should've UNK that in the UNK straight away rather than saying yeah we'll put it in the post we can do that you should've just said you know well i'll bring it all along and gone from there
erm also the accountant you could've tried to of got round because you were you were digging the hole there erm you know where he's okay he wants to see the accountant will this be a good idea i mean you could've said yeah you know you appreciate that and all the rest of it and you could've gone more into the tax side of where you know you could've perhaps er the company could've benefited by putting some into the pension scheme as opposed erm paying all the taxes maybe you could've gone in that way
er and the only other point was where was how much can you afford and he said well what's the minimum
and you said twenty quid and that was it
i'll have one of those please
yeah you were finishing up erm that was it
you know you should've perhaps questioned him you know what's his minimum what you know what could he how important is his future
you know it was good and that's you know and that's not knocking you apart at all
no
and of course you know you er you'll get hold of all this as the more we do erm but you lost your way on the diagram by giving him too much i think and er the referrals you sort of lost at one point but you come back and UNK it didn't you
mm
okay
are you done
yeah
thank god
joan
okay
can i just ask a question to start with because i was messing around with the camera and was it that he ha that he had no private pension policies at all
haven't got any
right okay so there was nothing to actually come back in and question about that cos there was there was nothing that you actually came back and actually questioned on that on that form
okay
well i it was just that i missed the initial question
mhm
so i wasn't quite sure of the answer that you gave back with me walking back from the camera so i just wanted to qualify that so that i mean all that i noticed was that there was nothing that no information that you tried to get out of him
i haven't got anything
erm but anyway so that was that then
the UNK of needs erm well the exploration of needs you never really went in to erm er what he really needed what he thought he needed to retire on
what er level of income that he thought he needed
you never actually found that out
erm so really what er although when you came to summarize the needs i've actually put good but too technical because we all knew what you were getting at but erm but to actually be doing that but not know at what point he needs to stop at or wants to stop it you didn't know erm the pension that he wanted and you didn't know at what age he wanted to retire at that point you know you hadn't got any of those facts from him you know
mm
so i actually felt that although that presentation was very good it was almost like a blind presentation because there was no benefit to him at the end of it because he didn't have you hadn't got those finishing point
aha
that's the way that i saw it
erm i'm not quite sure about this i may be wrong but i thought that maybe that you could've erm questioned him a little bit more about why he thought he needed to speak to his accountant
fair enough he may have had a very good reason for doing so but i thought that would have been a typical UNK erm he did say well you know i just want to run it by him you know just to make sure but you still needed to know why he thought that his accountant had to be involved
the referrals you missed the beginning out of the f referrals and just went straight into it and said have you got anybody i could contact
mhm
so erm but i think UNK already mentioned that part of it
erm and again i put erm things about putting details in the post although you although you did try and overcome that one erm but you just couldn't you couldn't get steven to realize the benefit of you actually going round with the illustrations rather than you just sending it and you needed to get to get the appointment out of him rather than because if he got the illustrations in the post he may never read them
so
you find that is the reality
you know so erm so some er a lot more should've been done about actually getting even if it was just well i'm in that area i'm in the area on such and such a day anyway so i can call in to see you
erm and erm again the last comment i've got is er how much was affordable to himself
but that would've tied in again with the beginning because what is affordable erm would he get the benefits that he was wanting at the end of it
that's it
okay
yes
thanks joan
erm yeah i th i mean i i've got more or less all the points that have been raised but i just felt that it went it er it was almost as though you'd made your mind up before you went in that you were gonna tell him what compressed funds was
and by hell or high water it was gonna be on that
mm
erm
we know that you know what compressed funding is
yeah
i mean the conversation started off and when you started to ask him about his existing or his previous UNK employment as a carpenter he really hadn't got a clue as to what it was all about
erm you never really sort of er he said he'd got a bit of paper somewhere and he could perhaps go and find it and you said you know sort of no not now erm but having done that you never you never not now erm but having done that you never you never i
mhm
and i think as a result of that it got UNK and you and you couldn't follow it through
erm you did you know you did summarize with what you thought you you'd established erm you went through to get your second appointment steve threw you know the objection in about sending it in the post and what have you erm er and you o you UNK that erm successfully but i think the other thing that with the anna it unless you get that authority the rest of it is meaningless because you know you can't go on and well you can agree the needs but there's no way that he's gonna agree to do it now or when you go back or even perhaps agree on the amount
i think if you've got somebody who's got a er a solicitor or an accountant then you need to establish why he wants to talk to them and also er if he if he's UNK that he wants to do that find out who he is and ask if you can speak to him as well or you can explain erm you know what the what you're doing with the client
but don't sort of back away from them try and to work with them cos you've gotta you've gotta get the two the two together
erm as i say really it was it was just er the same as er as the other people said
there was one there was one last comment that i missed out there that it was the erm the permission to proceed with the product recommendations you were wanting to proceed with recommendations but you hadn't got the commitment off steven in the first place so you were suggestion recommendations and what
because you hadn't got the commitment that he wanted a pension or he didn't i didn't i didn't feel that at that point that you
that and it and it went back really to the fact he hadn't explored the needs
that's right yeah everything went back to that initial part
yeah
steve
yeah now you see the difficulty with that particular one was i wasn't con convinced or committed to buying anything because you had not explored my needs
okay
you see that's the problem
mhm
and it's a case of er if you're talking to somebody about pension requirement it would be a case of mr prospect let's just have a look let's imagine today is the last day that you'll be working as a carpenter
you pack your bags shut the door switch off the lights and you go home and you've got the r another thirty odd years perhaps to look forward to in retirement
what are you gonna be doing now that you're not working
how are you gonna be spending your time
mm
what are you gonna be spending your money on
how are you gonna be UNK yourself
mhm
if you'd retired yesterday how much money would you need in today's terms to spend
what would you be spending it on
because you see there was none of that exploration and it's just those nice easy open question to get me to start enjoy spending my er retirement
erm so i c i couldn't buy any of what you were telling me and it's all like a it was all a UNK i was putting up the accountant basically i was not erm buying anything er and the compressed funding was just blowing my mind because i couldn't UNK er it was basically giving me an easy option to say i don't need to do anything cos i can UNK my funding at forty five won't i when my business has taken off
it was like you know you were digging a hole and er it was it was making it very difficult for me to want to buy you see
mhm
and then when i gave you the minimum premium er it was like right okay well that's the easy way out isn't it twenty quid a month okay i might do something for twenty quid because i wasn't committed and that's what exploration of needs is all about and it's so easy for me to sit and say yeah that's what you need to do but putting myself in your shoes you know a few years ago
mhm
how to do it
mm
and that's what you know i try and help you on if you like but how can you do that when
i saw a very good erm presentation of a pen of pensions
erm it was actually somebody who came for an interview and you know how you sit in on the presentations when you do the group presentations
and erm he actually he started off and was very nervous but the summing up of it was brilliant erm and i wouldn't put it across as well as what he did but the principle of it was that he suddenly turned round and said right i have now changed my job right you are now looking at the new managing director of friends provident he says and the first thing i am going to do is i'm cutting all your wages to eighty five pounds a week what are you going to do about it
and that was it and erm so then everybody's saying so you know i'll come UNK on your door and saying what do you think you're doing you know knocking me down to eighty five pounds a week or whatever it is and you know obviously there were various UNK from that and then the summing up of it was so is that what you're going to do to the d s when you when you retire
obviously he put it across a lot better than what i did but the actual message of getting that across to
mm
because you know especially to people and this is this is not talking down to people but er to somebody who doesn't understand pensions or anything who
i'm a carpenter i'm not a rocket scientist either yeah
that's it you have to put it in the simplest of terms and that is the way that most people would understand it you know you come to sixty five or whatever and instead of having three hundred pounds a week you've got eighty five pounds a week and what are you going to do about it
and i thought that was that was one of the best simple erm ways of actually describing what a pension
mhm
of what to do to actually your pension in retirement
anyway i just thought it
and very yeah i mean th that's all that this exploration of needs is just saying you retired yesterday and you were earning twelve thousand a year you're now gonna be earning two and a half thousand pounds a year
what's gonna go
what things have you still gotta pay for what things are you gonna cut out a bit
come on let's write them down
food
well you still want food rent mortgage do you wanna have a holiday are you gonna run a car
meals out well you're not gonna do it on two hundred and fifty pounds erm a month or whatever it is you can't do it can you
what are you gonna cut out
do you want that to happen
you don't
do you wanna do something about it
mm
so in fairness i got this excuse the expression UNK about face in the sense that i ha i thought UNK these and pensions were was this and that's why you were exploring the needs for the second appointment
you know you had gone through the whole c q and the priority was the pension that's what i got wrong
what i should've realized was that we're still filling in the form
yeah that's exactly it
and that's why i went totally off beam steve
the reason i asked for a preserved pension obviously to see whether there was any preserved benefits
the second thing was i asked and nobody picked it up five years he'd been working could the net earnings related carry forward
oh yeah
so i mean again i realized i had dug a hole for myself with the compressed funding but at the same time i was saying to myself oh yeah there is carry forward here er
mm
there was a possibility still there was still something there that we can use
erm i'm i admit er that was one i just UNK simply because i was taking it the wrong way round i thought we had identified what was the priority life insurance p h i and pensions and was UNK it whereas i should've realized we're doing that page towards the priority
mm
there's a totally different way of doing it
you see about the accountant you've gotta knock that on the head immediately because otherwise it's a waste of space
yeah that's right
you've gotta destroy it
but the accountant could well be the guy that you went and played tennis with and the boy doesn't even make a move unless he gets the accountant and
so
it's a difficult one to get over on occasions
well you've gotta probe you've gotta you've got to UNK that
yeah
say that's interesting you want to speak to your accountant
mhm
why
yeah
because the then again i was er at the back of the form and i knew who his accountant was er
you've gotta probe and establish the reasons why i'm gonna talk to him and most people it's a lie they're not gonna talk to him they want to use the accountant as a reason to say oh erm i'm i can't do it this time the accountant said no or i've not spoken to him yet i'll have to put it off for a for a bit longer
mhm
so you've gotta knock that one out
mhm
er and as for budgets erm you know i'd be saying to people come on you're not buying a raffle ticket let's talk serious funding
how serious are you about being able to retire with some dignity and being able to continue doing the things you've always wanted to er the things you've been able to enjoy doing but you'll have to give up
are you serious about doing this
that's right
you know you could put in up to seventeen and a half percent that represents you know
that's right
a hundred and fifty pounds how close can you get to a hundred and fifty pounds a month
t having done that you never you never UNK
i think i think the other thing is as well though is that when you i mean you've been sitting pensions cos i mean i had the p h i which i thought it was easier to actually describe erm but erm it's easy for us to actually sit back and go back on everything that UNK er everybody else did wrong isn't it so
sometimes er trying to sell a pension to a thirty five year old can be difficult cos he's not interested he's only interested in his job
oh i don't know i think
and his business
it's your job to make him interested
now that's no fair comment i take the point fully er i'm just saying you know that you've got a thirty five year old och why the hell do i need a pension
when i
i think the thing is if UNK demonstrated that or got to the stage of saying well alright you know if you're retiring tomorrow how much money do you need to live on
i should've painted the picture
then if UNK done your bike riding up the hill
yeah
i think you know you were going down the right track you've gotta be really
that would've been down hill
mm well
i
i think a good example to use with younger people with er pe with pensions as well is that the er the cutting down of funding that the government is making and it's going to be hitting like the younger people and another important thing is like with the with the australia issue i mean in australia now it's compulsory for everybody under the age of twenty five to have a personal pension and that r and that age rise is going to that age limit is going to rise each time because they want to abolish the state pension completely and it was only what about two months ago that there was that there was er articles in i think it was the times about them doing a similar operation in this country you know
mm yeah that was in all the national press
yeah so i mean with younger people it's although th they're still not it's still not going to be easy er like with the older people there's still the UNK element that in years to come they are not going to have this to fall back on because by the time that they retire it's just not going to exist
you know
yeah that's fair comment i
but i think i think the australian one is er quite a good example to use on pensions
yes it is
yeah
well and the press comments th that have been made here you know that you could end up
what did peter UNK say the other day you know that er you'll have to provide
thinking about
provide for yourself won't you
that's it yeah
yeah
and er i mean th the o the question you would use for this one is tell me what are your thou what is it what are your thoughts on pensions you know what are your thoughts on retirement how do you feel about it just open up for the guy to say it's very important or i'm not interested oh that's interesting why do you say that
yeah er if he retired tomorrow
and it's no if you'd retired yesterday it's always retired yesterday you died yesterday
yesterday
why why's that
because well it
today is reality int it
yeah
well if you say if you'd re if you died yesterday er tomorrow
yeah
well i can't die tomorrow cos i've got a very important meeting and er and er
i say it's you've always gotta go back last night last week
yeah and what you can say
what would happen cos it's gone and you're not
it's gone
frightening them er you're not erm you're not saying you're gonna die tomorrow or next week
yeah you w you would be saying if there's a husband and wife there and you said you died yesterday and if the if the husband UNK in you say you're dead you say nothing all the plans you're gonna do you never did right so you're dead you keep quiet you can't go back and have a UNK
thank you
oh it's a bit strong actually isn't it
talking of UNK come back
did you give me yours
yes there i put it over there
mine's just on there bill
it's just on that chair
oh i think i've changed jobs again but i'm UNK
i'm still male
but that was good
you know you dug a hole don't you
i know a dug a hole and i totally UNK it in the sense that
that's a good idea but i don't think i'd
no
you know the priority was either p h i savings or whatever and i thought we've gone through the whole form
that's right
what the hell am i back here for
yeah
and instead of that if UNK realized that exactly what the guys said you know
excuse me
right who've i got and
me
what we doing
erm savings
cambridge
yes
right so it's
er what we got
five fifteen thirty five minutes six twenty oh we've still got bags of time then
you've got four minutes
okay erm er erm
right so erm i'm a chartered accountant on thirty grand
oh you're gonna be the customer are you
yes
well the last time i was a UNK on twelve grand
oh i don't know about that UNK
might as well get into erm the mode
mhm
that's all you've done isn't it
yeah
i didn't sleep very well
funny enough i'm tired
last night actually and it didn't exactly help well it's a long trip up here longer than i expected and i didn't
where do you have to come from
essex chelmsford
oh right i come from UNK
oh you're not far then
no
just that bit further
oh you're that bit further well i suppose i'm that bit further really
well no you're further north aren't you
which way
because i
did you come
well i had to come down i had to come i erm went down to bishop's stortford and in fact
what to pick up the m a one m
well i slightly lost myself because i went down the m eleven
why
back up on the er the four one four so i was really doubling up my journey
oh god you were weren't you
cos i went
that's right
straight on the four one four from chelmsford picked up the m eleven followed the m eleven up and took the a forty five across country
that's right
but i
UNK been quicker if i'd gone down into UNK picked up the m twenty five and gone on the a one m
that's right
well er anyway as it as it worked out although i did a lot of s UNK about erm when i actually got to erm on to the four one four and i followed that through to the m one and straight up and i was running parallel with the m twenty five virtually
yeah
it's just that all i heard all morning was there's so many delays there with all the water surface water erm so i thought well let's try and avoid that
what time did you have to be here yesterday
erm t erm two o'clock
one o'clock
start one o'clock lunch
one o'clock for lunch yesterday
yeah
i mean it only took me two hours two and two and a half hours er
i still can't get over the fact they cancelled my booking for last night
don't know whether they thought i was gonna leave home at half past five this morning
well that's alright joan had an eight hour car journey to get to
nine hours
yes cos you've got a long way
nine hours
to come haven't you
i came very close to having a very bad accident because we didn't we were up early in the morning and we didn't
mm
finish until late and then i had
mm
erm i know
oh it's all over here i moved them all
yeah there's one here are
here are
no that's
oh it's okay hang on no so no sorry
erm do they have a plane
i th er erm
it's a heck of a drive
well it's pretty intensive
i mean there's a lot UNK into the time
well this is about i mean at this point it's about one o'clock in the morning
UNK been better off to have been booked in here for a good night's sleep and then driven up the next day but then you're virtually sort of getting up there turning round and coming back aren't you
well that's it cos i'd i mean i had the accident well i mean i didn't hurt myself and i was very lucky i didn't hit the cars but erm it was bad enough with er and i ended up on this big grass UNK at the end of the bypass
you know at the top it was like UNK down here and the car's like this and i'm having to try and get the car back down without it UNK over and it was an UNK
where were you
i was on the erm bypass at this point about erm less than an hour from home
yes but that's when your concentration UNK
possibly yeah
you get more accidents within the fifty miles of your home than anywhere else
yeah
yeah
so that was quite well very UNK
that woke you up with a bang
very frightening
you alright
yeah i was alright but i was very shaking and everything and i managed to get the car down and there wasn't that many cars
no other vehicles involved
no i don't know how but there was two cars that was that was er behind me and i managed to avoid them but i don't know how
did they stop
no
they just left you to it
so you had you had to get it all down you know do everything by yourself
but when i got the car back on to the road i mean i'm a complete bag of nerves and i'm not wanting to be walking along the edge of the bypass at one o'clock in the morning
that's right
and erm the car's all over the place because the wheels are all covered in mud and everything so
joan for what it's worth erm and this is just something you might want to think about a mobile is worth its weight in gold
yeah well my husband's talking about getting one of those because i mean after i didn't tell him all the details
i was gonna say have you told your husband
well i told him that i was getting very tired but he would've just worried about me coming back down you know
i know
and i mean i've got s it's not as bad going back from here cos it'll only be about a six hour then
not the point though is it
but erm and i thought well he's just going to worry unnecessarily so i'll tell him when i'm back
do have the mobile though because apart from everything else erm i mean you've got r a c membership
well we haven't though not after twelve months
that's what we were told in the branch it UNK after twelve months
well i've still got the r a c membership card
yeah it's only
no
for the guarantee er the one year UNK i think you'll find maggie
i haven't been told that
i think you'll find it is
cos i asked about that before i travelled down because i was worried in you know in case of breaking down
a lot of
well as far as i'm aware we've got r a c membership because i've got the card nobody told me to
er has the card been filled in with a date on it
cos i've got one in my car that's over two years old and there's not a you know nobody's written anything on it or anything
as far as i'm aware it's standard r a c
membership
it's something
yeah go on will
not to be s UNK but i mean let's try and get this in
to press on
thirty five minutes
one two
are you ready rob
yeah
i'll erm i'll just check this because we've changed round again and last time that
oh yeah
well it should be okay
yeah
yeah robert can you just move in s every so slightly that's better
that's fine
ooh
sorry i'm only playing
do you think i'd make a good do you think i'd make a good director
cut
excellent
right thanks for that maggie
er i'd just like to move on now erm what future capital needs do you need anticipate
sorry i'm not with you
okay
er for your future is there anything that you feel may come up erm that you will need er a lump sum of money for
er your children's future your future
your plans for ten years or so
oh i see what you mean er i didn't quite understand what you were talking about
i'm sorry
erm well as it happens it's er that this is something i wanted to bring up with you
erm when i got married erm i had a lump sum of money and erm i was thinking about my daughter about putting some money on one side
right and what would for what reason would that be
well so that she has similar so that she has erm you know money when she gets married or if she decides not to get married maybe she can use it for a house deposit
mm
so you're looking for mm well if she's ten at the moment you're looking at ten years plus i suppose
mhm about ten eleven years yes
yeah sure
okay
UNK run out right okay so you're looking for er a savings plan or a l a lump sum of money for ten years plus for your daughter
yeah but erm but i'd like to have some sort of life cover with that so if anything does happen to me she gets
mm
a lump sum
sure
okay
er what about your son he's only eight he
ah well actually he's provided for because there is a sum of money left in trust for him so it does just my daughter i wanted to
ah right so it's really just your daughter that your looking er for a lump sum
well yes having said
ten years
yeah but having said that erm that was something i wanted to ask you about because i mean both of them might need some money for higher education so whilst i'd like to put that sum money on one side i'd also possibly you know if the need arose would like to use it myself if i needed to for higher education
i want it to be fairly flexible
sure
so really you're you would prefer it to be under your name
mhm
and then if you needed it for the further education you could use it
mm
if you wanted it more for as a gift in ten eleven years time as you've said
mm
erm you would then like just to get the lump sum and say here you are
well i wanna make sure that if anything happens to me erm before the end of the policy that my daughter gets the money because
sure
as i said my son's taken care of from that point
sure
of view but i'd like to have access to it erm to
right
to be able to use it i don't know if that i mean can you i is that something that's possible
yes that is very possible cos what we could actually do is erm we could we could put it under your life and then we could put it into a trust a flexible trust
now what that actually means is that the money er will go to your daughter if anything happened to you but if you re er was still alive come maturity time you could then take the proceeds yourself to then give her
right okay
okay
erm so the money would come to me
the money would come to you let's say for instance we started the policy for ten years okay
mm
so in ten years time you would have a maturity of x number of pounds
right
okay this lump sum of money that you want to give to your daughter okay
mm
mm
right
now what we would do is put into a flexible trust okay
mhm
now what that actually means is that in ten years time when that money UNK that policy UNK
mm
you can actually have that money and give to your daughter okay
right
right
now if on the other hand if you were to die within that ten year period
mm
the money that's built up er in is put away in that trust to come straight over to your daughter so she would actually get that money
okay
alright
so you're covering both angles then
okay yes that
are you happy with that
mm
right so just to summarize erm let's remind ourselves of the issues we've raised here
would that be okay
yes UNK yes please do
yeah sure
okay so you said that the most important concern really is that you have some money for your daughter's future
yes
whether it be a lump sum or for further education
yeah
right
now what do you think would happen if you made no provision for this
well that's why i'm asking you to draw this up
right
so you can see that it is a concern
mhm
and you would like erm to have this money for your daughter's future
yes that's er yes
right
well thanks very much for all your thoughts and ideas there
what i will need to do is to now take this information away with me and put together some recommendations er which will help solve this concern for you
now what i would like to do is come back and see you either next week or the week after
which will be best for you
er probably the week after but erm
okay
now would it be the same sort of di day and time
yes
okay so we'll do it again on tuesday at seven o'clock
right
okay that's fine
now right now as we've seen that you you're looking for this money for your daughter's future
mm
now if when i come back erm the er the idea that erm the recommendation that i put before you if this UNK that particular need
mhm
will you be willing to go ahead with that
yes depending of course on what it costs me
right
now is there anyone else you will need to speak to first before you can erm actually go ahead with this
no
no that's fine
so you can take full authority of this
mm
right
now just so that we can get this er correct what sort of amount do you think you would be able to af afford on a monthly basis
well what i want to have is erm something like twenty eight thirty thousand pounds in ten years' time
so really you would like me to forward plan this for twenty eight to thirty thousand and whatever that costs do you think you will be able to afford that
well let's have a look at the cost of it you know what sort of life cover is that going to give me immediately
right well it will give you er i will go away and work these plans out but one that comes to mind is where there's er a life cover but it's a low level of life cover so you have more of an investment erm more of th more of your contributions goes towards the investment so that you get the bigger return in the ten years when you need it
could you run that one by me again
right
this is just one that's come to mind i'm not saying it's the correct one at this stage because as i have said i would like to go away an work on these plans
mhm
but one that comes to mind is where you would have er life cover which is what you want
yes
and then it's a low level and then plus the er the higher more of the contribution goes towards the investment risk
right
well i'd like to have about ten thousand pounds life cover immediately
right
okay then
so that's fine
okay
that's no problem so you're looking for ten thousand pounds worth of life cover for yourself and then you're looking for twenty eight to thirty thousand for your daughter projected forward
yeah
in ten years' time
that's it
okay that's fine
now you consider that to be the most outstanding needs at this moment in time
yes
this is what we've covered today
mhm
okay
right now as you've seen you're quite erm covered in most departments there but as you've seen today that er you would like that extra bit of life cover for yourself
mhm
and the money for your daughter in the future so do you feel that it's been of some benefit to you today to have had this discussion
well yes well i mean it'll be more beneficial when i know what it's go er what sort of plan you're going to present to me
sure
but of course this has highlighted those two key areas which you've brought up erm that you would like to address
yes
so you feel it's been of some benefit to you today
well as i said er i i'll know that when you come back with the figures
okay
now if you cast your mind back to when we started the er discussion i did say i would talk about refer erm recommendations to you if you felt that this meeting had been of some benefit to yourself
mm
which you said it has er you would perhaps recommend me to some people you know erm like the partner in your er your work or the members of your squash club
well i think that's something that i erm we can go into when you come back next time and er i see what sort of plans you come up with
sure
okay but you don't mind me coming back to ask you about those people
no that no that's that'll be okay
right that's
finished
about it isn't it
oh sorry
that was ac
i didn't know if i'd covered all these
cut
you were actually oh three
three and a half minutes short in fact you did it in about eleven and a half minutes
it's only a small subject though it's not like
that's right
this is true
did i cover all those all the UNK
shh
oh i'm sorry
shh
your name's not joan you're not supposed to say things now
i think i'm getting a bit of a reputation for talking when i'm not supposed to
come on then joan UNK er tell us what you thought
i can talk
yes
permission to speak
sit you've
oh
right
this is the most valuable part the feedback
okay
the things that i picked up on was erm when you started i thought that overall i mean you were getting the message across and overall that you know erm there was a lot of the areas that you tackled very well and you UNK back to your old self and you did a lot better
so than what we were talking about before you know
right
but anyway when y when you were first exploring erm the needs and maggie came back to you and offered erm this policy that she wanted for her daughter but you never actually went back and saw if there was anything else you never came back
no that's right
you know there was i've got a policy er here that i can take out and you took it and then that was it and you spent the rest of the time talking about this one policy whereas because you'd been thinking about that one there may have been others that you may have been able to disturb her about or erm you know if she had other member of the family or education whatever there was there was other areas that maybe you could've brought up or gone back to anyway
so that i th i think that was the biggest problem
erm the UNK of needs was i thought was good
ag again with the recommendations i think you went on to say can i can i go forward in getting the recommendations erm without actually explaining what you were doing you just came back and said so i'll go ahead and get the recommendations and come back and see you in two weeks' time and like what recommendation
so erm
mm
the idea was there and the structure and everything was there it was just that you hadn't actually explained what you had to do first you know to come back with the erm recommendations erm but you did you did get the date confirmed to come back for the second appointment which was good
erm i thought that you lost er i thought that you'd forgotten about your referrals but you did actually come back to them erm and i'm not quite sure whether you actually tackled all of anna i know that you got the authority i'm not qu
yeah i
i don't think you tackled all the needs in the now area of it but you got the amount at the end of it
erm so i think in the m er in the lit in the middle of it you actually lost some of it erm and then you came back to the to the referrals erm tt so that was that
and a couple of other things that i wanted to pick up on was erm maggie
ask a silly question
i was born on central island as i said
what's the name of the of the
the house er the house was UNK
it was down near the centre of the island down past er mill dam
ah
mhm
and was that
aye
mhm
what size was it
about seven and a half acres
oh that's not very big
no
were there many in your family
two
that size of croft would never be enough to keep you living
keep the family
well it kept us and er when we were the school holidays my brother and me used to gather UNK and that
the summer holidays and even in the christmas holidays we were
well er ten or twelve year old
yeah
when were you born
nineteen twenty two
so what kind of UNK did you have on that size of croft
oh
can you remember
oh two ca and four UNK and a horse
one horse
one horse
aye and joined with the next door neighbour er for UNK the land
mm
did you have anything at that time
no i never at UNK let me say
i don't believe so that must have died generation
oh there were there were a lot of houses but UNK we didn't have any
we used to some of us other boys we'd go down to the banks and the winter time
oh aye
where you involved in it
aye the gathering
used to take a basket with your bottle with tea and that in it to my father when we was
what was it like
oh it was great month of june
see we summer days then compared with what we get nowadays
everybody says that so it must be true
when you went to the UNK how long do you remember that
oh i don't know really what time the really started
i think it started school
and what age were you when you left
fourteen
ready to walk land when i were fifteen
but like when you were a young boy growing up would the UNK workers could they make as much money
er not really the main source of income on the croft er when i was er we keeping hens
aye
tell me about that
oh i couldn't rightly tell you what the number of hens would be that er maybe within maybe er thirty dozen eggs in the week or so
mhm
and that was that's just your croft
mm mhm
aye with used just the grain that was grown on the croft and brought in a lot of the feed
we used to wheel it home then on the push bike
the feed for the shop and we the box of eggs on the push bike
and that brought in th that was your main source on income
aye
mhm
when did that start
was that on the go when you were growing up o did it start
aye just when i was growing up it started aye maybe when or maybe when i was about er ten year old or something
oh quite a lot
well like all the ground was all UNK and you had the had like all the summertime you had to fence the hens off the UNK land
what kind of hens did you have
it was usually wine dots some UNK island UNK
oh aye and there was the
all the UNK boiled UNK and chopped it up for the hens
that was my mother sometimes er mix it up with er with the bought hen feed and gathering UNK and er boiling UNK and that to mix it up with
oh
mhm
and gathering UNK out of the UNK the chickens and that for green feed when they needed and they were confined in a small space where there was no green grass to feed them on
oh i see
you used to go up with a with a sack or something and gather the UNK er out of the UNK and UNK
so you UNK your own
mhm
oh yeah flock of hens
sit on maybe thirteen or fourteen eggs
mhm
was that hens
oh no hens
and they used to and they if you had er good er breeding stock and that the neighbours would come to you for a sitting on eggs
UNK eggs a dozen eggs or
would this erm croft UNK in that
did you w did you UNK more than most folk or were you just average
oh no just average
all the peedie UNK throughout did that
more the peedie UNK
aye
and was it much did you get for you know
oh i just i just couldn't tell you really what
usually
aye usually
mhm
well there was you would er buy your UNK and they was marked down in a book at the shop
you put up your eggs and marked it down and then they was er cleared then at the end of the year
and some years you'd probably maybe get a few pounds back and sometimes you would er maybe have to pay a few pounds
and your aye
but aye
mm
i see but you didn't actually get the money for them
no actually no
mhm
but us there was there was mainly was also er living was er the eggs paid for what you bought for the shop
and for their own er feed
aye
mhm
you bought that for the shop did you
mhm
aye
and you didn't have to
no you just marked it down and cleared it up at the end of the year
what kind of accommodation and equipment and that did you need for the hen did you just big UNK
just the usual size for a UNK er six by eight feet
er
and how many hens would that hold
oh you'd maybe hold er thirty in it
mhm
thirty hens in the six by eight house
aye over those aye
about the same size
and roof with er like st flag stone roofs
where they easy to keep hens
mm
were they did they need a lot of attention
well they needed a lot but they especially if they were in a confined space
but what we found was that the heavier UNK the wine dots and the UNK island UNK they didn't need such a high fence as what the UNK or any of the lighter UNK needed
used to if the wire and that you'd try and get a hold of them and clip their wings to stop the flying out
did they all follow or not
oh they tried to aye
that must have been an awful lot of hens then
oh aye
and now where did they go then
the usually go to the egg packing station
i think most of the of the UNK here i think maybe had a better
but nobody much into the egg packing station
mhm
and when did that all fold up
oh it folded up after the war
mm
something i've heard it said before i don't know if this is true in north ronaldsay that gale in nineteen thirty two had something to do with it
mhm aye it had something to do with it lot of lot of UNK and that blown away
and aye certainly i think it did er start to go down after that
and
do you remember that night
oh aye i did
tell me what you remember of it
i remember me getting up about three o'clock in the morning i heard the wind and i got up to look at the stack yard and start to put er bits of pit UNK and that into the UNK and the wind was getting that strong the pit UNK was going flying over me head and i gave it up and made for and it's certainly not a very high door at UNK but or a very big door but it took me all my time to get the door closed
mm
mm
was it the worst wind you've seen
oh aye
it was more wind than what was the UNK after to the north east
aye
was that the next year
aye
mhm
aye mhm there were more damage done on north ronaldsay with the nineteen fifty two
what direction wind was it
south west
is that your worst
mhm
aye
and what damage did the wind do to your croft
well er it blew down er two of the UNK and er i was working at UNK then
and they got reckon they were they had a lot of UNK then they were working a lot hens and there were five or six UNK all blown to bits and the hens scattered about everywhere
all the stacks blown down
were there hens all dead
aye a lot of them
aye
there were quite a lot of loss right enough
i was just gonna say
there were a there were a bit of fund for it i think
aye
there were some there were
one or two on the island here who got a bit for the that er damage with the storm
storm damage
mhm but there wasn't very many
were they the ones that really bad
mhm
aye
what's erm what what's most affected
oh i think we were one of the worst hit was UNK was aye
it was up on a height suppose
aye
but it was during the night you see the nineteen fifty three one was started UNK nine or ten o'clock
it was more in the daytime
and did that do damage
aye it did a lot of damage the UNK and that
but not so much i think er with a lot of UNK and that they were better UNK down i think after the first year
but the hens UNK off here for the start of the UNK the land
they were growing UNK and corn
more hay and that
so they didn't have much er of their of their feed for the hens
and they buy it all in there was no pay in it
and then there was not much UNK grown here and then the mill stopped
nobody working in the mill for they'd not much to do in the mill
aye
and did the money
well er the money was not you had to buy the and the there were nothing in it unless you went into choosing a big system like the battery system
aye
but there was a lot of them they used to work with er the oil lamps and that out in the UNK the hens eggs they feed at night
oh right
aye
mhm
but they light the UNK might be about four or five o'clock and you maybe leave it in the UNK maybe till nine or ten at night
hens got extra feed and you got more eggs
and that worked
mhm
oh it certainly worked
but there would have been a lot of work for you boys
oh aye
hens who were once the oats were so were UNK they had to they were closed down and that
and when we had a down near the banks UNK and it was UNK round and we used to carry the hens down there at night in a sack on your back
oh
mhm
or maybe a lot in a sack wheel them down on a UNK or something
and what was the reason for this
we shift them down to the so they couldn't get onto the UNK land
and then they left the then for the younger birds
give them a better chance
if you'd the old hens closed in with them they the young birds would have no chance
the old hens would eat all the feed
mhm
aye
catch them with a dog and clip their wings
so you were what were you doing at
were you growing a lot of UNK
well er grown in just in rotation you know working the land every five or six year rotation er and er you had not very much hay
and er then you see the then and
oh aye did all the cutting with UNK
really
mhm
aye
we never had a we never had a UNK on UNK
it was all cut with a UNK until er well i started i go to holland to work when i was fourteen and my brother charlie he got away and my father and mother was left they were home
and they failed then you see with cutting the crop with a UNK and they hired then a tractor and binder to cut the crop
did it take a while to cut crop this size
oh it took a while
you would er it would all depend
you see if it was a fine stand crop you could cut quite a bit but if it was all UNK it took a while
well they were all no well you could maybe aye they help aye but er usually they had as much as they could do themselves you see
cos any spare the men or that they were usually away for a UNK taking up a harvest
earning a few pounds
work when i was fifteen and i was away then for a while and then after the war when i come back i was working at UNK
and then er working with them the tractor and binder did the cutting and that and we did the cutting and the leading
and sydney at UNK
what was it like when you went into service at
what were the conditions like
the conditions was not great
you got er twelve pound for six months work
did you get your board and
you got your aye
mhm
you just had the twelve pound for pocket money
you got your board and UNK you see
and what did that
well er you at holland i usually stayed home at night
i got aye
mhm
aye but er some of the other boys that were there they used to stay at
they you see
and er the wages get up two years every half a year
fourteen pound for the UNK er twelve pound for the first half and fourteen for the second
and what did a day consist of roughly then
what time were you up in the mornings
well er when i started then i was usually up about seven
and we worked from eight o'clock in the morning till eight at night
with break for we'd start we'd do the cattle feed the cattle in the morning and then we were in for breakfast and then er be out then and er dinner then was usually about half past twelve and you started again on at two
and then in for your tea at six and then after you had your tea cattle
aye
you finished about eight o'clock at night you had about twelve hours so you're working more or less except for the wasn't very long
were you responsible for the horse or were you a cattle man
well er i was a UNK to start with and then it was the horse
was that a progression up then
mhm
mhm
why was that the case
well i don't know he usually had the one horse man and er a chap in the working
and er if it suited then if you a young chap when they first started for a year or so you'd be working with the cattle and himself the boss would be working the horse with a UNK
and then you get getting neeps and getting and onto the ploughing and than
and then er himself then would er be doing the cattle
mhm
no he was just the tenant the firm were holland
ran jimmy 's the name
he belonged to the mainland of orkney
no he
aye
from UNK i think his brother was in UNK in UNK
oh
aye
and then when he left er holland in nineteen thirty nine he went to the UNK in UNK
what size
oh it was about three hundred acres
UNK at UNK then was about sixty acres
mm
and what kind of food did you get
oh the growth of the ground as they said
what was it your breakfast UNK of
well er sometimes it might be UNK but it was usually just er the and maybe er boiled eggs and er UNK and your UNK probably be UNK and pork or something of that kind
UNK the same at teatime
but you were well enough fed
oh aye well enough fed
was there a difference in the conditions at different firms in
oh aye certainly there was
right enough
you were better fed at some firms or others
and
they were fairly good
aye
mhm
and what kind of holidays did you get then you worked at holland for how long
two and a half year
mhm
one
holidays
one week in the year
and you worked every saturday and every second sunday
there were no half days on saturday or day off on saturday
and you worked every second sunday as a cattle look after the cattle every second sunday
in the summertime you didn't have so much to do on a sunday
horse to water and things of that kind
but you couldn't really do very much
and the funny thing was even if it should be a UNK day
and we were maybe hanging around at holland and not doing very much the boss never thought of doing the UNK till after we for tea
then we go out and UNK after tea time
and what did that consist of what did you used to UNK with
we'd UNK with a mill and engine
one chap feeding the mill and one the other chap then giving him the and the other chap was working below taking away the straw and looking after the grain
was that a hand mill at that time
no at holland there was a hand mill UNK
just a small er tiny metal mill and a handle on every side you turned
maybe before i was ten year old turning the handle of the UNK mill as they called it
and there was the like for the corn and that we used to what we called UNK it was done with a UNK
ah
did you used the UNK
mhm
mhm
oh aye we used the UNK
oh it wa
i've never seen one i've never seen it being used
no
it look can't imagine
it was alright i didn't mind working the UNK and the two could work the UNK together
one standing opposite other one
and one was striking one time and the other one the other
mhm
oh right
aye
mhm
was it efficient does it work fine
oh aye it worked fine
and i've seen when getting corn er just right er dressed for the mill i've seen us er doing with a spade and that and a tub
cup a bag or corn into the tub a big wooden tub and get a sharp spade and keep UNK with a spade in the tub
that's what they call UNK corn
you just made the corn
in fact you made it too for seed if you did
the corn was too for seed it didn't go down
er there come any rain it just all come to the top
what sort of mill did you use the mill for did you put grain through the mill
mhm for oats for UNK
and lot of the oats and the corn they was roughly ground for the
that was feeding the pigs or the
but w as i said we did because we didn't have a pig
but we used to put the oats to the mill and the and the corn for getting it UNK for feeding the horse and the cattle
was it quite a sophisticated mill
mhm
mhm
aye
they got a new engine in the mill er the start of the war i think
cos an oil engine was in it for a while and then they put a new diesel engine in i think it would be nineteen thirty nine or something
it was mr that was the UNK there
mr oh yes i remember him and the wife died but i didn't mind er
UNK aye well i didn't mind him
and mrs she was the UNK for quite a while a while after the war
she was UNK
did she stay here at that time
no she only stayed for a few weeks in summer
so who was the factor here
it was er a james in kirkwall
but he didn't live here
no he just came up to collect the rent
and
oh it was alright
was it quite fair
oh aye he was fair you see the rents on ronaldsay was never very high in fact the rents in north ronaldsay they're before nineteen hundred i don't think
no them's just the on the if there'd not been any change to the croft and that there'd still the old rent
no they seemed to be UNK than some of the UNK was
when i heard the stories about quite a UNK
oh the s aye well they were more the UNK and that
aye they were aye
it was when the when the UNK was out in india and that and the factor was stationed on the island
yeah
aye
no well i don't think so
it was that was there at UNK there were a man
yes
mm
who was at UNK in your time
s that came from UNK
oh
no there's nobody in it now
mhm
was UNK one of the big
it was the it was the biggest next to holland
thank goodness aye
and then the next biggest then well UNK would've been somewhere about sixty acre and UNK was roughly about the same i think
and the next biggest then i think was about thirty six acres or so
there were a few of the houses about thirty six or forty acres
and a lot of the others then may thirteen or fourteen acres
some of them down to six and seven
so holland was by far the biggest
mhm
was it quite a good going farm
oh aye
mhm
good land and that
oh aye a lot of good land on it
gets a bit of sea UNK somewhat but a lot of good land on holland
and was it m mixed farming or what kind of farming
oh aye mixed farming aye
mhm
they worked at holland worked with the hens and pigs when i was there and the cattle
usually just store cattle
UNK they used to work a lot with finishing the cattle sell them for
take them out
do you remember things like the wild white UNK
can you remember was that before
aye that was started afore i mind much about it
but er i mean it always er gained there was just a few working with it and they saw the improvement it was making and then everybody for the wild white UNK
and did you was that
aye oh aye
did it make a big difference
mhm
it certainly made a big difference
what do you mean just in the quality of the cattle or in the
well the aye the quality of the cattle cos it gave you a better grass better feeding before that you see they bought some UNK
but it wasn't like the long white er the wild white UNK but it did only did maybe a year or two
it was only a grass seed and they used to grow their own grass seed and just bought the UNK seed
and there was not a great lot of the UNK about until they started with this wild white UNK
a lot of them worked with er UNK it stayed in it didn't go out with the sea UNK
well what
oh it was UNK and aberdeen angus mainly
and that's what you had at holland
aye mhm
aye well there were some of the no there were no there were no at er holland
er there were at UNK when i was there
but it was just the UNK and the aberdeen angus that was at holland
and do you remember you must remember sort of changes in the chemicals that were you know that was used on the land in the in the time that you were
oh aye
when you started what kind of UNK did you use
there weren't used much first i started just UNK and UNK
and very little artificial manure
if they were short of UNK or something they'd maybe put on sulphur or UNK and super UNK and UNK and then they started then with slag
slag on it maybe er five or six years you get a heavy dose of slag
and that certainly helped land
and it made better grass
and who did you buy that
they usually some of them would just order it through the UNK the merchants through the shops here
and some of them would take it maybe themselves just or in kirkwall
did they come up sometimes selling
aye there some as come up travelling for seeds and for manure
and did it make a big difference
oh aye it you see but er if you did put artificial manure on you see
oh it worked all right there was very little manure used when i was a boy you used UNK
and you used to when you got home from school follow the plough and UNK the UNK into the into the UNK
and it was
putting it right in and
aye and if it was very dry you had to tramp it down with your feet
some er UNK at the front of the plough and some UNK er behind the plough
it spread the UNK
was the UNK better than UNK
oh UNK was best i think but er UNK
oh aye mhm
always something to do
and if you'd nothing to do then
eh
oh aye we'd have had in the process mind
you maybe deserved it
aye
the sheep
i think it was twenty i think
well er the sheep they were usually only the UNK when they the lamb so they were usually on UNK just on bits of grass
then you had to UNK them every day when the wool started to get loose on them you had to the UNK would get in a and you had to clear their UNK
did you do anything with the wool at that time
oh it was just sold we were getting as much for the wool then as for
aye she used to
did she
aye she used to aye she used to
what did she use it for
for socks mainly and UNK
oh she used to make a lot of the clothes
and she used to i mean her making the jackets and that for us
buy the UNK and make a UNK jacket
took a pattern off an old UNK coat or something like that
was that
aye that's common with some of them aye
they used to make the their own UNK
did they
aye brought the cotton and my mother used to make UNK they were i think it was
when i was a boy
but er afore she married she used to make UNK coats and then er
they painted them with er raw UNK oil
she used to they were made of cotton aye
and UNK on the sewing machine and then painted them all with raw UNK oil but raw UNK oil took a long while to dry but they soft
and if they were in a hurry they would maybe paint them all with what they called paint oil which was the boiled UNK oil
it certainly dried quicker but the UNK got very hard and it was no time till it when you were walking
and did
aye
mhm
all that material and stuff did they bought that or send for it or
oh they sent for the cotton or whatever to make the UNK
the shop didn't sell that then
aye the shop aye
but they sent the wool away to UNK for blankets
aye
mhm
aye if you wanted like wool away and you got
and they used i think they used to do that with blankets
for blankets they would send so much wool away and you got blankets
mhm
oh aye
mhm
oh yeah
mhm
it was where the last weaving UNK was until well he was there at UNK
and then er he got er well the land up at holland
and he UNK back and forth to the UNK
built a house there and got a house there
the UNK i think er they did the work and the UNK provided the roof and the all the woodwork i think
and he UNK
aye
he had the weaving UNK i think at the whether he ever had it set up at the i couldn't say
but he certainly had it at the at the i think it probably maybe still there i couldn't say
what kind of cloth did he make
blankets mainly i think
well i just couldn't really say
mainly blankets but they were awful heavy and blankets
there's some of them blankets i UNK be here on north ronaldsay yet i think
is it that wouldn't have been north ronaldsay
aye
it was i think it was
mhm
mhm
no
it was stopped a while afore i mind
mm
i tell you something i wanted to ask you UNK society was that
never in my time but i've heard it spoken about here
aye had the UNK word some of the older heard the UNK word but that was afore me time
no
no
what about farmers unions did you ever have that conditions that you were working in
oh no there were
there were no unions no
oh no
no never any union at all
you were taken on as a boy and er you got a boy's wages but you were expected to do as much work as a man
you couldn't maybe do the ploughing and that but if you were out spreading UNK you or neeps you'd to just the same as the men and the man may man might be getting maybe about twenty pound in the half a year and the boys maybe only getting twelve or something like that
you
how long did it take you to work up to getting a full man's wage
well it'd be about two pound every half a year
so you had to wait
aye
mhm
where did you go after holland
well i was er twice in UNK at 's well after he left holland
and then i was at UNK
and then i was back at holland for another four and a half year
and then i was four and a half year in sanday
and then i was back here then and i worked er at UNK for a year and then i work at UNK and sydney was at UNK then
what was it like at holland when you came things changed a lot
well er it was only i'd been a wee while at er UNK and a wee while at UNK till i were back at holland but it was a different farm i was in then it was a bit different
i was in er holland
no
no
same name but no connection but the same name
originally aye
mhm
and had changed a lot in that time then
it changed a lot basically the with the food and everything
different
well the idea of farming was much the same but he certainly was not very much of a farmer
mm and was his treatment any different
slightly but then him and me didn't get on
he never wanted me there in the first place
oh
well that's
aye
mhm
that must have gone on a lot
oh aye
aye and then he'd leave
in fact he and then UNK from UNK was in it for a while
and he away to UNK in and then the s took it on and they've been in it since
and it's changed they out winter the beasts there now it used to be that the beasts was in all the time in winter
when i was a boy of fifteen you were expected to half acre of neeps in the day
did what to do expect you to get on with and
they expect you to get on they tell you what to do and you had to make the best
it must have been a long day for a boy of that age
it was long day you know
oh maybe
aye
and what was school like when you were going to school
it wasn't so bad er UNK was not very far from the school
and it wasn't so bad
firstly we had UNK for a teacher and he certainly was awkward
was he
aye
did he
aye
who was the first teacher
when i started it was with UNK and she were married in north ronaldsay with the brother of sydney roy
and she was the first teacher and there was mi mr who was the head teacher
and er UNK got married and she stopped the teaching and died just that same year and then there was the a change for the both teachers
UNK come as the head teacher and er there was a miss that was er the pupil teacher
aye
i never had he was never my teacher for i was i was with a pupil teacher
until he died and then i was just
and was it two teachers in the school
aye mhm
there were thirty
so maybe but usually thirty
and what sort of things did you do in the in the
what do you remember
oh i couldn't tell you very much about it
i can't mind
playing
mhm
played and things of that kind
tell me what is
well they were usually a line of kids standing along the wall or something and one set out in the middle of the field and then you had to touch them and then you'd be back to the wall and they had to do it
you changed places one of them catch them
aye
mhm
mhm
aye and mind the UNK they used to play a lot with instead of marbles they were working with
the boys didn't play with
no
that's funny isn't it
the boys was trying to play football or something of that kind
or if the ground was kind of wet we used to er make slide then and UNK along on it and if the ground got dry we would get a old bucket or something and run round to the tap at the tank at the back of the school and get a lot of water wet till you could slip on it
and that
tell me about rob UNK this teacher was it UNK
it was UNK aye
what sort of teaching did he give then
well he just well he gave us er algebra and UNK geometry and maths and that we were no use
and he certainly had not much patience and we had never seen this afore
if you made mistakes you got the strap you didn't even get the strap just for UNK you got it for mistakes and that
aye
oh every day nearly
depending on the mood he was in
ah he was here for what twenty two from thirty two to thirty nine
mhm
he'd away just at the start of the war
i was left school afore he left
i was when he left
i to the school after i was fourteen just for a wee while
aye
and i wouldn't let him give me the strap then
what were you
eh
i wou i wouldn't hold out my hand i was fourteen
really
mm
if he gave me a UNK i tried my best to get me heel of my boot down on the UNK something of that kind
when you when you were a young boy i was gonna ask get off the island manage to get
i was never away off the island until er i started to work at holland
the first the first half a year that i was holland i don't think i was away for a holiday but then the next summer then i was away
just for er a few days
for the plane was started here then you see
what did you think to it
it was alright we were got a flip on the when the plane first was just started here well all the UNK and that was er called out on saturdays to gather the loose stones
gather them in buckets or baskets and cup then in
and we all got a flip on ronaldsay for our trouble
was that
mhm
what was it like
oh it was fine yeah
what was the plane like
oh we enjoyed it
was it were there many seats
aye just was five or six i think
it was the we used er to go into kirkwall with mainly
the old repeat planes
oh but he was alright as a pilot
he did some of the flying himself but he had other pilots
i forget was one of them and i forget the names now
and what did you think plane someone who'd never been away from
aye
you weren't frightened
oh no
no
well was there UNK much going back and fore in the boat
not really that many there were maybe the holiday trip to kirkwall maybe just for the day into kirkwall
my father was maybe in once or twice when i was a boy and he was maybe buying a horse and that but he was very seldom out of the island that i mind
and i don't think i can't mind my mother away at all
i don't think she was ever away for a holiday
never away
well she was in her younger days but after she married aye after i was born i can't mind her being away
you know
my father was not often maybe once or twice would for buying a horse or change a horse or something of that kind
he went into kirkwall
mhm
mhm
what happened when you were
did you
sometimes aye some of the UNK come out you see and
mhm
aye
UNK were only used once a fortnight if there was weather
sometimes you'd maybe not get a UNK for maybe six weeks if the wind was to the south east
getting er low on sugar and stuff er landed here with a plane
it must have been a big difference when the plane was
mhm
do you remember that as being a oh aye well you see they had they had the mail service here before the war
to north ronaldsay
and then er it was stop

see well you could er i still went with the horse and cart down there on a saturday take the meat still the same i done that for a year or two
you see we only had the one van you s cos the one van was wanted to go to UNK on a saturday again
right so you had the UNK van and the horse

i used to bring them home and then well father and me used to slaughter them on the monday you see and perhaps a UNK on the monday and every UNK every monday morning the men from the farm cos he had a farm you see used to bring perhaps twenty bullocks up through the street and he used to pick one out to kill every monday
then they used to take the others back and put them in the yard again
yeah that was every monday that was yeah
see there weren't no lorries to get them about we used to have to drive
this was during this was before and during the war
yes oh yes and er he used to buy some bullocks from mr ro mr la from UNK
him and mr he was another butcher he was a UNK and he used to perhaps buy twenty or thirty between them and we used to drive them home from UNK and split them
you know where wa where the garages up here
yes
we used to split them up and his men take his that way and th we used to bring ours this way yeah
you seem to have done a lot of work with other UNK and people around the area
oh yeah well it was people he knew you see yeah
and this mr you see he used to have several in the course of twelve months they used to have several bullocks cos he used to keep perhaps well up to eighty to a hundred bullocks a year for fat yeah
well then that all finished
that all finished when the lorries when the lorries come about
the lorries used to fetch them then
UNK market cambridge market
UNK market and cambridge then that changed
bury market
yeah we used to have yeah we used to have bullocks from bury
he used to go on a wednesday my father did yeah
well that were the meeting place for all of them all the different butchers
have a little drop of UNK each you know in the pub and chat
that was the general thing
but then in the war in between in the war time
you'd better come in here
aye in between in the war time you picked your meat up from the depot
oh yeah
at
yeah
at er
UNK yeah
UNK where it's allocated out to
in the war
yeah in the war time
i used to be one of the UNK over there as well
yes
yeah we used to have perhaps three lots come in a week
one on monday wednesday and on a friday
what was it one and UNK worth each
oh it weren't so much one and
one
sixpence
one and six
that's what
yes
the ration was
i know it varied from one and four up to
yeah
to one and seven during the during the war time
yeah
cos we were you know well hard up for food at well everybody was really weren't they
yeah
during the war at some
yeah
at some
oh yeah
some part parts of the war time
yes
what was the weekly allocation for meat in UNK
what here
yes here
in what just for us
for the people who were buying meat from you
oh about
that's what i said that was one and four
oh about one and six
one and six to one
paying
and seven
this is for the week
they used to have roughly yeah
and they could choose what they wanted from that
there was on yeah there was only small quantity though during the war you know
what sort of meat were you selling then
well though some of it was coming from UNK that used to be UNK beef
some of it was australian some and then you had the english you see as well but they was all allocated out to so much you a week how many books you had how many customers you'd got
and lamb th we always used to say they were UNK
yeah there was one
yeah
didn't we
one time we had
we always used to say
we had a real UNK of UNK didn't we
yeah and you just said they were UNK
yeah
they were that shape
why did you
because of the shape right
yeah they were so small and narrow
they were UNK alright but we used to call them UNK
UNK
and what other kinds of meat did you sell
oh well you were
during the war
allocated UNK beef
you had so much UNK
per
beef a week
per book
yeah
i think UNK beef was about
quarter wasn't it
quarter something like that
yes
per person
what about erm er pigs and things like that
well you was okay the pigs used to come over as well you see and the la english lamb if there was any and the english beef you see and there was so many cows killed then as well
they used to call that b beef that was a lower grade
that was marked with a b in the UNK and
right
if you was all UNK to get one of them cos you'd make a bit more of it
right
you'd got a bit more margin you see
well yes
hadn't you then
where the best beef was a little more money you see that was priced two different prices
that was
there
very hard wasn't it to make it go to stretch it wasn't it
well yeah sometimes you see the bull was killed as well you'd perhaps get a quarter of bull beef you'd gotta shift
you know that's
i
tough
i remember once i UNK our piece
yeah
i UNK it
yeah
and we couldn't eat it on the sunday and
no
so i turned round
could not
why
no
could you not eat it
that was bull beef
bull beef
oh right
our second class beef you see
then i put it in a UNK and i UNK it the next
yeah
day
yes
war time
yeah
but still after that we i mean
well we picked up after the war a bit
it picked up yes
couple of years after the war it got sort er bit more UNK you see
then er on a saturdays our slaughterhouse was our slaughterhouse was still open up the street then and we used to perhaps kill twelve fourteen pigs for private people but they had to give their ration up six months' or twelve months' ration up to have these pigs
they perhaps had to give two books up
yes i see
they perhaps kill a pig you know roughly this size or we have killed them up to thirty four stone yeah each
we used to do that saturdays then UNK i used to well we used to have the clients come
i used to cut them all up and they used to leave me the legs you know the UNK and the backs and they used to have a few joints off and take home and then the rest i used to lay it put it into bacon down the cellar
used to go down well i used to be down every night rubbing the salt in this to make the bacon and i had a UNK down the yard where i used to smoke the bacon
i used to have it changed every monday i used to empty the UNK put that in the slaughterhouse to dry and then put a fresh lot in the UNK and start her off again with oak UNK
that's what you use for that to make the bacon brown you know yeah
i used to do that every monday yeah
can you just go back to the picture for a minute
yeah
erm can you tell me the weights of the different UNK
that's right
these
what there
yes
that UNK would weigh about three hundred pound yeah that's large you see yeah
mm that's very heavy isn't it yes
and those sheep these especially these two sheep they'd weigh about ninety pound each
they'd weigh just double what they are today more than double
yeah they're thirty five
they're about thirty five pound the sheep are today where these are over nineties yeah
and the pigs those pigs would weigh roughly about eleven score yeah
they'd weigh about erm twelve thirteen stone to put it in weight the pigs would yeah
and the bullocks
the bullocks well i suppose bullocks like this weigh about seventeen eighteen hundred weight alive when they was on their feet you see yeah
your father looks very smart there shirt
oh he was ever so clean
always we could never keep a kettle of hot water in the house
why was that
well he was always washing his hands
really
yeah
every hour or
and mother used
so
when mother used to have a servant you see she'd put the kettle on for herself
well he'd come in from the shop he'd have that kettle of hot water to wash his hands
then when the girl wanted it she damn me she said this here's empty again yeah
he was a rare man
he was always weren't he ma
yes
always washing his hands
i was i was just the same
i was as bad as him when i started up in the UNK
very clean
yeah very clean man he was ever so clean
so was uncle jack so was this man mr
yes i no yes i noticed they're all wearing shirts and ties
mr harry oh yes yeah they were all smart
they used to wear a lot of the UNK with a with a wing on the hard collar you know they used to wear a hard collar then
wing collar
that
wing UNK
that mr is the UNK of UNK the dairy
people up the road here
UNK
oh yeah
today
yeah today
today
yeah
my granddad was the UNK of the
fa butchers
family
yeah
erm yes
well then er on after the war then you er ernie came and
that well that was after the slaughterhouse all the controls come off
yes then
then another chap came he used to slaughter and help us you know general work er and
full time UNK
we used to perhaps well we used to then when that started mr got a slaughterhouse you see down we used to kill his stuff as well up in our slaughterhouse and ernie used to do it well he used to do the UNK and make the sausages
yes
and dripping and UNK and make that up all that sort of job
there was always plenty for him to do
mm so how many
yeah all week
so how many men were working for your father did you say
we had well when we got when as we got older us younger ones our business got larger
that grew with us you know
we used to kill three bullocks a week and about nine sheep
nine pigs
when was this
well i'm going back well we was doing that when we left off eight nine that'd be nine years this june
we was killing three bullocks a week then yeah
and during the war
how many were you UNK
oh we
oh no nothing
well
nothing you know
they always used to come
from
from the centre
allocated from the ce
there was there was UNK at different places you see and all these bullocks went to the market and they was graded with the government people you see and perhaps twenty or thirty UNK go to UNK and about forty go to cambridge slaughterhouse
that sort of thing and the pigs the same during the war they all had to go in UNK then
and you got meat equal to the amount of ration books that
yeah
you had
yeah
and with very little to spare you had to scheme sometimes didn't you
oh yes yeah
mm to you know stretch it out
well you see you'll have to switch it off what i
took back
yeah
right
you know
you used to bike round you see
used to take used to go round take the first lot of orders out with you and then you'd get another lot of orders to take back
used to bike back with them pass down the UNK and round the common and up and home again
so the UNK do that you see you used to keep a boy or perhaps two boys
they was apprentice then you see those days
in those days
was this during the war or before
no this was after well after the war
well after the war
that was before the war
yeah
he had he used to have one boy with him during the war UNK he now lives at UNK
he'd be about UNK be eighty now you know getting on yeah
he used to go around with him and bike around with orders yeah
then after i got old enough well i had to do it as well yeah
weren't no good saying you wouldn't do it you had to do it and you had to go whether that was raining or not yeah cos people relied on you taking round little bit of meat for their dinner that day yeah
then they'd give you order for next morning when meat got more UNK you know when there was more of it after the war had got over
cos we was we was i don't know how long we rationed do you now
ooh no i don't
i should think two years you know when the restrictions got lifted a bit so it got better yeah
right
to go back to the picture erm
yeah
your father and his UNK are both wearing white UNK
yes that's right
erm but the other UNK wearing a UNK one
he's got a UNK apron on
is
that's what he had you see no doubt
my father they always had white my UNK i used to have a white apron when i was
why was that
boss man
well you looked better didn't you
master man
you look cleaner
master man
you know and this was er apron for er
a worker
worker like you know had on
yes that's the
that
sort of er the trade
and the UNK were
distinction
that thick what do you call it
UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK stuff that were
UNK
very thick
thick
blue
blue
yeah that's what they were
a mixture of wool and cotton
so
all three of them
so they're wearing UNK underneath the apron
oh yeah these are UNK
they're UNK all those
and they're UNK they're also wearing trousers as well underneath the UNK
oh yes yeah that's right yes
yes
mr got his UNK in his top pocket you see my father always used to only he's standing a bit that way
when you when did you first start helping to slaughter the animals
me
yes
when i was i used to go in the slaughterhouse with him when i was about nine yeah
when did you first start killing animals yourself then
myself when i was about sixteen yeah
well i was always with him i was brought up with it you see and then we got the UNK come along then yeah and it was quite easy then
i
this when you first started killing
yeah
animals you had the UNK
yes that's right yeah
had a gun you see with a blank UNK in
that was only like a that was like a bolt used to go shoot this bolt in into the brain then straight away
that was instant ever so quick
that was as quick as you'd really yeah
did you find it difficult at the beginning i mean to kill the animals and cut
no
them up
no i was always used to it i was brought up with it you see
that'd be harder with somebody strange what never been in the job
that was different for those to do it you know to UNK a way of life with er doing the animals yeah
and how long were you an apprentice with your father
all my life
i like that bit
yeah
you were always learning then
i was always learning yeah
always
father when he used to i'd seen him years ago when he was a young man he'd do a sheep in five minutes
take the UNK off
so he'd take the UNK off and cut it up
yeah
within five minutes
no you just take the UNK off and take the UNK out
unclear
and you'd hang it up like they are now you see till next day you wouldn't touch them no more
you'd let them hang till they'd set yeah
sorry
what do you mean by set
well they'd get firm you know
yes
so's you could cut them next day
you couldn't cut them that day cos they were hot you see the day you killed them the cos father was a rare man he when we got we got two UNK we used to kill a week in hand you see one lot was in one fridge that was in there a week before we touched it yeah
ah then they were ice boxes weren't they
well years ago they were you see in the shop other side of the road i don't know what he had in here other side of the road that was an ice box
they used to come three times a week with lumps of ice oh as big as that about as thick as that in bags
where was this from
come from cambridge
they used to make it at cambridge and they used to come and bring one there used to be a little door in the top of this fridge and they used to slide it in you see and then they'd that would freeze keep that fridge cold so's you kept your meat better
when he first started you see all you had was a fly safe
just a big fly safe with that metal UNK on
and or put it down the cellar in the
or put it down the cellar you see out the way
you ain't got a fridge then no yeah
and how long did it take you to cut up say one of the bullocks
what next day
the next day yes
well you'd perhaps well you'd cut that in about erm half hour
cut it up in the UNK and the UNK and erm and take the UNK off and the UNK of beef you see and your UNK and you'd take your UNK out you see cos they used to sell a lot of UNK in them days
sorry can you say that again
UNK this
UNK
UNK yeah you know like they have the box UNK today well you bought it either quarter or half pound in a lump
that was the kidney UNK out of the bullocks where the kidney lay in what you have UNK and kidney pies yeah
that'd take you about half hour to cut that up and tie it
but years ago they used to cut meat different what they do today
which wa in which way is it different
well they tie so much up today you see where years ago they'd keep cutting from it you see and people weren't so particular they'd take the lump as it was
they didn't they didn't bother about being tied up then
but you see today i mean if you go in newmarket today that's all tied up round in the windows where we didn't have it in the window no not at all
you'd have a UNK up like that and
yeah
and say to the UNK customer or if she
how much did you want
or she'd say to you up to
you'd cut what
there mr and you'd cut a
you'd cut them a piece of UNK off
right off
that wasn't tied up
no and you'd say shall i turn it round for you
which meant UNK it up and
yeah
putting a UNK in it or shall i leave it as it is you know
you didn't take no bone out
you didn't take no bone out
no
the bone was left in the UNK you just fold him round and put a UNK in him and tie him up with the string round and another one over the top
wasn't no bone see
if you years ago when they used to cut the UNK there's an h bone there what we call h bone where you split the legs when you split a UNK in halves
well they used to cut a bit of that h bone on with the UNK that weighed with it
used to saw it through that fashion like cross there that's the UNK
and that ernie being a real good UNK i mean after tuesday morning he'd always have a UNK
oh yeah
on erm come on
rollers
and chop it right down
he'd chop it down yes
in one stroke
yes it wouldn't take him many minutes to chop it down
he'd chop it down
well he would just chop and chop and chop and chop
in about four minutes
right down
yeah four minutes yeah with a big UNK
that was a big got a UNK on it
a UNK
yeah
i shouldn't think
yeah
this young lady knows what a UNK is really
now can you remind me again what you were saying about earlier
early
when you was UNK the
oh yes well i used to monday mornings first thing he always to sharp his knives
well i used to the UNK was in the cart shed you see and er i used to turn the handle whilst he ground his knives down and then he'd take them in the slaughterhouse after he got them ground and put them on this stone to get them smooth to get a fine edge on the knife
then he'd he used to try them on the UNK on his arm and if that cut them off that suited him you see
that's how he found that his knives were alright always yeah
did he do anything else special with his knives
when he was cleaning them or
oh he used to wash them and he had a proper he had a case what he made up with a UNK so as he could drop them all in
he was very particular about his knives
oh yes oh yes
a UNK a UNK
UNK yeah they called them yeah
they called them a UNK
he was always particular about his UNK knives wasn't he
and very clean
yeah
you know UNK er a body down you know UNK it right down with a with a UNK cloth we call it
so you'd first clean the UNK with a UNK cloth
oh yes used to wipe it
and then wipe it down
wipe it down
yeah
and then you'd start to cut it up
you wouldn't start to cut it up till next day
yes
after that was set yes
then you'd quarter it quarter it off you see then carry it down to the shop so as you had some beef in the shop on show in four quarters
you had the two UNK and two UNK yeah and the same with the sheep
but with the sheep used to hang them whole in the shop like these are now yeah and the pigs used to be chopped down
we used to chop them down in the slaughterhouse on two UNK you see
mark them down with your knife down the back down here you know right down so as you had a mark
then you used to chop them down this way with a UNK
i've done thousands
bullocks yeah
i used to slaughter as well you see and er and see me sister used to help us
when we got the vans ernie was with us then and he always used to UNK her knife up so as he'd give her a fresh one lunchtime to go he'd she'd start off up down from where you'd come from this morning then she'd go on to UNK and do that on a tuesday round
cut it as you go then cut the meat off
each customer come out and she'd say well i'll have er three or four lamb chops or a couple of pork chops or whatsoever and you used to cut it as you went then with a van yeah
right yes
she used to generally get home about she used to go right to you see and get home about seven o'clock at night
she was out all day
she used to go out er about eight o'clock in the morning tuesday mornings not wednesday cos we had a boy then we used to call him frank
he was a young lad and he used to go out UNK and do the other rounds and then she used to go out UNK and do down the UNK and UNK and come back and then up to UNK then home again and she'd be home by lunchtime then on a friday
then saturday morning she'd load up again and start off round down at the round mill corner along the UNK for the and back and then across to the where you come from UNK and all those houses along there and she'd get home about one o'clock from there

yeah
it used to look really nice didn't it
oh yes yeah and hundreds of people used to look at it
look with a UNK
they was always in there saturday afternoons you see then
you used to have your
we used to have my light on in this archway yeah
yard UNK mm
yeah
i mean after that
used to put a cloth over the back so as they were warm
inside the yard there was UNK up at the back of the place and we used to hang this big cloth down so they were warm
there weren't no UNK go through you see
they had four or five bullocks in there
and when was this
oh it's about nineteen sixty yeah
and then after you showed after you showed the bullocks you'd then kill them
we used to kill them perhaps three or four days later perhaps a week later
what was on the sunday before the christmas
they used to be in the boxes up the yard you see you used to lay them and feed them for perhaps a week before you killed them
you wouldn't kill them straight away cos they're so
why was that
well bullocks being UNK about they're hot and upset they don't set so well
we never used to kill a UNK straight home from market
never
never
used to let them rest
we used to let them rest
they always used to go up the farm or we used to lay them in the boxes up the yard the church yard yeah
we had big stables up there where we finished up
what about the other animals erm the pigs for example would you kill them immediately after market or would you also
no
let them rest
no they used to come home on the thursday we'd perhaps didn't kill them till monday
they used to be fed in the pen up there and they wouldn't be killed till UNK
they used to have a rest you see
but that is the trouble with meat today you see that's not UNK
they go into these big UNK from the markets kill they're all hot and UNK you see where we used to rest our bullocks and pigs and sheep
and you think it gave a better meat because
i know it did definitely
the meat was set better ever so much yeah
you tell me that you don't in fact sorry on the sunday before you killed the animals you didn't in fact feed them
no
why was that
only water
water
water
we didn't want to kill them full you see they're that was a waste of food and it wasn't so good for them
like you having an op
just the same thing
just the same yeah
now if we can go back to the cart that you've kindly given
yes
to the museum
yeah yes
where was it made
over a hundred years ago
where
where was it made
where was that
i really couldn't say
whether ernie made it years ago i shouldn't be surprised
he used to make a lot of carts
he lived in and i believe he made that one yeah
yeah i should say so
cos we used to keep two you see i told you we kept two
we used father after he got UNK he sold one of them to a man named at UNK
he was another butcher you see he bought the other cart and my father kept the best this cart you've got was the best cart yeah
and were you alone in the cart when you were going round about or did you have a boy with you
no i was alone yeah and the horse used to ge used to stay
if i got one what was a bit tricky i used to perhaps tie him to the gate but they got used to it
they knew every day you when you went on the rounds they knew just where to stop and start especially the last pony i had
it used to belong to a man name up here
he used to go into the market with him
then he give up he got you know older and we bought the pony off him and she was used to rounds you see and she was used to pulling after you'd started going down the fen she knew all the places
and you went out every day
eh
went out every day
three no twice a week down the fen
but you'd be perhaps UNK some pigs home from UNK on the monday morning you see and she might go again during the week perhaps wednesday at UNK to fetch some more three or four more pigs
with the UNK in the cart were they put on UNK or put in bags or
no they was used to cut it up smaller so as you could handle it
you know a UNK and a UNK a UNK
the UNK would be on its own you see
on that UNK on
on the UNK
on a there used to be shelves in that cart then
you see where they go can't you
that's right yes
there'd be a shelf in the middle and another one on the floor and the UNK on the back we used to cut on that
right
so the meat was placed on UNK and
yeah
shelves
yes oh yes in
right
the cart yeah and you'd cut from them
whatever the person wanted you used to cut it
she used to say i'll have a piece of UNK and i used to get it down and cut her a piece of UNK and sausages as well and pork chops
you know when things got fresh she'd perhaps have enough for all week or till you went on the tuesday you see yeah
when you're going round the UNK you must've had a very early start in the morning did you
oh yeah we'd start about used to load up about eight o'clock go down the fen yeah
you'd start then
you'd start then get home about half past three in the afternoon yeah
you'd work before that but you wouldn't you'd start
yeah
so what time were you up in the morning then
oh six o'clock before six
used to have to feed the ponies early
six o'clock they used to have their feed two or three UNK before they went out
that would consist of oats and UNK
that was their food
used to give them whole oats you see cos that was such a good standard for them for running you see
this last pony i had from mrs to UNK church she used to do it in twenty minutes and i never held the UNK
she used to know her way home
i used to stick the UNK there was a little tiny the thing has gone what's on side of the cart a little hook on the side of the cart where i used to hook the UNK on and she'd just come home herself with me on top
didn't want to touch them
and she'd draw up and come in the church in the shop yard there and i used to when i got home she'd be hot you see
i used to UNK and make a UNK of straw and UNK her all over rub all the sweat off so they didn't take cold you see
then i used to feed her and i didn't let her have any water when she was hot cos that give them UNK you see sometimes
then after she got over she used i used to give her some water then
she used to have all the water she liked after she got hot UNK off yeah
when you finished your round sorry when you finished work after you'd
yeah
been on a round what time was that
that'd be about well we used to finish close about five o'clock half past five
we won't if anybody come in we stopped open didn't we mother
yes
yeah
we used to say well we think they're done now right
yeah
erm i'll go home and get a
tea dinner ready
i'll get the
it used to be dinner for us at night you see cos we didn't have time for stopping like at lunchtime
and you'd i'd you'd say how long would we be and well we'd come to er you know an UNK
agreement on time
and he'd work until i cooked
yes
you know
just trying to see if there was any ernie i'm trying to hunt ernie up but i can't find him yet
there's one in one there with him in the UNK
yeah i know
when we fi if we do find it we'll bring it we'll bring it
that's my granddad look
oh yes
and the butcher boy and tip the dog
that was down way
yes
right
and that was you know that was my grandparents when they retired you know he was sixty five she was younger because she was eighteen when she married him at twenty six you know
all UNK were then they was always UNK right the way around
and you don't know why they were UNK
no i think they was just made like that in those days yes
what was your father holding in his hand there
oh he i should say he'd got a knife in his hand knife that'd be
that's either a knife or a steel yeah just a steel you UNK and that's a bigger steel than what they use i've got a big UNK now what i use and that's what that would be a steel
no doubt he was you know got something in his hand and just holding it with on the bar yeah
part time
when you were working with your husband in the shop what did you do
the beginning of the week i used to cut the meat like he did and erm and take orders
if anybody said if tuesday we started if anybody said on the what they want sent them wednesday thursday friday take all the orders down under their appropriate names in the book but right an UNK tuesday wednesday thursday my day off and friday and saturday i was in the office
but if there was a gap anywhere i filled it and squeezed my office work in between
and you also kept the house as well
yes
you must've found that very UNK did you
worked hard
she used to cut the meat just the same
yeah
as i did
both of us
yes
yeah
did you mind cutting the meat
no loved it
loved it loved my job
were there any times when you wouldn't work in the shop or wouldn't cut the meat
erm well just the friday and the saturday when i should be doing all the UNK you know making the tickets up
what people had tuesday wednesday thursday and they perhaps came for their order on the or their weekend joint on the friday and i'd make the whole ticket up and they'd pay and then that ticket would be torn off and if they wanted that meat delivered on the saturday that would be delivered with that ticket on the top
but erm i had to do that in between if harry hadn't got enough help
and harry then had just ernie to help on the UNK
well he was just a UNK then he always used to try and have frank another one of our butcher boys or david or frank to help him
but erm if people fell sick you know anybody fell sick well you all you had to fall in and fill their place
and er then we had a mr didn't we dad
oh and our son used to help on a friday from eleven o'clock
until evening time
until the evening
and sat
and saturday
yeah
yes
but he didn't like UNK so
why was that
he liked the farming better
he liked the farming better
he didn't like being tied up to the women
farming is UNK
you're not forced to er open at half past eight and er shut at dinner time and erm farming you are UNK aren't you
so er after what well he just didn't want to carry on
did you find it strange working in UNK
did people think it was strange you working and helping a butcher
no they just accepted me
you know i was UNK and he was harry and that's all there was to it
and then i had come from erm what shall we say a general my grandparents had kept a general shop and general i mean from baking he was a baker er a butcher a UNK and my grandmother saw after the UNK hats etcetera and the grocery
so i had co i had come from what would you say the right stock hadn't i
i can't
think of a better way that was in the blood put it like that
it was it was no erm it was natural
were there any things about the job you didn't like
any things you didn't like doing or felt UNK doing
no
you found it all quite natural
i loved it
i would never have given up not me
i would have UNK myself to the death up to the end
i did
but i would have gone further
see i didn't want to give up
i felt after working hard for twenty seven years i felt it was a shame
i didn't accept er the opportunity to retire and take it easy it seemed as if i had worked twenty seven years for nothing
but you must of had the enjoyment of the work itself
oh yes
but i would of liked to of handed it on to someone else
well our son to carry it
yes
on with it
yes
yeah
yes no
he wouldn't just
no
he didn't just like it
no
no
he'd do all the UNK do all that sort of business but he wouldn't er he did he used to come and help us UNK and saturdays but he'd rather be up the farm on his tractor
yes
yeah
i mean he's a very good UNK me UNK isn't he
oh yes
i mean he keeps these what do you call them what do you call them UNK and everything
tyres
j
j c bs
yeah that's right
and does all the work repair work to them himself
yes
but he didn't want the erm is it UNK work would you
yes
say
oh yes
or you have to please everybody
yeah
and you had to be nice to everybody don't you
and you didn't find that difficult
you
no
no
enjoyed meeting
no
no i didn't find it difficult
i mean if i didn't like the person i wouldn't let them know
when you're working in the shop er and you're helping perhaps with the UNK and things like that
no i didn't do any UNK no not me no not UNK
i was a shop girl

no
we worked clean

we used to we used to have a UNK there you see a clean UNK on the block used to wipe your hands i used to wash them
you either work clean or you work messy
work UNK yeah
and you tried to work clean
that is so yeah
yes
does that mean you have to had to work fairly slowly and carefully
no
i er we had to keep busy you see cos it was always
you had to keep
full
we always had
we was always full of customers
we always had a queue
that was queue outside there tuesday mornings all along the front of the shop
there'd be just us two see cos all the others they was out my sister was on the round

when we finished it
wipe

and then i used to
clean
then i used to UNK it at night when we'd finished
when we'd cleared the shop out and put the stuff in the fridge i used to all scrub all round all the ta you know the shelves round the sides and clean the scale down and the bacon machine and i used to UNK the block with a proper UNK
and this was
used to
every night
yeah we used to shake a bit of UNK on and then UNK it you see cos the UNK picked the blood up you see clean
that's what the UNK was for
you see actually i started once my UNK got to school
school yeah
then i started working more and more and more
more
and as they married and left home i was working
every day
every day
it was a gradual process
yeah
you know mum was doing more
er
yeah
that's what you call a family business isn't it
yeah that is a family business
that's right yes
that is a family
definitely
business
when one drops out and sits by the fire another member comes along and
take the place
takes their place
yeah
i mean your mother sat by the fire for years
yes yeah
controlling everything

i want to buy erm i want to buy a swinging chair
see in the latter part of my father's time he wasn't a well man was he
no
he used to what they call a UNK from the nose a lot
UNK
yes
used to UNK
yeah
so he er
that's the way you started when he
yes i started when he
he left off of it
he started to UNK somewhat
he used to come into the shop after a little while and he'd go back in the kitchen again and he'd come back again later on
he was never a well man
no
he was always under the doctor
yes
his last few last what twenty years was it
oh yes
yes
when people looked after their own at home you know it went on for years and years didn't it
mm
you must've had to be very careful then when he was UNK the animals if he was a UNK
he wasn't so bad then
this gradually come on as he got older you see this UNK trouble with his nose
he used to he was not like that when he was a young man he
no
was alright then
but as he got older this that was in the family though my sister was like that UNK the one what used to be with us
yes
she used to UNK
the one what's just recently died
she was a one in thirteen of
yeah
england
it's rare for a woman isn't it
rare yeah
it goes down
she used to sometimes go on the round with her nose plugged yeah
and then
she'd perhaps take the plugs out UNK when she got home when it had stopped
then she'd go in
yeah
the raf at UNK for so many days and have
have a build up the blood
so many pints of blood
perhaps six pints of blood at a time
at a time
yeah
then she'd be fit
she'd go again then for a time perhaps three or four months
see they build her up with this blood and she was alright then you see
yeah
and then this arthritis caught up with her
she had arthritis bad didn't she
mm
at the finish the last well she had arthritis about twenty seven years altogether but
you know a long time a long time
it gradually got worse
you know
yeah
wear and tear of the
oh yeah
wear and tear of the job you see it's not a woman's job really
but you
no
felt quite happy doing it
she loved it
used to keep
i
your shoulders fit didn't you
i can tell you i i've done it you know
it's wear
yeah
and tear oh
yeah
it's erm it's a man's job really
yeah
er a woman is alright in a shop just serving like they do today but we were actually cutting meat you know we were
cutting you were cutting chops and
doing a man's job
you were cutting chops and pork chops lamb chops and
yes
UNK
mm
and chuck UNK
yes we was doing a man's job
liver
working doing heavy
UNK
work
we used to sell a lot of UNK on tuesday morning
mm that was
that was cos of the fat the fat so as they just lay it over the top and put the potatoes and UNK
that's it running now the tape and this that's all you get a quiet UNK in
yes
the background there
who's going to start
hey
who's going to start
ask a question
aye i was just asking really i was just gonna ask well were you all born in this house
no andy and ann were born here
aha
and mrs was born in over the river
that was the farm
oh yes i
where our UNK came to
aha
in seventeen twenty
aha
so they came from
aha
they near at any rate
so that's a long time ago seventeen twenty
yeah
two hundred and sixty years is that right
yes
you're quicker than i am
that's just that's a long time to be you must be the oldest family in do you think
pardon
no
i think are older
really
they were longer yes
mhm
the
but you'd be one of the oldest
aye they would be the oldest family
aye
i see
and s and so wh when did you er who s who built this house or when did you move to this part
in nineteen
seven
nineteen seven
nineteen seven
just when you and why did you leave
was there
well there she
didn't
had the two places going you see
oh UNK see
yes
you mean you mean you
this place was big until my father took it over and he kept the places going and we still have the two places
aha
but the house at now is UNK i think is it
well it's they're going to sort it out
oh that's good
mhm
mr at the lodge
aha
sister in law
aha
she's married and they think they're going to make a holiday home of it just now
yes
but they are beginning to sort it up
oh that's good
cos i remember looking at that house years back you know when i was a boy walking about you know
mhm
er and do you remember living there at all or well
no i was two years when i left there
two years
yes i can't remember anything about it
no
but of course i was back and forth
oh yes
yes
but that wasn't my father's house until he got married
aha
my grandmother lived just nearby you see in the
aha
yes bits of walls
i think aha i think know where it is
mhm
mhm
i think i know where it
cos that's where my father was born and brought up in that old house
yes
he never went into the new house until he got married
and that
mm
was in the beginning of eighteen ninety nine
aha
what was your father's name
john
john
john
john
and who did he marry like
well my mother was from north UNK that's the UNK
aha
and erm they got married in eighteen ninety nine
aha
that's a long time ago
it's a great date though eighteen ninety nine
she was
ah
from UNK
yes
ah
well what do you know what brought her over this way at all
she was a UNK in
aha
with
oh i see
yes she had her aunt was a widow there at the time when she came to and she just lived about a year
aha
and that's how she met my father you see
oh i see
oh
right
see
and UNK and that's your father and mother
my father and mother yes
aye
and do you remember them well
that's away ba away back in seventeen
twenty
aha
there were two brothers came
one took a farm up in the UNK
that's a UNK way
aha
and then the other brother took
aha
over
right
and there's no from the other brother now is there
not now they're all dies out
that's a shame
they might be abroad of course cos some of them went abroad i know
aha
but er there's none of them about here
oh that's a shame mm
and my father i think just went to school in the wintertime
his father died when he was seven years of age
mm yes
and he was the second oldest of the family
so he would have had to do quite a lot of work
so he'd quite a lot of work to do when he was quite young
aha
and he just went to the sc school in the wintertime
oh i see
so
i think he was two UNK in school
but apart from that there was just the
in the winter
the winter
when things would be UNK maybe on the farm
mhm
yeah exactly
mhm
right
and that would that have been school
yes
the same
n no
it was er that building beside the free church
the old school house
yes
that was the old school house there
oh i didn't
the old school was below
aha
and the teacher's house was next door
oh i didn't that either
that's really
that was the free church school house
right so it was it specifically was
that was the time of the disruption
when you
aye y
be have the history of that i don't suppose
a little bit
i know a little how
but it would have been the other school as well
yes
the other school was
there
it was a church of scotland school
i see
but all those have come out in eighteen forty three at the time of the disruption
ah
to the free church
aha
where they did build a school for them you see
oh i see
because it's the churches that run the schools in those days
i never knew that
until about er eighteen seventy two i think
aha
and the school board was born then
aha
do you would there have been many people in that school at the time
oh i'm sure there would be
quite a lot
because there were a lot of people on the staff at that time
aye
there'd be records somewhere i'm sure of them
what did my father say
he remembered when there was fifteen UNK went up here on this
fifteen families
in this one
this one place that we have now
that's an that's a
well i was looking at i was looking at the what do you call that now
census
aha
for eighteen forty one
aha
and there was forty two people living in
i eighteen forty one
hard to believe that's amazing
and today it's three old UNK and a dog
oh dear
so other places would be equal to that
yes
so if you if you took that up and down there'd be quite a lot
yes
so you may know there wasn't very many rich people about anyway
no
except the themselves whether they were rich or not i don't know
no
that's the that was the state of affairs
and most of these folk were they just being farm workers or UNK or
yes
that's right
they'd just be living off the land
yes
there could be UNK amongst them
aha
and UNK
aha
UNK
and UNK
UNK aha
and maybe an odd carpenter
yes
but
while you're on UNK there was a UNK over at that little cottage on the other side oh well i can't explain
you know where
cottage
when you're passing by and going to go down to
you know where is
yes
yes
well you cross that iron bridge there's
aye
an old cottage on the top
yes i know it
well that cottage
oh right
and what relation is to him
well the was UNK great grandparents
and he's the governor general of australia today
sir UNK
oh
he used to come for holidays as a wee boy
i remember him
aha
aye
of course they weren't er well off or anything there but he was a clever boy you see
yes
he went in for law
aha
so he was a he was a lawyer or a judge i think in
i think he was a judge in india
mm
i just can't tell you
so he's the present governor general of australia and that was his great grandfather that was a UNK over in that little cottage
that's amazing
connection
they're related to us too
aha
we're connected with them you see
yes
they're mostly the country old country people now
related to one another
yes they would be
they wouldn't out
aye
well that's
it's quite interesting that
it is see the difference
mhm
now again
it's just across the river here
yes
there were a woman born and brought up there she was annie before we married and her UNK is
the duke of UNK private
er not a pilot but
no
what is it
UNK
UNK
oh yes
yes well he's promoted since then
yes
and he's
queen's flight
yes i think he's er the leader of the queen's flight what do you call that
commander
i suppose something like that
mhm
well he used to come here for holidays
and it shows how some people get on
yes
yeah he was just
you never know you never know you might get on like that
oh no
we'll see
we'll see
ah he used to come up here when he was a wee boy with his granny
aha
and when the granny come up again without him she told that when he went to back to glasgow if he came in hungry he would say oh for a plate of UNK
very good
UNK now not with the duke
yeah
no maybe that's
it kept him going
i was i was gonna ask you who or what does the mean the name
the mouth of the river i think
mouth of the river
UNK is the
aha
mouth and
i think
is
i thought you thought it was the UNK
well it's where the where the and it meets
yes
i think it's that's the UNK you see
oh yes
aye
at the mouth
the mouth of the river
and means the face of the sheep UNK
really
mhm
i didn't know that
it's gaelic
it's gaelic is it
aha
well what would the original gaelic have been for that
ah
it's to analyze that you would think it was the UNK face but it's the face of the UNK
sheep UNK
face of the sheep
the sheep
c o t e s not c o a t s
c
c o t e s
c o t e s like a UNK you know
oh i see
a UNK a shelter for sheep
mhm
right
down south they would call it
aha mhm
sheep
oh i see
mhm
right
because you often you see the english word you've no idea where it comes about it's just an odd word when it's been
mhm
changed you know
mhm
UNK or whatever
h how long is it since was UNK
oh well er i think it was the last
och no
oh aye
i think
it'd be in the fifties
aye
er
i think so
another thing i was gonna ask you as well your father your parents both spoke gaelic obviously
oh yes
and did they speak it to you when you were children
yes
my mother did but my father didn't very much
no
he mostly spoke english to us younger ones anyway
yes
but er we used to answer when our UNK speak to us in gaelic we'd answer her back in english
oh
us younger ones
aha
but er
UNK and my older sister mary they were perfect gaelic speakers
mhm
they used to speak gaelic to one another when they were children
yes
UNK in gaelic
but we were never as UNK as that you see because er they went to school then and they started coming home with english you see ad speaking english and we just
yes
mhm
never got the same chance
no i and was it not UNK a wee bit at school
no i don't think so here
i heard it had been said that it was UNK but er
i heard that said aye
i don't think so never heard of it
aha
right but you understand quite a bit of it still
oh i understand it as good as english
aha
aye anybody speaking gaelic there is just the same to me
aha
as though they were speaking english
aha
right so
there'll not be many gaelic speakers left here now
no
very few
gerald i believe
yes
yes
gerald
and his wife
yes
and little
oh yes
is he
aye he's a gaelic speaker
although if you if you say anything to him in gaelic he answers you in english i notice
yes
oh yes
he speaks gaelic
yes
yes
he's just UNK of course
mrs
that's right yeah
i think UNK has been learning gaelic i think she's not a UNK by any means but ian 's wife you know
ian 's wife
she's learned gaelic recently
is that so
aye
she's getting quite good i think
oh well
not a UNK
dawn can speak gaelic
och not very well
no but he understands it quite well
i ask you when you were younger did you would there have been many of the folk in the place spoke gaelic or was it dying out then or
oh no quite a lot
the older folk
the older people
right
the older people's all gaelic they would speak
so yes
so you would get quite a quite a lot of it you would hear
oh yes
aha
of course you there would just been my father and UNK be speaking gaelic all the time in the house you see
yes
and we were it was just to us like english
yes
only we didn't practise speaking it you see
yes
yes
aye
and the UNK that were here too they would they come from the west
aha
and they would have gaelic
so we was brought up in that atmosphere
it would have been quite interesting having the two languages
it would have been quite
yeah
quite er
we just
you do you g get a best of both maybe i would imagine you know
be quite sort of interesting it was just er d i was gonna ask you about your name as well it doesn't sound very
it's not very high
it's a name
aye aha
i think
aha
and it was
yes i think originally it came from in
aha
that's where the first
aha
and i think that's where the chief of the UNK is i think
mhm
he's adrian
aha
aha
but whether he's still alive or not i don't know
but there are quite a few round and these places
aha
mm
that's good
so i think jimmy UNK back to the first
aha
who was UNK from william the lion
aha
that was the first
yes
a UNK of william the lion that was king of scotland at one time
i wasn't very good at history myself
no
no not that far back anyway
that was just that's quite interesting
erm i was also gonna ask you about the farm
would you all have worked in the farm when you were young
oh we did a little bit anyway
yes
may used to drive the horses even in the binder
aha
with a binder with a
yes with three horses in it
aha
she had to cut the harvest one year
was away up at or something
aha
so that wasn't bad going
no not at all
well was the harvest
aha
you
aha
working at the horse
you liked the horses
i liked the horses yes
i i'm scared of horses myself
oh well
i like to see them
i liked i liked sheep
aha
sheep
so i work on down the UNK quite a few times
aha
now we've we haven't got you see
when did you actually give up the farm as such
i mean when did you stop
i think in seventy seven i think
seventy seven aye
you see
oh i see
let it for the summer and autumn
right
cattle and sheep
but i mean do you not it's not your
that's right
not your stock
do you miss the farm work a lot
oh yeah
oh aye
oh he cuts UNK he's been busy cutting UNK
aha
do you cut well where do you cut your UNK round here
pardon
where about do you cut your UNK
away up across the overhead bridge here you cross the you know the overhead bridge
aye the railway line
aha
aha
you cross that and you go way up the hill about a mile
aha
aha
you take them back with the with the land rover there
no the tractor
i still have the tractor and trailer
oh i see
aha
what time of year do you cut the UNK
well er the best time is the month of may
aha
but this year you couldn't the weather was so
so bad
bad
i never cut them all till about beyond the middle of june
aha
but they're fairly dried out
that er
aha
good hot days we got and those UNK too
aha
dried them out very well
i must admit when i when i came in the door there the first thing i noticed was the peat smell
oh well yes
yes
yes you would
and it's lovely
takes your right off
it's lovely it's really it's a great smell you know
it's like it's like going back in time the feeling about it
aha
it's a great smell
and i never i never thought to ask you about if you cut UNK now
mhm
and i remember we used to do it erm at the UNK
och while back now since we stopped
i remember cutting the UNK you know
ah
my father and a few of us would take the tractor and stuff
but nobody i think does it now up there
i do i don't know why
i mean it's good fuel
yes but it's too much like work we're too busy doing everything
aye i think so
i think that's what it is
but the UNK itself used to cut a lot of peat for their own
aha
for the UNK use
aha
oh they used to cut a big lot
but they stopped it i'm sure twenty years ago
yes they get all UNK now
is it finished
oh no it's a good bit yet
i cannae can't quite see
what's the next head
well just it's one of the other things i was gonna a it's still about the farm actually i was gonna ask er about things like h your tasks your was there anything like things like the UNK would you have people coming in to help you
would other farmers help
no not often
you would just do it yourselves
do it ourselves yes
yes
you would there wasn't a traditional
they did occasionally
aha
a neighbour might come in or two neighbours might come in and help
aye
with the in
aha
and you would have built erm UNK was it
yes round stacks
oh aye
cos i think there was all different styles of those wasn't there
that's right
have your own
did you not have to be off the ground a wee bit or something
well we used to put er branches below them to
aha
keep them from UNK the
aha
wet off the ground
aha
yes and a UNK inside you know with three legs a UNK
a UNK a UNK
oh yes
and then if they got in good condition built up solid
aha
and how many UNK would you have in a good year
oh well UNK we'd have about ten UNK right
aha
and i remember the most corn stacks we had was twenty five
aha
but er as a rule there'd be about sixteen or there about
aha
corn stacks
that's quite good though
oh yes
quite
so that's what you would have done with the corn the hay was the hay the UNK
that's right the hay and the straw
you UNK the straw you see and
aha
the straw
aha
do you know if there was any mills around about
meal mills or
oh right
this was one just behind the
yes
yes
i know
well
i know
i remember
and that would have been
made the meal was it
made the meal yes
aha
for the local people
would there have been anybody like a baker who would have baked it or
no i don't think there
no
was a baker here
no
home made
all home made
aha
aha
the bread
aye
there was a UNK mill at where they UNK the wool you know
i didn't know that at all actually
that's where er mrs used to live there
i remember
who's in it now
somebody took it over
you know where the council houses are
yes
and there's that square house down to yeah
oh yes
that's a UNK mill
i'd heard it was a mill
i didn't know it was a UNK mill
aye it's for UNK wool
aha
it was away during the war for scrap but we or maybe not maybe they took the works away too
aha
for scrap
and do you know when that stopped at all
about nineteen six i think
aha
quite a while back
mhm
quite a while
i was just thinking about also sheep UNK and stuff
that you'd have done that yourselves as well
yes we used to a whole lot would come here and i'll go somewhere else the next day you know we used to help one another to sheep UNK
oh right
yes there were quite a crowd
aye
the sheep UNK
and would had to make food for them and stuff like that
yes we did
yes
it would be quite a busy time
well it was just a dinner you made for them you see
aha
and they'll get tea at in the stack yard or wherever they were
aha
oh
and they would be all the hand UNK of course
oh all the hand UNK
mhm
and how many days would it take
oh maybe a matter of four or five hours we'd take here
oh right
we had
two hundred and fifty sheep
but if you'd
they did the harvest first you see
aha
and then they did the sheep with the UNK
right
and that
was the biggest that had been about here
aha
there's be about twenty UNK at it
that's quite a lot
there would be about a thousand to do in a day
aha
quite hard work
long day quite hard
UNK need a hand UNK around here now
not very much
they all
doing it the other day
i was doing it the other day yes
aha
yeah
down the valley
they're still doing a wee bit there
but er there were two boys who a machine beside
another thing i was gonna ask you about was erm i'd heard somebody mention ploughing competitions with horses
oh aye yes
i wondered if you remembered any of them at all
yes because i UNK
ah you did
yes
i was at the first one when i was fifteen
aha
was it quite a big thing around here was it
oh what a great day match
where would they hold it
oh on different farms
say here one year maybe another year up and
aha
different places
aha
well they'd just get a suitable field to keep the whole lot
you get half an acre each to do
half an acre that's quite a lot
mhm
the horses would be all dressed up and everything
UNK and
be lovely that
nineteen thirty first was the ploughing match
nineteen thirty five
here
they still have it in with but we never had a one here
no it was just
the same
no i wouldn't think so
horse were nice
would they have been the big heavy horses the big UNK
well they were mostly the UNK but oh there were some light horses in it too
mhm
but it was mostly the UNK
that would be it would a s the UNK plough would it be or the UNK line would it have
yes that was counted in it too and it had to be well parked
each UNK parked against the other to keep the you see
if you had holes in the seed bed that was a fault
aha
it sounds like quite a skill
ah
just i was just gonna ask you really to maybe just a change you know the difference between day and know maybe you can see quite a difference just er
well of course you will the population was
yes and er the motor car
no nobody with UNK when we were young
aha er you mean all horse transport or
or walking
aha
or the bicycle of course
but hardly anybody had a car
but
well except the
and the doctor
who
oh the doctor
relations
yes we remember going to school would see the doctor's car
aha
if he happened to come up the way
the roads would they have been quite good or
oh they were quite good
well not as good as they are now
they were er what you would call er broken metal on them
aha
and rolled in
rolled in and what you called er water bound roads
er they done the broken metal and then they put on the top of it and then they come along with a UNK cart and er UNK water on it and then
aha
drove the down between the
aha
the broken metal and then the steam roller was back and fore on it and it was quite a good surface you know but
aha
mm
it was pretty rough and we used to go in summer you know UNK
aha
and we'd run in the middle of the road and today we couldn't stand it
no tough
it would quite suitable for horses and stuff
it would be very suitable for horses even more so than on the present roads there's a better grip
aha
for horses
but er that kind of road would be no use today with the speed of the cars it would just
too noisy
UNK up in no time and
aye
oh yes
we used to see a lot of UNK and UNK of sheep
aha
you know on our way to school and it was just grey UNK of sheep with perhaps
oh aye
two UNK with them
coming from c as far as UNK
yes
i don't know where they'd been
making their way south
what quite big UNK of sheep
big UNK of sheep
aha
and two or three UNK with them
and i remember it was a one lot was a
a mr from UNK
aha
how long would he
walking to the south
be walking a way down south
aha
mm
would he would he ever stop and down on the way or something like you know overnight
well that's in er either stopping he stopped here one night
do you remember the deaf shepherd we called him
yes
he left his flock up there and stayed here all night
i think that's the only one i ever remember
cos we were off the road a wee bit you see
yes
i remember er a flock staying here and the UNK got their supper here and then they went on to for the night
oh aye
was a long time ago
would have been a UNK wood i suppose at some point
this would have been quite a popular route
oh it would really yes
an old inn you see
i think it was
aha
built about seventeen forty five i think
aha
the origin of inn
aha
that's a bit old
and now they're taking it down
that's quite sad
aye
aye
very sad indeed actually
i'm not really sure what they're gonna put in its place
when d when did the road go through here
oh well the
in i mean
oh well it er general he made the first road
aha
when would that be about seventeen something
about seventeen twenty
yes
i think
something along that line
up to anyway
and then there was it was improved after that
it was known as the old edinburgh road
aha
the improved one
it's followed 's road most of the way but it's it went different routes some places just to take away a steep
aha
but i think the pre er well not the present a nine but the a nine that was there before they made the new one it was made about eighteen thirty i think
aha
up through to
yes
see the other roads went by
oh yes
and this was up by bridge end and up
aha
by
and there's a new for the place since the railway went through
oh really
yes it means the hill of the UNK
aha
there is a UNK hill at the back
yes i used to play on it when i was a boy
is that so
my favourite place to play
well it was it was known as before
my father always c called the place
well the well the first post office was built just where now it was on estate so they called the post office
oh i see
and did away with the stuff there
right yes
and then when the railway come through the station was also estate
yes
it was called station
aha
oh i see
and then
and before that it was known as
aha
a nicer name
it is really
yes
that station
well is quite nice in the gaelic but er when they change it into english they
yes
it loses its flavour
it does i agree with that
it's much nicer name for the whole area really
yes yeah
do you know what the means at all
the white
the well
the white river
no was white you see it was an irish word i think and it was known as the
that's how we'd you see
oh i see
and i think it means the white
mm
and originally the white UNK
oh
that's what it came from
it's irish
i'd never have guessed that
it's a nice r it's a nice river
it's six sixty miles long
the
yes if you sort of
i see
it's a lovely river
oh yes
mm
there's another down in er UNK
aha
and this was but they put a d in it to
ah
to distinguish
to distinguish the two
yes i see
mm
the gaelic is
aha
and you see ireland is
yes
you see it came from the same thing
aha
or something
yes
yeah
it's an old sounding name
mhm
i was meaning to ask about the would you wouldn't have any idea the number of people who would have been in your early days here
oh no
no
would there not be would there be two or three times the number now or
oh no i don't think so
of course the UNK had been made bigger it er put up the population a good bit
ah
but then a lot of the other part of the er disappeared in the UNK days
aha
yes well when did they start UNK about eighteen fifteen or thereabouts eighteen si
eighteen twenty
well in eighteen twenty one th the population was one thousand one hundred and twenty odd
aha
if i remember right
one thousand one hundred and something anyway
aha
but i think when i was young we used to say that er the population about here was five hundred
aha
but i don't know what it is now
i think it's hundred or something
i'm not sure
we don't even know the people now
no
well you know how many people would you know in now at all
not awful many
not very many the
yes
oh well yes
and the down of course
anyway
there're all them in the farms we know all them right enough
yes
a whole lot in the council houses the UNK i don't know them at all
yes
i don't know
och aye
well i know the UNK and his wife and ian and the wife
but the other keeper i don't know
mhm
it's amazing how it changed really
yes
do you think there was more of a sense of community then or
pardon
do you think there was more of a sense of sort of community in those days
where people would know each other better or
oh yes
oh yes i think they would
each other everybody would know one another in the UNK days
aha
well a way back in the last century they had to go looking for a life a living elsewhere because of the poverty of the place
yes
there was far too many people for the land
i see you couldn't
and there was no other work besides
aye
to keep them going
did you ever travel anywhere yourselves from at all
well
the borders
oh yes
but
oh yes
he used to go here and there
yes
the western isles
i reached the borders
aha
i just saw england i was never in it
ah right
but i was in the most of the islands you know
yes
but you've mostly lived here
oh yes
yes
yes
so this is definitely home
i was just UNK interesting to ask about was erm well just how people pass evenings you know did they go visiting each other or
yes there were a lot of that done
yes they would
there was a lot
mhm
what they called UNK
aha
and what would happen in a UNK
oh well just talking and when anybody came here they used to just talk about old stories and things like that
aha
oh yes
maybe the local gossip that was going at the time
ah yes
would there be anybody singing at all or
no i can't remember an anybody singing
not unless a drunk man came in
but occasionally a tramp would come
aha
and er he'd a night's shelter and a in the stable
aha
oh
oh we'd some UNK that used to come here
oh they used to come with boxes of jewellery and stuff and thing
oh aye
this
aha
jewellery
mm
they used to go UNK you see
yes
a box on their back and they'd open
it out and there'd be UNK and UNK and oh we though that was great
yes
yes we didn't see many
who where would they get that
or would they make it or
no they would buy it somewhere and sell it at a profit you see
i see
what you called a UNK
aha
went round the houses
and they were quite friendly were they
oh yes
oh
oh that's did you ever have many sort of musicians at all in those days
musicians
aye people UNK or
oh yes there were quite a few
michael 's father was a UNK
so was
yes
aha
and er jimmy my brother he was a piper
i'd heard that yes
i'd heard
yeah
dave 's
father he was a piper too
's grandfather
yes
and don he was a grand piper
so there w would have been quite a tradition of music as well
mhm
would it be all self taught or how
well er jimmy you know used to go down to learn to read the music
oh yes
and i think don could read the music too but they'd be more or less self taught otherwise but then they would have started playing by ear
yes
and then they learnt the music later on some of them and
ah
aha
took it off the books then
yes
mm
i was just gonna ask you another thing as well was there any tradition of local songs at all
do you know any local songs or UNK or anybody ever
well
poems even
well 's father was a UNK
aha
he'd a book of poems
have you ever seen it now
was it just one he wrote himself was it
yes
yes
oh
was it ever published or was it just
yes
yes
aha
i must find out about that
you don't have a copy or anything
yes i can get a copy for you
aha
i d i don't think you would get them to buy now but
no
i know there's a copy in the house somewhere
aha
i'd be very interested to see
i'll give a look for it before you go
aha
that was that was 's father
's father yes
aha
oh was great UNK too
i i'd heard he wrote a few things
oh that was a very good UNK
i i've been trying to see the 's about it and about getting copies of some of his poems so that people could see them you know
and i don't know what's happening but that
i just wondered if you knew any of them off hand or
we did have them somewhere but i just don't know
aha
where they are
did you ever sing or play anything yourselves or
no
you used to play a lot
och
i never UNK it though
you had a go though
i used to try
no
do you play yourself anything
i'm learning the UNK
a wee bit
oh well i see
yeah
very slowly
mhm
i don't think i'll ever master it
but er i'm trying you know
trying
i was just thinking there w there would be more music playing in those days because there wasn't a television or things like that you know maybe just to UNK people make their own entertainment you know
i was just wondering about well about that
i was also gonna ask you about was it a UNK subject but about funerals
was there any undertaker locally or
UNK
aye who would who would take care of that
well er mar mary 's father used to do the UNK
oh i didn't know that
and there were other joiner over and do you know what is
yes
well william he used to do them too
aha
in fact i think in those days er it's mostly the local men that
aha
did the undertaking
aha
but that's during my time that i remember
yes
so if somebody died they would they would the body or make the coffin and
make a coffin and take it to the
take it to the house
take it to the house
yes
and would how would the would the coffin be carried to the UNK in those days
mostly yes
shoulder high
sho aha
high on the shoulder
and walk all the way to the
walk all the way yes in the UNK days
aha
must have been quite a would there have been a UNK behind it or anything
oh aye yes and they'd be changing over
aha
every now and again
was there anything like an places where they used to rest the coffin or anything like that
well er they would rest it in the UNK of a bridge i think
oh yes
but i think there's some places though special places for resting a coffin
aha
aha
and then in the old days when they used to have this body UNK
yeah
you know for the for the doctors
yes
they had a little watch house
you'd see that in and
aha
there's a little watch house
yes
where the people watched for so many days there
for six weeks
six weeks
yes after the
their relatives you know
aha
bodies you see in case they would lift them
aha
and they even had a gun in with them and if they didn't go by the third shot they fired in the air you see
aha
they were liable to get shot properly
mm
so
it's quite nice of them
quite UNK
indeed
what why would they steal the bodies
for er UNK it for the
ah
doctor
ah i see the money yeah
because they were busy
UNK at that time and
ah i see
you've heard of UNK and UNK
yes
yes
well that's what it was
i never thought it went on up here though
oh yes there were watch houses here
yes there was
oh
in all the UNK
and they had to watch there for six weeks
there'd be tonight now for tomorrow night the two that was on tonight had to find the next two
oh i see
to go in their place
aha
if not they would have to stay on another night
oh
but they would only get two you see and they would go on and that two would have to find another two to go on the following night
yes
for six weeks
mhm
aye
a lot of work and UNK nights
that's why there were these flat stones on the graves you know the old
yes
so
so that they couldn't easily get them out
i see
i didn't i didn't know that
but there would've been nobody would have stolen bodies here though
surely
well
i think they did
there was er a man here his name was james and i don't know was it one of his relatives that was buried but he UNK that they came to UNK the bodies
aha
the body
and he reported it and the put on a double watch that night
aha
and during the night the UNK saw a coming over the UNK
aha
and they shouted at in a while they saw it coming up again they give another warning
aha
the third one was the shot was to be fired you see
aha
he disappeared
mm
whether there was any truth in it or not i don't know
but it was told to me that he UNK it
aha
that they came in to UNK the bodies and they put a double watch on
but i w i was wondering myself did the UNK make up the story or did it come
i don't know
right
but er
what about the tramp that was found beside dead beside the road up the glen somewhere
oh aye but he wasn't UNK
no but he was put into the church
he was found dead at the UNK and er church
aha
and there was a miss living in the croft beside and she UNK during the night that er he was stolen
mhm
she got out of bed and went out and went through the UNK and went into the church and started feeling in the dark with her hand
aha
at last she touched him oh you're still there poor
and she'd away back up the way to bed again
once she once she was satisfied that her dream
yes
wasn't right
it was
very brave
she wasn't she UNK
oh indeed
a woman
very i wouldn't do that myself
no
you knew john
no
oh you didn't know john
no
oh well it was his great aunt
aha
that did it
aha
right
i think i've heard the name but i
yes well his widow is in the in the house opposite to mrs there
ah
across the road
yes
oh yes the wee white house
she's got a wee UNK
yes
oh yeah
that's his widow there
oh
yes
i didn't know didn't know him actually
and john would be away one night
i was er a manager up at what's that place now
ah i see
that's another thing i was gonna ask you was about weddings too was there be you know quite a few weddings locally
they would be quite different from weddings nowadays would they or
they used to have them in the in the houses you see
oh aye
in their houses
my father and mother were married in the other side
they were married in was it in the barn or
no the house in the
in the house they were married and they had
the reception where in the barn
in the barn yes
oh i see yes
quite a crowd of people i think
oh i'm sure
as a rule it would be i think
aha
in the UNK days
they did they were married in deep snow and it was a job for people to travel about
oh yes
in january
but er long before our time a wedding in a district like this would last for about a week
really
there were the wedding would come off right enough but the reception would UNK on night after night
yeah
aye
singing
drinking
yes oh indeed
what about funerals was there ever any wakes funeral
oh aye there used to be wakes at one time
aha
not in our time i don't think
at one time at that too
yes
and at the funeral there was bottles of whisky
oh yes
oh yes
at the UNK and
oh aye when they used to carry it they were drinking a UNK now and again on the road going to it
oh well aye but i think they UNK it sometimes
yes
i mean i'm quite sure
quite sure
ask i was gonna ask about was there any organized dances or anything in the hall
was there a hall
oh yes there used to be very often dances in the hall
would they be quite regular sort of
yes
yeah especially in the shooting season time when
aha
the UNK were full
you would get a lot of people coming down from there
mhm
aha
and who would play at these dances
oh well s sometimes it'd be the local boys
aha
but er quite er often they got a band from UNK
aha
maybe a fiddle and a UNK
aha
sometimes the pipes
yes and they would they would go on quite a while these dances would they
oh yes
quite late
i i'll just stop this here actually
it was just a very low part there was a little shopping area just round there at the time er a UNK shop and a UNK shop and a post office street was the post office on the corner and then street and road which lead down into lane and just round oh just round there you see but i was born at the last house in the street almost at the bottom of street
now then what else do you want to know
what sort of house was it
oh just an ordinary house nothing er nothing UNK
a terraced house
a terraced house yes yeah
and how many rooms downstairs
three up three down
and where did you move from there
we went into street for a few years and then we came up here in nineteen twenty eight
erm why did they move to street your family
oh it was a bigger house better house altogether ah that was a very nice house a very nice garden as well
was that sort of house typical of the area
well it was a question in those days whether you got a bay window or a flat window i mean erm the houses down street are better quality i suppose really er all property around there is rented i mean no one bought the houses at all not even up i mean they were all rented houses
er and i remember i remember street west when the right hand side of street west going from road every house was empty before the first world war and they gave somebody er somebody who lives in the end one and they were rent free if they keep all the rest clean and always you see house to let where wherever it was in every street there was houses to let and the price of the house in street must be about eight shillings a week in those days and then if you went up to i mean you'd get in the twelve and UNK bracket and down in those houses down in the that they were ten and six or something like that er
so would you say that was the smart side of
oh yes you'd say that was the smart side of caldmore but er
what ways did the families differ then that lived in those sort of houses to the families that lived in the terraced houses
oh i think that they UNK in as far as they were a tiny little bit more ambitious and wanted a sort of erm a little bit better life but everybody even in the terraced houses they were all very respectable people very respectable people i mean er i
were any of the families considered rough
no i can i can honestly say that i don't think there was any what you can call rough families as i can remember
now you take all those take street and street they were all very respectable people and er i don't think you could say there were any UNK about at all as far as i can remember
now you go to road and street and round there probably that wasn't quite as er as nice but street and street they were very nice people very respectable
so some streets were considered better than others
oh yes er i should say that er street er street then you get into UNK now you see UNK was a little bit less due to the fact that there were a hell of a lot of railway men at work down there i mean really all belonging to some department on the railway you get er drivers and all the men and the permanent way of being in street i mean a lot of people from UNK lived down lived in UNK was working in the permanent way in street so it was a really UNK you could say was a railway community
now if you come to caldmore you'll find out then that the majority of the married ladies had worked in i mean i should say that erm i know my mother was very UNK she'd been an apprentice to some UNK in street and work for one year for nothing she always used to tell me and she was quite er UNK about these girls that used that er that used to go well they were very respectable people and when i was a kid when i growing up in my teens a lot of the girls i used to know were in the offices at er it they employed about fifteen hundred people at in those days you know i mean coming out of at night it was fighting your way against the crowd if you were going towards it and the same thing going through the square for people who have worked in when they left that's why all those shops in the square used to do reasonably well it was the people walking through to go up the other side of walsall but there was a crowd of people i can i can always remember as a kid a crowd of people and then there'd be well you can tell it was along street in those days i can remember UNK carts where the girls used to go and buy apples and that all sort of going along there you know people used to wait for them coming out these are my UNK as a kid i mean i can remember the er and the men of course were UNK and various people and a quite a lot of my father's friends were er had er skilled jobs at as UNK and managers of the UNK department and that sort of thing
then of course there weren't no traffic signs in the middle of the road it was a sort of er certain people from went and started that up and er they were all wor all worked in caldmore it was almost as though the UNK caldmore was full of UNK in a way then there were people starting up on their own making clothes but er there was quite a lot of UNK around er i know there was he'd got a shop on caldmore he was a UNK and er shall we go through all the shops
yes
well we'll start off at the top of road and on the one side there was the furniture people they used to make furniture
did they make it on the premises
oh yes they made it miss has just died erm then coming down there was the post office with old pa and the then the miss they used to keep the post office then there was er well there was a gents UNK and then there was a beautiful shop i always used to think it was called another but it was UNK but it was all most delightful old UNK sort of shop and my mother often used to go in there then you'd
tell me a bit more about that shop then
about that shop
there was a victorian air about it somehow there were there were quite ladies who'd kept it almost the same sort of thing as you'd find out in the country ye UNK coffee shop type of thing you know they they'd be the er there was that atmosphere about it and you'd buy lovely cakes and things like that
then coming on to the end of street next door was a UNK now that nobody knows what they are today miss the name was and then coming across street to the other side was which was a UNK and next coming down was UNK the UNK shop and next to that was the UNK following on down there was the UNK then there was the newspaper and you come down to the white UNK erm then we come to the white UNK
do you remember anything about that
oh yes er i think somebody kept it around father's day a chap named but it was a beautiful old place and he always because my father always used to erm start off about seven o'clock in the morning to walk down to walkers and er call in at the white UNK because they were open at six o'clock in the morning for a UNK and coffee for about tuppence or thruppence then he always used to er go to his mother's for his breakfast and er he used to go down and see all the men start off and then slip over to his mother's she lived on the road and er she for years and years this went on that he had his break he never had his breakfast at home he'd start off going down there and come back to his mother's but he always stopped at the white UNK for his UNK and coffee
did many people go in
oh yes oh well yes for a UNK and coffee yeah and i'm afraid it was very acceptable on a UNK morning but erm now we come we've come on that side of road we'll now start at the top of road again and come along as far as er what i call street i believe it's now where st UNK church is and you come to sammy the butchers
now sammy was a character in himself he was a UNK and his wi his sister was UNK the UNK er and er there the women used to go into old UNK shop on a friday night simply to be UNK by all the UNK and nonsense that used to go on in there and somebody would say i suppose you're off this weekend and he'd say yes i'm off to my little widow in wales he hadn't got a little widow in wales at all now but it would the start of the conversation going
my mother's been up there and she didn't come back for two hours and she came back we kept well he'd sold a lot of meat in the meantime
the next three shops was which was a er he become i think in the finish but it was a toy shop and then you came to er the UNK on the other side of street and you came down to er little UNK
i shall be seeing the you know in a few weeks time the daughter she's a she's er UNK that was erm eddie who were very big UNK of mine and we go to the anniversary lunch together so we're all over eighty but erm you couldn't the bread shop was another UNK shop and then turning round the corner you come to another shop up two steps which was and that was another type of UNK and shop then you get as far as the corn and seed people er they used to have a shop in street as well and then before the first world war there was the butchers and they sold foreign meat
fourpence ha'penny a pound this new UNK lamb was i remember
mother wouldn't have anything to do with it whatsoever don't you bring anything any of that stuff into our house i mean of course it be this new UNK lamb had just arrived on the scene before the first word war i mean nobody was anybody dare have it i mean they'd be standing on the pavement at eleven o'clock at night almost giving it away on saturday night but anyway that's all changed now we all eat it
then you got to er the picture house er that happened just before the first world war that was put up as far as i can remember i know i used to go there and see erm the broken coin which was a serial picture and it was you know er where somebody was up to their neck in water one week and it would say that the continuation of this picture would be shown in this theatre one week from today and you
what was it like inside
pardon
what was it like inside
nice very nice you went up a long hall UNK as soon as you got er through the doors it was very nice really quite something for caldmore anyway
then on the corner of street and green was the UNK shop
then coming along street you come to the picture frame people and then the conservative club then there was the big house further on towards the top of street and that was owned by somebody named UNK was my second wife's she went to school with her they used but her father lived there and on the other side of the road you got the toy shop and er the UNK shop on the corner of er road then there was the UNK and one or two people kept that but that takes you from the top of street straight the way up to caldmore
now on green now we go we've come along from the top of street right along road the toy shop then you get to the kings arms and on the other side of the road there was another pub and i can't remember the name of it then there was the fish shop and then the liberal club then the pork butchers you'd think they were all full of meat
there were a lot of butchers
butchers and er then there was the butchers and that was on the corner of and er and then cross over there towards street you've got the stores then you come the er UNK then er tommy the butcher who was my first wife's uncle and then you come to a shop which was owned by one or two people which was a sort of er general store and then my mother in law's shop a UNK which was
what sort of shop was that
which was a bakers and UNK they used to er UNK at the they got the er the UNK at the back and they used to make UNK and high class bread
and what sort of shop was it itself was it a large shop
oh quite a nice shop yes very nice shop
would they display the bread
oh yes in the in the window yes i think and many and many a ticket i got when i first got married to my first wife i used to do my mother in law's little tickets for all the various UNK and UNK cakes and four for thruppence ha'penny it doesn't of course i could print right you see she said being a UNK i always could print right so i used to do the four for thruppence ha'penny
how much are they today
well i bought i bought three UNK the other day and i think they were about fifty three pence
have you got any special memories about any of these shops at all for any reason
any that you used to go in a lot that you can tell me about
perhaps for instance
oh yes i used to go and fetch the er erm i used to go into every week oh there was the UNK next to as well
i used to go and fetch the butter from don't bring UNK my father used to say we put better stuff on our machines so er i used to go to for my father kept foul i used to fetch a UNK of UNK of this and a UNK of you know all the various things that UNK and stuff for the foul yes and i believe a lady she has she's only recently died and but she kept it for a long while UNK her name was
and what was it like inside were
oh yes sacks of other and they used to have a proper corner UNK shop which you don't see about today the er garden centre has knocked all that on the UNK hasn't it really
what about chemist
whereabouts was that
that was er coming down from street you come to then you come to the UNK and was next door there
that's the only link with caldmore as it used to be and caldmore as it is now
maybe
because it's still there
yes probably yes
and what sort of shop was it in your day when you were young michael
oh quite a nice shop
i used to know i used to play at tennis with bay the daughter and er the eldest daughter she married another chemist and he ran the place afterwards i think then there was jack but er i used to know i used to know quite a lot of the er people on the who kept these shops
was it the sort of chemist that erm was it the sort of chemist that you'd go in if you'd got something the matter with you and rather than go to the doctor they would sort of dole out something for you
well i've never had the experience and i don't think my family have i er no i shouldn't think it was really they might i suppose somebody they used to have a reputation at one time these UNK was doing minor giving you something for some minor UNK but i wouldn't care to sort of er i'd never think of it no there were quite a lot of doctors about you know there was er doctor at the top of road and there was doctor oh there was a lot of doctors about
were you sent to sunday school when you
oh yes rather
which one did you used to go to
well my mother was one of the pillars of the UNK church and er she er oh i went my father never used to go but she used to go and of course i used to be an UNK server down there when i got a bit older i did for a week or two to the erm do you know anything about an anglo catholic church i mean where they swing the UNK and there is this little boy with the boat
i was that for about i soon got fed up with that job
how old were you when you did that
oh about eight seven or eight but when we first went there the honourable s g w was the vicar fourth son of the earl of and er oh you he was there then afterwards er father came and i used to do UNK serving oh i was never interested in it you know i was forced into it
who forced you into it
my mother i remember there was a sale of work going on at UNK church once and bef i had just been made apprentice at wolverhampton and of course i got amongst the they when they came the derby day they were all having a bet on it so i said to the give them half a crown so he said you can't have half a crown and he said what do you want it for so i said they're putting it on a horse was on this horse it won so of course this sale of work was in great progress when i gets off the train at station and thought well i couldn't understand in er UNK church hall so she was there in all her UNK and i said we've won we've won she said shut up shut up she said but erm no i think the biggest character in caldmore was father
what do you remember about him
oh i don't i just i remember that er if you walked down er road at night you'd see him with his UNK board on and his UNK by his side coming down to post the letters and then when all these ladies were in sammy shop one night being UNK by sammy erm father and his UNK went by and old sammy turned round to the audience and said well if dressing up will get him anywhere they'll be on the first row in heaven
i was there that night i was sometimes when i was a little boy i used to go with my mother you know to for the UNK i didn't know whether UNK of UNK used to come out of his shop
i'm trying to explain to you that there was a different atmosphere about it the whole situation i know they were hard times i know that some people had some really rough times but it didn't show very much and when i come to think of all my parents' friends i don't remember anybody having a wife UNK or they all seemed to be very UNK with their lot somehow except one and that was a little bit UNK when i was a little kid but the man died and the observer the next week the er UNK notice was put in the paper and underneath they'd got with christ which is far better and my father said and they she couldn't have said anything better words
do you remember anything more about father
yes oh i ee i i'm led to understand that he built that church and i'm led to understand that at the same time he started he came as a UNK to st UNK and then he came to street into a house and he had a little he started a little church down there in a private house and then he built the church
he very wealthy but oh dear he was a he was a UNK i should call him i know for a fact that he used to before the choir walked in at night he'd have his watch out in his hand and they'd start at exactly the same time
i remember when he always used to read out during the service before the sermon the previous week's collection and it used to consist of the collection last sunday UNK of one UNK note twenty ha'penny half crown pieces forty UNK and he'd go all through the UNK down to the last ha'penny but erm oh i believe he was he was er very UNK very UNK but er father cos he used to come over our house quite a lot when my mother was on the UNK church council and er he had a UNK that was quite UNK and he got himself on the old board of UNK and of course he used to sort of er go into the labour club and was quite of er father he said to old father one night he said erm he's a funny chap your UNK he said well he he's the son of a farm UNK he says and i'm the son of a country UNK and that's the difference
so that was the attitude hey but erm they'll have me up for UNK here
tell me about some of these other characters around can you recall anyone
well old was er absolute er you'd never think UNK would buy anything out of his shop er my father went in for something once and he and he said you can see them hanging up can't you i mean er UNK was on UNK of as far as he was concerned they were there why ask him if he'd got any but erm course you must remember i was only a little boy i mean i can remember all this i took it all in but i wouldn't say that i knew them er i knew miss from the UNK shop she was a sunday school teacher and er the sunday school used to be at road school we used to have a sunday school there and a mr used to take this
he was another character er there was er i remember they used to have a lot of UNK and things at the church you know it was very well attended i suppose in those days
don't know what it's like now
what about the conservative club and the liberal club did they were they more social clubs
oh yes er yes they were they were er of course there was a great divide there i mean between the liberals i mean they were the only two parties in those days
the conservative club was there before the liberal club
i think if the liberal club was only like first world war it wasn't there it hasn't always been there but the conservative club was there as long as i can remember
do you recall any of the activities that were associated with either of them
did what
do you recall any of the activities that were associated
well i was in the tennis club when i was a er they used to have a tennis court at the back
which club was that
conservative club and my wife she wa we were both members there oh and there was a i tell you another shop that probably i haven't mentioned just before you get to the white UNK there was UNK the UNK shop with er they got three or four er daughters i remember
why do you think there were so many UNK shops
there was a lot of meat i suppose really i mean erm
answer
i mean were there sort of different quality UNK being sold
all the rest were
no difference
no of course one or two of them had slaughter houses at the back of them you know
i see
i mean er
which were those
well tommy used to slaughter all his cattle and er you see my father in law's UNK and his slaughter house were next to one another an open yard at the back of the shops and er
how did the cattle arrive
oh driven up from the station from the from the goods yard oh yes
was that in street walsall or
yes a long street or somewhere around there and yes i mean many oh many a time i've you'd see ca every wednesday night you'd see the cattle being driven up
always the same night was it
yeah and one got stuck in the there was an entry between my father in law's shop and the next one and one of these cattle ran down the entry and got stuck in the entry you know it was only narrow and the they had to shoot it but er oh yes it was a that was a thing you never hear of today and you never hear of people putting UNK down when people are ill do you
you see walsall being a leather town there was a lot of this er bark UNK as went and when anyone who was ill so they wouldn't hear the noises of the horse driven vehicles going by they used to for about fifty yards each side of the house they used to put this stuff in the road to UNK the sound
do you recall this being done
oh yes
and what where did this happen that you remember
oh i've known it happen all over caldmore
so it was a regular happening
oh yes they put this UNK down it was like a bark i don't know what it was cos i'm not in the leather trade i don't know much about it except that it was some by product from the of the er UNK process and they used to put this stuff down when people were ill
so with you mentioning leather then it leads me onto another question erm was there much done in the way of leather work in the caldmore area
oh rather yes out work people used during the first world war there were no end of people were sort of er especially if they'd had a bit of experience in the leather industry like UNK and UNK and that sort of thing especially the UNK and er other work attached to leather UNK and er revolver UNK and that sort of thing they'd do them at home you know oh yes there was er now UNK divided isn't it
it's got leather and iron and steel now you come onto the road and you wouldn't think there a leather factory about would you
because from top to bottom it was all connected with iron and steel the whole lot all the way down
you go from er UNK and UNK john gill and UNK walker brothers it was er a terribly industrial well you could fi road used to be all UNK sets in the road there wasn't the because there was so much traffic went up and down er it was all made of UNK sets when i when i was a kid but my shall i tell you what i used to do when i was a kid for my saturday morning
well first of all i'd go down street and up street west and up to the top of street and there was some UNK the new side iron works and i'd watch those men they'd produce UNK iron and during the process the metal boils up and i'd have to get a big UNK bar and UNK they'd call UNK into a ball there's a little wagon put underneath the put under the wagon and off he goes to the steam hammer now i used to be UNK with this and saturday after saturday i used to go up there and watch one of the UNK and as soon as they'd finished doing they used to go into the UNK and hammer for a drink i mean it was such hard work so they'd do a heat go up the UNK and iron and come back and then do another heat when i'd
how long would it take to do a heat
oh i should think it would be the best part of an hour and er then i'd go along street down into walker brothers call in my father's office
can i go in the rolling mills
i used to go into the rolling mills and watch them rolling steel sheets and over about half an hour there this was saturday after saturday after saturday i used to do this
i'd come along road and up lane into street to a shop that had got rabbits in the window
i used to walk along there to see these rabbits i think the name was and they it was a UNK shop that had got these sold all sorts of pet things and that i used to then i used to come home that was my saturday morning but i always used to go in up to the news line
now the funny thing about it when i took UNK i got i got all this process i knew all about it you know and er i had it the theory explained to me then but er i was in the bell one day about twenty years ago and an old boy came in and i started talking to him and he says i bet you don't know what i am
i said no i don't he said well what i was anyway he said i'm retired now
he says you'll never guess
i said well what was it
he says i was a UNK
i said were you
he said you don't know what that was that is do you
i said i do a bit so er he said well do you know anything about it
i said a bit and i never let him know i thought i'll wait a little bit until he go so he says to me he says i bet you don't know why they put the UNK in just before they'd put the bring the ball out do you
i said yes i do he says you know
i said course i know i said to put some of the carbons from the smoke back into the into the er UNK iron he says how did you find that out
and i told him that er all about it but i said do they make do they do this UNK these days he says yes at west UNK they still do it but er they used to do it up on
do you recall what they used to wear
UNK trousers
were there any protective gear of any kind
no just the used to wear like a pork pie hat
did he wear anything in par
no not that i know of
did you see them load the furnace
oh yes they used to put pig sc iron and scrap in it
pig iron you know er pig iron was what they had i've seen them pouring UNK pouring it onto the pig beds and you know when i was a kid when we lived in caldmore from about half past nine at night all across west UNK all over that area you'd see the sky light up and it was due to the pouring of er pouring the pig iron
they open up the these blast UNK and the we'd all be in the open air and the reflection there used to be quite a reflection in the sky all round there
did getting back to caldmore
erm were there any small workshops around doing odd things you may recall sort of small set ups
no i don't think there were there might have been one or two yes i do know one that used to make some form of er something for the UNK trade and you know those houses opposite the UNK houses in road there are some UNK houses on the one side then there's some houses that lie up steps on the other side of the road if they're still there
the back of there used to be one or two people who used to have little UNK where they used to sort of make things and my grandfather up the UNK he was a good UNK and he had his shop at the back of the house and he cou he could watch the walsall races going on which is now where the road is from his workshop before street was put and any of those and he could stand in his workshop and watch the races
and when would that be
oh in the eighteen nineties i should think eighteen eighties eighteen nineties
and did he have any men working for him or did he work on his own
yes he er he had a UNK for part time but he was a now he was a wolverhampton grammar school boy
his two brothers both died with UNK cos one was they all three went to wolverhampton grammar school and they were a UNK family and they died with the UNK but i thought they were putting the youngest which was my grandfather for the best UNK one was going in for law and the other was going in for medicine and the youngest was go which was the same as engineering is today i suppose and he went into the gun trade and i can remember him he was a grand old chap and er he used to come and bring the springs that he'd made and to temper them he used to throw them in the kitchen fire and they'd die out and get them all out of the UNK in the morning and he used to take his week's work in his UNK pockets and his day out was to get on the tram at the brown lion and go straight through UNK and right through west UNK up to the constitutional in birmingham to UNK or UNK and UNK and he'd got these gun locks as he'd made during the week in his UNK pockets
they were very small then
yeah
that's interesting
yes and er my mother was frightened to death of guns because oh he was a bit of a boy at heart i mean you can just imagine everybody used to bring the sporting guns to be repaired and there was guns floating about all over the place and my mother was scared stiff of guns right till the time she died er and he got mixed up with all these sporting connections you know like go off to shoots and various things and i think he did a bit of cock fighting in his day as well but i've got the exercise books that his two brothers
do you want to see them
you can show me
i can show you afterwards aye you can have a look at them and see what you think about them
erm yes aye that's the UNK that's not caldmore you know
yes but very interesting all the same
yeah oh yes he oh and he was erm being better educated than the majority of people in the UNK he used to stand outside the brown lion to read the newspaper out to them cos they couldn't read and he attended all the weddings all the funerals and er made the wills out and he almost was the father UNK for the UNK and when the old steam tram came off the lines down in the UNK when there was a steam train coming through there he was the man who put it on the rails again
what was his name
john
tell me about transport through caldmore when you were a young man
do you mean public transport
well both sorts
