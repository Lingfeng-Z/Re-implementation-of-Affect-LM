non UNK until about i shouldn't think there was an a bus did come to the bottom of road i can't remember what was it must have been about nineteen twenty i suppose something like that it used to go to the bottom of road and turn round there but i never er my mother always used to say you'd UNK the trade the trade down well i don't believe it did really er now i think the lack of transport now you've hit something there lack of transport there encouraged people to shop in green rather to go down the town cos you could get anything off green you know you just think you'd ju you smiled about the er UNK shops the UNK shops the cake shops you could get the gents you could get anything on green the UNK shop you needn't go anywhere else but when they started transport er yes i think the buses had quite a bit gradually cos things that you don't think get things happening in this country overnight i mean they grow on you don't they
i mean you get a bus coming as far as road and back i don't suppose it has half a dozen folks on what's this thing coming up here nobody i'd er i've walked into walsall all my life and but gradually the whole thing changes doesn't it and then the thing gets off as far as west UNK and in then there's through traffic and then how far and the UNK not big enough to take the turn around up road then they change the direction and it's all done on bit by bit by bit and so UNK got eroded it's er
so they took bits of green away then
oh yes they did for the increase in traffic i mean that er that er went on over the years gradually creep on until the whole atmosphere of the place was er i don't know improved should you say or not i don't know whether it's er well it certainly hasn't improved but erm it changed it was such a lovely little place really and of course you could run across the road whenever you liked i mean we used to play in street of picking out in a sweet shop window er a name be UNK or chocolate or something you'd be standing across the road and you'd be running backwards and forwards backwards and forwards there was no sign of anyone getting run over cos there was nothing about and when i was a kid going to the UNK school i'd run across that bridge every morning without looking right or left because if anything had hit me well nothing used to be coming you could see a tram coming but oh there was nothing else at that time in the morning oh no it was wouldn't like to run across today
what about private transport in caldmore about this time how was what was that
do you mean somebody who owned a er some kind of vehicle UNK some of the UNK did but not many that i can remember no i don't think there was too many of them
would private individuals have their own transport
no there was nobody now er probably up at the top of UNK there though one or two would have er stables i should think one or two of those houses but by and large no i shouldn't think so
now there is another part it's very nice and that is round lane and er road and all round there used to be very nice at one time
do you know it
er
i can't er
were there any open rural areas
oh yes
yes my playground
go up road and from there turn down UNK lane the continuation of it and you'd come right to the UNK and nothing at all from there to west UNK and you could see if you go over one UNK from one field then onto another and then brook that now runs through the road there that used to be a little country brook that run across the golf course and there was a little UNK over it a little bridge and a UNK then you go straight up to UNK common and not a house in sight
was it open UNK
no cut straight across it
i mean that's what cut straight the way across that it was it was all and my aunt she used to live by all UNK west UNK we never used we never went to see them we used to walk it down the road past the UNK head onto the navigation inn and up by the UNK and she used to live opposite er all UNK church in west UNK and erm coming back we should come back round midnight you know and er have you ever heard of the UNK gang
yes
has that come up in your er in your well we were coming back there one night from my UNK and er there were quite a lot of policemen about and i was only a little boy it was before the first world war and my father said to one of these policemen what's happening so oh we had a tip off he says that er there's these UNK gang folks and in the morning we saw UNK been UNK or killed but er that was another bit of interesting news around and i remember down in caldmore one day there used to be some ladies who used to come from well they used to be one of them used to call them the salt ladies they used to come with blocks of salt on a on a i think they used to come from and i saw a horse there as a kid and i it had got a long UNK right across its body and i said to this lady i said what's happened to this she said oh the UNK gang and er i was in paris in nineteen twenty two and er we got to this hotel and there was another UNK on this trip and he said to me he said where do you come from
i said walsall he said oh the UNK gang
you just mentioned these salt ladies coming round
yeah
erm tell me a bit about that
well all the way from they used to come from and they used to have some UNK on i always remember they used to have the i'm not a UNK but you know a la they don't like UNK down the back that used to hang down the back and the i remember them coming round selling blocks of salt
horse and cart
horse and cart and of course milk was never delivered by in bottles in those days
i mean that was always a UNK used there used to be er james was one of the UNK down UNK he used to come
they used to pour it out of a can you know it's a wonder we didn't all die of tuberculosis but we didn't
did anyone else come round the streets selling things
oh yes the UNK man on a sunday afternoon and er all the various things were s UNK all used to bring their stuff round
how did you know they were in the street did they have a call
shout they'd shout something but er well since we've been living up here my mother used to give the man used to come for the order for the grocery the baker used to come round the milk used to come round they all used to come round at she'd ha she didn't have go out for heavy loads of stuff to bring in it was all delivered but when they started some new technique of er of ordering by computer it's going to come back to square one again you know they'll be delivering stuff in the same jolly old way hey
could be yes
yes don't you think
could be yes
give it fifty years and i'll bet you that the baker and all the rest of the folks it'll be coming from a supermarket but they'll be delivering stuff that you've put on your computer
that's right that would be interesting
hey er well during just after the war they started these concerts in the UNK hall
now the UNK hall was a very nice hall er UNK all the way around it held five or six hundred people er UNK and all the rest of it a lovely stage and these travelling concert parties used to come round on a saturday night and i should imagine they'd be doing the UNK during the summer and then they came back in the walsall and various areas during the er winter months and we used to get concert parties like the UNK and the UNK and all those sort of people come along and they were real and of course fellas my age i mean eighteen and nine we used to take our girls there i mean it was full of young people er you'd perhaps have been to the pictures one night and it's another way of entertaining really and it was really a first class entertainment
well my pal and myself we took these two girls and we sat in the middle of the UNK hall and he said come on let's sit over on the UNK he says and put up my clothes by the UNK he says it's been raining he says and it will dry them so we moved and exactly from were we moved was where the women got killed just UNK dropped on her and er when it happened the fella on the stage the UNK was singing a hundred years from now you won't be here and i won't be here and from the corner of my eye i could see something gradually dropping like one of these UNK and i thought hello that's part of the act you know it was just gradually coming down and all of a sudden UNK and the roof came straight in oh and i don't know sure i'd i everything went dark of course i mean it was all in UNK out all the chairs were loose so as the folks UNK their way towards the exit doors they took the chairs with them so they UNK threw them back in the crowd that stood in the hall so you were UNK chairs as well as trying to get out where we were where we were seated the firemen were UNK at the windows thinking that it was a fire because all the dust had gone up in the air and the reflection of the light from the market i suppose and that would give the appearance of smoke and he was i said to this UNK i said there's no fire he says he says there is i said there's no fire in here anyway we eventually got out but i took these girls back home to and i really it was properly UNK us both and as we came on that old tram we were we thought you know everything seemed to sort of upset us and when i got far more upset on the sunday morning when i went to have a look at it the whole roof had come right in but there were fifty people got injured you know and about oh there was one lady killed
i knew one of the girls and er she never got right properly again
she got injured in her back somewhere but er it was national news i mean it was in the mirror and all the papers and it became a for a day or two it was er it was in everywhere and the theory is that er it was this erm very dry summer and a very wet autumn and a bit of dry rot in the timbers somewhere but it was it was another
how long did it actually take you to get out of there
oh half an hour
quite a time really
yeah oh yes of course a lot of the people were that were in the we were in under the UNK but they were up to their knees in plaster and goodness knows what that had come out of the roof they couldn't move it all dropped round them
so they had to wait to be dug out did they
yes i've
good gracious was anyone trying to organize the
well you can't in the dark can you really
you can't really you see we came out into a side door into the old square
i don't know what happened to the front entrance but there was a basement underneath there and my first wife was dancing in harvey UNK dance hall underneath her pal and herself she they'd gone to this dance it was a dancing lesson on a saturday night it was famous in those days harvey UNK dance class er yes i
was there any damage down
no
in the basement it was just on the
just on the top yeah
on the top of it
that's about all i can tell you about that but er it makes you wonder whether i hadn't better keep out of street doesn't it
perhaps you could start off by telling me how you came into working in the lock trade
what made you choose that as an occupation
well i had learnt shorthand and typing at school but erm the money was necessary at home you see and er with my sister working there at h and t UNK er she spoke for me and er i had an interview and they put me up in the nursery we used to call it the nursery see because we were all UNK up there and er then they called it the cylinder shop and er my foreman was a fella name UNK and erm everything was very strict indeed we could not move away from our board you couldn't speak to the next one that was working by you and er there was a fella named mr and he was he i didn't work for him i worked for mr but some you cou you were afraid to move because of this man and he he'd UNK at you and he'd look at you and anyway erm they put me UNK and it was very interesting indeed there was a tall stand on we called it the bench a tall stand with a screw on the top and then to as begin to UNK the locks you had to take what we would call the body screw it into the er little on the stand and then we had UNK there were in the body there were five springs and then you had to have five breast pins and when you got the springs in you we have to have a plug at the back so as we could put each pin and push the plug over that a dummy plug we called it and so that was five pins were in and then there was a ball er when that when we came to put it in our vice we had to put the v i c e not v o voice
we had to put it in erm oh what did we call it oh dear a little vice and er put a ball about three inches long and then er put it into the plug and erm put the cap the little brass cap but also the i've made a mistake there before we did that we had to put the natural plug in and in that plug there were five like aluminium coloured er pins each of a different size and we had to learn to read the key for the various depths you see and we had boxes of pins with the different sizes in and er then put those in the plug and then push the key in and but we'd got to we got to file we had to file the bars and also the little brass UNK to get all the edge the i forget what we used to call it now off the cap to get it smooth and then get it in our own vice and screw them down and there were thirty two there were three key keys to each lock and er we had to file them until they were ready and they worked easily push the key in properly and we also used to put black lead in you could not put oil because they would have stopped the springs working and we had a little box of ordinary oh like the black lead that we used to black lead the graves put some on the key and push that then and work it round and that was the erm that was made it work freely you see and then there was erm a half a gross to each board and three keys to each one and then erm we filed the various things ourselves but then they would take that away from you and bring you more you see and then when eventually the keys had to be polished and it was only a favourite few that were allowed to sit down to sort the keys out to com to complete them you see but it was very interesting work and i enjoyed being there but you
you enjoyed it yes
oh yes i enjoyed it very much but erm we had american visitors around and we had one a captain and i'm afraid we all fell for him cos he seemed such a UNK man and he'd been a hero in the war and he was engaged to then to the then president of UNK daughter so they informed us but erm i don't know whether it was the truth that's what they said but of course some of the some of the things had to be cast the bodies had to be cast and they were they were i don't know whether you'd have heard of the UNK
i've heard of them yes
it was next it was next to h t UNK and erm i think they used to do the casting there and then all the castings had to come into for us to file and it was hard work but er there was erm a big bell to tell us when to stop work and that was outside and there was a big notice in the department wait for the bell or
you daren't move you see
yes that's right
how many of these locks do you think you'd have done a day of the cylinder lock
oh er i used to about four or five board boards a day oh yeah
with how many were on each board
half a gross on each board yeah oh you couldn't move away from your board at all and it was erm mr his eyes seemed to be perhaps i shouldn't tell you this but i'm going to it may be a bit UNK for you my er mr used to send me out through the back way into street i think it is now to wait for the UNK with a sporting book oh should i have said that
no that's all right
and erm we used to work from seven o'clock in the morning until seven at night we had to walk from new UNK to hall because there weren't any buses and erm there were some girls some girls worked at legs have you heard of
legs
yes
legs
yes
and then some at UNK and in the during the winter months we used to we had a spot to meet about half a dozen of us from the various factories because we were afraid to walk home through and that way er because men used to wait in lane
there weren't any houses then and there was a big ditch where the UNK side and erm we used to have to wait for each other because no street lamps nothing at all like that and er really we used to be afraid and then when the first bus ran shall i tell you this when the first bus ran from bloxwich to willenhall of course word got around that the buses were beginning because the roads were only UNK they weren't UNK roads then and it was certainly gentlemen first for the first there were about three hundred waiting that was a lot of at the top is it street i think it's that and all the gentlemen were first but we some of us managed to UNK on but erm then they used to break down very often because the roads the roads were in such a terrible condition they were only UNK
this was while you were working at was it
yeah oh yeah i didn't work anywhere else in willenhall at all and erm but we'd got to be in for seven o'clock and if erm you weren't in for seven o'clock and sometimes i used to hear the bell began ringing when i got to go around the corner and get into the but you had to wait a quarter of an hour before they would let you in and that was stopped off your money and my wage was eight and fourpence a week
were you allowed to keep that money
oh i had about a shilling pocket money i think although they used they'd fine you they'd stop money off you if you were late if you were a quarter of an hour late you couldn't go in and erm until and then you'd got to explain to your mums well that you were some money short you see why is this and we had to say well we were a bit late getting in when you started out soon enough you see
but erm i real i really enjoyed it and er to me it was interesting work and i don't know that i can tell you much more about the locks
what did you like about it
i liked everything about it i liked everything about it mind you i had sore fingers to begin with very sore with the filing you see but also er i was used to thing in a way because there was a little lock shop in mother's yard er and erm home made er home made locks and he used to er and now he used to do them and stamp them and i us i worked his hand press for him before i was fourteen and they were for and they are still and my mother used to take them to birmingham and erm i think he used to give me sixpence for doing everything i did for him
do you think that helped to decide you to go into lock making
well erm you see although i learned shorthand and typing it was better money and that was the reason i had to do it i've passed my exams in shorthand but er probably there weren't enough offices then to employ a good many clerks but erm they er it was a very big fellow who used to ring the bell and the bell was on the outside he was named tom but i can't for the life of me think erm what his other name was but erm it used to put the fear through us i can tell you if we were around the corner and we heard that bell ringing but erm they were a good firm to work for and but they were strict but everywhere was strict in those days we had to accept it but it was a long hours but erm they knew i had some i enjoyed it and i'd go back again only i'm too old
can you describe the room you worked in what was that like
yes it was a big it was a square big square room and er we were all young people up there except the foreman and erm some lived in one lady live in she was named then there was another one who lived in street she was named and er there was a UNK there's a UNK butchers shop isn't there UNK have got one in road at willenhall yes there was UNK and er
did you get on with these other girls
oh yeah well there was no option you'd got to cos you daren't speak you'd oh er friendly in our lunch break you know er dinner break really we didn't have lunch time erm we were all friendly together and er as i say er we got on alright but you'd er you'd got to stick at your job absolutely you daren't move oh they don't know they are born today
i don't think some of them don't
how long did you have for lunch
about half and hour and er i used to take my sandwiches with me you see you couldn't there were no UNK then you'd got to take it was a bottle no and UNK
so there was nowhere to heat anything up or anything like that
oh no oh no you couldn't heat anything up no but erm oh we well there wasn't anything else you have to accept things don't you there wasn't anything else to do
my er my sister worked in the UNK shop and erm after she ca she'd been working at on the manor do you know the manor at willenhall and then er she decided to go on with the war work and she was UNK the man named john and his father was the UNK later h t UNK but erm it UNK out and anyway the UNK did but erm
so your sister was working there before you
before i were yeah she was on war work you see on the hand UNK that was on the on the ground floor of course there were a lot of old cottages er the one at the end and erm there was something about those oh when we did erm er when we did erm locks for the erm hotels there were called they used to say no they used there would be about a hundred keys for the guests who UNK in for the er for the hotel and they would each be given a key to the same lock you see and they used to call those keys to pass sometimes there was more than a hundred keys to one lock but er wait for the bell or
were you allowed any breaks during the morning or afternoon for tea and things like that
i don't remember there having a break we had the break at er midday but i don't remember if we if we did we had to work you know what i mean we just have i forget that is a bit i've forgotten
mm
whether we had a break
i know everything was very strict indeed there was nothing like it is nowadays that i had but erm
there was there was nothing in the way of a union or anything like that
oh not then oh not then there wasn't a union at all
cos started a union up but that was after when i was working at UNK but there wasn't there wasn't a union a union at all then but er there was keen competition between UNK and cos they and i mean they all developed the UNK and er we used to get a lot of visitors around and er you used to get a lot of american visitors around but erm it's a it's a very old town isn't it very old because mother used to do her shopping there and there weren't any buses running but we used to go by UNK from er to do the saturday shopping er UNK used to run the UNK and the daughter used to drive the two horses and
did you have anything in the way of holidays erm was there a sort of UNK holiday or any UNK while you were there
we perhaps had a UNK er we had to have a UNK holiday yeah
was that during wakes week or would that be in september
erm we didn't have a holiday for that but we used when it was willenhall er our mums knew that we should be like going home and we used to go straight from work to the wakes you see which was a it was really a good wake then but then you'd got to walk home
what was at the wakes what did you like about them
i liked everything about wakes
then i used to go dancing down at down the and i'd strict orders to get in on a saturday night early but it was always eleven o'clock walking on my own back
what was at the wakes
were there UNK and things like that
oh yes oh yes much as they are now and the big horse we used to call them the big horses you know and er shows and that all they used to willenhall wakes used to be fine really good and er that was down in the lane somewhere there
do you know lane
somewhere there but off the wouldn't it be but erm it was an event erm when i had a rise in wages my mother being a UNK she used to have a machine under the little front window and when i got a i had a they'd put my wages up to ten shillings and when i got in mum came over and said what's the matter with you she said you seem as if you're walking on air i said i'd had a rise in wages and it was up from eight and four pence up to ten shillings i don't know what that seems but still
did you did you keep the increase or did
oh no oh no i wouldn't do that
so it was still just a shilling pocket money
yeah i had a shilling pocket money and out of that i saved up for a bike
the wakes were very popular were they
oh yes
i've never seen one so
oh they were haven't you ever been to wakes
they were but it well it was an event a big event in the among the younger people anyway in UNK in willenhall then and er it was really lovely really lovely i forget if we had to pay to go in but er we had er we saved up for a good few weeks before so that we would have some money to spend at the wakes it was one of the an event of the year then but erm i used to like willenhall wakes and er i used to go dancing a lot well i was allowed to go dancing cos i've always loved singing and dancing you see and er i was allowed but i had to be home before my father got home but i wasn't always
can you remember the markets in willenhall
oh yes dan used to stand outside calling er get your nice UNK or get your nice egg UNK and all this they mostly had UNK and it was competition you see between the there was er UNK the pork butchers erm UNK the pork butchers that was nearly by UNK that were i forget and there used to be UNK shoe shop round there and a mr used to erm i don't know whether you've heard of UNK no and erm his father used to manage it and erm behind the angel UNK you know the angel UNK well that was down shop there and then there were several maid shops and there was the erm UNK that's er before you turn o that's on the same side as street it is it is it UNK in street there's a hardware shop on the corner now straight in the market place
UNK yes
yes and erm UNK used to be next to it and it to see him UNK the butter you know and with all the fancy things in the window they would be doing it and er everything was UNK up then into brown paper and strong brown sometimes there would be a bag of sweets pushed in as well for the children
how often did the markets take place was it every week
oh yes oh yes oh mum went there for years and years every saturday yeah and as i say the UNK used to erm be stationed up by UNK street to take er shopping and er and UNK used to be the big UNK then that's on the it used to be on the corner of erm UNK well there's a market there an indoor market now isn't there yeah they were the er the big UNK and er bakers and UNK and er all the barrels of flour used to be you could see all that going in you know but er i don't know whether it is am i making it interesting is it interesting for you
it's fascinating yes
were the markets erm were there a lot of stalls in the markets
oh yes oh yes each side and er there some a few came round erm where it used to be the old picture house a few came around up as far as UNK and erm further up towards erm now then the central there's a school that they used to call it the central but erm
up you mean i know yes
yeah but er it there isn't a i haven't known anything else like it on the walsall market
right were they open late on a saturday
eleven o'clock there weren't restrictions then on they could keep open as long as they liked no restrictions on time and er as i say their own place you know it really it was UNK i thought in since erm i contacted you i've been thinking how what i could help with and er what i could still think about and er it was really a sight because to walk and it always used to be UNK well it was one of the best markets round here and er people used to go off and from bloxwich and er although there's a good market at walsall there wasn't a bloxwich market then sadly for years and years but erm and then if you went to wolverhampton you got to walk through UNK you got to er walk everywhere you went then and except on a saturday night when the UNK used to run on a saturday but it was amazing to see the girl behind the range now controlling to
i i've heard in birmingham that people used to wait until quite late on a saturday night to get
oh to get your UNK oh yes they wouldn't there weren't really good UNK in those days there was co UNK cold rooms but erm they would be glad to get rid of the meat that they'd already got cut up you see and the UNK they used to call them the UNK standing outside you see and get your fresh meat and so on so on so on so you know and er to get the custom in you see oh there was real competition between the UNK and there were UNK standing in road
right you left erm UNK when you were eighteen
eighteen yeah
why was that
the work had dropped off yeah and then i were on the on the labour for a short time and erm then i got a job next door to where i lived straight next door
that was it
yes
and what sort of work did you do there
the till the till locks and erm we used to UNK those as well and er it was a fortunate one who used to do the UNK there was a big er big erm heated table and er it was easy work to do the UNK you see and you used to have to put them on the top of the heated tower to dry before they were packed to go away but erm they were it was a hard place to work for but er the one son mr he was always in london and er this isn't being recorded now is it is it
it was quite strict then was it at er
oh they were very strict
yes if erm two girls were in a toilet you were fined and they used to stop the money oh yes two girls were fined it was a very strict there it was er quite as strict there as it was a h t UNK and erm you but you could have a drink there but er at one time before they allowed a drink a cup of tea the men used to someone to watch to see if when we were working in the top shop cos we could see if anyone came up the up the shop into from the bottom shop into top shop then they put a can on erm on something to boil you see and er oh and we got a little UNK coal stove to heat the shop no central heating pipes or anything like that and they put er someone you could see anyone coming up the up the steps and er anyway there was someone one of the bosses coming up so they erm UNK the can off ran round the back of the bench wh where there were a lot of hand UNK going and mr walked straight he was only mad that off the can of boiling water
was that because you weren't allowed to
we weren't allowed to have a we weren't allowed to have a cup of tea in break time no but er we were all on edge you know for fear if he kicked it would have UNK his foot and he were he were only a few inches away from it and of course he went now what we used to say now UNK around and we shouldn't have done he had a job to get round because he was
did they have the union in there at all or
have what dear
have a union at
erm they began the union just before i left UNK and of course it was cried down and erm they had meetings and the lot and then all the miners were on strike at the time and er my father and brother were both miners and er my brother was very friendly with mr and mr next door and er anyway er we decided to come out on strike for UNK union and of course erm they the one i think it was mr said UNK he said er did you know we're out on strike here and my brother said it seemed to be catching doesn't it he didn't say he couldn't say i worked there you see but erm it caused an upset but still up to a point the unions were good because we're all badly UNK for what we did and the hours we worked they wouldn't tolerate it nowadays but erm i forget er i joined the union and if you didn't you were a UNK you know you they wanted you to join the union from then i've been in the union all until i finished work but erm they got us our rises and er as i say the money wasn't er very good and then the union did fight for the rises and they'd got to pay it or lose all the er employees but erm i was i was satisfied with without it i've been satisfied with my life you know i've had there's been UNK there's been sad but erm i'm still able to get around and that's the main thing
what was that first strike over was it pay
yeah oh yeah
it was pay
well they didn't want to recognize i recognize the union you see and when everyone really knew what we should be having and what were paying and of course erm it caused a bit of UNK and UNK against those who wouldn't join but er that that's what causes the trouble nowadays isn't it and it's a sad thing really but on the whole erm i've enjoyed UNK everywhere i've been
what was there a shop steward elected from amongst you or somebody to
well we never heard the name shop steward in those days i don't think they went that far there was somebody in charge sort of thing but erm they er got the na the name afterwards i think you know shop steward but er and then they used to be miss used to have the garden UNK the garden parties on her lawn that was for the liberal party you see as soon labour was mentioned there were only tories and liberals at that time and er we used to when there was an election er we used to wait up for the results and then if the liberals got in UNK big bell would be rung if it was twelve o'clock at night or one o'clock in the morning the UNK big bell would be rung you see to say who'd got in if the tories got in it wasn't rung because it was a UNK were liberals strong liberals and er they used to attend the liberal club at UNK but erm there used to be some fun in those er what's the name parade if the liberals got in and dances you know to raise money for the various things and the garden UNK used to be lovely but er on their lawn
where did they live
they live in the a beautiful house a little house old very old and erm they always said there was a secret passage underneath and my uncle er used to er he used he named he named some locks my uncle did a till lock and when i star began to work there er they were called salmon UNK and er mr said to me you know he said er it's your un they used to call him UNK my uncle it's your uncle UNK that named them and i said was it and it was a till lock and they couldn't get them right er they were having trouble with these particular till locks and er my uncle said to mr when he went around they were having trouble and he said all these locks all these things are good for a UNK for salmon and then they were called salmon UNK and they were traded as salmon UNK so
what happened when you when you got married and did that cause problems
well no i i'd got a cycle and er the money was very useful to us cos er my husband he worked on the on the top of at parcel he couldn't go down they weren't allowed underneath er because he wore glasses anyone wearing glasses they weren't allowed underground you see and they had to work on what they call on the surface and of course the wages weren't much and er i was glad to go out to work and er and i eventually i had a cycle and i used to cycle to UNK and back you know and erm it was it was very useful indeed the money i earned there
what was the attitude of UNK themselves when you got married
oh well they treated me alright afterwards because mr er said well you see they put me on big UNK during the last war and er i've always loved machinery always loved machinery and then the foreman said er before the foreman came to him mr said er you've got to learn to set your own tools he said i can't keep coming out of the tool room and er to change your tools so of course erm i began setting my own tools but when i got them in they would come around and check because otherwise hundreds of pounds have gone could have gone if i hadn't just got the top to go in right in the base you know and er they were great big UNK very big
was there some pressure on you to stop working when you when you got engaged
oh no not after mr had said you see
but before tell me a bit about that i haven't got that on the on the tape
oh er of course they erm they didn't believe in married women working and er they thought a married woman should be at home you see well i hadn't got any family then you see until er after oh we'd been married a number of years when we had when i had my first baby and er and then i had the other one pretty quickly and er then i was glad to go out to work again when they were school age they weren't left UNK at all er one the elder one looked after the one we didn't live we lived in then but erm there wasn't any pressure for me to stay at home it was with my husband's consent because he knew it was helping out because rent man's wages weren't very good then and erm he er he finished he finished at the pits you see and he got a job rent collecting and he er he used to do miles he'd cycle part of the way and then er he'd perhaps leave his cycle somewhere and call back for it but he used to do all the and all round there there's a place called and then er a lot of places er he used to do the old is this is this on erm he used to do round the top there were some UNK there
yes i've seen photographs of them
and they used to collect the rents from there er some of them and er up er he came home one day and he said erm i'm not going up there collecting again as he er collected the bugs used to drop on his collecting pad i said finish the job don't go again but anyway they persuaded the people to take the rents into the office you see instead of having to have a rent collector but er it was horrible he worked for them twenty five years and then when he was sixty four he had his a stroke but he went back again after eight months and he completed his job for when you know he stayed in the office he was er him and erm started the UNK well it was UNK the UNK system was worked out at the town hall but they the rent men had to carry it out you see and er he er work the system out and of course erm when he was sixty five he finished course he was lucky really but then er he could get about fairly well but after the years drew on you know his health deteriorated and er but he lived er he was sixty four and he was eighty five when he died but erm
when you were working at UNK erm
and they were glad of them during the war
so when you were working at UNK the fact that you were the first woman
i was the first woman to start
the first married woman to start
the first married woman in the factory yes
right and then others followed you on after that did they
oh yes they
they became accepted
it sort of er gave them lee a ladies UNK who wanted to work after they were married some married and then could they come back well they couldn't keep me on and not let them work you see so oh yes it was mostly married women there were a lot of married women there when i left but erm it sort of set a precedent i suppose for them but it did it did them some good really
you say you noticed more and more machinery being brought in over the years
oh it had oh yes definitely they used to have a lot of machinery from germany cos they were specialists in power UNK oh i used to the one big press i used to work on i used bells erm all this was great nearly as high as the ceiling here and it was an press and er just one just press a lever or a handle there used to be er UNK on the side as well sometimes they put UNK sometimes a handle and the bell would come out all formed and everything and that was heavy steel and that was a heavy job but erm they were very heavy UNK they the pressure was very i don't know tons or something like that but erm it was all er it was all to cut labour out and er and the self feed as well where one would be feeding it or you'd pull it yourself it was automatic all automatic i couldn't think of that word before
so they were cutting down on the workforce
oh it was cutting definitely cutting it down yes and i er remember in the first place before erm all this UNK was brought in they used to do the casting er a man and his son used to do all the casting and believe me it was hard work er the real old way you know er with the fires and that and everything like that and heating the things up in a UNK
that was done at UNK was it in
in the casting yes in the casting yes
and what bits would they cast
what pieces would those be
er it would be some of the bodies i think oh er wait a minute i'm trying to think what the casting were be used for there were other things besides locks you see i forget what they the i know they used to do the castings and the brass castings it would be for the locks for the locks yeah
i should imagine for some of the big lever locks
that's it the lever locks yes
the bolts and things like that
that's right yes and erm it was all er now it is more UNK but still they're still i don't know whether they still do it cos i haven't been around UNK i don't know whether they'd do casting now i haven't been down around for years and years when i erm when i left and then i went into the leather trade and er started to learn leather cutting
when you left was there any sort of erm did you get a send off or any sort of recognition of all the work you've done or anything
erm i don't think i did no oh no they didn't they wouldn't think of doing that then but they do now and erm then i i've been around at UNK the old hall table where people you know worked in the warehouse there and i've done all sorts
do you think conditions improved while you were at UNK
they'd they had to because there were they got when after the union was formed you know they were having the rights er but and i think really the hours they put in and the type of work they deserved it but erm there was a time you know when the bosses were UNK sort of thing and er and you UNK to that because you didn't know anything different until erm the unions started up but erm i know there were one or two UNK you know and peer rights and all this that and the other but erm on the whole it's er it's been an UNK life in some ways very UNK and it's been interesting
what things that did you notice any particular things improving
did your hours of work get shorter or anything like that
oh yes the union did erm get that er sorted out you know and er and then when the buses began to run it made it easier for those worked in willenhall and er and it just be about threepence of fourpence in our money go there then but erm and then the hours were altered you see eight o'clock and finish at six o'clock and er and then it used to be seven to seven you see
mm
did you have to work saturdays as well
oh yeah saturdays
all day saturday
no half day saturdays half day saturdays yes and then er i used to stay waiting for mother to come and my sister er to do the shopping in willenhall cos they wouldn't shop anywhere else and then erm my brother used to come with his cycle and er i used to carry a lot of the shopping back and my brother used to push a lot on his on his cycle and mother and my sister used to stay down and have another walk around but we'd got to walk it back i'd come back on the UNK so or just after the buses started but er i'll never forget the first time the bus ran it was pouring with rain and my sister was standing in front of me and she'd got a new UNK on and of course we were getting very wet and there was a UNK to get on the bus and the lady in front of her had got a bag of flour and of course the bag burst and went all down her
they made a big difference did they the buses you would use
oh yes it did yes er i don't know whether it made us get more idle or what but erm the hours we used to work and erm i never had a sitting down job i was standing all the while and i only went if we could sort the keys out you know we were lucky if we could sort them out to put the keys ready for packing you see everybody wanted that job
what happened if you were ill at all or anything in the early days did were you allowed time off for illness
oh well you had to UNK take doctor's note in you see oh yes er doctor's note and erm we were allowed but erm fortunately i didn't have to have much time off i've been really fortunate that way but erm i don't think i would do anything that's different to what i have done because it's hard to prepare me for how i am now that's how i look at things and er the trouble i had with my husband it's helped me to prepare myself for doing the garden i'd done the front garden when the UNK came this morning
the UNK used to bring the cattle through they would walk from wolverhampton through
UNK straight into new UNK and every wednesday night first it was the cows that would come and then the sheep and they'd got to walk to the UNK at bloxwich and erm sometimes the cows were so heavy with milk that er a lot of people in new UNK had free milk and then if the if the sheep would be here there and everywhere you know and then with mother living where there was an entry dividing four houses er and a well straight at the top and a big old fashioned er tap for the cold water there weren't any UNK laid in kitchen in er what are the UNK it was a UNK tap erm sometimes the sheep would get out of hand and they'd run up the entry hall and all round mother's yard and then the cows would go around but er it to me i felt sorry about it because especially in the summer er erm the poor things were so hot and to walk all those miles now they're carried aren't they and they used to every wednesday every wednesday of the year the drivers would er the men must have been absolutely tired out well although they'd be used to it wouldn't they but it was miles to walk from wolverhampton the cattle market to UNK straight to bloxwich and er that was another event that erm it we it we used to have
did they ever have any animals live animals at erm at willenhall market
i don't i've never known of any no i haven't know of any at willenhall but erm as i say it's a long way you know through
UNK and along that way to get to bloxwich isn't it and of course it used to as i say it was an event and the kids used to we used to and then the UNK used to come round pushing his pole no electric lamps then he used to come round
are you recording this
he would come round on his cycle just lean up against the er UNK and push a long pole u underneath the lights the lamp itself the glass and of course the lamp would come on off this pole
did you enjoyed that as children did
yeah oh yeah
we used to we that's all the as the village life was it was it was all very now i know it's very interesting my daughter wants me to write a book about it she says i said i'll oh i don't know mm write a memoirs mum she said er you know and i said you know a lot about new UNK which i do but it's willenhall you're interested in but it all sort or UNK the lot and erm there might be things i've can i wish i'd have told you if i can think about them after it's finished but it's erm
i'm going to pour you a cup of tea now
i've lost my name plate
usually there's a name plate there that says coral UNK on it and you took it down
my name is ricky UNK i am delighted to be here
erm i will start with the two most important pieces of information that i'm going to give you this afternoon
the first is er erm well let me put it this way not the last one of the sessions i did here but the one before that there was a huge guy sitting about where colin is sitting
and before i even started he called me over and he was the sort of person who when he UNK you over you tended to go over there and he said here it says here on this programme that we're finishing at four thirty
now you look pal i've got two hundred miles to drive and i don't believe this is going to take that long
i said no
i don't we can finish right now
alright so the important piece of information here is i have a train to catch so we're not finishing at four thirty
we we'll almost certainly finish about quarter to four
now if anybody seriously objects to this erm i actually do give everybody my home telephone number and i'll be happy to carry on er a UNK session er later tonight
but i actually have to get home you know yes probably you don't have those pressures on you
erm the other important thing i'm going to give you the information as mike said a lot of people i'm not sure of the percentages do carry on using this particular barrier system and the other important piece of information is that when you need to UNK something there's an UNK nice gentleman in your stationary stores called mr UNK and he is the person that does all the ordering
okay and be nice to him because he's very nice to me
er but please make a note of that name because it you know it could be the salvation of your future etcetera
before acting out as a late father christmas i want to erm come up with some general how shall i put it general considerations this is why you have slides you realise that slides are not actually for your benefit they're for my benefit that i can remember where i am and what i'm supposed to do
general considerations about this sort of thing
now what you're going to receive this afternoon is what is UNK called a time management system
right in other words it's a diary of all the bits and pieces attached to it
and when you some people regard these things as UNK
right it's the solution to all their UNK
if only i had a decent time management system you know i could be really effective and all the rest of it
now of course people who think that way erm really are kidding themselves
and when you for example see ads in the times you know these pathetic people who say i've lost my UNK five thousand pounds reward to anybody who gives it back to me because my life is in ruins
such people are to be UNK
i mean by all means take their money if you can but basically
you know they should be UNK because there is no way that my life is inside a ring binder
and i would feel genuinely sorry for anybody who's like it
i mean either they have an incredibly narrow life or an UNK large ring binder
er but in either event you know i i'm not sure i particularly regard them as members of the human race
so the first general point is these things are an aid to you
they're a tool
they are not a substitute they cannot in any sense make decisions for you nor can they guarantee your performance
what they actually do is they they're a UNK for information
er one of the UNK of the modern era as er pointed out by tom UNK not by me one of the few things i do not claim original thought on erm is that it's not that we people think that we don't have enough information at our UNK and are constantly UNK to gather more and more the opposite is actually true
many people are literally made UNK by the amount of data surrounding them
this sort of system is a is a UNK so that you can channel your information in a positive way
the second general point i want to make is that there is no single right way to use this thing
i wish there were because then my life would be a lot easier
erm but in fact the way that i use it er would not be the way that andy uses it the way that andy uses it would not be the way that martin uses it does not necessarily mean that any of us are wrong
er it really is different for different
and it's terribly important to realise that
it's ev actually a little bit more complex than that which is that the things that i used this year i may not use next year and i probably almost certainly won't use two years ago
because as my needs change so this happens to be a flexible system and you can adapt it to your own particular needs over time
right and er the third point i want to is that you what you're actually getting consist of two elements
the first is a very good planning diary it's just automatic erm a b and the third part of it the last part is what we call the work organiser
some things that you do are best UNK by date that's what the diary does some things you do are best UNK by subject that's what the work organiser does
i'm going to as will become evident mainly focus on the diary because that's where at least eighty percent of the data UNK and it's the bit that's most easy to get to grips with
er but we will in the latter half of what i'm doing er come on to the work organiser
now another general point which i daren't put on the slide is that during this the next sort of hour or so or two hours erm some of you will almost certainly become UNK with the way that i talk to you
er and i did have er somebody who came up about a year ago and said do you talk to all your clients like this and i said no it's only at tarmac
erm and he said you know i really resent the fact that you treat me like a village UNK and i said well you know i'm sorry that you feel that way but my experience is of a group of fourteen people erm is that somebody always gets it wrong
er at least one person
erm and we can we can have a UNK now to decide who that's going to be
but it it's it bear with me if you feel that i'm taking this very slowly just look around the room and you'll see confused faces somewhere else
erm because th i've never had a group anywhere not just at tarmac where people get it completely right first time
erm so er an and the other thing i really want to tell you is of course this tape recording is a blind
this session is actually been suitably video taped to see how well you can follow fairly simple verbal instructions
there will be a test afterwards
now what i'm going to hand out to you in various packages er on the diary is you're getting a two page per day diary erm and i will go through all of these things in detail it just helps if i can give you an overview
well it helps me anyway
erm twelve monthly calendar cards which give you a month at a glance an address and telephone section some personal information sheets which are very exciting information tables which are irrelevant to daily erm life
er a storage binder which is that big grey box over there and what we call the active binder
and the active binder is this i can't say this with a straight face this UNK cover erm purchased at enormous expense on your behalf
and as a special bonus UNK with the tarmac logo
er so then you'll always know and you know regret where you got it
however at my UNK and this is something you can genuinely be grateful for the UNK the erm tarmac logo is in the inside cover
erm please take on and pass along please
now this is a seven ring one inch mechanism please always open the binder by pulling the two UNK at either end
not by pulling the rings apart
have a practice click get it out of your system please
i never really
i'm always interested
you see we aren't UNK do you want to take that UNK back now
er mine's just a bit stiff as well
there you go
that was good
okay everybody happy
we're going to happy until five at this rate
now erm this is the active binder this is the one that goes with you wherever you go
the reason that i said please always open by the UNK is that if you open by pulling the rings apart the rings will eventually UNK your papers will fall out you'll send it back to me claiming that the binder was UNK
i will be able to prove to my own satisfaction that you are lying and we will have an unhappy business relationship
if you need to satisfy you UNK to close the bin you know to UNK the rings er you can close it by pushing the rings together that's actually a more efficient way of doing it than the UNK but please always open with the UNK
the same is true with the storage binder which i'm now going to hand out erm or i'm going to pass it round anyway
this time
take one and pass it on
this is a true service
okay now this is now here you have yes take the storage binder out of the slip case please erm we'll deal with the strange yellow things in a minute
can i just concentrate on the binder
this is a three ring as you can see two inch mechanism
it is UNK powerful er please again always open it by the UNK
again you know do that now so it's good isn't it
er yes it is a it's a strong mechanism
what i'm about to say UNK a legal warning
if you are foolish enough to close this binder whilst holding it upside down on your lap i am in no way responsible for any damage that it causes
now you think i'm joking but in fact in the states people in the states sue at the drop of a hat
and while i was there last year erm there was er a case that came to court about a man who'd installed a ceiling fan in his kitchen
it's actually a very sad story
erm had he was very happy with it and he was so happy that he UNK up obviously it turned to be UNK small child erm who was promptly UNK by this fan which is i mean it's a terrible story
the incredible part is he sued the fan manufacturer on the basis that there was no warning through saying you know if you UNK a small child up towards this it's going to lose its you know its head
and he won
so these days you know in the states everything you buy is covered with legal UNK
you know you buy co a bottle of coke it says you know if you hit somebody over the head it can hurt them so please don't kids don't do this at home type stuff
so that's why i'm you know i'm almost serious about the binder
it is a very vicious mechanism so please be very careful with it
this is the storage binder this stays at your base wherever that base is
and this houses the stationary you're not currently using
erm right the what i'd like you to if you can is to open the yellow things up please
er if anybody has didn't have UNK for lunch i have a UNK thing of UNK
okay there are some UNK placed boxes around the floor because there is quite a lot of packaging and you going to you know pretend to be michael UNK with these
now these aren't oh right the strange black things that some of you are holding in your hands are called riders and these are end leaves for the storage binder and the idea is that they will have protective pages that are in the storage binder that will make them easier to turn
i personally found them absolutely useless and i always through mine away er right away but you know that's one of these areas where you have personal choice
erm the yellow things are expense envelopes
this is the bit that some people find extremely exciting
erm the idea what i'd like you to do is to put the UNK one into your active binder and put the rest of them into your storage binder please
and the idea with these is that when you get UNK for expenses you put the receipt into the expense envelopes then at the end of the month erm you would UNK the envelope and attach it to your company expense claim or you know throw it at the person who's going to give your money back or whatever
this is of course assuming that you get your expenses UNK
if you are in the unfortunate position where you do not get your expenses UNK my best advice is go get a job where they are er because this is one of the few good things going er in terms of tax efficiency and all the rest of it
erm now some of you know er this is a big company you probably have very UNK expense forms type things that you have to do but if you want to kindly note that you can analyse your expenses on the front of the envelopes
can you
er there are i think it's ten columns and thirty one rows erm so that you can plot where your money is going if you need to
some UNK well organised people and this does category does not include me erm also use these for their personal expenses
so i know a guy for example who when he gets his UNK bill say the last third of the month he puts it into the envelope and makes a note in the diary on say the twenty first to pay the UNK bill and when he gets to the twenty first lo and behold he knows where the UNK bill is and he has to pay it
UNK you know in the words of abraham lincoln people who like that sort of thing will find it's the sort of thing they like
erm personally you know i think it takes all the fun out of all those red notices that i get all the time
you know l calls from the bank saying you know we're sending the boys around
erm but you know erm that's obviously a different way of using them
and that's true of most of the forms you're going to get that there's certainly more than way of using them
so those are the expense envelopes
the other thing you've got in that packet are some erm er dates er if what you'll see is there's a space on the UNK of the storage binder for putting the year date for the r er okay the basic UNK here is of course you never throw away an old diary in case you get sued
erm the storage binder we er anticipate that you of course will wind up with shelves full of storage UNK housing various diaries and you'll want to know in ten years' time which storage binder has your nineteen ninety four diary erm that's what that label is for
and essentially you can get two years' worth of records in a storage binder
so that's that
now i'm going to start with the diary
the diary comes in two packets
erm january to june and july to december
i'm going to give you the july to december pack first
erm you don't even need to open this just put them straight away into the storage UNK please
that's it
in front of or behind the expense envelopes
in er in front of the envelopes
make it easy to
the expense envelopes always go at the back because they're bigger than anything else that you're going to get to put in the binder
no you don't need to open it just you have to you can't possibly
did that just arrive
they're all there you know like
okay this is where it starts to get a little bit complicated
i'd like you to open this pack please which has january to june
put january to march pages in the active binder and april to june in the storage binder
steve i'm going to give it to you first this time that's right yes that's good so you can actually throw away the cover sheet you really don't need that
you get something else that says if lost return to and you might also want to UNK the piece of cardboard at the back because the storage binder does get very full
okay are we there
this packet takes a certain amount of restraint because it holds a lot of different things in it
what i would like you to do before you get take the UNK wrap off please and just extract the twelve yellow cards which are in the very back of this the monthly calendar cards
you know just let's take it one step at a time please
okay everybody's done that
what i'd like you to do is to put the january card in front of the january pages the february card in front of the february card pages the march card in front of the march pages and then the april to december cards after the thirty first of march
turn the page
no i know
it's usually at this stage it goes UNK wrong
but do you put the rest of the cards sorry where do you place them
after the last page in march right at the end you know that's the best bits very good yes and er no right oh yes i'm sorry
i think we may all
some people will smell of it
well okay now if we can go through the rest of that package please
throw away the cover sheet right you really don't need that
the first sheet we come to is something called personal information
this is the kind of thing if lost send back to particularly poor at this
erm that should go at the very front of your binder if you really want to keep that information in your binder
and you might want to think it if you're using this thing properly the UNK value of what's in this binder may be worth more than you know getting it back
so i'm not i'm you know fully in favour of putting that kind of information in but that's up to you
erm the next bit of that i want you to find which is the address and telephone section that also i'd like you to put at the front of the active binder
go there
yes it tends to finish right there so
you should then find twelve monthly expense UNK and then some annual expense UNK
these are probably useless to you
er so stick them in the storage binder please
and you'll also find some sheets that say expense details the same thing applies to them
so keep going until you get to something that looks slightly different
it's after er yearly UNK and such like
er simple interest rates stop when you get to simple interest rates please
yes that's this thing
the simple interest table is in fact terribly UNK it's what's on the reverse that's important
er a truly depressing document called no it isn't
yes
oh how much is the worth
yes
now i don't want you to extract this i but i want you to know it's there because it has a specific purpose which you will come on to later
okay so just remember that form is on the back of the simple interest rate form
now most of the forms in this pack you can put in the storage binder because they're going to be absolutely useless for you
i don't want you to throw them away today er because you might actually in a few days' time think of some use for them
er by all means go through all this stuff in a weeks' time and throw out th those things you don't need
okay
what i'd like you to find now are there are planning UNK
so when you get to the planning UNK put everything before the planning UNK in the storage binder please and then you should find some planning UNK for the next five years
that's the bit i'd like you gentlemen to find
yes you you'll find some world holiday dates and so on those can go in the storage binder and unless you're likely to want to know when the UNK birthday is and plan things like that
although it does have english holiday dates it's true
erm
it's actually got them
which we don't have
there's a small pack in fact
right by all means keep that if you like that
no i mean i always keep them
i never look at it so i understand
you start getting on with it
yes it's like everything else
i can remember one time in the last year when i actually thought it's the sort of thing we always put in a diary
it's a kind of i mean it
put that in your if you've got all the if you've got all these UNK
so i don't know how useful it may be very useful to you to have that on one page i don't know
well i thought the english one was so they'll come as a massive shock because they're not on the calendar cards but no i don't
i mean i don't find the rest of them interesting
and i have to warn you coming back to the UNK birthday that i suspect because these come from UNK otherwise known as that erm they haven't actually UNK to the fact that erm UNK died erm so it if you are concerned with japan you might want to check when UNK birthday actually is erm because it may not be the same one as in our diaries
now a planning UNK you've got these planning UNK for this year and the next five years i think or five years altogether erm and then you've got some sheets called appointment details
i'd like you to put all of that stuff behind the december calendar card please
okay stop when you get to the map of the united states please
no
okay and the rest i think from that packet are particularly UNK i think
erm there's the time zone map and phone map of the united states there's the international time zone map there are key telephone numbers if you're happen to be travelling in america
there are peel off labels for the long holiday dates something with which you can UNK yourself on the next bank holiday
erm plus some other UNK labels
stick all of that stuff in the storage binder please and as i said go through it at in you leisure or UNK depending on where you come from and you know use what you want to use and UNK out what you don't want to use
you should now be left with two UNK page UNK and everything else should be away in one of the UNK apart possibly from the dates
is that is that true for everybody
yes
okay the UNK page UNK erm i was once asked erm by a gentleman on the programme where i thought no where he said to me where d'you think i should put the today marker
and unfortunately i told him in UNK detail and thereby of course lost a contract because he turned out to be the most senior person in the room and he did not enjoy being UNK in that way
erm so i will UNK from saying where i think you should put the today marker and use your imagination
erm the i wish to explain the theory behind the UNK marker or UNK marker depending on where you come from but i warn you now the theory leaves quite a lot to be desired
the theory is as follows
i was last in my office yesterday as it happens
the next time i'm going to be in my office will be a week next tuesday as i you know i'm due to arrive in on the twenty eighth
obviously it's the human condition that you never actually ever finish all the things that are on your to do list so you always have to UNK things
the theory is that my UNK marker would be on next UNK not a week UNK diary page because that's the next time i'm going to be able to do anything in my office
now of course what's wrong with the theory is very office which is a week UNK already UNK a UNK with various meetings that i've got the chance of doing anything important in between those meetings is you know
so what one would actually need using that theory is a whole theory er series of UNK to highlight different days when one has time available
so what can you actually do this thing
well there are a number of different options
you can do what i always do which is i just sort of UNK throw mine away erm because i just find it UNK the binder up otherwise
you can er use it to highlight a key piece of information whether that's in the diary or in the work organiser
you could use it er in the reverse of the way that the theory suggests which you can actually leave it on the last diary page where you have something on your to do list that you haven't completed
and then as you complete those things you move it forward in series
erm i do not personally like that because i like the discipline of writing things out again for reasons which i will explain in boring detail in a while
or your last option is to do what the good folk at the training agency have done which is they claim that the today marker is not erm UNK enough so they UNK the er the two UNK together to make it UNK
and i think i'll stop right there with even more comments erm in case i lose that contract too
erm so those are the options with the UNK marker
please note that you do not have to open the rings to put these UNK over though you should after you've done it the first time erm it should become easier with practice let me put it that way okay
right i will now start to go through the pages
erm let me start with the monthly calendar card please
so if you could turn to any of the monthly calendar cards it matters not which one
er preferably the front of it erm they look something like this
okay can everybody see that reasonably well
i'll just stand in front of it most of the time
erm and obviously what you use these things for is to schedule your activities
now let me say with the monthly card and with the daily page i'm going to be showing you a very structured approach to planning
i am not anticipating that anybody in this room will do it the way i say i do it
erm i certainly don't do it the way that i say that i do it
erm what i'm aiming to do is to show you as many different techniques as i know er and if you pick up two or three of them that's absolutely terrific
erm but bear in mind you know this works best if you work it the way that you want to work it
erm so you can see i mean there's a er a totally UNK month for me
there's no such thing as a typical month
erm but those that has all my appointments on and i use a very simple system of crossed UNK when i am away from my base for the bulk of the day
so on for example the fifteenth of that particular month er i'm in manchester for the day i have one meeting at ten o'clock and i have another meeting at three thirty
but i am out of out away from my office away from my base
and the importance of that for me that shows me the shape of the month so there's nowhere i'm going to be on the tenth other than my office because i'm going to be out for the rest of the week
now i do tend to do everything in pencil particularly appointments
i find that the minute i write down erm you know somebody phones me and says i want another meeting with you let's make it for next friday at three o'clock in the afternoon and i find within half an hour of me writing that down on the calendar card in ink er the people who's UNK i then start to question phone back and say well whoops you know we forgot we actually had another meeting then and so on and so forth
and of course due to the good folks of the health and safety executive er UNK is no longer UNK so there is absolutely no fun in using the stuff any more
so i do tend to write everything in pencil
however there is very strong reasons for thinking about colour UNK
particularly if you're involved in different activities different project work colour UNK because it appeals to the right side of your brain erm whereas a lot of what you're going to be doing i assume is going to be fairly UNK activity erm could work very well for you
and it's something i'm UNK with myself but i haven't quite got it right
certainly i mean something you should be aware of however if you're using colour UNK if you're using symbols and UNK is the minute that you need a key to understand your own UNK and your or what the colours mean you're wasting time
and these things have to be instantly UNK
and again i mean the training agency are sort of masters and UNK they say of this because they had this stuff and then they actually you know certain departments will have a pre printed page with all the UNK that you should use
erm you know and that's just UNK
it's supposed to save you time erm not make your life more difficult
so whatever you use has to be instantly UNK
now what else can you do with these pages
well okay you'll see that of course that's a five by seven grid no it's not yes it is a five by seven grid so there's always going to be some blank spaces
oh wait a minute i'll wait while those of you who are UNK challenged will check that
erm
it is a five by seven grid isn't it yes thank you
erm there's always some blank spaces there so i use those for writing up key goals for the month
now for example these three i've got three on this one you can see the bottom right hand corner i have three specific business goals that i'm us that i want constant reminding of during the month
the first is that it's the end of a v a t quarter
so i write that down because that's going to involve me in extra work at the end of the month
i want to be aware of that when i'm planning my month
the second says mailing list
now as part of an annual goal which is to run some public courses later on in the year erm i've broken that down in a way that i may go through later to things that i have to do on a month by month basis and this month i need to create the mailing list
i mean is that reasonably
and the third thing says panels
erm i'm doing an exhibition next month i need new panels for my exhibition stand
the people who make these panels are closely related to estate agents in other words they are a lower life form
erm they write down nothing they remember nothing and i have to phone these UNK every other day to make sure that they're doing what we agreed they're going to otherwise i have no panels next month for my stand and i would be up the UNK
so that's why you know three different sorts of UNK that i've put on the front of the calendar card
now if you look at the nineteenth which is a sunday it says mailing cut now this again you know every month i send out renewal mailing erm for people who need diaries
and at the beginning of the year i would sort of work out which weeks i want those UNK to go out
now at the beginning of the year i have no idea how this particular week in november is going to pan out so i can't put it in for a specific day but i put it in on the sunday because it's specific to that week
okay
next going back to that erm you know i said that the key business goal there was to create a mailing list
now i know from past experience that creating that mailing list is going to take approximately sixteen hours of my time
er i don't physically have to type out the labels but i have physically have to be in the office to UNK the computer sorts because under something called personal job insurance scheme i've UNK the sort of routine under a lot of security codes and i'm only the only person who knows where they are
er which means i can't be fired without a great deal of hassle er but i er the kind of the down side is i have to go to the office occasionally
now erm the even dedicated person though i am ex UNK erm there is no way that i can find sixteen UNK hours in one month
you know it just isn't that simple
even on a sunday people come in and they phone and so on
well what i can find are eight days where for two hours my primary focus can be these labels producing the labels
so i make appointments with myself where i've got you'll see there eight days where for two hours that's what i'm going to be doing
mailing
and although you know to all UNK and purposes those appointments are UNK i know that they're in pink on the slide but they are UNK in terms of i'm not going to UNK that time to anyone else
those appointments with myself have equal importance perhaps more importance than my appointments with other people
and i think that's a that's a key message which i don't know what spends time on this how in fact we always accord other people more consideration than we do ourselves usually
and one of the key time management techniques is making appointments with yourself and keeping them
not UNK that time to other people
erm so that's one thing
you also see at the bottom of the slide i've put two UNK on the twenty ninth and the thirtieth
erm this is something that i started to use last year
a new technique for me and it works very well for me
erm these are catch up days
now what i mean by that is that every you know twenty working day month i know from UNK my time that i lose two days two full days to major interruptions
you know the computer goes down for a hour it's three quarters of the day to get everything back and UNK and that's a major UNK
erm in UNK town a particularly UNK part of london where my office is based we have a monthly burglary
erm and it's by appointment because it's just a lot easier
than having you know break all the alarms and everything else
the embarrassing thing is that we're all very right people so the place is a mess er and it takes us a quarter of a day before we realise that we've been UNK because things are actually slightly UNK than when we left the previous day
erm those are you know major interruptions
now what i do then is because i know this is going to happen when i'm planning my month if i've got some days towards the end of the month where i have no UNK whatsoever i put the UNK in there and that's a catch up day
and that's saying to me unless something really important comes up don't give this time away because this is your safety net
er now if you're going to use that you know so if somebody phones me and says er you know ricky i like to meet with you at er on the thirtieth i would just say i'm sorry i can't meet you that day
i'm not lying i'm not saying i'm addressing you know a national convention or i'm going to see the queen or whatever i'm just saying i can't see you that day
er how are you fixed for the beginning of next month or the week after that
i grant you i mean it's my judgement as to how critical that meeting is and i may lose business that way
but i think overall i gained
however i do use this with a certain amount of common sense
so if the president of my company calls from UNK and says ricky i'd like to see you in my office on the thirtieth i don't say i'm sorry steve it's catch up day i say what time would be convenient for you sir because you know otherwise i i'd be looking for a job
and the same thing that if a major client like the health and safety executive said to me ricky we're running a regional training week in the last week of november and we want you for three days you know i don't say to them well look you know well two of those days are catch up days i can't possibly do it why don't you move your whole regional training week to next week
because that's just not going to happen
you know they would say well we'll just find somebody else
so if i want the business you know i daren't
er but in the ordinary course of events er this afternoon is i'm dedicated to using as many UNK as i possibly can erm is you know that works very well as a way of protecting time for myself
next feel free to ask questions at any time if you're confused by anything
i won't necessarily answer them but you know i want to feel you know in these days of product communication that you have the er the liberty to ask them
okay now looking at all the other stuff on there and i look at that and i think well this is all very boring because it's all about business and business as we know is incredibly UNK
erm and we and i trust that would be true for everybody in this room
the really important things are outside of business totally
so what i really want to do this month well what i really want to do this month is to lose some weight
so i write that on the calendar card in big letters
now why do i write that there well this is my planning system
nobody actually looks at it apart from me so i'm not embarrassed about writing that there
you know a few thousand people see my slides over the years but you know nobody would ever guess i need to lose weight anyway
you know maybe i'm not giving that much away erm it's constant UNK for something that is important to me
er if i don't lose any weight this month i feel UNK guilty and that's going to help me lose weight next month and so on and so forth
what you should bear in mind of course is that in the space of a month i probably look at this a couple of thousand times
and every time i look at this card i take in everything on it and er at a UNK level
so it is constant repetition of something that's actually important
erm again if you're not comfortable doing this kind of thing then you shouldn't do it obviously and the last thing on the monthly calendar card is as you'll see er on the twenty fourth twenty fifth twenty sixth and twenty seventh it has another personal message there
what happened is at the beginning of last year UNK said to me er we have lived in this house for three years we must UNK it
i have just been on an inter personal skills workshop so i knew what to do
i UNK before UNK to her because if you pause before UNK to people it gives them the foolish idea that you've actually listened to what they've said and i said of course darling
er at the beginning of february we had a very similar conversation and march and april
may she said i i'm not going to let you get away with this
give me your day time
and i handed over my day timing now bear in mind this is all in pencil and she looked at the schedule for may and said you're not real busy this month you know you can take some time off
no more excuses
and in UNK ink she crossed out those four days and wrote decorating across them
she said we're going to UNK on those days
now of course she had a very odd spelling of decorating d i v o r c e
erm but you know which lent a certain point to the whole argument
but that's you know because she did that because the time was blocked out in that way i actually did it and we wound up with i now live in a in a big one UNK house
we have a few other rooms to go er with my family as opposed to living on my own
and so we are decorating the house together
if i'd not blocked or she'd not blocked out that time in that way what would have happened is on the thirteenth er of the month erm red would have called me from the health and safety executive would have called me and said ricky we've got er a UNK leadership weekend on the top of UNK and er on that on the last weekend of the month and we've got a one hour slot for you that's just a golden opportunity
now you know when someone says golden opportunities they're not paying you
it's code
er and red would go on to say er unfortunately we're in an overspend situation so i can't afford to pay you but i personally would give you fifty p towards your expenses as you pitch over there
and i would have said ray please i was brought up with this and it's UNK to discuss money over the telephone erm you know don't dream of paying me anything i'm just ever so grateful for the opportunity
erm and i would have gone home and said i'm sorry darling a major client can't afford to pay these people and so on and so forth
so th the this you know this main thing of really a UNK worth a thousand words and the more you can block out time in this way and protect yourself er the better your overall time management will be
any questions or anything else anybody has ever done we want to use the calendar for
any
okay if you could turn to back of the calendar card please you'll find that is a that's just plain lined paper which is divided into two columns that says at the top to be done in january
now the ones for january february and march are perhaps not terribly useful for you because you have the current diary pages
where they come into their own is let's say that you wanted to phone me in july because my wedding anniversary is in july you could turn to the back of the july calendar card write down call ricky UNK on the seventh because it's his wedding anniversary erm and write down my telephone number and then UNK though i find this idea you could forget the whole thing confident in the knowledge that the system will remind you at the appropriate time as to what action you should take
for any sort of forward prospecting or monitoring that you do the backs of the calendar cards are absolutely invaluable
let's say that you give one of your people a six month project to work on you've agreed with them as part of the parameters that you're going to check with them every two months on it where do you put those UNK to yourself
you put them on the backs of the calendar card
it's the same thing
in terms of prospecting i usually do the training exhibition at the n e c every july er in eighty six a man came onto my stand and we UNK for half an hour he then said to tell you the truth i'm not interested now but i will be interested next may
so on the back of the may calendar card i wrote down his name and telephone number and put n e c in brackets
the following may i called him got through his secretary by saying mr jones asked me to call at this office which was more or less true erm so i got through to him and said my name is ricky UNK we met at the n e c you asked me to give you a call this month about time management training
and he said oh yes i remember you erm of course he didn't
er he did after a while because there just aren't that many people who run round the n e c who look me in july but erm there were UNK earlier in the year but it you know i got actually a very reasonable size of contract out of this man from that thirty second note i made on the calendar
and that's why i say they are invaluable for prospecting and monitoring purposes
you should be working on a i would recommend a three month rolling basis in terms of your current for the daily diary pages
in your binder you should have this month last month and next month
obviously you haven't got that at the moment you've got this lot like that
erm that's on the basis that eighty percent of your diary forward UNK will be in the next thirty days eighty percent of your UNK for information is going to be in the last thirty days
practically what that means is when you get to march the first you would UNK january and insert april
is there any merit in actually UNK day by day
rather than month by month
not that i've ever come across
i could i but nobody's ever suggested that before
erm try it and let me know in six months
i'll put a note in my day time to check with you in six months
it seems to me that would be a real pain
okay
i you would probably remember to do it i wouldn't
alright i'll try it
i mean it's
yes well and that's good that's good
report back
erm what was i saying
at the beginning of each month you'll find the first page of each month is a UNK of the back of the calendar card
yep
except it has a year date on it instead
now this is the page where i recommend you do your monthly planning on
the back of the calendar card the notes that make on the back of the calendar card will be in UNK order presumably
you know you'll write them as they as they occur to you
what you do on that first page of the month is you put those that page that says to be done in january ninety four or whatever erm you put the notes on the back of the calendar card in priority order and add any other formal targets you've got
so that you wind up with a UNK monthly to do list
erm i know that over the last few days you've gone through the process of writing UNK notes so i'm not going to go through that process with you
er in any detail
it is not enough just to have that UNK list
er you must then go through the month and work out either on the monthly calendar card or on the daily pages when you're actually going to do this stuff on this list
that is essential it's not enough to write the monthly to do list
and i would suggest that you need to be looking at investing about two hours er up front in each month writing the UNK to list and then working out when you're actually going to do this stuff
er and not making the mistake of UNK how long things are going to take
you know always give yourself more time than you actually need
to do that operation you are expected to wait until the first of the month to start planning the month
you're probably looking two weeks before or something
UNK again whatever is comfortable for you
erm i always yes i mean i tend to
i tend to do it the weekend before the month starts
but that may just be the pattern of my work
that's not to say they are things that are happening this month that i haven't planned for three months ago
yes
it's the rest of the stuff that i want to do this month
yes
but it would depend on what you actually do every month
anything else because i'm a i'm about to UNK on the monthly calendar cards and monthly planning
richard
if you have say some people who want something UNK for may would you bother to actually go into your storage binder and actually mark it in there as well
when do you actually put it in
yes
and i might do it depends what it is
if it's a meeting i might not even put that in at all
erm because i'm because i don't like UNK i UNK as little as i can you know
depending on the sort of day it is
anything else
i mean that doesn't mean you shouldn't do that if you're if you're happy doing that
yes
mike certainly would do it i can tell but i mean i personally wouldn't
okay i'm going to go to the day the daily page now
if you can turn to any i'll talk generally about it and then i'll go into detail
any daily spread you've been given here a two page per day dairy
now this particular size because do quite a lot of sizes as well er we do five different diary UNK
er we do two varieties of two page per day we do a one page per day and we do two varieties of two page per week
i've given you the two er the one that gives you the most space for the day on the basis that if you have too much space for daily planning it's maybe UNK
if you have too little space it's actually UNK
so i've followed your commitments through this course i'd like you to stay with this particular diary format for three months
if at the end of three months you decide that this is too elaborate for you or you'd like to if you need to see a week at a glance er you just call my office send back the pages you haven't used and we would exchange those er for the equivalent in a different format
that is that's not a problem
er but i want you to start with this one because it gives you the most flexibility
erm i am not aware as i say i'm not aware that anybody in tarmac has ever switched to a one but i i'm which i find quite remarkable erm but you can do it if you if you feel the need to
have you got a anywhere
i think there are details in the er UNK referred to handbook with your instructions
i'll check that out in the break
erm okay the daytime principle is very simple one which is you have the left hand page and the right hand page
the left hand page is where you plan the right hand page is where you record the end of the day you are supposed to record one with UNK and carry forward UNK business to the next day
it is of course not that simple er in real life
i mean it may have been that simple for mr UNK who was a lawyer erm but i don't think it's it certainly isn't that simple for me and i not for anybody else i know
erm i am going to go through the left hand side in some detail
again i'm going to show you a very structured approach to planning
don't be put off by that erm just you know grab whatever you can out of it
i'm not sure whether we need it's better with the lights off or on
oh that's something else i shouldn't have said i guess
erm okay some of the is that visible or shall i turn the lights out
yes mm oh that's okay
is that okay
alright now here's okay he's a day i've got this is the beginning of the day
yes i've not started to plan the day yet
and inevitably when you turn up a diary page you have between say one and twelve things already entered into the to do list
i have to go back a stage i haven't actually explained what these four to you on this page you've got four boxes
okay you have a to do section you have an appointments schedule you have a box at the left hand bottom that says phone calls and you have a box at the right hand corner that says expenses and UNK record
this of course is an american system as you will have gathered already
they get away with a lot more in terms of expenses than we do over here er which is why there's such a heavy emphasis on expenses
i know very few people in this country who need to record their expenses in that much detail on a daily basis
particularly if you think about the expense envelopes and the other sheets you've got
i use that box for my personal to do list
as you'll see
and i'm mentioning that now because i'm always amazed at how UNK by the printed word most people are
as i go round the country and i you know i explain to people how i use my UNK and er people say well can i do that too
you know is it okay
and i say yes you have my permission now
erm because i used to laugh at people but i found you know they got UNK so it is much easier if i play god and say yes you know
they you can do it now
so in case any of you are worried about you know inappropriate headings ignore them it's you system you do with it what you want
alright
i'd much rather y you know you did anything you want than ignore a bit that you could otherwise find useful
now going back at this particular day i have forward UNK er they represent different sorts of forward UNK so i'll go through those in detail
before i do that you know let me point out i've got three commitments on this particular day
i have a meeting with a software house at ten thirty mike is coming in at three thirty to talk about the new book and tonight's one of the nights when UNK is teaching so i have to be home by a reasonable hour so that we can exchange car keys and UNK keys and that sort thing
now on the to do list the first item says check b j l and there's a d in brackets
b j l are the initials of my marketing manager
the d in brackets refers to a wo a work organiser section of my UNK which is my marketing section
now what that's saying is today is the due date for a job that i gave barbara
all the information about that job is in the d section look in the d section
there's no point me writing any other detail out on the to do list because i'm going to automatically go to that section to find out all the all of the details
so i i'm just using very simple code to cross reference the diary section with the work organiser section
the second item says phone UNK with the thirtieth of the erm september after it
on the thirtieth of september er a good friend of mine called me and said these people are interested in what you do give them a call
and dictated to me their name address you know telephone number fax number contact name and all the rest of it
which i wrote down on the diary records side
i phoned and the man that i needed to speak to was not there he'd been seconded to the UNK or something he was only coming back erm in the middle of january i was in erm november or whatever it was i was giving a few days' grace and then i was going to call
at this stage i have no idea how important this man is to my future
the likelihood is i'm going to send him a catalogue and some you know a letter
erm there is a very small chance that he's going to say all the time that i was on top of UNK er i was thinking about you because i've heard you're the best thing since UNK bread i have three thousand people that i want to put through a programme in the next six weeks
you know do you think you can help me
at that point he becomes marginally important to my future and i might just make out a client sheet for him
even i can UNK myself to do that on that kind of basis
but at this stage i have no idea so there's no point writing out information which is already in place as it were and then i can reference him
it's because i just i UNK unnecessary UNK
the third item says check b s t that's just an order for a particular customer that i put through yesterday and i want to make sure it's going to happen today
erm in other words it's the kind of thing that you would automatically remember in UNK
now the last thing says labels code four you'll remember from the monthly card i have these eight days where i was going to do the labels
this is one of these days
kindly note that i have been specific on the daily to do list
i haven't just put labels i've put labels code four which means london
do the london labels today
the reason that i put code four is if i just put labels on the list i know that i cannot complete that task today
and because i know i can't finish it there's a good chance i won't start it
by breaking it down into something i can do today there's a much better chance i will actually do it
and i really can't say this enough times
that the more you can break stuff down into achievable daily goals the better off you are
you know because time and time again you know we're made UNK by the size of the task that face us
we need to break stuff down as much as you can
okay
so then that's er that's when i turn the page now i add a variety of other lists
erm i have you know i have added things to my business list i won't go through those at the moment
underneath expense and UNK record i've got two personal items there
erm i mean i separate them out UNK because they have equal validity
er i used not to do that i used to put everything in one list and then my home telephone was cut off one time er because i just never regarded the personal things as being terribly important until you know i don't have to pay well over a hundred quid to get the thing fixed again
but now i separate them out because i realised although they don't you know things like pick up cleaning don't seem that significant erm tomorrow morning when i
okay erm this bit we're going through is the work organiser
this consists of some different bits and pieces so again let me go those first
you have here twenty six UNK alpha UNK er unless it's going to create a problem they usually go a to z erm some people use this an UNK filing system
i'm actually going to recommend that you regard these things as codes and that you only put twelve of these actually into your active binder and put the other fourteen in a storage binder as spares
er and this is as i said er right at the beginning the work organiser is a way of tracking information which is best UNK by subject or topic rather than by date
in other time management systems this sort of thing would be called a key results area erm you know it it's that kind of thing
it's for setting goals and working them out and so on
then you get six pads of different sorts of daytime UNK extra forms such the agendas communication records and so on five samples of fifteen different forms and some clear UNK holders
those are the exciting things i'll explain later
wow
you get a lot of stationary
er about twenty different forms in all
i anticipate that you will use about three of them
you know you might like sort of six and you may use the sample pages that you get in about six different things
erm but i think you'll actually use one two maybe three of them
er i have people who get this set and then instantly UNK everything plus everything else that's available
there are about another forty things that you can get you know for this particular er binder
these people obviously are in the wallpaper business
they cannot be doing any honest work if they're spending their life filling pieces of paper to go into these ring UNK
erm so what i'm saying you know as we go through this stuff you if you if you discover that you don't like some of it you know you're not supposed to
i mean some of our forms i haven't worked out what they're for yet an and i'm trying to some run some competitions for the best er use of one particular one it may well be in this pack
so you know don't worry about that
don't lose the basic utility of the system they're because you're UNK by a form that has no relevance to you
just make a paper aeroplane out of it
or use it as UNK
okay so let me start handing these out and what i'd like you to do is to extract the er alpha UNK that are at the back and then separate those out into two piles a to l and m to z please
erm now put the m to z into the storage binder please those are the ones that you're going to use for spares
now even more than the rest of the stuff that i've said i wouldn't mention that to anybody else no
erm then anything else i've said today this is really not holy writ erm i'm just going to make or suggested arrangement of these UNK and if you want to keep them this way that's fine and if you want to do something else with them that's also fine
but for today we're going to pretend that there is a right way of using these and you're going to follow what i say
put the a UNK in front of the address and telephone section please
that's at the front of your active binder
put the just the a UNK
just the a UNK put the okay right it's usually the bits before this that c erm th the b to f i think it is b c d e f after the address and telephone please before the january calendar card good okay put the g UNK after the december calendar card in front of the planning UNK
sorry one thing i didn't explain i it's probably quite obvious but i'll explain it anyway which is the reason for putting the planning UNK in at that place is your diary UNK in the december of next of this year you will probably order your UNK in october november er of next year and based on our outstanding customer services this year you'll probably receive it next february
erm you will want you'll already have commitments for next year where do you put those commitments
you put them on those planning calendar pages
you know that's they're there for
put the remaining UNK that you have it should be h to l after that section in front of the expense envelopes
now at the back of the re rest of that packet erm in front of the UNK cardboard but you may already have extracted this you'll find two sets of pre printed labels
these are for UNK to the erm UNK
right but please don't do it for at least three months
i would suggest that it takes about three months to work out what your best arrangement of categories is going to be
now i had the first set of these UNK over in this country
erm i erm employ people so i decided to have an employment section six months later when i was reviewing the UNK i discovered that i had one sheet in my employment section er about a lady i had interviewed and not employed whereas i had a prospect section that was UNK and needed drastic sub division
i was able because i'm a director of the company to tear up my UNK and steel another set
if you make the same mistake er you have to buy another set and i double the price for people who have heard me say don't do this er and lie low you know in the first three months because i believe in UNK
so and UNK
so what i'm suggesting you do is decide roughly what your categories are going to be and write at the top of the in pencil or on the UNK themselves in pencil as to what you want them to be
i'm going to write up a suggested arrangement on the board now
and i'll explain you know what these different things mean as and when we come to them
so what i'm suggesting is that a is in fact your address and telephone section b should be for your goals and strategic plans c d e and f er would be for your specific functional areas
very carefully chosen erm g is your forward schedule for next year onwards h would be for god otherwise known as the boss i is for erm otherwise known as colleagues and j is for UNK people who report to you and k is the personal section and l is new ideas schedule
basically
what is the is what's c d e and f
er specific functional areas not what you actually do in other words
so in mine for example c er is er public courses d is marketing e are in house courses and f are computers
because those are the areas that i look after for the business
okay is that reasonably clear to everyone
what's
loss could be i'm sorry
erm now what you do with this these sections is of course you build up information over time
so the information in these sections will tend to be static
what will tend to happen is for example erm in my section to deal with public courses i would have information about the UNK that i'm going to use this year i would have information about the mailing lists i'm going to use and information about the mailing lists of my office i'm going to use i would have prospects that i'm going to call you know it's all stuff that i would tend to plan out on a pad of paper and then insert into the particular data section and refer to as i need to
which is why i've asked you to actually split this work organiser between the front and the back of the binder
er open your binder any ring binder system has the basic functional disadvantage that pages close to the bottom of the rings are very difficult to write on
i have very small hands but even for me i can't write UNK more than half way across that page
what makes sense therefore is to put the work organiser at either end of the binder to build those up so that pages where you really will be writing on in the binder which are the diary pages will become UNK towards the middle of the rings and make that much easier to write on
is that yes reasonably
erm that's the reason for having the sections split at the back and the front of the binder
okay what i'd like to do now is to go through the pads that you've been given
it should be on top of the erm UNK the erm instruction sheet
erm
excuse me
yes
just one thing we're actually writing this information of ours for individual job areas on this
i would yes
right they're not they're not UNK for other
whatever they are no you've got UNK there but i'm saying don't use those up yet they're not UNK for stuff that's going to be behind they're actually for pages and so on
right so what are you saying
well you're saying that you build up information about so you're actually writing that information on these
right no that's just a UNK responsible
ah so it is a UNK yes
so the information that goes on yes
so you've got extra pages right which is
don't interrupt
what we're going through now
because
yes okay
i'm sorry about that the room erm okay the six pads that you've got
now each of these alright we'll go through the pads and i'll discuss what you can do with them
the first pad if you hold it up against any of the other pads you'll see that it's actually slightly shorter
yes
it therefore has th the swinging title of cut down memo form
erm which just trips off the tongue
erm the advantage of this one is that you can it's obviously just plain memo sheet you can insert a page from this pad into any diary spread and it wouldn't mask the date information at the top
and this is the pad i would recommend you use if your diary is UNK
on those days when you need more information use this pad er for that purpose
i mean er again bear in mind this is not holy writ
use it for whatever you want to use it for but er this is a suggestion
okay the next pad is
okay this is a drop dead sheet
erm you know we all deal with people who either on a personal or a business level who we genuinely feel the world would be a better place without
you know people you know you're going to wind up in court with and you need to you want to keep an a you know an accurate log of every communication you get from these people
particularly now of course when it's so much more difficult to back er back date stuff maybe because of the success that people have had on pay cuts
and it used to be it killed off a good part of our business this year we used to do a UNK trade in back dated diaries with accountancy lawyers and it's all gone
you know it's a tragedy
erm what they could possibly be doing with these things i couldn't imagine
erm so this is what this is this form is for
it's for it's a it's a client form obviously but it's a very detailed one for all the sorts of communications you get with brief notes about you know actually
okay next okay a rather odd looking form erm multi purpose memo form that erm well that's what it used to be
these days it's perhaps best as a telephone answering machine tool
when you're away from your base and somebody is UNK your calls for you give them this pad and ask them to record the calls in this pad then you can just tick that box on the right hand side that says calls to answer erm and insert the pages as you need to into the UNK
next one meeting agenda
okay meeting agenda is a splendid form
erm it it's really one of the more useful ones
i think it's a bit too busy myself but i'll explain w the things about it that i really like
erm i think that the things that are important about this form in that it asks you to define the purpose of a meeting as opposed to or as distinct from the agenda
you know pe people confuse the two
personally i do not go to meetings which do not have a purpose
or if i am called to a meeting that does not have a purpose written on the agenda i demand to know what the purpose of the meeting is before we start
if somebody can't tell me what it is i get up and go
er because it's just you know my time is very valuable
i feel that about everybody's time
i don't see why i should spend time some way away if people haven't actually UNK what they're trying to achieve
erm other things that are good about this you've got the people attending and then the value per hour
you remember there was that form saying how much is your time worth
from time to time it is a good idea to cost meetings
very few people realise how expensive they are and if you can remind people UNK of how much time you know how much money is actually going erm it tends to focus people's minds
erm what of course you do on that form is it's not just how much people are paid it's how much they're paid plus benefits times two
you know it's charge out time it's the cost of them not doing something else
i so don't do this for every meeting erm but from you know occasionally it's a good idea
you've got items to be discussed and then you've got an ability on the right hand side them to UNK them
because people who write very good UNK to do lists don't necessarily UNK meeting agendas
erm and yet it's exactly the same thing
if the most important thing on your agenda is number seven you know you're probably not even going to get to it because you'll be too tired
you should make the important thing the most important item on your agenda number two
you have an ice UNK and then and then on to the important stuff
and lastly you've got material needed and people responsible for bringing it
erm how often do you go to a meeting or have you been to a meeting which has to stop for twenty minutes because some UNK has left the files in his office and he has to go back and retrieve them
you know this way erm if it's on the agenda as to who's bringing what you can UNK people erm if they decide not to bring it or if they if they don't bring it
erm you'll find if you turn to the back of the form again this is another mis designed thing
you're supposed to write the minutes for this meeting on the back of the agenda now i know very few people who ever actually do that er i always want to look at the agenda when i'm taking my notes
er and i always reckon others will do the same so i always take my notes on a on a plain piece of paper and put them together if i need to
some UNK well organised not to mention tight people take their notes for this meeting on the back of the last meeting's agenda
erm which i just find amazing that they can do that
but again you know it is an optional erm
okay next
er graph sheets yes
er the one after that is plain lined paper
which i'd
where are we putting these in
no you're not putting them anywhere at the moment
okay that's the life of the pads
right what i'd like you to do is oh andrew perhaps i could show it with UNK
you will also find you have got two clear UNK holders like this
these are actually to use for use with the pads
obviously you can use these if you can figure out how they open erm to protect documents
you can use them as my brother does to put pictures of your loved ones in to remind yourself what you're working for personally i find that rather UNK
erm but at least you know
what they're actually designed for is you'll notice that each pad has a stiff card backing why
why do c i'm sorry i've just remembered something i haven't covered okay
what you can do is to insert the cardboard backing into the envelope like that and then you put that bit through the rings and then it becomes a tear pad
so if you're wandering around and you want to write somebody a quick note you don't have to open the rings and take out a piece of paper you just write on here and tear it off
okay
erm if of course you're heavily into recycling er what you can do is put the whole pad inside er the envelope and use a
erm but that takes a certain amount of UNK
now what i'd like you to do is to select two i told you i'd be serious in the last part the whole is here is select the two pads you like best please and put one at the front of the binder and one at the back
kindly note these things are UNK they don't care which way round they go but i'd recommend you organise it so the pad is actually resting on the cover not on the rest of the paper in the binder because it will make it a bit UNK to use
yes
okay
if of course you don't like any of the pads then ignore everything
what at the front and the back
i would i would do that yes
so i can actually write in it
no put it in here take all that out
yes
put that like that i'm going to change the way i say
like this one here the shorter one
right
everything and all menus are available from i mean i don't where they take out a listing of well i don't where they
alright okay no they're extras
put the rest of them i mean i in the storage binder or you know or you can obviously put them in the active binder if you want to do
so the rest of the pads we need to go through the colour forms and everything
okay everybody put the pads away please
er we'll go through erm okay we'll go through the rest of the stationary with a certain amount of UNK
erm now they changed the order that they put these things in so i need you to tell me as we go along which ones are which
the first one is expenses
this form is actually quite good for UNK how you pay for things not necessarily what you pay paid for erm i again er almost certainly useless to you
some people i know have used them for departmental budgets but quite how they do that i don't know
you know but again you know i would throw mine away
next
important people to remember
ah important people to remember is quite an interesting sheet because everybody UNK it so much
erm it's a rep sheet
and er it's very good if you need to record that kind of information about people but most of us don't
next
UNK log
sorry which one
UNK log
UNK log absolutely useless completely
next
delegation assignment
delegation of assignment
okay a key form
delegation assignment
erm okay i er you can use this in one of two ways
either to you know write down delegation that you're giving somebody and then photocopy it and give it to them
now one of the reasons a lot of UNK go wrong is because we think we have agreed ground rules with people
er it's because we don't write down the stuff we're not as pr precise as we could be
you know that that's a very common reason
so you can write down the delegation and photocopy it and give it to somebody
alternatively er what you could do is what i do which is i use these for rolling basis appraisals
so i have people who report to me like kevin my despatch manager
so i have a sheet like this in my UNK that says kevin
every job that i give kevin i write down a brief summary of what that task was and i leave a gap of three lines
when the job is over i then write a brief summary appraisal as it were on his performance
so that when we have the thing that he calls an annual review and i call a pain in the neck i don't actually have to put in very much work to come up with the fact that no i'm not going to give him a salary increase erm because i have his performance you know already UNK throughout the year
so it takes all the pain out of coming up with annual appraisals because you've been doing it on an UNK basis
that's what those sheets are good for
okay next
plain lined paper
which one
plain lined paper
plain lined paper yes that's a very complicated form
and you'll find the same thing but with a co in two columns
yes
erm absolutely wonderful for shopping lists
erm otherwise perhaps a little bit too small for anything useful
it's erm sometimes you could use that as a as a structured UNK sheet
what's called a UNK list w quite why the UNK are blamed for this i don't know er and the idea with a UNK list is that you have you put the problem on the left hand side if you're right handed and then you would brain storm the solutions for that on the right hand side
if you are left handed of course you do it the other way round
next
the iron UNK diary
the iron UNK record
this used to be called services performance day but we realised most of our customers were
it's a an UNK sheet for erm people who charge out their time by the minute or what you can use it for is if you want to keep a precise time lock for five working days and i would recommend that you do this at some point in your future use these sheets to do it
erm each faint er horizontal line represents fifteen minutes so it it's a fairly easy way to do a time lock
okay next
meeting agendas abroad
meeting agendas abroad we've seen
UNK
UNK okay this is er it's a diagnostic sheet if you find that you're UNK quite a lot over time for you know at a particular time and you want to find out why you're becoming less effective you use this to log interruptions
it's particularly powerful if the interruptions are coming from the boss
erm because if interruptions are coming from the people who work for you can you know nicely tell them to go away and get on with it but if they're coming from the boss and bosses are sensitive soles so it's difficult to actually say to the boss you're wasting a lot of my time go away
erm depending on your relationship you have if however you keep a log of your interruptions erm well this is the way i recommend you do it
the first time the boss UNK you write down er boss on the appropriate column and then what it was about and the UNK time and all the rest of it
then er you don't do it whilst the boss is in the room obviously
the next time the boss UNK you do the same thing but you leave a gap of three lines there you see just three two three lines and write boss and what it's about the next time the boss UNK you know leave another UNK gap er and log the UNK
when you've got enough boss imposed interruptions on the sheet you know twelve to fifteen take the rest of the week off
you know there's no point in wasting your time you know UNK everybody else and you go to the boss and you say boss you know that personal management skills course that i you said i should go on so you proving what you know what a good person you are because you've remembered a month later what the course was called erm i was told on that course to keep an interruptions log so you're proving you know that you are a good person when you've done this and i see from this that a great deal of your valuable time is being eroded by my humble concerns you know something like that
you will be right he UNK
erm i was wondering if you know and then you have to come up with a solution because bosses don't like problems they like solutions
and maybe the solution would be regular one to one meeting for ten minutes in the morning and you could get rid of all this UNK in one go rather than having him wander in or her wander in at any particular time you know and just UNK your flow
so that's what this sheet is for it's an interruptions log particularly good er when you're with the boss
er let me say also of course some bosses you know are sad UNK they need a little bit more of a UNK at which point you have to put it in monetary terms
you know and you then have that sheet and how much is my time worth and how much is his time worth or her time worth and you can say you know these interruptions are actually costing us quite a lot of month
next
oh that's you see that one over there that's the one for phone calls
yes then you've got some graph paper and you'll probably find that you've got some with columns in you've got yes vertical and then horizontal margins and then you've got some with columns in
the columns are always one square out from what you want them to be
erm there's a genuine we never we they're relatively recent
we produced because so many customers said you know why don't you have columns on your graph paper
so we produced three different sorts and they're never in the right place
then we've got the most sophisticated of our forms the UNK absolutely blank ones
the ones most people can't do anything with those they're just paralysed by them in the states and then we have project management forms
these are project fact sheets
they're quite nice for self imposed goals
erm for something you want to do and UNK yourself it's again in here it's a brain UNK sheet
and then you've got some more communication records and then you've got ah the annual summary forms
now these clearly were designed for financial UNK er for people who have very small handwriting
erm and you can certainly use them for that
i use them for breaking down annual goals to monthly goals
you know so i mean i talked about this before this is a mailing that i want to do in october which means for example that i've got to print the catalogue in july which means i've got to proof it in june which means i have to actually design it in april and may
and by breaking things down you know that's actually what i use these sheets for myself
and i would keep those in my b section you know i have my long term goals and i have goals for the year and then i have my planning sheets on how i'm going to implement those goals
so i think those sheets are fabulous but you only need a few of them
okay is that it
the telephone call batch are fairly obvious sheets
okay so that's it
so those are all the different forms you've got
erm put all of that in the storage binder please for the moment erm if you you've got so much stationary now you'll probably find it quite difficult to close it but if you UNK it around enough you'll be able to do it
and i just have a couple of other things i want to say to you and then we can all go home
oh i've got something else in here
erm okay there are two other things i want to do
firstly i my office telephone number you'll find in various places throughout the system
erm but i'll give you my home number to see what else we do in the other things phone my office please
if however you're confused about anything this afternoon or you want more information about you know managing time and so on give me a call please er my number is and er i may not be there but i do have an UNK and i will get back to you as soon as i can
erm that's the er that's the first thing
erm i'd much rather you put this in your UNK of course and then you can't send it back to me
erm but more important er i wanted to explain something to you which again to my to the best of my knowledge nobody else does this erm so pay close attention please
this is a you know how you should approach change er i learnt my lesson a few years ago because i went on a course i came back to my office and thought the world had changed
i called UNK in and said UNK this is the way we're going to do things from now on and UNK knew which side of the bread her butter was on so she said of course ricky no problem
over lunch i UNK say to sarah who'd just started with us then UNK a bit strange at the moment because he's just been on a course but he'll be better next week
and i was
and what i thought was happening you see was that if you can imagine this kind of psychological or UNK equilibrium point that we all start from then i sort of UNK changed
i moved up to there and i want to bring everybody up to my new level so i sort of drag everybody up but i always thought it was just the UNK effect you know that i couldn't have a mental and physical and moral energy to last everybody out wh while they would change effectively
but i talked to UNK about it and she said it's a lot more interesting than that what you're forgetting is that change is usually perceived as criticism what's wrong with the way we've been doing things
i didn't get where i am today by kind of UNK
and it's one of the more interesting applications of UNK third law to every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
it's not that when you're trying to change that people stay in equilibrium point at all they actually go down to there
it's not that they UNK resist you it's that they actively UNK you because the change is so UNK
so you know it it's just they will actually the interesting bit is that they'll only move back to that equilibrium point as you fall down towards them
so in order to sort of effect effective change you really need to do it very slowly and UNK
so with the particular diary system i mean this what i've just said is about the whole course but the particular diary i would say get to grips with the diary first and then you know once you're on tap with that then get involved with the erm project sheets and the project management forms
erm but start with the diary because that's where most of the benefit is coming from
any questions at all
good excellent i like it when there are no questions
erm well thank you very much for your time
thank you
i have enjoyed it
do you want a lift
erm no i'm fine
yes
walking is good for the soul it's
you've finished it
as i say you've er you've got a long way to go okay fine thank you
we'll see you in whenever in a months' time is it february
february is month one okay then
yes
right can i ask those of you who haven't to start to fill in your assessment sheets please
some people have already done it by the looks of things only they haven't changed it
hopefully
yes
is there not one in your er
twenty six forms which police had to fill in to UNK a thief
and are too many babies being born by UNK
british coal has asked the national union of UNK to discuss further pit closures
the plan set out in a letter to the union is being seen as a sign that all thirty one pits earmarked for closure last year will now shut
in the commons the energy minister tim UNK said the government was prepared to go on funding the current redundancy terms available to miners until april next year
labour's robin cook said the miners had been UNK
it was just over a year ago that british coal announced the closure of thirty one of britain's deep mines
five months later the government gave twelve of the pits a UNK after an UNK from the public and m ps
but today british coal said the closure review procedure was being UNK after its suspension last year
feelings ran high but it wasn't like the drama of last year when the government were forced into a UNK review of their pit closure programme
michael heseltine let his deputy tim UNK put the case that the government had tried to encourage the market for domestic coal
the opposition condemned ministers for a cynical exercise which they knew would fail
if any other government in europe had such efficient pits and such large coal reserves they would be UNK that national resource not shutting them down
it is not the miners who should face the sack but the ministers who have UNK them and UNK britain's coal industry
the government is now washing its hands of the industry as it hands it over to a UNK market which will leave very few pits in britain and the destruction of an asset which the british people asked the government to save and which the government said they were going to save
mr UNK insisted that the government had poured enormous sums into the industry
twenty billion pounds since nineteen seventy nine
that means one million pounds for every miner now working in the coal mining industry
and the honourable gentleman has the nerve to say that we have UNK the market against coal
the energy minister denied that the government had broken promises
the government made its position absolutely clear in the white paper
we said there was no guarantee of additional markets
we accepted the recommendation of the select committee that a subsidy would be made available
we have made that subsidy available
on which pits might close that he said was a matter for british coal
but some of the tories who successfully UNK last year showed their disappointment
and one of them complained that the government were prepared
to allow this country to import coal into the united kingdom putting people out of work when in fact we have some of the UNK and most competitive deep mine coal in the world to offer for sale
last year mps were shocked to be told that thirty thousand miners would lose their jobs and half the country's pits would close
much of the UNK that produced is still present
but there's now a more UNK mood
everyone accepts that pits will close but there seems little chance of the government being UNK by another UNK among tory m ps
john sergeant b c news westminster
there's been UNK anger in the mining industry to UNK news
many workers said they'd expected another round of closures despite the earlier announcement of a UNK for some of the UNK
and n u m officials have accused the government of misleading the public into believing the pits would be saved
calverton colliery in nottinghamshire is one pit under threat
the law says that british coal has to go through a procedure of consultation before it can close pits
after today's announcement the miners there now expect that to be done
it's been on the cards for so long i think everyone's had enough
let's just get it over with i think most people are thinking
it's expected
we know it's been coming
it's just been a matter of time
well i'm forty three i don't see what future i've got
i mean if i UNK you know there's a thousand people for the same job it's just looking very bleak
miners at UNK watched the announcement on television
the UNK threatened
after the tragedy there they're also concerned about safety over the decision to UNK a law limiting miners' hours
safety does come cost and here in notts that we've had a safety policy
it's been now some eighteen month two years
but it does cost er the corporation
i don't think that er smaller operators when er safety becomes UNK will be able to afford er that cost
british coal put no numbers on UNK to be closed
UNK sources say about fifteen pits are now threatened
with nottinghamshire first in line
the corporation hopes miners will take the redundancy and not go through the lengthy procedure
it says the money is generous
unions call it closure by UNK they feel UNK
they were simply buying time came out with a white paper that meant absolutely nothing and now we see the full effects of it
we're about to lose our coal industry and er we're about to lose it because of the incompetent blind UNK er of this present government
if i say that er the reduction the industry is facing is about fifty percent
currently we've about thirty operating UNK
erm i think the scale of that reduction is entirely er UNK
and in fact er we said that at the time the white paper was published
it is the home straight to privatization
the smaller british coal is the more attractive it is to buyers
but there's a city of london view that not much will be bought
contracts to buy coal aren't there
until such contacts are in place deep UNK output would not be attractive to the private industry and would not be UNK
british coal and the government's problem would be if the men don't volunteer
if they don't accept closures soon
that will leave the corporation with too many UNK on its hands and that would put privatization into doubt

thousands of pensioners travelled to westminster today to protest against the government's plans to impose v a t on domestic fuel
at a rally they heard the labour leader john smith repeat his criticism of the government having a fatal UNK to v a t several conservative mps have stepped up the pressure on senior ministers to reverse the plans
as UNK of pensioners arrived at westminster from around the country on a suitably UNK day to protest about what might happen to their heating bills when v a t's introduced
their message to the government was UNK and straightforward
well i think it's disgusting
absolutely disgusting
we either freeze to death or UNK to death
they don't care about anybody
their pockets are lined that's all i've got to say
around five thousand UNK on the commons to lobby their mps and the labour leader sought to step up the pressure on UNK conservatives at a UNK rally
if john major and kenneth clarke think that they can ignore the anger and the distress of millions of pensioners they're making an enormous mistake
and one of the six tory mps who signed a critical commons motion today on v a t on fuel came to the rally to deliver this warning to the government
that i no longer believe that the government has a majority for this measure
aware of the risks of losing this argument a confidential briefing document from central office was today sent to tory mps with advice on how to answer the crunch question haven't you broken all your promises
not at all say the government and anyway UNK at hand
oh i accept there is obviously concern and i will try and meet that when i introduce a package of measures at the end of november in the normal UNK statement to help those on lowest incomes who are affected by this
there's no doubt there's widespread concern among conservative mps about the UNK of v a t on heating and fuel and UNK like this will only serve to UNK it
but equally there's no evidence that the number of would be UNK is increasing and that would seem to suggest that unpopular though this measure might be there's little prospect of the government being defeated on it

an increase in high street sales has given some unexpected good news on the strength of the economy
sales rose by a half of one percent last month that was double UNK increase and more than experts had predicted
the city welcomed the figures and the one hundred share index rose by twenty seven points
despite other signs of weakness in the economy today's official sales figures suggest activity in the shops remains UNK
september saw strong increases in sales of clothing UNK and household goods
retailers at the UNK shopping centre in UNK in essex are seeing their best business for many months
we've been UNK over a quarter of a million customers a week and an indicative of this is that recently in the last week we've just opened an additional three thousand car parking spaces to take our grand total up to twelve thousand spaces
so we're having a very successful year i'm pleased to say
but while retailers are optimistic at the motor show in london this morning britain's car makers were still expressing concern about industries prospects
recession abroad has hit exports hard and though business at home has been improving slowly since the start of the year confidence remains weak
there doesn't seem to be a consistent upward pattern er traffic that comes into a dealers UNK to buy cars can be up one week it can be down the next
so there's no consistent upward trend but overall we have seen an UNK since the beginning of this year

the home secretary michael howard has announced measures to cut down on the amount of police paperwork and put more officers back onto the streets
he said the plans could free more than two thousand officers for front line duties in england and wales
for police forces struggling to cope with record levels of crime UNK people and UNK them up is only half the battle
at some police stations when a suspect is in custody his name may be written down on different pieces of paper on sixteen separate occasions
about half the tie the police spend investigating crime is taken up with form filling and bureaucracy
an officer dealing with a straightforward case of theft has to complete at least twenty documents as well as UNK tapes of interviews
it's the UNK of many UNK lives
i didn't join the er the police service to be a pen UNK or a paper or a form UNK
erm many of my officers erm indeed all of them are of the same mind
er the very fact that we're at our UNK er for more than seventy percent of our time filling these forms in er prevents us from moving on to the next prisoner and going out and UNK more people for crime
the consultants called in by the home office identify computers and information technology generally as the best way of saving time
civilians should also handle more of the paperwork
all of the recommendations have been accepted by a home secretary who's UNK his reputation on making an impact on crime
the UNK have put forward proposals which they believe could UNK the amount of police time spent on these administrative tasks and which could put the equivalent of up to two thousand three hundred police officers back on the streets
the consultants noted that substantial UNK could be made if the crown prosecution service which UNK cases going to court didn't need so much paperwork
for the police it's one of the fundamental issues
there's too much paperwork involved in getting fairly simple cases before the court er there is too much paperwork because of the demands the system makes of us
we need to address those demands with the other parts of the system and do it together
while welcoming the prospect of more officers on the front line against crime the police are concerned the proposals will have to be funded from existing budgets

in the united states the UNK general has said that unless the american television industry substantially reduces violent UNK over the next year the government may have to intervene
the warning follows a string of incidents including one in which a five years old child burned down the family home killing his sister after watching UNK characters playing with fire
it might seem UNK but a scene from a recently released UNK film about american football the programme UNK young players testing their UNK by lying in the middle of a busy road as the traffic drives by
after watching the film one eighteen year old in UNK was killed and a friend critically injured repeating the UNK
in long island new york another teenage boy was critically injured trying the same thing
the kids just don't seem to know the difference between UNK and what's real
in a recent UNK of a music television UNK called UNK and UNK the characters play with fire
one five year old in UNK who watched the UNK but who was also left alone with matches burned down the family home killing his two year old sister
the u s UNK general janet UNK warned of government action if american television does not reduce violent UNK
in only a half a century television bought violence has become a central theme to the life of our young people
as central as homework and UNK
we're selling soap through television we're selling cars through television and we're selling violence

caroline UNK says she was given no option but to have a UNK section when her daughter UNK was born eighteen months ago
UNK was facing the wrong way in the womb but her mother says she wasn't allowed even to try for a natural birth
she's expecting her second child in three weeks and is determined this time to have the baby at home
i wasn't presented with the full facts
i wasn't able to make a choice based upon being fully informed
erm and i feel that for no good reason i was forced to go through a major surgery
which took a long time to recover from
i still feel i've been deprived of a natural birth
the national UNK trust believes at most one in thirteen births needs to be a UNK but the present rate is one in eight
although in some hospitals it's as high as one in five
if you don't do a UNK when it's needed then of course you can end up with a baby that's damaged
but equally if you do a UNK that isn't needed you end up with a mother who feels UNK and isn't able to really relate to her baby as she wants to
UNK blame the rise on what they regard as an increasingly remote UNK approach to UNK
forty percent of consultants questioned said fear of being sued was a key factor
but for some women it's the preferred option
diana hambleton had an emergency UNK with her first baby her second UNK was booked in advance
being that i'd had one before and i was alright about it i feel fine
just a bit of stomach i feel like being kicked in the stomach by a like a horse but that's about it

mr wilson was shot be two UNK at his lancashire home last year
the jury failed to reach a UNK on a charge of UNK to murder
UNK david wilson was murdered in the garage of his home at UNK in lancashire
police described it as a UNK style execution
mr wilson a forty seven year old accountant was shot through the head twice after his family had been tied up and held UNK
what emerged in the crown court trial at carlisle held under extraordinary security was the story of a twenty six million pound international fraud involving the sale of non UNK cigarettes to various buyers
the plan then was to UNK the ship supposedly carrying the cigarettes thus destroying any evidence and collecting on the insurance
the court heard that the man behind the fraud was an american going by the name of UNK
he's currently in new york facing UNK moves
when david wilson realized what was going on he began talking to scotland yard

UNK harvey was raped on her way back from midnight mass in UNK last christmas
the former magistrate chose to go public
she says the women in the UNK case should have been named as should all alleged rape victims when their case comes to court

and since nineteen eighty eight it's been permitted to name the alleged UNK
angus dougal is appealing against his three year sentence for attempted rape
his solicitor duncan UNK believes the UNK should remain anonymous but the accused should only be named if found guilty
there is a risk of a UNK being left er on the name of er a c er of a defendant of a rape case even when he is UNK
there is a strong argument er for us to revert back to the previous legal state of affairs in which the UNK was preserved both of the UNK and of the defendant
it's widely agreed that UNK has made women more willing to report UNK
many lawyers and women's rights UNK say it must stay
for it to be known that a woman is a victim of a rape attack would really UNK her
it can put pressure on her family on her children er put pressure on her at work in her job situation and she could be under a lot of harassment
for austin UNK yesterday's UNK should end the matter
but his case has raised new questions in the continuing debate about how the courts and the media should deal with rape

some german women are up in arms no thank you they say to going back to the role of mothers and home builders
these women in UNK think that could happen if an arch conservative takes over as UNK head of state
that man is UNK he's a little known politician from eastern germany

UNK fans arriving at park head UNK this evening are hoping for a european victory over their UNK guests in the manner of past UNK
UNK defeat of inter UNK in nineteen sixty seven brought the european cup to britain for the first time
their success attracted a worldwide following as the UNK and their UNK dominated scottish football for more than a decade

third nineteen eighty nine this is margaret with jo ellen in the home of UNK glasgow
well when margaret suggested er doing a project on french UNK i had to admit that i didn't really know what french UNK was
er
mhm
could you tell me er
well french UNK is what they term the original UNK of furniture
you know that was now that is a UNK table now that table is in it's been stripped
now the first er process after that it's all UNK down and then there's a sort of UNK mixture UNK mixture is all rubbed into that and you've to wait till it UNK
then that's rubbed up that's to fill in the grain of the wood
that helps it you don't need so much polish if they use that they fill that in
then after that it's all UNK down and it's stained after that it's stained
and then it's UNK down you'd use a terrific amount of UNK
it's all UNK down again then you put your first coat now you use what you call a rubber which is consists of a piece of cotton wool you know you know cotton wool
mm
that you use like the chemist
yes
and a cotton rag over the top of that
and you have er french polish which is UNK
mhm
and UNK spirits
it's UNK with UNK spirits
and it's raw UNK oil you dip your you have it in a dish and you dip this pad into the into this dish and you put a little drop of raw UNK oil on that and you work it in and you go round and round in circles and you know i mean and that's left
you maybe turn this table upside down and then you work on the legs
mhm
the same procedure
and you coat that
then you leave it and then it's UNK down again and er the same procedure only you use thinner polish you know you dilute it you make your polish thinner
and you dilute it with more UNK spirits
but you've got to be very careful because if you use too much UNK spirits it cuts and takes the polish off
so and you have to don't use too much oil and you use the oil on it you know and then when you get what we call a good body on it that's when all the UNK is filled up
and then it's UNK down again
then you do what you call colour it
now you've seen different see that see that light part of the wood
mm
there
well you mix up er you mix up some colours black and er and black and wh i stuff UNK brown which mix them together and you make a colour to match up the rest and maybe bring in UNK and make a pat you know what i mean
mm
see that would have to be all UNK down that see that light bit of the wood that's got to be all UNK down and brought up the colours is all sort of you see matching and that
you know sort of match that's french polished
mhm
you can see that's got a there
mm
it's just UNK he could get a job see that
so however and then you start you've got to start and use very little polish and very little UNK spirits and what we call to work out the all that oil has to be lifted out and it's you UNK it's you work in circles and work in circles cos that fills in the UNK and then near when you're on maybe UNK the last th takes about three or four coats you know working on it all depends just how long it takes to get it filled up
and after your colouring after your colouring you UNK it very f very fine UNK
and er you get out give it another coat with a UNK and then you work straight across straight across and you just gradually add maybe just a wee drop of UNK spirits till you get all that oil and you see it UNK
you know the oil gets lifted out
you know and then you leave it it's what they term soft and it's got to be left to sort of UNK you know and then some instances some people prefer a dull polish they don't like a very bright and they'll say what they call UNK stone and they put that UNK that on and it's got to be done a certain way with a brush so to not to leave any marks
you know to brush it and it leaves a very dull surface
you see lots of er antique dealers and you know people that you know there's different classes of people that like well what they term the dull polish
and others like a really brilliant polish you know they like to see their things shining like a UNK bit
but er there's quite a lot of it's hard work
you know it really is it's hard work
but er when just before i left the UNK which was in nineteen thirty eight er they were bringing in a lot of UNK it's all th a lot of all this modern stuff is what they call UNK but i couldn't tell you how it's done it's done with a spray

us the boss used to say i like the UNK they can just blow their breath spirits
so it wasn't well UNK
mm
no you couldn't i mean er at you know the doors wouldn't be open be i mean you know you could picture a wardrobe without a door but you were working you were UNK that on the inside and er maybe UNK it up and down and then UNK that again and then they had to go over with what we call the rubber
you know to leave a soft er finish you know
and to m make it smooth on the inside
cos they're like UNK some of those yes
yes
aye
the old ones are
it really is good quality furniture hand finished
oh aye
mhm
mm
what sort of folk bought the furniture
well er we did er furniture for quite a lot of the well known UNK
and that in street that w they had worked in now i forget the name of the big firm but they'd come out of one of the big er furniture UNK and they started up on their own
and er that was the first time i'd ever seen a continental UNK
and they had got this contract for this er this lawyer who there was a great big er case it had run for long enough
something to do with som something to do with a cotton mill in UNK and it was s w i c just cannae recall what it was but it was a great big trial there was a and er this lawyer he had done quite well out of this case but it was a quite that must have been in er about nineteen twenty nineteen thirties about nineteen thirty two
but this was this big case was on you know and it went on a big UNK it went on for quite a while
and the he had er these two men had started up then they started up and i they're still there to you know what i mean i don't know if there's the same men are there but 's still up in street
and they started that and they were sent out to this big villa and er that was the first time i had seen a continental UNK and er we couldn't understand what it was you know
great big when they you know when they brought it in you know a great big thing you know and we said what's this about
do you know
and er then of course the bed was put in it and then there was you know things as the s pillars at the side
and er we'd done quite a l we'd he'd UNK his who th you know they got the contract to UNK the whole house and it was beautiful you know
very modern then
and er very up date
but it was that's what it that's where er you know there was he had been quite successful in this UNK you know he'd made quite a bit of money
so that was the start of and lots of different and then we used to get er maybe a wee special jobs in for UNK
i we did quite a lot of these er these wee UNK boxes
antique UNK boxes
and we would polish them so far then kick them up and down the shop you know to make them
yeah
UNK and you know
you know
they were rubbed with UNK at the edges and to you know just and then polished up and just to make them look er antique
even then they were doing that
even aha
that was that was then that wa er i mean people knew that they weren't UNK but they were UNK you know but they were well made
and then er that's one of t the boss made that cabinet there er it's got the feet er but and these are what they call UNK these UNK of glass are all in er individually you know they're all put in and to polish these wee UNK oh you had to be very UNK cos they're very thin you know and you had to UNK them and polish and they lay them in the thing and then they were fitted in and then the glass was the doors were sent to the UNK certain amount of polish on them and then the doors were sent to the UNK and then they were finished after that you know
but er
yeah
and then there was another man a way up street and he'd made the UNK the UNK and balls
see you can see the UNK and balls
they were hand UNK you know
beautiful
mm
but
how long did it take to make erm pieces or like this tale how long would it take to do
well to polish it or to make it
oh to polish it to finish it off
to polish it
well i would say i mean you would be working on that and then be working on something else
something else
and you would go back to that and you would maybe have um you maybe had you'd maybe have a chest of UNK and the UNK were out and you would be UNK you know doing so much on them put them aside and then go back to that
it would take about er it would take about three days like to really give it and then it would have to lie for a wee while to UNK you know the polish to UNK
but erm french polish is easier than the UNK polish
mhm
because er i mean you put anything hot down on that and e the tip is if you put anything down hot you take a rag and a UNK with some raw UNK oil and you heat the rag and you rub it gently and it brings sometimes you know the white marks
mhm
and sometimes UNK just UNK you know
mhm
just UNK er rubbed into it can you know help to lift because there's something in the UNK
but it needs the heat to lift the white p you've seen the white polish
mhm
UNK marks on it
well now you know
but er
there's quite a lot there used to be quite a UNK worked in ships and of course it's all UNK work and just UNK now
you know
oh some beautiful work
you know but er they're really a lot of hard working women you know and er
was it mostly women
nearly all women
now there's men french UNK too
there's men
half and half or er more one than the other
there's more there was more er women french UNK but there was a quite a there was quite a few men
and then there was different er types of UNK
there was oak and that didn't have as much work as UNK and then there was er what they call the i don't know whether you'll ever have remembered seeing it but there was a fashion for a while just bef in the thirties what they called UNK oak
they're beginning to bring it back in again
that's you open the you know you put a layer of polish on so much and UNK it down
then you put this lime wash and l white like UNK
and you rubbed it into the grain and you UNK that and it left white
mm
have you seen it
i've seen it
mhm
i didn't know what it was called
that's aha
but er UNK er that's what it was called
er you know the you used a wire brush to open the UNK to rub this into it
but th i was reading somewhere that they're bringing it back in again
lime wash you know
and er then there was er oak and then there was different kinds of woods that you used to could you know s er UNK make them look like maybe er UNK
that's UNK there
that was a wee er that er made that
on the south side
that's a record cabinet
mm
but er it was made to my UNK specification like you know just for keeping UNK er gramophone records in you know
but er this is it
would they have been old fashioned records the seventy UNK
aye there's er there's one of UNK records in there
i've got UNK
my uncle UNK was he came away from america
he was in america when the world war broke out
mm
first world war broke out and er he brought the UNK were just being introduced
i mean america had them you know really and he brought one that er i think one or two UNK records
the great big old fashioned record there
brought quite a lot of and he brought the gramophone with him you know
and he come over to fight for his country
but er och aye
but th to go back to the UNK it really was it was you know really hard work and but there was a great band of i mean the used to different firms that would h have a lot of work on one place and then they would move and then some would go to the UNK
and there was a lot of work at that particular time in the UNK
you know for UNK you know when the boat was
yes
and the though some were would actually go on the boats when after they were launched and finish the UNK you know
but i never ever worked on a boat you know
but er just er just different er then during the war i did the some of the er work for the cooperative you know like fire damage or water damage and that you know
but er i never worked very much after a after i got married
i used to do just occasional jobs you know
and at that particular time there used to be er what do you call it the fashion was UNK
oh yes
and that was one of the first jobs i practically did on my own
UNK asked me and everybody was wanted their er these er UNK
you know
mhm
the UNK
it was a wooden and pillars you know this was all down here and this UNK to be french polished
that was j that was the ne about thirty six thirty seven everybody was wanting their french polished you know
and then pull out tables was in UNK then
and er they were quite tricky to work with too
and er chairs there was some factories did nothing else but chairs
you know that er french UNK there was er factories away out at that just er that did nothing else but take chair work you know
mhm
and erm my used to tell me about er when they were serving their time all the apprentices used to UNK their work on a monday afternoon to go to the UNK and at that particular time they had turns on and if they didn't like them they UNK them with UNK and oranges and they had a big hook for pulling them off the stage
where was this
you know where the is
well there's a building just along there it's into er shops now but there was a well it was er no aye
he had this erm he was really a you know he was really a character one of the glasgow characters
and he had this theatre the UNK and er
the apprentices er and the polish the you know the cabinet makers you know young boys
and the f the younger apprentices used to UNK on a monday afternoon and all go along to street to the this and she says you didn't need to buy UNK it was the rails of the gallery were sticking with UNK
was really UNK
and she says they you know what i mean they had a great they really had a good laugh
would they lose an UNK pay
aha
they weren't paid
they would
no
the this was just at a just a custom you know
mhm
mhm
this is a just a custom you know and they just all UNK er their work and they had a right what we call a good tear
now the cabinet makers were serving their time an apprenticeship you say
aha
was that a five year apprenticeship
yes
be a five year then
and
and what about the french UNK did you call that an apprenticeship too
well while you had an apprenticeship you had about four years
before you were fully UNK
had four years
aha
mm
had four year and then you went to a you'd a sort of four year er
and after that you could you really were in control of anything
well you were supposed to be able to you know be able to take command you know
but into your fifth year and you were supposed to be really you know fully UNK but i mean you UNK about four years to serve
you know but er oh there was a happy UNK you know it was good
there was good company
we had er we were all quite good friends and quite good company you know
but er we enjoyed it and as i say it was just like a family
yes
so just like a family would you do anything special say one of the girls got married or something like that
er well there was none of them got married during the time that i was there
i mean that er shortly after it UNK was married at er aye just a just before the war er broke out UNK was married and cathy got married during the war and i got ma er no the three of us got married just round about the same time you know
but as i say the boss had er lost his business by then you know
but erm well you know what i mean th it was it was quite er it was really quite a sort of family atmosphere
mm
i mean mrs 's son was a cabinet maker and the UNK son was there and then there was another paul
he was a cabinet maker and er then the boss and we just all sort of worked you know sometimes we had a quite a lot of work going and other times we wouldn't have anything and other times you were standing waiting doing nothing waiting in the job g coming for the cabinet makers who would send through legs something to get started just as long as we got started to work maybe it was in a hurry
we just started on different things you know
but er and other times we were just we were working to you know quite late you know if the there was a special job that had to be out you know
but we did quite a lot of work for e g in er street
they were quite a well known er furniture very select furniture dealer you know
different shops
nice stuff and we did a lot of UNK
you know
like writing UNK
UNK writing UNK and er well th apprentices i was b started on the what they call the pigeon holes
they're they you they're all worked you know UNK and polished that's rough what they call rough work and then you gradually go onto the maybe UNK and the just quite a lot of oak and there's quite a lot of UNK and UNK
and there's then he used to make great big er display cabinets with a cabinet with a full UNK door in the centre and two doors similar what your granny had you know and er two w like er glass display cabinets in either side
and sometimes a bureau fitted on you know
whatever was the order
but er then there was others sort of cheap joints you know they just rushed things up and just a couple of just er when you see some of th you know that UNK shop that the thing when you when you see a lot of the things that's supposed to be polished you know they're just UNK over
they're not polished
you know
aye they're not really polished
but however i suppose it but it takes it's like everything else but it's a dead it really is a trade er graham was saying to m to me when i was down in london he says it's a pity mum that you couldn't get work you know i mean you just didn't have the you know your age and that to start work down here he says there'd be plenty of work for you
you know
yes mhm
plenty skill
same with sign writers and all these sort of trades they're all you know they're you know they're lacking a lot in the these things
he says there's stacks of work he says down i in london for people like that you know that's
that are skilled
that're skilled you know
yes you don't here of many french UNK now
no
mhm
no
do you know any
er no i cannae say that er there is one i think there used to be a lad up the road there i used to speak to his mother and she said he son was a french UNK
and my UNK husband down the UNK he was a first class french UNK
but he died a good about erm eight or nine years ago
and i have some of his UNK
he sent brought his UNK up to me
but they're still waiting on me UNK this
mm
table here
so some of these graham stripped it down but some of these days i'll take a daft notion and er
three days
for three days
for three days
well what's easier starting from scratch with a new thing that a cabinet maker has made or re UNK work like doing something over that's had marks and stuff
oh i think er starting fr it's harder work starting well it's hard work anyway th i mean sometimes er a job that's been polished before it's UNK but i mean that's really all stripped down to you know what i mean it's a it's that's all stripped down to
ready for you know back to sort of it's original you know
but i see the likes of that wee there that wee UNK in that
yes
now do you know how you would fix that
no idea
you would take a wet rag and a file you know an ordinary file
heat your file and put your wet rag on that and put the file the hot file you know just
yes
touch it up and that the UNK and the heat rises the wood
oh right
that rises the wood that would dry that
kicks the UNK out
tha aha
just keep at it
or if it was too deep you could fill it with wax
mhm
and what they call
that's just something like you know the wax for er for s for UNK wax it's something like that
and just you heat it and drip it in
that's if the UNK was awful deep
and you just put a drop in there heated and leave it till it UNK and then UNK it down level
you know
that er that brings it up
but er tha this is how the different things
but er n see that's a water mark there
well that's been caused with a plant being put down in that now
that'll take more UNK there and a bit UNK with your you wou use wee tiny UNK
mhm
what they call colour UNK
you know to bring up the colour
and just bring you know just that sort of to raise that
so it's just like painting
it's a
mm
very UNK
yes
and your eyesight gets very UNK
yes i'm sure
aha
aye very UNK with it you know
but er the colouring is really anybody that's really good at the colouring you know what i mean they could do wonderful things you know you could make plain wood look like erm sort of UNK
mhm
you know they can make the designs with
yes
these wee pencil UNK that colouring in bring out different er sort of you know knots and you know they bring in the pencil
yes
marks and just er sort of make them UNK looking and you know just make them a s a standing point you know
what was your favourite thing to do
what was
er my favourite thing er well i couldn't tell you that
i was always because i started later i was always very sort of worried in case i wouldn't you know get the thing right
er i liked the colouring
mm
and i liked er the UNK you know the what they call building up a body
but i was always you know always awful tense at er there's a wee there's a wee UNK there sitting
you mean a live one
aye
never
that's
gosh
no it's you wouldn't see it
no
just er it might of been of course i had plants through there it might have been
mm
yes
mm
but there's no UNK there
in that
but it was just a wee just a tiny wee thing there
mm
and er UNK are is a rotten thing you know
mm
it's a rotten er and you can you know you've to fill all the wee tiny holes
UNK them all with these UNK things to kill them
but erm can be a rotten thing to work with
sometimes i they take the hole the out and renew it then when it the colouring i that's when your colouring a good UNK is really
mhm
it's like an it's very UNK you know
work hard you know if
mhm
anybody can UNK and bring up the colouring you know
but er the likes of that see that UNK band round there
yes
well you see you bring in your dark strokes
of course
mhm
you know you highlight these lights at you know
highlight them erm and the likes of these bring them out
you know
see that's these are these are UNK legs
they're not UNK
they're UNK
you get to UNK know all the woods then
quite a lot i have
yes
some aha
yes
but sad to say the UNK are getting more UNK there are good woods now you know that er this is it
this is another factor of er the wood you know
er there er i think anybody would be that's really handy with or that and keen on woodwork there's quite a lot of old furniture that er they could you know UNK
mhm
with the old type of wood in them you know
but erm it's a it's a game
yes
did you ever have commissions say for big houses
like UNK homes that kind of thing
er well that was about the biggest that we worked on and we maybe had er some things for churches
mm
er for to you know different er wee things and er aye sometimes er different er wee sort of wee tables for churches and
yes
wee things like that
but i couldn't sa i couldn't say that i ever worked on any of the big
no
big houses you know
but er i would i would have liked to have been able to done that you know
but we used to get sent out to after the stuff left out the shop we used to have to go maybe touch up anything
mm
that had got marked
mm
in a lot of the different houses you know
thing is that the furniture trade was really UNK then begin that was in the thir you know in the th er early thirties that was the
yes
really the turn of the circle
you know the furniture trade th the furniture
between the war
mm
trade was between the wars things was beginning to pick up
i mean you could get erm a bedroom suite for about twenty pounds then
and a dining room suite er would be about six pounds something like that
seven or eight pound
that's four chairs and a pull out table and a UNK
and then of course the there were some a lot of them mass produced then there was the mass UNK come in then
they were just sort of as i said they used this UNK
mhm
and the chairs were UNK and which made them which made things a lot cheaper
you know that people were able to afford this like everything else er mass produced i mean at er that the public get the benefit
mhm
you know things become cheaper
but erm UNK and different furniture and that you know
but this is it
that's life
it's a full circle
but now they're UNK for UNK now
this is
mhm
the this is the tragedy of it
but erm this you know
the just wo you would like to see a return but i mean it's still it would be expensive
yes
mhm
you know to go back to the way that with the you know what i mean the trade
as i say well you've to spend a lot of time
it's like everything else that's done by hand it's aha
that's it time is money
time and money you know
why is it called french UNK
i don't know how it came to be whether it was the french that really in invented it
i suppose there must have been something associated er you know the french would UNK they were really first in the field with all these sort of
mm
i mean if you listen to the UNK
yes
mhm
the antique show you can se they can tell you know even by the polish
mhm
and er you know the different er things they can tell you just how l old a thing th and then i think they were the sort of the fashion er you know they were first in the fashion trade to introduce these sort of things you know
but it must have been something connected to the french when the they said it was french UNK
mhm
but i never ever though very much about it you know it was just it was just a term
now this is it
now you know all about it
mm
mhm
it's great
mm
thank you
yes
the british housing market
first new UNK price cuts and free c UNK all attempts to boost circulation
but who's going to win the newspaper war
six o'clock this morning at a west london UNK they're UNK the UNK independent on sunday
it's the latest UNK in a fierce fleet street circulation war
which is costing newspapers tens of millions of pounds in investment
with extra section and money back guarantee the UNK also gone up in price becoming the most expensive weekend paper
this sunday first of all the sunday newspaper will get quite a lot of colour into its pages and will be expanded and secondly the daily paper starting next tuesday will become a two section newspaper with about twenty wee twenty pages a week extra
while the UNK raising prices UNK cutting them at the sun and the times
UNK market competition
this is the most competitive choice UNK industry
er newspaper industry in the world
there isn't another country where you get eleven daily newspapers published by seven or eight different UNK every single morning
today also saw the launch of the mail on UNK new up market tabloid review
and next saturday the daily UNK going to have one too
we are going to see a supplement war and only the strongest and the most confident and the best produced will really come out of these in a in a good way
these fashionable tabloid UNK are one of the key weapons in this circulation war
and whether it's new sections price cutting more sports pages or simply giving away compact UNK everybody's at it offering their readers better and better value for money
the problem is the UNK become so fierce it's pushing up UNK costs at an UNK rate
for some this burst of competitive expansion seems bound to end in tears
a major reason papers are fighting so UNK for readers is the decline in sales as families like the buy fewer papers
hello
hi
how is it going
fine thanks
it's been most UNK in the sunday market
but since nineteen eighty seven daily paper sales are down by more than a tenth
changing working habits and increased competition for leisure time mean that many people feel they simply don't have the time any more
during the week i certainly buy fewer papers now than previously
perhaps it's got to do with the fact that i have er four children i really do not have the time to sit down and read papers in depth
i work a very long hours
er it means generally that i'm coming home quite late so as far as a daily UNK concerned i'm really not very much interested
but the most worrying trend for newspapers is the sharp decline in young readers
over the past twenty years the number who look at papers has fallen by more than a quarter
partly due to television
i read a paper about once a fortnight
and if i do read a paper it won't be for very long because all the stuff it's got in it i've seen it one telly or heard on the radio
in my family we always read the sunday papers
always
and the erm quality papers during the week
but i have been quite UNK to see that the youngsters today do not seem to have the same interest in reading the paper
they read the UNK but after that the reading seems to be fairly limited
now there's a new threat UNK the prospect of value added tax on newspapers in the budget
it's already causing UNK of UNK from the industry
it will be UNK whatever happens
if the industry UNK it will wipe out virtually all profits
if it doesn't absorb it will cut UNK into circulation figures in my view
because there's never been a time before when all newspapers have gone up UNK
we've had to cut prices of some of our newspapers in order to prevent a decline in circulation
er and i suspect some of our competitors may have to do so as well
that's a very odd moment for the government to load on up to seventeen and a half percent er there which would er threaten i think the existence of a number of newspapers particularly in the UNK but also possible at the national level and that would be a great shame
the UNK price was UNK by a third last month to boost UNK circulation
UNK say it's costing the murdoch empire millions when the times is already loss making
the UNK even reported news international for UNK pricing
the only way you can make sense of it is that it's design to get a competitor out of the market
and as we're the one small independent group which has no huge er group wrapped round us then we're clearly the most vulnerable
news international denies that's its aim
and although times sales are up about one hundred thousand in a month it doesn't seem to have had a big impact on the independent
the real target news international says is the highly profitable middle market
the mail and express are very different newspapers from the times but nevertheless the top fractions of their UNK are very high quality readers
and i think we've seen a good number of those erm from the telegraph the mail and the express going to the times
because the times price cut was so large no one's sure if its gains are due to the publicity or it's proved wrong the conventional wisdom about quality newspaper pricing
in a sense the UNK still out on the times cos you'd have to look at it over say a three of four month period
erm but i think it's we've looked at historical trends and you find that the quality newspapers the up market newspapers they're actually not particularly price sensitive
the mail and its sister sunday paper are UNK their appeal with up market news UNK
a huge investment for associated newspapers
it expects them to lose a UNK twenty million pounds in the first year
but associated newspapers UNK it's well worth it
i believe that you that you must never stand still in newspapers you have to keep committing you have to keep expanding and you UNK to go with trends and there is a trend for this kind of publication
not just in erm the world of advertising but in the UNK as well
we've seen it in the er erm UNK up market papers
erm i think the time is right for a big broad middle market paper to have such a publication
the UNK big rival the express is doing much the same
trying to attract the readers from the quality market while the UNK papers UNK at the middle ground
if you look at the sunday qualities they're very much erm UNK some of their content
we've seen the sunday times for example introducing UNK and more articles on the royal family
if you look at the mid markets erm for example the sunday express has recently run a erm a feature on the french UNK
which would have previously would have been the preserve only of papers like the independent or the times or the or the guardian
i think the er figures also suggest in a way that
for the struggling independent papers adding papers is aimed at securing the top of the market
UNK for cash and investment circulation of daily and sunday has UNK
the UNK is aimed to reverse that
UNK because we can display photographs much more effectively on UNK and of course we'll have colour
with the group only breaking even having UNK colour advertising is crucial
and the higher cover prices will boost annual revenue by four million pounds if sales hold up
helping pay for the new promotion
at premium prices the independent papers are opting firmly for the high ground
the new independent on sunday are you getting the full story
the long term trend is that it's actually going to be more room at the top of the market i think
and that's very good from our point of view
UNK prices when others are cutting is a bold high risk strategy
UNK what's at stake is whether the independent has to raise capital again and whether it could do so without someone else taking control
associated newspapers admit they might be interested
and other potential investors include carlton communications and the mirror
but sir david english says they'd want control and then only at the right price
you ask how interested we are we're interested
i suppose we would run the independent as a professional publication but it would be run at a loss for a very long time before you could turn it around
and we'd only be interested i with that scenario that you could virtually er get the independent at a song otherwise it wouldn't be worth having
the question that is raised about the independent is not whether it exists but who owns it
what the independent very badly needs is very solid professional newspaper management er to go along with the good franchise which it has created erm and a proper owner who can actually er do what all of us in newspapers have to do from times to times which is back a UNK newspaper
with so many papers UNK so much on these costly strategies to UNK in new readers will it all add up
newspapers make their money from combination of cover price revenue and what they bring in from selling advertising space
so it's the behaviour of both consumers and advertisers which will determine the winners and losers
advertisers love the new sections because they provide choice and make it easier to target advertising at specialist audiences
but with so many new sections being launched is there enough advertising to go round
although advertising is picking up after the recession most in the industry only expect fairly modest growth
i think what we're probably gonna see is a redistribution of the cake but not much growth in that cake
and i think we might see it in one of two ways
we might see advertisers that currently use black and white advertising space move more into colour to take on or make use of these er other sections these review sections
and we might see movement within the colour UNK of a newspaper
i e from the UNK into the review sections
at the end of the day is there going to be enough new advertising to go round
i think w we may well see some kind of shake out
whether it's gonna take two years or twelve months i don't know
equally important in deciding the outcome of the circulation war is how consumers like the 's react
something to do with water UNK
yeah
like everyone they appreciate better value for money but as the newspapers have got bigger and bigger they have found they have bought fewer
a number of years ago i would have bought two papers on a sunday the observer and the sunday times
but it was too much reading really couldn't get through it all
if you look at the industry as a whole there's obviously the problem that by producing so much more content that people are simply not going to have the time to get through it
so as a result there's a danger that many readers many regular readers might buy a newspaper less frequently
so move from buying it every d every UNK say to moving it f to buying it four days a week
everyone in the industry agrees that quality will be the key to success and of course they all say that means them
deep pockets are going to count as well
but there's no doubt this fierce circulation battle is going to claim casualties
for some that could mean heavy losses for others it may be more serious
workplace stress is sweeping across industry
it's costing the country more than seven billion pounds a year with millions of working days lost
are british firms reacting too slowly to a problem that could one day land them in court
i didn't realize at the time when i was getting headaches UNK
you know real bad headaches
and er terrible UNK
well UNK it was terrible pains down my chest just as though you'd UNK glass and every now and again it would sort of stab at you
and er i wasn't eating right because i just didn't feel hungry i didn't bother about food i just seemed to keep going and keep going
keep taking the UNK and the blooming UNK
and then er i just completely broke down one night i just couldn't take any more pressure
farm work means long hours and low pay but it's a great improvement on last year for david smith
then he was ploughing a very different UNK
working in a UNK factory
he'd moved up from shop floor worker to production manager but the firm hit hard times an the UNK were called in
david found himself caught between the demands of the UNK on the one hand and his old boss who stayed on as a consultant
i was trying to keep the workforce happy and keep every body in a job
trying to keep our old boss happy and trying to keep the UNK happy but it just doesn't work like that you can't keep everybody happy
david's life is now in balance with time to follow to the country UNK like shooting he loves
for him the low point came with a telephone call from the factory
telling of yet more problems
he broke down on the bed at home and UNK
he left the firm soon after one of thousands of victims of occupational stress
did you ever think of UNK the firm for the stress problems that you'd been caused
no i never thought about UNK the no i never thought i didn't realize you could anyway
no i didn't know you could
i wasn't advised or nobody mentioned it
that may soon change
lawyer mark UNK some of our biggest insurance companies on workplace UNK he believes workers could soon be able to sue for stress damage costing british firms and their UNK millions
thirty years ago employers didn't take seriously the risk of being sued for UNK
ten years ago they didn't take seriously the risk of being sued for passive smoking
it cost them a fortune in both cases
if they ignore the risk of workplace stress claims it may cost them another fortune
delegates from some of the biggest companies in the land gather at a UNK of british industry conference on health at work
workplace stress is on the increase and ironically it's now being widely recognized that companies own efforts to cut staff and become UNK and fitter must take part of the blame
at the end of the day we are asking so much more of our employees nowadays than we've ever done before
we ask them to be multi skilled we ask them to use new technology we ask them to be obsessed as they should be with quality add customer service
those trends can cause stress if they're not properly managed
every year in britain ninety million working days are lost as a result off undue stress in the workplace
that's thirty times more than through strikes
most british firms even if they recognize the problem don't do anything about it
but in the wake of legal UNK from america the prospect of workers UNK their employers for stress related illnesses could soon be a real one
in that case big firms and their UNK would have to sit up and take notice or pay the consequences
the UNK line at scottish and UNK brewery in manchester
it's one of the sites where professor UNK cooper a world authority on stress carried out britain's biggest ever company wide stress study
he believes it's important to distinguish between stress and pressure
stress is not pressure
pressure is UNK it gets you moving and achieving things but when pressure UNK you ability to cope then you're in the stress arena
and that means that you're doing UNK things
either it's causing ill health or it's affecting your relationships
stress at work is costing industry UNK
official estimates include the value of lost production through UNK when stress makes people ill
and the cost of sickness benefits
but there are other factors
i think the bottom line cost for u k p l c er the health and safety UNK executive estimates this to be seven and a half billion pounds a year
i think that's an under representation of it
because what we don't have is people turning up to work because they're afraid they'll lose their job during these UNK times
they turn up to work but are so stressed out they can't perform there's no added value to the product
the cost in my view is probably in the order of ten percent of gross national product
your workload what about it
it's too much
i can't cope
a training video made for UNK the UNK group recently UNK from i c i
with stress management courses like this it's one of the few big companies trying to tackle the problem
can't cope eh
never mind we'll find something for you
of course it will mean a drop in salary but you needn't worry about the extra stress that goes with promotion because there won't be any promotion for you ever again
the UNK to teach managers to spot the symptoms of stress early
and know how to deal with them
the courses have cost UNK a hundred thousand pounds so far but the company believes to ignore the problem particularly at executive level would be UNK still
there is the obvious cost if people are away ill
we know that er stress er does cause UNK of other illnesses and er people can be away for that sort of reason
but on top of that if people are under undue stress they make mistakes
and making mistakes in important contracts if they involve w hundreds of millions of business can be very expensive indeed

here they believe the problem has to be tackled at the lower levels of the organization
