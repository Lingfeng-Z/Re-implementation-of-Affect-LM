this whole idea of a subsistence economy is something i'm not really i'm not really sure about it because erm what would exactly you're saying that if everybody was the same then erm then you're somehow necessarily going to be producing at a subsistence level so erm so er and so it's so if you can only extract surplus by effectively taking it off something given to others
yes
so you're virtually UNK some people to operate below subsistence
yes
in order to allow other people to extract a surplus which you then give
yes
yes
right
so why can't you just erm why can't they just take a bit off everybody in that case and UNK the same degree
cos you're UNK you're UNK or people at the very bottom of the scale you're forced to operate below a level of subsistence because inequalities
yes
so why don't you just run a middle peasant economy but take what you need from everybody else
but surely state intervention should have been the best way of achieving both goals
but how could the s
by taxing people
how would the state have the means to intervene
just go give us your taxes build a few factories
where are they gonna get these how can they impose taxes unless there's some kind of a healthy economy
you know an economy that's
well i mean
UNK and is in such a state
there is no cos there's a surplus right
but there's
there will i mean
but would there
i mean is
yes but how great is this surplus
well look there's a UNK amount of resource in the economy
you've got some rich people you've got some poor people
yeah right
right
now there's gonna be a surplus no matter who you give it to no matter where i mean
why
why
that surplus probably has
because those people on subsistence level are surviving right and if they're surviving
yeah
it means that they're there and that if you take something away from the wealthy peasants and UNK
yeah
amongst your UNK whatever
but it is gonna be
but isn't there a different expenditure pattern between the rich and the poor
that
yeah but erm what i'm saying is you can tax them take that surplus cream it off create an equal society direct state intervention invest it in factories whatever
right
i don't think it'll really help i mean
no
but i if you went yes i mean er in a sense that th there are one possibility is to UNK the land and do that equally but if there was not enough land to bring everybody up to subsistence level er i mean some were the argument is there wasn't enough land to bring everybody up to a UNK subsistence level
or at best everybody could just come up to but nobody would be creating re er a surplus nobody would have the resources to invest to enable them to come above subsistence
yes
and if you then taxed you would you would pushing everybody down below
right
and tha that is no way then that is no way forward
what i'm
yeah
yeah but as far as i can see there either is a surplus or there isn't you know that it shouldn't depend on where you organize the a UNK
why not
if y the way if you
because any UNK any surplus you're UNK from rich peasants is an artificial one because it's only based on you know basically imposed suffering of poor peasants
you're not allowing
bu but the rich because they have more resources are more highly productive
so they have a higher income
yes
which you can then tax
and you will be able to y you your tax revenue will rise because you've got a group that is rich
and then but also with the poor peasants i mean you you've given them a enough land so that they still can't meet subsistence given them some land but not enough but you know because they're UNK and they've got other things that they don't need to have enough land to give subsistence they'd rather go and do something else and make it up
so that therefore in i mean it's like a form they just they just get by
yeah but i but i cos i can see the arguments but then i mean i'm just not i'm not entirely sure whether i it couldn't work that it couldn't work being a middle peasant economy and that these erm these inequalities would er sort of
y you could certainly extract a UNK er extract a surplus for the government
yeah
which the government would then have spent on the industrial sector so agriculture would not have moved forward
and no middle peasant would have then had the investment resources to improve his own
i e the agricultural sector would not be left with enough resources to improve
and
why do say that
i mean why er with this surplus they've gathered i mean what you're saying is that the rich peasant economy effectively are better investors
yes
they're more productive
yes
but that needn't be the case
i mean if the government is er taxing and pr UNK that money properly then it should be able to do the job of private investors
so surely the arguments UNK upon the fact that perhaps the government is likely to be inefficient UNK bureaucratic whatever
possibly but i if you say it is a i it's an honest government and er the tax collection is straightforward and honest the government is then deciding what it does with that tax revenue
i e you you're saying in effect that the government is taking all of the surplus from the from agriculture
yeah
what little surplus what little
yeah that's what i'm sa
surplus there is and then it UNK that surplus and given that the priority is industrialization most if not all of that surplus is going to go to the industrial sector
there will be no resources for the agricultural sector and agriculture probably will not be able to support the industrialization process
whereas if you go for a degree of inequality within the countryside a you will have you might get the same tax yield because you have a higher rate of tax on the rich and their UNK going up so that tax revenue will increase
mhm
and you've got a group the rich within the agricultural sector who are going to invest and they are more likely to invest in agriculture
you have the problem of how much to tax because on the one hand you're trying to promote this rich peasant economy and not erm tax them too heavily because you don't want to them to not invest with
yes
and then you also need to have a surplus so that you can erm pay for industrialization and you can't tax the poor too much to fit into your ideology so at the end of the day you know well it's a matter of just balancing all these factors
exactly
exactly
to get a compromise
right
so the creation of a rich er along these lines of the creation of a rich peasant economy is a necessity as the communist party see it in terms of paving the way for industrialization
it is a better strategy to create resources for industrialization to go for a rich peasant economy than to go for a middle peasant economy
what i'm also saying is that in terms of
sort of the context of ideology that you know from a marxist perspective it is actually useful still to have rich and poor peasants because potentially you've got classes you've got class conflict and you've got a means of making further progress towards socialism
and the two come together
wh what you're also saying is right though that within that the danger is that inequalities get too great and you would also need a set of policies which would stop that inequality
so you're trying to promote it but you're trying to limit it
and what well how do you do that i mean if
right
that is totally inconsistent if you're trying to create class struggle
right
then you're not gonna stop it i mean if there's class struggle no one can stop it
yes
yes
that that's gonna be a problem
that political argument seems i mean you can't win in this game can you
if you've got inequalities and everything then you say ah yes it's all very good we need this the marxist class struggle i mean that just seems like a ridiculous argument to me
but w was it was it the size of china that made this necessary
you know the sort of UNK nature of most of it that meant they had to get on with it
i'm not sure size is the reason
i still don't see why you're saying the government couldn't use their erm policies UNK policies with erm and then actually take an active part in the economy
why couldn't they create improve the agricultural sector by
i'm not saying they could have done
right but they didn't
cos the various things you've been saying about the rich peasant economy i mean
because but you don't you well if you've got a rich peasant economy you don't need to because you're saying the rich peasant
yeah
can do it themselves
but it's highly i mean i don't it doesn't follow to me that in any way is UNK with marxist ideology because surely you want to get to your socialist state
right
mm
as quickly as possible
yes
so if you could create equality
this er government intervention policy UNK achieved your goal
erm right
and i don't see why
yes
they UNK invested in agriculture
sh
all this in the private sector would've
sure th that is your other option is that you go for a m a much more equal policy and the government takes money in taxation and puts it back into the agricultural sector
right
i think the reason they probably did this because it's it was politically harder to do that they would've had to taken a lot more responsibility
yeah th that was that was the that was my point about the size of the country and i think
oh right
yes
that so th that sort of policy would be very would've been difficult
you'd have to have a huge sort of bureaucratic structure
yes
to invest in
right
so sort of technically politically that would have been quite difficult to do because of the UNK involved etcetera
yeah
etcetera yes
whereas creating a rich peasant economy will work immediately cos that's what a significant number of people in the countryside will actually go along with and want
mm
because it is it is en it is encouraging people to become rich and basically people want to become rich
but it seems to me like it's passing the UNK a bit in the way they're just sort of taking responsibility
yes
yes
and saying well you know that if we if the sort of rich peasants were
mm
yeah
gonna be pretty safe it's gonna be pretty stable we don't have to get our f hands dirty erm you know
future cos if it doesn't work you can always
economic about UNK and there's a great deal of UNK in this because you know here you are in the nineteen fifties in china rich peasant economy which is accepting and preserving inequalities
yeah
and yet you go to UNK and there's some sort of land reform which ends up in a very equal distribution
well exactly
what's happening
a and erm and i think it is being conducted by the government which has just left china
yeah that's right
yes
right
this bu but isn't that only because of what they learnt from
oh absolutely yes
their experience of china
but if erm if they have learned that why you know why didn't the communists
perhaps they
so
which is always
are you saying that they actually deliberately were trying to
right
erm right
UNK would you like to carry on from
wherever you want see what you have
alright
what then were the economic effects of land reform and the preservation of the rich peasant economy and how successful was it in raising productivity
land reform had profound impact on the distribution of rural wealth and income and through this on both the motivation and UNK of the rural population to invest improve farming techniques and to increase production
the degree of the immediate impact of land reform however is a matter of debate
the UNK specific impact of land reform is extremely difficult to evaluate
land reform does not necessarily lead to an immediate rise in output neither does it increase a physical supply of land nor does it significantly alter the ratio of peasants for the amount of land available
furthermore the exact economic impact of land distribution is difficult to identify in test because output is the function of many other factors besides land distribution per se
the scope of the economic analysis of the immediate impact of the land reform period is further limited by lack of statistics
official economic data released prior to nineteen fifty two were confusing due to lack of UNK contents and coverage of data
according to one data especially on output for the immediate post land reform period were later corrected and adjusted by officials causing one to question its credibility
in addition statistical data from the pre land reform period is UNK
most UNK use UNK land survey data and statistics erm work by the for the nineteen thirties to draw UNK with official data which was collected for tax purposes from nineteen fifty two onwards but there's very little data from the period of land reform itself
in view of these factors my discussion can be confined to three inter related aspects of the economic impact of land reform
since the agrarian reform swept away the landlord tenant relationship it altered the claims to the output from land
these effects will be explored first
as a consequence of the abolition of the landlord tenant structure reform to the tax structure was necessary
the second aspect considered here will be how the c p structured their tax system as a means of both investment in industry and as an incentive to agricultural productivity
finally an assessment will be made as to the effect of redistribution of land reform to agricultural productivity
so what was the overall effect of rent transfer of agricultural output as a result of the abolition of rent landlords estimates that the UNK land was thirty three percent of the total land area in UNK in nineteen thirty and about thirteen percent of the total value of agricultural output was transferred amongst households as rent before land reform
land reform primarily meant the diversion of rent payments
in addition to the redistribution of the actual rent payments the abolition of landlords meant the abolition of other charges local taxes and UNK cha UNK rent deposits and interest payments to landlords
all of these further contributed to the post land reform potential o of the law set to maintain and increase its income or for the communist party to tax
i'll now consider how much the peasants actually benefited from these gains and how much they paid in tax after land reform
prior to land reform most agricultural taxes were UNK to the land itself assessment per unit of land being graduated according to the quality of land proportional to output
land taxes were paid to the
and provisional governments
tax UNK and tax was widespread
UNK that the actual sums collected by these agents were sometimes as much as ten times what the government received
she explains that there were generally two stages to changes in the tax system the tax system initiated by the communist party
there was expansion of the tax based UNK on production per household assessed on the basis of UNK annual y yield
this was the harvest that could be reasonably be expected in an average year
the levy was set by cadres based in
tax rates were applicable to the total household income derived from agricultural production divided by the number of members in the household who depended primarily on agricultural production
commercial income was tax exempt
during this first stage tax rates were UNK progressive from three percent on a hundred and fifty per capita per annum to forty two percent
the c p's aim was to gain peasant support for land reform and to emphasise class divisions
once land reform was under way the peasant support of the c p regime was more secure the c p implemented a second stage of its tax programme in the newly liberated areas
from nineteen fifty one to fifty two it re graduated the progressive tax rates raising the bottom rate from six percent in the same UNK of a hundred and fifty per capita per annum and UNK the top rate to twenty five percent
the main incentives to agricultural production embodied in the tax system
first production over and above the UNK family unit was free of tax
following from this there was thus an incentive for peasants to invest in large scale improvements without fear of tax on rises in productivity because the n a y was fixed for at least three years
further because the n a y was based on grain as a standard this encouraged a switch to cash UNK which were of a higher value relative to grain
the tax system extensively encouraged all peasant owners to settle down and get rich because the tax rate remained fixed on grain output from each household but the adjustment of the tax rate was more UNK to the rich peasant than the poor especially in view of the fact that the rich peasant still owned UNK more land than the poor peasant
according to it did not seem to make much difference to tax on income differentials rich peasants were still about two and a half times better off than poor peasants
it appeared however that the chinese communist party was rational in its tax policy taxation was crucial to the c p to control inflation and the supply of grain to the people's UNK army and the population as a whole
estimates that in nineteen fifty the tax UNK to nearly forty two percent of the national budget receipt which was clearly a significant contribution
turning to the economic impact of land reform on productivity
can i just can i just stop you there for a minute
to ju and just take taxation bit of it
do you understand what UNK is talking about
do you understand what the tax system is
no
no
right
actually you're okay it was extremely clear but it it's a i think it's a complicated issue
mm
is what you're saying that the tax was on a kind of expected yield that cadres would go into a village and they would say look erm that is the normal yield for that bit of land
on past experience that's roughly what the yield has been on an average year you would expect to get that
and we are going to base our taxes on that normal yield
if the yield is above that we're gonna keep the tax base the same so i if your yield goes up if you work harder if you're more productive you you're going to be much better off
we will not raise the taxes because your UNK gone up
so there's that there's that kind of incentive behind it and that normal yield is gonna operate for three years if there are improvements we're still gonna keep that the normal yield tax based exactly the same
so there are significant incentives to improve the land
so what happens after three years the er the yields are sort of therefore reviewed and the UNK
yes
how would they do that
so basically what you what you would be likely to do is rip o rip off the system completely for two years at a time
yes but then er you face the possibility that er because your if you like your normal yield has risen
yeah that's it
you will move into a different sort of tax bracket
it's a strange incentives aren't there
it's like in the first year the first year of the three year period you've got an incentive
yes
the second year you increase about as much but the third year you're gonna bring it right down use hardly anything at all
yeah but the point is
did they actually have to claim how much i mean er you know they produced cos all we're saying here is they're just taking a UNK amount which they UNK at the beginning of a three year period and they're just gonna take that
i mean they're not gonna have any information of how much you've produced over and above your tax
so how do they follow
but er but at the same time
i mean how do they go about UNK
ah
that's going to be a problem but that's three years off
and presumably
no but
by that time you've got the personnel and you've
oh i see
you've got much more information and you would
but er what information
i don't see
well presumably would go back in the village and if you asked other UNK look how much has x grown on that bit of land they will tell you
tax erm i can't remember where it was that i think it might have been one of you saying that how that a peasant of subsistence level erm would still have to pay eighteen percent of its income
right
in taxation but that still the peasant was even though this might seem like quite a bit the peasant was still in a better position than he had been previous because rents were at least thirty percent
yes
yes
so
it's a matter of ho i mean er greater equality was achieved but they could've erm i mean a hundred and fifty was a very low UNK
okay let's just work around that
what you're saying is that i mean broadly this is quite an incentive based system at least on the face of it
mm
er in that you are you you're sort of fixing your taxes and then you're allowing anybody who increases their output will keep will benefit from that
so basically it's an incentive system for to increase production
and it it's clear that production was higher than normal expectation so it seems to have had a positive effect in terms of
and you're also saying that there is some UNK going on because erm the tax rate erm and th the top tax rate at least to begin with is forty two percent the bottom tax rate is only three percent
so there's an UNK going on
but what you're then saying is that the taxes start at a very low UNK i e you start to pay tax at a hundred and fifty UNK per person
about eight hundred for subsistence
exactly
so you are taxing peasants at well below subsistence level
now either we have ei either you accept that and y you're saying n not only in terms of land reform is the communist party prepared to see poor peasants being allocated less than subsistence land but even when they are allocated land they're being taxed on their income even though it's well below subsistence
now ei either one sort of accepts that view
would that be because the communist party didn't want the rich peasant to think they'd be s they were being UNK out
that how that their policies were being applied to the whole society
would that be
erm
the justification for it
there's there was an element of that yes that
why should they be concerned about the rich peasants
because they're promoting the rich peasant economy in the short run
yeah but promoting the economy doesn't necessarily mean
it does if
we wanna keep them happy
you have to keep them happy in order to
i mean inconsistent with what we were saying about
what
the objective of politically going for a class struggle
yes sure
well they're not gonna have any incentive to invest unless they know their interests are gonna be protected
you know
invest in what
sorry
in industry
yeah
or whatever
i in increasing the surplus agricultural surplus
but if that beginning you know i if you're going to go for a rich peasant economy you've gotta convince them that it's their advantage and it's gonna last
there's a sort of i mean it is a very favourable tax system in relation to the rich
okay there might be in all sorts of ways in terms of equality in terms of socialism it's all a bit dubious erm but the other reason for taxing down is that let's face it the majority of peasants as we as we saw last week are still poor and if the communist party is wanting to UNK its revenue if it was gonna say okay we're not gonna tax anybody at under six or eight hundred erm you you're gonna take out er half the population and you would have to get that income by taxing the rich even harder and that would be a UNK
reasonable system wouldn't it
but it would have been a UNK on the rich
erm what proportion of the population was living at subsistence level roughly
cos as an idea
erm well er the figures we looked at well i it this is the problem it depends how you define your subsistence level
now
it varies from village to village doesn't it
it's gonna vary from village but it's to an extent although the amount of grain you needed the amount
yeah
of grain erm
but if we say it's around eight hundred
now yes i mean i in terms of two thousand UNK a day it s it seems to be six hundred and fifty seven hundred UNK er seven hundred right now th there are those who argue the hundred and fifty is UNK level
i e it it's about a quarter so you you're on five six hundred UNK a day
so they wouldn't be able to pay the tax would th they wouldn't
well i it implies that the communist party is actually taxing p taxing poor peasants at three percent of their income even though they are at UNK level
but would they wouldn't they just in practice UNK it
no
erm i there were provisions that where er more than ten percent of the population for any area was at the level you would be able to tax at a higher rate
why
what
your revenue i guess that you need the revenue
were there were there people starving
well i ca what i can't quite understand is that why anybody should have come through land reform and still only have that level of income
erm it may be that the people who were right down at the bottom like that were people who were doing other things as well and were say blacksmiths or whatever
mm
a and that i think would not be taken into account so we're just looking at agricultural income
oh i see yeah
and these people were not depending on agriculture alone
if they are people depending on agriculture along i it seems an UNK harsh
well they'd be forced out wouldn't they
they would be forced out
yes
and work in the factories of the rich peasants
the factories of the i think
well you know what i mean workshops or whatever
yes
yes
erm but it might mean that in fact we do need to UNK what we mean by subsistence income
i e bare subsistence might have been three hundred four hundred
now if one is arguing that then the number of peasants who are really below a very basic subsistence level as a result of land reform is much lower
mm
i mean if your cut off point is six or eight hundred say six or eight hundred yo you're gonna you know you're into a very large section of the population if you will come to four hundred and fifty you are into a much smaller proportion
but you you're right that if we stick to somewhere between six hundred and seven hundred as a erm even a basic kind of subsistence i e you've just got enough in just you you're just not using enough food to get yourself up to two hundred two thousand UNK a day at that rate you were still being taxed on a at a rate of almost twenty percent of your of your income
which meant that net of tax you would y your yield would have to be about eight hundred in order to net of tax give you just under seven hundred
how could they before pay rents then
because that was even more
right
yes
just don't you can't UNK it
so had they put too high a sort of level for subsistence
i mean what did peasants expect to live on what were their expectations
that's what really matters
i mean this is i er there is a fundamental problem here i think th that i if you do the calculations in terms of how many UNK per amount of grain it does seem that for what we regard as being an adequate diet and then again it's a diet which is not being UNK by meat okay there will be some vegetables but basically it's grain you do need somewhere between six and seven hundred
and it is clear that there were that a very significant proportion were not reaching that level and it's being taxed
but they are still surviving and they were surviving and still paying rent on land before nineteen forty nine
but were they
because quite a lot of the peasants didn't
right
wa wasn't it when we were studying about landlord tenant relationships
yeah
that how that erm landlords in practice had to reduce the level of taxation
yes
have loans and stuff so it just
right
yes
UNK
yes
payments
th there's all of that and there is obviously the option to borrow and there is the opportunity to work as hired labour or UNK etcetera
but the assumption must have been that before nineteen forty nine there was a lot of that going on
mhm
more than seemed to be indicated in the figures that we've got because UNK figures for the extent of supplementary income are i know they're significant but they're not enough to the kinds of levels people had been living at
but i think there is a conflict between what we would regard as being a an acceptable subsistence level and what it would appear that the peasants could possibly have been achieving
i mean it's difficult to bring those two close enough
it's hard to i think there is this erm UNK i would imagine a very hard
yes
that may not have involved been involved in a cash economy
yes
yes
yes
yes
right
but i think we do have to recognize that not only are we looking at a land reform process which is providing a lot of peasants with what
subsistence land and the communist party was taxing them they were on that below subsistence income
now that would not be what one would expect er two months ago if i'd said well look you know that's what the UNK gonna bring about you would've said i don't believe you
the only way you can justify it is by saying it's a means to an end
but it you could equally say that well
yes
but at the same time the party could argue that it was attempting to UNK things or at least limit inequalities in the sense that the tax rates were
what i what is really extraordinary i think is the way as you say that in nineteen fifty one fifty one fifty two they actually changed the tax schedules so it goes not from the three percent of the bottom from six or seven percent of the bottom and only up to twenty five percent
but it could also mean that erm they were UNK that it they had been successful in getting taxation from what they'd done since the beginning of cos they felt they could go even further
yes
it could apply to their original taxation policy
yes
but it's a it's a major UNK to the rich
a at precisely the point where one would expect them to be in the position to be able to UNK on the rich they are actually this is this is the promotion of the rich peasant economy
mm
could that stem from a problem like sort of marxism is really a theory developed from the g an UNK country
mm
and you've your idea from that but then china is a completely backward country
oh i see
but it's not only it's not only
there's room for it in marxist theory isn't there
yeah there is
what about UNK methods of production and all that sort of thing
yes
i think they were originally for it i just think there's it is just so backward
mm
that there haven't been any forces of change for a thousand years
i mean perhaps the forces of change that were normal were not UNK in the chinese
yes
so that they really had to be brought out
yes
or created even
yes
absolutely
yes i mean th the fact that you've got a whole range of problems an and you were bound to come up against those problems if you try and define marxist in a strict sense and therefore you were always seeking to sort of make
can we just come back to
mm
can you just go on with your productivity bit
okay
what i'll do is i'll just quickly UNK
yes
through the stuff
erm that UNK regarding productivity from economic impact of land reform official statistics claimed that between nineteen forty nine to fifty four gross output value of agriculture increased by fifty eight percent
erm those are the only sort of figures we have and but nineteen forty nine seemed to be a bad base state because it was about half so that meant that it UNK
erm that had er most economic UNK agree that between nineteen fifty two nineteen fifty two there was a healthy recovery and then a UNK off and that erm another consequence of land reform was to decrease the output UNK by peasants and this was because as we mentioned earlier the peasants have a high UNK to consume and lower marketing land was rich peasants erm and that one says that there was a new air reported then in the countryside UNK wave of productive enthusiasm initiative and UNK but there was also evidence of instability and uncertainty which UNK erm the advance of erm UNK improving productivity and investment
erm and that how that but through land reform it meant that how that you had erm credit difficulties and that how that landlords who UNK previously provided the credit were no longer there and so that meant that how that erm that UNK problems of increasing productivity and also there was a severe shortage of farm UNK and animals cos they weren't UNK there was only the surplus that was taken away from the rich peasants and landlords it meant that how that the rich peasants erm you know got back er they sort of were a self UNK in that how the poor peasants just didn't have the means to improving their production
erm so the communist party to try to counter this sort of erm advance of the rich peasant economy which they saw was getting a bit too far tried to encourage the formation of mutual aid teams erm but they were very there were problems in that in erm the implementation of this because peasants were UNK to share their tools they weren't UNK for it
also peasants joining the mutual aid teams UNK that erm it would UNK their opportunities of working in other forms of erm er getting other forms of income and that says that only twelve point six percent of the total farming households in UNK which was quite a progressive place for mutual aid erm teams er erm were members of UNK in nineteen fifty two
erm i in m i in my opinion that the communist party aim of increasing productivity wasn't actually achieved and because of all these problems erm could that their policy of favour of erm promoting rich peasant economy didn't significantly contribute to industrialization erm i mean there was a little bit of an economic growth but that it wasn't particularly significant
however the agrarian reforms of nineteen fifty wasn't a complete failure and it did UNK er play a vital step in socialist transformation of agriculture
it had got rid of this the old order and new power relations had been established and so it shouldn't be regarded so much as an economic failure but as a profound political and social reform which is an important step towards the party's ultimate aim of communism and going back to the beginning of my paper that how that they had always seen industrialization as a means to an end and that how that socialism and ultimately communism could only be achieved through stages and so that although it was an economic failure it was a sort of a social
yes
success
fine
s so the really important outcome of land reform is the political and social changes not the economic changes
yes
and although it is being set up to promote a rich peasant economy in order to UNK the way for chinese industrialization that has not been particularly successful either in terms of the level of output and therefore the levels or in terms of inequalities in that one of the one of the worrying things that comes through that comes through despite the tax system there are still very substantial inequalities and i is the promotion of mutual aid a means a perceived means of reducing or containing those inequalities
yes but in practice it didn't really work because the communist party didn't really erm sort of make a concrete commitment to promoting them and just encouraged them
and n u up until nineteen fifty two
yes and then afterwards
right
but what when they do get going it is it's clear that the mutual aid process does reduce inequalities
erm
in that productivity within mutual aid teams goes up
i mean
but i mean you see the problem is that how the rich erm rich peasants two different mutual aid teams which meant that how that they didn't ha the resources they were sharing were pretty much the same
but their productivity still did rise within the mutual aid of the poor
it it's the poor that go into mutual aid teams
yes
their productivity rises
is it only marginally though
well but it comes up to closer to the productivity of the independent middle peasant
mhm
perhaps this is this is something we could we could we could use to talk about in some revision seminar at the beginning of next term cos we we've sort of got up to nineteen fifty two erm maybe it would be helpful if sort of you know we just sat there over the UNK and then come back and sort of have look
and see where this has got us
erm is that UNK
sorry yeah i
it's not your fault it's i mean there are once you get into this topic it becomes quite a big one
erm but if you can have a look at some of the taxation stuff and about the mutual aid
and pull the things together a bit
well the mutual aid people should look at the
yes
and also for taxation is very sort of there's one chapter which quite sort of
yes
so the second one yeah
the second one yes
and that i mean it's very UNK and i think if you just read those two books that should give you quite a good
but doesn't talk he does only talk about the economic
erm UNK are you talking about UNK that blue one
no it was the erm
it does everything doesn't it
it does everything
well UNK
so basically if you read UNK you're laughing
yeah but
you're laughing
i'm going to ask professor lock if he would like to open on this er this matter and proceed policy to major exceptions etcetera
how does that strike you
i was expecting a chance to get my papers organized
it's alright
thank you sir
the erm i think the best way to er start on this er
sorry david lock
the best way to start on this dis section of this discussion may be to erm express the observation that the county council and at least one of the local authorities which is harrogate erm are already engaged in have been engaged in for some time a very positive erm activity to try and attract to the county inward investment UNK that the economic development unit of the county council the economic development of at of at least the one local authority that i have named and erm prospective developers such i'm representing today share common UNK is that the existing structure plan UNK some UNK some UNK to the attraction of inward investment into the county
existing structure plan in short is erm set out in such a way that it UNK positively UNK the accommodation of inward investment on a large scale
it is in the shared interest of the parties i'm describing that this county should be able to attract and accommodate er inward investment of strategic significance to help the people of this county find the due employment that they need
the difficulty we all share is how can one construct a planning framework which allows for UNK significant inward investment to be accommodated without UNK an open season of speculative proposals from developers and uncertainty at the local level up and down the county
as you've seen from the erm discussion paper that we submitted sir it's our feeling that the most helpful way to proceed might be to add a new policy to the alteration
or alternatively adapt policy i five to allow for a strategic erm site or sites to be brought forward by local planning authorities in the course of their local plan work
but clearly some way must be found to prevent the open house that is all our concern to safeguard the amenity and character of the county
looking through our own experience in other parts of britain and having read some of the submissions of erm others on this subject we reached the conclusion that the most helpful thing to do might be to have a policy which was criteria based
and to set criteria for this strategic site exception policy which we feel should be added to the plan to set this criteria in such a way that it would so point to the local authorities in the making of their local plans but it was clear that the policy did not provide a speculative opportunity for everybody any UNK throughout the county
the criteria that we have suggested in the paper we've put in for the discussion session UNK from detailed observation and experience of what inward investment of the UNK significant kind might be looking for
one of its most distinguished UNK characteristics is the size of site which we know from experience which the county harrogate borough and ourselves at least have already here can be the order of UNK of fifty hectares
now almost by definition it's very unlikely in this county that a site of that size development would be found within a built up area
but size is the first criteria it seems to me that one should be looking at
on location where what criteria might be used to guide location i've said it's most unlikely to be found in a built up area but clearly close to good communications networks is important and must be within a reasonably short travel time of the national highway network
and i'll volunteer suggested in for me in the paper as a criterion that it also ideally should in my opinion have a the potential for railway connection given the thrust of policy a decade two decades ahead of us
the next issue is that we know that these prospective inward investors are likely to be looking for a site in reasonably attractive setting
this is very difficult because it means er it is a potential threat as it were to the countryside of the county
so we're suggestion criterion which make it quite clear that such a strategic site should not under any circumstances be located in the national parks areas of outstanding natural beauty heritage coast greenbelt and other specially designated areas of countryside protection
another characteristic of the inward investors that two authorities and ourselves have had experience of is that it's likely that the user or users will want to have reasonably clean air good water and the ability to work twenty four hours
now that again suggests for this strategic type of inward investment a location away from existing built up areas
on the one hand for environmental reasons for their environmental reasons i should say and on the other hand so as not to come as a nuisance to residents of existing communities
another safeguard that it seems to me that any such policy should have should be that development of the site must be possible without UNK reasonable and appropriate environmental standards
so that in itself it must not create er air pollution or water pollution and so on
and the last aspect of this sir is if you were to erm have a strategic site policy which as i was UNK to in my opening remarks really is a chance for the planning system to catch up with what is actually happening in this county
an enabling framework at strategic level to allow inward investment to be attracted
if you have such a policy if you were to have criteria of the kind i'm UNK to erm does that still leave it too open in north yorkshire might it still be too wide too many erm er opportunities might meet locations might meet these criteria
and on this sir i the way the UNK been going over the last couple of days erm i would like to point you at the experience of the nottinghamshire structure plan which i've got direct personal experience where there the panel was persuaded to commend locations that isn't right for structure plan but was a felt able to erm name a district or district council in whose area such a strategic site might be located
and i offer that as a idea for discussion
policies which no doubt david erm allenby will explain later of harrogate would suggest that harrogate borough is one in this county that feels it could accommodate a strategic site
there may be others i'm guessing presume that er mr UNK mr heselton is looking as though he might be welcoming of a strategic site given half a chance
the point i'm trying to get at sir is that erm it is none of it is in none of our interests either the planning authorities or even of the developers that if we were to erm find a strategic sites policy appropriate for this alteration it's in none of our interests that it should be confusing to the public or to the development industry as to how rare a thing this should be and how tightly directed it should be in geographical terms
criteria i've su criteria i've suggested UNK the geography pretty precisely but if you felt the need the local authorities felt the need for even further protection it does seem to me from my own experience of the nottinghamshire precedent it is possible if you felt so inclined and the county was to agree you could narrow it even further by naming one or two erm local authorities such a site erm should be discovered
now that sets the general scene sir
what i haven't done and i ought to because of the erm the way that this discussion has to UNK i ought to say that pure few sentences about why should there be a strategic sites policy at all and erm i ought to put that on the record although it's pretty well UNK in all the paper work
and it goes like this that the economy of north yorkshire generally and of some of its districts in particular has reached the point where it is not possible from internally generated growth to provide er the jobs that the residents
it is therefore necessary q e d for this county to be able to attract if it can some of the UNK investment which is available in britain and er generally in europe
to attract that inward investment to provide local jobs it's necessary for north yorkshire to have one or more sites which are as available and as attractive as competing locations
i've described some of the characteristics in those sites
now this aspect of competition is UNK
in a planners ideal world where we might have a wholly directed economy competition would not be relevant but i'm afraid the reality is we have to compete in north yorkshire with other counties in er this region and with other regions in britain with other countries in the european union and with other countries in the world
and what we have found that is the county harrogate certainly and ourselves from direct experience this last two years is that one of the features we have an attractive county to such inward investors its environment its people its setting its air and everything else is good but one of the features that we have so far been unable to offer is a planning framework which means that the marketing authority can deliver guarantee delivery of the planning consent that would make it happen
as a result of that UNK to guarantee a planning erm approval er this county has this county has lost one major inward investor within the last eighteen months already referred to by name in the documentation that is UNK clarke
who were extremely keen to locate in this county everything was right for them mr UNK borough had the site my clients had the site should i say and erm but we lost it to humberside because it was not possible for either harrogate or ourselves to look them in the eye and say yes we can guarantee planning consent
there happens to be another current live inquiry of a germany car manufacturer
that may be part of some bigger game going on about UNK unions in germany we're not green about that but again the same question arises in the UNK
the people are right the location is right the situation is right but can you guarantee planning consent
and under the present planning framework it is difficult for us to do
so for all those reasons sir there does seem to me to be erm the case for a policy which would allow this exception to erm attract to north yorkshire inward investment of this UNK important kind
and as i said earlier on is how the key to this is how to construct such a policy that would protect the interests of the county in a general environmental sense give local authorities the freedom in their local plans to set their stall out if that is what they want to do and er whilst avoiding UNK a rash of speculative developments erm er all over the place
i believe that a criteria based policy might the best way forward for that
thank you
thank you
can i ask you professor lock to say a little about what you consider the housing implications of such a policy might be
yes
and
sorry
a bit more about the range of employment you would envisage on the sort of fifty hectare site that you've talked about
do you mean range in terms of numerical quantity or type or all sorts
er oh all
please
certainly
the i've forgotten what your first question was now
housing
housing right
the i'm not an economic development officer so the er UNK of the perspective i have is limited from market experience rather than from a broader overview
the market experience is that the inward investors of this scale on the strategic importance that we're discussing generally speaking generate no significant housing demands as part of their package
there may be a handful of key employees brought in by that company to the location to establish the plant erm and to erm recruit and run the work force but my experience of these inquiries and prospective inquiries is that generally speaking they are looking to recruit labour locally and so this is not a housing generator type of development
this is a job supplier type of development
as to the type of employment the interesting feature that i experienced over the last two to three years as shown is that the inquiry level the type of inquiries has tended to focus on manufacturing and the attraction has been the quality of the work force that is both in skill and its UNK you know the liability and there are other issues in there too about where britain is at these days in terms of UNK wage levels but it is the people that are themselves the major UNK so the potential work force in the locality that is the major UNK
and that the business has been predominantly the nature of business has been predominantly manufacturing
detect a bit of a question mark and the end of er sorry er UNK tone as to in my voice that i'm not sure that would be so in the decade ahead
i simply don't know but the paperwork i've seen says that erm it is as likely in the next four or five years that major inward investors could be in the b one office type of employment as they happen to have been in the last couple of years in the manufacturing class
it may be you see that the manufacturing flavour of the past two years was to do with the pre er common market period getting inside the european union ring fence with the manufacturing plant and there is speculation as to whether that will now change that the common market is now established and that window of opportunity for manufacturing has tended to UNK suggesting that it may be erm administrative er services service sector that erm these international companies would now want inside the union
we don't know but i don't know but that is a doubt as to whether the manufacturing flavour of the past will be carried on through the decade
it is also fair to say and i must be up front about this because it is a matter of it is probably the most sensitive aspect of this whole debate is about b eight UNK and distribution
this county is one that for quite a long time has had the policies i think it's e it's number eleven e eleven is it or i eleven
i eleven
thank you in the existing structure plan
there's a there's a established prejudice against UNK and distribution er developments in this county in the existing structure plan
to be UNK with you i would expect there to be i'm certain that there will be demand for er modern UNK and UNK floor space of strategic scale strategic importance er in this county
and i know this presents the county council with some problems i don't know currently what the local UNK view on it is
but do let me say a couple of things about it
a subject i happen to know quite a bit about because we've got seven and a half million square feet erm in development at the moment in UNK at UNK park
modern UNK and UNK can yield good job UNK
er modern UNK floor space will at the very least yield about a thousand jobs sorry a hundred jobs per thousand square feet
er sorry getting all my UNK in the wrong place
try and get it right
it is a hundred jobs per hundred thousand square feet that's right
and the reason why those job UNK work like that is that modern UNK floor space comes brings with it typically an office element unit
so you'll get a big erm warehouse erm which may be typically erm computer controlled UNK systems storage UNK stock control and all the rest of it which will employ a certain number of people
but also with it comes erm office accommodation which is handling the clerical processing ordering and so on of the business itself
and that is a relatively new phenomenon and the type of warehouse which historically we all knew which was men in brown coats driving UNK trucks is not what it's about it's about er pretty sophisticated labour erm dealing with erm computer systems and electronic UNK systems and often working in shifts on twenty four hour basis
now whether we would find in our UNK if we were to have a strategic sites policy erm whether there's an issue there that it might let in as it were too much of that kind of land use and not enough of the manufacturing or proper office kind i think is worth kicking around the table
and if it is an issue as to whether there's some way of containing that
but i'll have to be very careful with it i do expect i would expect that there would be inquiries for that kind of investment here erm it's just that we haven't any major ones in the last couple of years of that type because the overall framework here is opposed to it
i suspect the answer to my first question is about numbers of jobs by virtue of what you've just said as long as a piece of string
would you like to hazard a guess about how long the string might be
on the number of jobs
well if you'll just if i'm allowed to turn round and consult the chap sitting behind me i can actually give you a direct a direct answer
it's sorry i'm going to have to do some UNK because what my friend is telling me it curious it's the thirty four per hectare
right
i've actually i've actually been doing some arithmetic while you were talking
thank you
on the basis of a hundred per hundred thousand square feet to which you'd have to add obviously a sort of surrounding area from the square UNK used for a distribution warehouse it looks as though it's around about the thirteen
yeah
per hectare
something like that
i'm embarrassed about that because
it's alright
the speech we had about job UNK yesterday
it obviously wasn't UNK that it worked out that way
yep
thank you
thank you
can i can i before we go to mr potter erm may be my slightly naive mind here but i distinguish when you start talking about a strategic site approach to planning for and one of provision within north yorkshire er as being different from an approach based on major exceptions in that in the sense that you would actually plan for the ability to cope with what my colleague calls the UNK coming over the horizon
in other words major inward investment not UNK of major investment within the u k but major inward investment from say western europe or japan or wherever
another nissan or UNK
erm against that there is this elephant which appears and you say we might have it and find a UNK for it and in fact we can't move fast enough to find the UNK
now the problem with the dealing with i suspect with the major exceptions policy is that if you had it could you move fast enough in order to cope with that sort of animal appearing on your horizon which you wanted to UNK
surely in a way i'm answering my own point you would have to go beyond just having a set of words on paper which says we have a major exceptions policy
what do
yes i
what do you do in reaction to that
you're looking at mr potter do want him
i'm just throwing it open
because i don't think he wanted to be asked question as his first question
erm it does like this sir that i would imagine that what we're after here is a policy which would enable a local authority if it so wished to put into its local plan a strategic site
so that by the time so that when you're out catching elephants you've already got the planning story is straight already as part of your net is that i've got a planning
yes
mr potter
erm david potter north yorkshire county council
er in fact you have anticipated one of the questions i was going to ask
are we talking here about the principle of major exceptions or are we actually talking about a site
but the reason as it were was to address some of the issues er that professor lock has raised
and i think i need to place this issue of inward investment in its proper context in terms of the county council's economic development strategy and the planning strategy for the county
erm inward investment in terms of the county council's economic development strategy is recognized as important and i think professor lock quotes the economic development strategy
i have the strategy in front on me but i it also the strategy also places the economy of the county in that context in so far as we're dealing with er the county of north yorkshire is UNK upon some twenty five thousand small businesses employing twenty five people or less and has only forty one firms serving one local market employing over three hundred people
this is an important area of concern obviously
but the basic essence of the strategy UNK on the small firms which UNK the local economy
in UNK in terms of inward investment the economic development strategy UNK on inward investment it has a role to play
er without suitable sites and premises inward investment cannot succeed since inquiries cannot be converted into jobs
and the county council will actively promote key sites to potential inward investors
it will seek to attract further inward investment based upon its strengths and by UNK
whilst inward investment
can you can you submit that
i can certainly
essentially what it's talking about it inward investment on small scale
inward investment which could be accommodated within the existing plans existing strategies on existing sites
and in fact at the greenbelt plan inquiry er i spent a considerable amount of time arguing on the issue of prestige sites and the availability of prestige sites within the greater york area already planned and available
er i think the county council recognizes the role of inward investment but that it is a small part of the UNK economic growth
in fact the revised economic development strategy which professor lock probably doesn't have a copy of refers to inward investment as being desirable erm and is of critical importance but whilst it will be vigorously sort in this way it has to be said that the bulk of north yorkshire suffers from a relative lack of financial incentives from central government in terms of whose regional policy does not have a priority
even when north yorkshire sites have been short listed by an investor on quality grounds the county has had no means of matching the financial incentives elsewhere
and i think the er inward investors that professor lock is referring to in terms of the german car manufacturer er the information that we have is that those were the very factors they considered and erm north yorkshire is not short listed
erm we have not perceived that inward investment of this scale is required or that the economic structure of the county could support such a major investment
it is based on small firms
and i look at issues much broader that the sites availability
availability of labour erm the structure of the labour force
now in terms of harrogate for example that is largely focused on erm on the office commercial sector
there is no obviously er pool of manufacturing labour or erm strong manufacturing base sufficient to support a firm coming in and taking up these large quantities of land
i mean why should this be in there'd be a strategic sites policy
it's not necessarily possible to generate jobs from with within its own boundaries
i mean the focus of the plan and the way we've approached erm trying to identify the appropriate level of land takes into account all that we considered to be the needs of the local economy
and i think this inward investment that professor lock is referring to and the scale of investment that he is referring to must be considered as additional and would draw in additional jobs
i think that's all i i'd like to say on that for the moment
any one else want to participate in this discussion
mr allenby
thank you chairman
er david allenby harrogate borough council
erm obviously the borough council strongly UNK the principle of a strategic exceptions policy and i think there is some difference between what professor lock is advocating and what the borough council is advocating
from a planning point of view we're advocating that there should be a criteria based policy within the structure plan
er we're not seeking a er a side based initiative if you like as such although that might come later
so we're looking for a for a separate policy in the industry employment section of the structure plan we do not wish to see any amendment to part of e two or for that matter to policy i five both of which we fully support
in making a case for a new exceptions policy our starting point really is the erm strategic planning framework provided by structure plan that's policy i five and the proposed policy e two
and we feel that both of those policies combine to establish what is in effect a presumption against erm any form of significant employment development away from the county's main settlements
and i think this is particularly important in the context of the section fifty four a
we've heard from professor lock there are some economic development projects which because of their size or their importance or their locational requirements just can't be accommodated in and around the main settlements of the county
and these developments may be of regional or national importance and they're usually UNK and clearly would have very significant employment benefits for the local population
and it's these developments that the borough council wishes to see UNK by a new policy
in effect the borough council would like to see a framework established which UNK explicitly that in the right circumstances strategic employment development can be accommodated in the county
in our view such developments will only be attracted to an area if there is a clear prospect of a site being made available as an exception to normal blank policies to meet those very specific requirements
and a key in all of this and professor lock er mentioned is why should we have er a strategic exceptions policy why do we want to attract those sort of developments to the county and more specifically perhaps harrogate district
and in that i can only speak for the harrogate district erm but the situation may well apply to other districts
yesterday professor lock referred to UNK having burst
erm indeed over the last two or three years the borough council's become extremely concerned at the UNK economic situation within the district and particularly around harrogate itself
the current in UNK case significant number of major job losses and we estimate that those amount to between three and four thousand jobs er many of which we feel are still to come through the system and are therefore not reflected in unemployment figures of yet
the result of all this has been a rapid rise in registered unemployment er nevertheless and a steep rise in long term unemployment
and particularly of concern to us an adverse structural shift in various employment sectors
and the borough council has responded to this situation by adopting a number of policy objectives including the one which seeks to attract appropriate inward investment projects
and we feel that in order to UNK this a planning policy initiative is needed
we've looked at those initiatives and there seem seemed to me to be to be three approaches
firstly the council could have opted for a significant increase in the er i five allocation and to go on to see to identify a site in the local plan
and for a number of reasons we felt that this wasn't appropriate er primarily because it's an UNK approach
erm it isn't really UNK to meet the needs er of the sort of developments we're talking about
in effect anything allocated under i five would have to be made available in or in or around main settlements
secondly we could've or we could accept the status quo and do what the county council's suggesting
in other words we would deal with applications as they come forward on an ad hoc basis where the onus would be on the developer to prove er prove exceptional circumstances
in our view this is not acceptable either
the main problem here is that sort of approach wouldn't give potential inward investors any confidence at all that a strategic development would be acceptable within the county or within the district
in other words UNK about the planning UNK towards a proposal and doubts about local UNK ability to approve a site are likely to UNK potential investors at an early stage
the third option is to go for a strategic exceptions policy in the structure plan and obviously this is what er the borough considered considers is appropriate
we feel that this would provide a framework for the evaluation of the material considerations which the county council has accepted can come into play
and it appears from what the county council has said that they are they're not necessarily opposed to this sort of development that we're looking at here but that er the case would have to be proven as an exception to normal planning policy
all we're seeking is some explicit acknowledgement within the plan that there may be circumstances where this type of development will be appropriate
the type of policy we're actually seeking is already included in the humberside structure plan and i see this morning that er that was circulated as d four double o seven
er in fact it is actually erm er re UNK in my evidence paragraph four and five
now that policy and i think i'll it out the proposals for industry and commerce that are not in accordance with the relevant policies of this plan would not normally be permitted but special provision for very large projects may occasionally be made in exceptional circumstances provided that and there are three criteria there would be substantial proven employment or other benefits to county residents the proposal cannot reasonably be implemented on land proposed in local plans for industrial or commercial development bearing in mind the undertakings operational requirements and thirdly that there are no overriding planning objections
now that seems to us to be a very good way forward in establishing a framework for the consideration of those sort of proposals
it's clear from that sort of policy that the need for or benefits arising from the development would always have to be assessed against environmental and other considerations for example regional strategy
which is what the county council suggests could happen anyway
in this case however there would be a proper framework for that evaluation to take place
to conclude therefore the borough council strongly UNK the panel to recommend the county council to include a strategic exceptions policy
before i finish i just wonder whether i could put one point to the county and that's whether in the absence of a strategic exceptions policy in the structure plan they would allow the borough council to include the type of policy we're seeking in our district wide local plan bearing in mind that some of the considerations in involved are of a strategic nature
before you before you respond mr williamson mr heselton do you want to just pick up the
thank you sir
same sort of feel that mr UNK been dealing with
yeah
terry heselton selby district
erm i'm in i'm in some difficulty because this is this is a matter that's arisen since the original matters er matters for discussion were drawn up so i'm not able to give you the formal views of the council in that respect
but it might be worth if i outline my own office view
well let me have your professional view
right well yes that's what i was about to do
erm well as i've as i've in my submission i think we can give qualified support for the proposal that erm harrogate have put on the table
i'll come as no surprise to you that er what's been suggested would be consistent with the sorts of arguments that i put forward yesterday
erm going back to my point that the existing development plan system hasn't served selby district particularly well
and picking up professor UNK point erm we are certainly in the market to attract UNK investment
erm interesting that dave UNK men mentioned the humberside policy and again just to reiterate very briefly the point i made yesterday
we had some discussion about competition if i can use that word between ourselves and leeds but where selby sits in north yorkshire we are in competition with more than just west yorkshire
we've got the south yorkshire authorities UNK and UNK in particular and also the humberside authorities as well
so i think it would fit in with the council's a adopted economic development strategy
i think basically having heard the argument put forward from both sides what we're really talking about is a is a policy that in terms of its support from the districts it depends whether or not any particular district council might have such a use for the policy
and i think i i'm able to give that level of support from selby UNK point of view
two concerns that i do have are one in relation to the er criterion and the UNK that might also be put in place with the policy
and er got three suggestions really to add to the criteria that professor UNK put forward
one is that i think in order to overcome some of the objections that we heard from leeds yesterday in terms of the erm the urban regeneration policies that any proposal would certainly need to be re UNK from outside the region
erm secondly it might reasonably be expected to demonstrate that it would be in the interests of either the region regional or sub regional economy
then that thirdly it would need to help fulfil the economic objectives or the employment needs of the receiving authority which i guess in many respects boils down to UNK a particular authority or authorities if you like
erm where i have to qualify my support is and i do particularly want to stress that in no way would i accept the exceptions policy as a substitute to an appropriate increase in the employment UNK allocation for selby district
because clearly an increase in the allocation sends a much stronger signal to potential investors and it carries with it a greater degree of certainty as far as the district council's concerned as far as potential investors are concerned
and also of course as a far as local people are concerned
the implication
so sorry can i just ask so in effect you haven't shifted your ground from the view which you expressed in paragraph three point six of your submission where you've just confirmed in fact that you'd rather have a proper or the ability to make a sort of proper measured allocations part of which would make provision or allow the facility to cater for major inward investment
er terry heselton selby district
well another way of putting it is that this might be an additional er policy that would help us as well as er
yep
as an increase in the all in the allocation but that the main message is that i wouldn't like it to be a substitute for that
no right
thank you
is the implication of what you've just said to the chairman that you agree with mr allenby that this animal is a different one than anything that might go to an i five site
terry heselton selby district
yes i think i think that is the case
but equally it may it may be in the in the UNK of time that we would be able to identify or bring a site forward through the local plan process and we're not at that stage at the moment
right
i have some knowledge of the UNK site to which professor lock referred and of the UNK site at derby
professor lock will no doubt correct me if i'm wrong but from memory in neither of those cases was there the sort of provision in the development plan which you're now seeking
it may be but i can't remember that both of them UNK section fifty four a
was that true at UNK
i'm not competent on er david lock i'm not competent on UNK
erm all i have is the UNK knowledge that it was a gift to UNK constituency
er erm and i don't think it had a planning history
the erm situation for UNK er UNK park however i am familiar with and it certainly UNK section fifty four a and erm in there were two phases
er the first of erm er three million square feet second of four and a half and erm the er in both cases it UNK the call in procedure under the departure and in both cases er a public inquiry had to be held er or the secretary of state chose to call a public inquiry
and in both cases that took two and a half years
but hasn't prevented either
it hasn't prevented either
going ahead
no but the sorry you're quite right
erm the difference is that erm it a UNK park is specifically an exclusively rather exclusively geared to b eight and is absolutely slap bang in the middle of the country on the conjunction of the m six m one and the a one m link route and everything else
erm the land is a UNK airfield required very cheaply so there was no great exposure in getting that site away and its first occupiers were the company that had bought it and UNK did their own buildings to begin with for their own use
what we're talking about here is a is a different circumstance where the erm competition for inward investment up here further north is more intense
a number of erm elephants coming into view is fewer
there are fewer elephants about up here erm and er the issue that obviously concerns me from the development point of view is the is the time scale is the process rather that the planning policy would im would imply
and sorry while i'm speaking i'm left a little confused
when you heard me i was UNK a process whereby you'd have a strategic sites policy in the structure plan which would enable a local authority in preparing its local plan if it wished to identify a strategic site and that would then become in the local plan you know subject to all those consultation processes and then it's part of the portfolio that is available in the published arena with a statutory framework behind it
erm david allenby didn't talk like that
we haven't UNK notes on this aspect of it
he maybe sees a different process and i don't know about you chairman but it would it would help me to see if to hear whether they see a different process at work
david allenby harrogate borough council
erm my starting point on all of that is the development issues report that erm we put to our members in may of this year where we discussed the issue of strategic exceptions policies and how we would deal with that sort of approach in the local plan
and the conclusion of that is we go for a criteria based approach for the time being see what the response was to that er and nothing was said about identifying the site as such
i think the difficulty with taking a site approach is that it's difficult erm to assess what the employment benefits are of something that you're not sure about
erm now it may be that on a particular site erm conditions could be laid down to ensure and secure that there were significant employment benefits UNK from the development of that site
but what we had in mind in looking at this through the local plan was that er we'd be looking at specific end users to see what the benefits were of those end users and to assess those benefits against any environmental harm that there would be and strategy as a whole
so i think erm there is there is a difference between us in all of that but that needn't necessarily mean that we won't identify a site in the future
can i take it from what you said professor lock that you would envisage this policy as providing for b one b two and b eight development
yes
yes that it would e it would exclude none of those possibilities is how i would
given the stance of policy approved policy i eleven in relation to b eight development and the fact that we are here discussing an alteration not a review and replacement of the structure plan does anyone around the table she said looking hard at mr UNK see any difficulty in the panel UNK potentially recommending a policy which would be in direct wi conflict with the policy which is not before it
les UNK department of the environment
since the department since the regional office has been suggesting for some time or throughout the entire process of this structure plan alteration that erm an exceptions policy should be considered by the erm county council i think it would be consistent that we would anticipate the panel could reach a conclusion on the inclusion of the major exceptions policy as part of this alteration
was the regional office conscious in making that i'm sorry that was not that pause UNK was the regional office conscious in making that suggestion that b eight uses were being UNK to be included and therefore the conflict potentially was a policy which was not before it
i think that's a fair point
i think that b eight was not upper most in the department's mind when it was making its er views known about a major exceptions policy
thank you sir
so if the panel were minded to recommend an exceptions policy then in the in the light of i eleven we we'd have great difficulty in recommending other than b one and b two uses
perhaps er my understanding was as i guess mr UNK understanding of this policy was before professor lock mentioned UNK that it was primarily manufacturing or b one b one or b two
this is this is now a now a terribly important issue
i it is not envisaged i mean i mustn't mislead you at all i want i want to be understood on this issue
nobody is that i'm that i'm aware is proposing a distribution park of strategic importance
yet
yet
erm what i was trying to do was be UNK about what kind of er inquiries of the strategic kind might be expected to come if this county had that kind of policy
i think what i imagined erm miss UNK and chairman is that erm if you get the criteria right then this exceptions policy would also be an exception to i eleven but it would have to pass this criteria
in other words it would have to be job beneficial it would have to be of strategic importance and all those other things we've been discussing
but i think i had imagined it would it would allow if it was wanted it would allow i eleven to be UNK it would be one of the things it would be an exception to
i think potentially professor lock you could be UNK some work for UNK given that policy i eleven says provision will not be made
it does doesn't it
but then if we're UNK ex exceptions policy except as maybe provided an exception policy number seven
i can i can see the trap here
erm it maybe that in this alteration the erm it's worth just spending a minute on whether b eight should just be kept out of the frame for the moment and it's something that gets dealt with at a later time when more policies are in play
can i ask would that seriously if it were limited or by virtue of the panel report having identified this problem we reported that we saw a problem if it included b eight would that be a problem from the point of view either harrogate or selby if b eight was in effect if not in the policy itself excluded
david allenby harrogate borough council
erm perhaps i could answer that chairman by saying that the policy i've suggested from the humberside structure plan would er would i think cover that er problem in that it starts off by saying proposals for industry and commerce that are not in accordance with the relevant policies of this plan will not normally be permitted
and then put special provision for very large projects
so there is a recognition there that by the very nature of these erm proposals that they're not going to be in accordance with one or perhaps more policies in the structure plan
thank you
thank you sir
er terry heselton selby district
erm i don't think it would cause us a tremendous problem
erm can i also draw your attention to the to the second erm part of the of the policy that would at least permit that type of development provided it was able to demonstrate a need to be located in north yorkshire
so it's not an absolute exclusion is it
you're talking about i eleven
i eleven sorry yes
yes it's not it's not absolutely exclusive
mr UNK
thank you chairman
as i said this morning doesn't oppose er in principle the idea of er an exceptions policy
but er looking at er professor UNK suggestion and the criterion that is set out there i think er a number of people might be interested to have a go at those criteria so to speak
and certainly from erm my department's point of view we would be looking for er an inclusion of a criterion on the need to avoid higher quality agricultural land
that's it
mr earle and then mr potter
thank you chairman
patrick earle richmondshire
i also speak with a while ago now but a certain amount of experience in northumberland working for the county council in bringing development into UNK new town so i am aware of the er the merits of er getting your elephants by having a cage already made
find some of them insist on finding their own cage and er so you do then have to er have a flexible approach
but i think the analogy begins to break down and i'll go on to erm straight forward thinking in richmondshire erm where we wouldn't recognize an elephant if we saw one
i've just been told er to my right it's a very large sheep
erm
shame
no
the scale of development that's in professor UNK is plainly not one that i think that would directly er affect richmondshire and so to some extent er i'm speaking from that perspective
although fifty hectares at thirty per hectare i mean fifteen hundred jobs erm and i think we've got eleven hundred or a thousand on our total unemployment role
so plainly that wouldn't necessarily apply to us but the except the exception would be sitting there in policy and i think it's a it's something we would find very difficult er to live with
erm you see the question is how far how wide to the exceptions go
er mr UNK just brought in another one that he wants er qualification on
how many other policies of the structure plan would this apply to
wild life conservation er and other conservation issues er would be brought into question
erm i UNK the possibility that erm we would be faced with lesser proposals lesser than the scale that erm professor lock UNK because it would be said well if fifty hectares is right for ha er for harrogate then what twenty hectares for richmondshire ten hectares
er and so the policy would perhaps be extended
erm the question would ultimately come out well why not retail
i the UNK not within what we've been talking about this afternoon but on the other hand it does employ more people per hectare than any industry we've been talking about as far as far as i understand it
i see a danger that every single motorway UNK in the county and heavens in the country will be subject to an interpretation of this er of this sort of exceptions approach
and it's that in itself has been er an issue faced by ministers on the m twenty five
erm the er professor lock was saying well you know the way you get your UNK industry is to present them with an absolute guarantee of planning permission
well no ideas have been put forward this afternoon in terms of a structure plan alteration er or an additional policy will give an absolute guarantee
i mean obviously the it's a i perhaps it's an UNK to the effect that nobody can guarantee planning permission until they've got planning permission
and this is why i think the approach that harrogate would perhaps be thinking of and we ourselves would be thinking of if this is the way we wanted to go is simply to go out and get a site and get planning permission on it
and present it to a prospective developer
erm or short of that a firm local plan allocation with all the consultations and environmental impact study already done
other than that you cannot guarantee planning permission
and what our colleagues in county durham again in northumberland we were able to do is was this was all in place
here's the planning permission here's the site if you insist on going there well we can't give you any guarantees but we'll do our best for you but certainly the best thing is to have the allocation
and if that allocation is pushed through if you like in the teeth of the structure plan policy but it becomes your local plan and that's the legislation provides for that surely must be the question
just one other point there is the issue of sustainable development professor lock referred to erm alright we'll bring in the railway line er as part of your criteria but i am concerned at the general UNK that is er envisaged in the sort of development er that he suggested
erm so as i say to get your erm to get the elephant er have the cage with planning permission
thank you
mr potter
thank you
david potter north yorkshire county council
erm i think professor lock appears to be talking about a site specific proposal
the borough council refers to a criteria based policy
yet i think the borough council gave some clear UNK they're maybe looking for additional land allocation
now i think it would be helpful if the borough council could clarify whether that is in fact what they're looking for an additional land allocation
but i would like to point out the county council point of view on both a site or a criteria based policy
in fact er professor lock in his UNK in his own evidence er page five para four three refers to a rash of speculation UNK along the a one m in the county as to which locations the policy might be said to apply
i think that is the fear of the county council that a criteria based policy would lead to a sp a rash of speculation speculative development along the er the major motorway corridors
erm with regard to a site specific policy if it's additional and there's no clear need for it it's not UNK for within the allocation which is er provided for within the structure plan then we could be left with a major site with a clear commitment to its development or its UNK for development and no end user
now what would happen to the site in those circumstances
a major business park er a major manufacturer a major distribution centre erm with the consequences for perhaps in commuting and trans er transport movements
i think these are the fears of the county council that er the uncertainty such a policy would bring
would the more explicit specification in a policy like e four of humberside excuse me that the development should not be speculative in other words that the end user should be known overcome some of your concerns
i think if the end user was known then the end user is perfectly capable of UNK a planning application
erm and it could be dealt with on its merits
i don't think there's anything within fifty four section fifty four a which UNK that
david allenby harrogate borough council
i just wanted to come back on er david UNK assertion that we were looking for a higher allocation under i five and i thought i'd specifically covered that point by saying that wasn't what we were looking for because that wouldn't address the sort of development we're talking about here
er another allocation under i five would simply mean that we'd more land to find in and around main areas
erm those sites are subject to other lo locational restrictions and other environmental restrictions and wouldn't in our view be appropriate for the sort of development that he's looking for erm a location in our context anyway generally speaking along the a one corridor
could i just have mr jewitt first
michael jewitt hambleton district council
erm i tend to share patrick UNK reservations about this particular policy i think that it would convey the wrong message erm to the development industry
erm undermine the policies of conservation and restraint in the county
there's also a danger as patrick UNK pointed out though it would be applied differently between different districts erm given erm that erm relative issues on UNK unemployment and the economy will er differ between districts
i question really whether or not this erm this policy is needed erm to meet local employment requirements
i think it should be erm local councils should be able to bring their requirements from allocated sites provided they make the appropriate er provide an appropriate choice of location and size of sites erm up to the erm levels proposed in the county
and i really do question whether the potential benefits of such an exceptions policy really erm are worth UNK those strategic policies of conservation and restraint
i tend to think that it should really be left outside the development plan process and it should be for individual developers to prove exceptional needs
that way it can be dealt with through the departure process and the checks and balances the departure er introduces erm are in place erm to protect local interest
do you want to come back on something or can i ask professor lock to
well it was really er ken williamson of north yorkshire
it was really er the point er mr allenby made
it seems to me that what we're talking about here is UNK land allocation being not necessarily an i five but sixty hectares which he agreed was adequate for i five yesterday plus i suspect another fifty which would be a strategic site
although there may be differences between er professor UNK approach and UNK i think the mutual objective seems to be er between the two strategic site within the development plan in harrogate district and on the access one site of the a one a fifty nine junction
could i check out i mean i'm still not sure whether harrogate are happy with sixty hectares at i five to meet their requirements that was what i understood yesterday
are we talking about another fifty hectares really to add on to that
not necessarily as i five but as another fifty hectares as industrial or employment land whatever you'd like to call it
david allenby harrogate borough council
i'm not sure how clearly i have to spell this out
no we're not looking for an increase in our i five allocation
that is not going to help in this situation
we support the i five allocation
what we're looking for is a new policy initiative which will allow in appropriate circumstances inward investment of er a significant strategic nature to be accommodated within north yorkshire and that could possibly probably be harrogate district
thank you
professor lock
sir
erm er four or five points
er the contribution to the discussion made by mr jewitt of hambleton erm is a necessary contribution but it really doesn't fit or sit well with the economic circumstances of other parts of the county
i don't know about hambleton but erm talking in er erm on high ground about conservation and so on erm is very difficult when a local authority is faced with structural change in its economic base and major unemployment
i mean that is a serious social and political issue to which there should be in my submission a planning response
we can't just ignore it erm it is proper planning to try and do something about it
on the second er the second point to make is that erm on the county council's end of this equation er mr potter er referred us to the county's economic development strategy i think i've got that latest edition where he was erm attempting to tell us that the erm county's economic strategy is to attract inward investment of a small scale type
that is indeed part of their strategy but the fact of the matter is that the county council is wholly UNK in the efforts that have been made in this erm county over the last couple of years to get large scale inward investment
that is a factual situation which i hope mr allenby would be able to erm endorse it if it becomes a matter of dispute between us
erm the county is UNK in the search for erm er large scale investment
it also puts money into the yorkshire and humberside development association which is wholly involved and has been for the last two years in trying to get large scale erm strategic inward investment into the county and erm it is a erm UNK i think that it's best to be open about that the planning policy of the county is out of tune with the day factor activities of the economic development side of the of the county council
third point erm relates to the proposal from the gentleman on the left here about agricultural land as an additional criteria
erm that has been a matter of serious discussion here and i know with some of the local authorities and the fact of the matter is sir that we feel that if we look at the agricultural land quality of this county if you were to have a criteria based policy which included the requirement that strategic sites should avoid good quality agricultural land erm you haven't got a policy at all because this is a county which has mostly its territory covered by good quality agricultural land especially in those parts of this county where strategic development might be expected to actually happen
that brings me to this last point about criteria
erm i forget which UNK it was but it it's wrong to think that there's a difference i think between erm me i was being UNK as wanting a site specific policy and harrogate who were being UNK as wanting a criteria based policy
i think there's a fit in this
what i'm trying to suggest is a criteria based policy at the strategic scale
the purpose of that is to remove from mr jewitt at hambleton and mr earle at richmondshire and any others erm who just don't want this kind of pressure brought upon them er by putting criteria in at the strategic scale you could derive that criteria and maybe even name local authority areas to make to protect those who do not want this feature
where i talk about sites specific is to get down to this UNK about which comes first the erm inquiry or the erm planning consent
and again to spell that out erm the way it needs to work in practice i believe is that in its local plan a local authority should be able to define a site which it would regard as suitable for development only for these UNK important reasons
in other words it's not part of its standard employment allocation but it's put it in the local plan so that people know the locals know that field over there those fields over there erm are not guaranteed for ever as countryside but on the other hand they're jolly well not gonna be released unless it's for something extremely special for which there would be a statement carried through from the structure plan UNK on no doubt at local level which set the rules
erm that UNK that allocation in a local plan backed by this erm er policy in the structure plan would be enough in my judgement to enable the economic development people to actually UNK the get the elephant in the trap
but indeed it is not planning permission
because that elephant is going to probably require an environmental assessment or environmental statement erm and there would be infinite numbers of details to tie up in section one o sixes and goodness knows what else specific to that user or users those users when they the came in the frame
but unless you've erm got the certainty from the planning framework point of view that subject to those important details its planning permission is UNK then the elephant will go somewhere else
there is a restaurant in my home town as i guess there is in many called something special
i have eaten there once and came away describing it as something not very special
how picking up on the terms you use professor lock how would the policy guarantee that what this elephant was special
i anticipate that because that's becoming now a key question
and what i've got in front of me david lock what i've got in front of me is erm and i know david's got it david UNK got it as well is the er paper from UNK economic development officer to his economic development sub committee and it's gone all the way through the process now and through the main council where he has to answer that very question and i couldn't put it better
what he says here it says there are an investment project miss UNK whose size composition economic significance and locational requirements make it impossible to locate on an ordinary site so that's one issue and then he says of regional significance or more often national or international significance
and this is how you clear that one up
relating to investment that could locate elsewhere in the u k or in europe but which would only be attracted to this site if it to a site if it is erm sorry UNK if the availability of this site if this site is made available on terms similar to those of competing locations
so picking the bones out of that it's size composition economic significance and locational requirement means that you can't bed it down in your ordinary i five allocation
that's one criteria
and then it's got to be regional national or international investment which could go elsewhere in the u k or in europe
now that kind of language which is what this chap is using here would seem to me to be setting the erm frame in a way which really would protect erm a locality from er this policy being a UNK horse for something that is ordinary
it really these are quite UNK to jump over
could we have a copy of that er paper
yes by all means yep
mr UNK
no i think mr UNK did you want to come back mr UNK
yes
and then and then mr UNK
just on one of the points er made by professor lock erm who was arguing that it basically wasn't possible to include an agricultural land quality criterion er in the exceptions policy because there was so much good land in north yorkshire
erm our estimate of the proportion of agricultural land in the county which would be classified as best and most versatile land that is having a considerable er weight in planning decisions grades one two and three a is between thirty and thirty five percent
er and that's of agricultural land not of all land in the county so the proportion of the total land would be less than that
so i don't think i would accept the UNK argument on that point i think there is plenty of scope for UNK a development of this kind either on non agricultural site or on moderate or poor quality land
mr UNK
thank you
michael UNK countryside special sites could be in open countryside away from government policies concerning sustainability i wonder how professor lock would see the situation emerging whereby a local authority has allocated a certain amount of land in its local plan for development for industrial or commercial purposes it's tried to erm identify a broad range of criteria but it also identified special sites erm which will only be released in exceptional circumstances that happened to be an open countryside and had the advantages that it may be a little close to the a one or somewhere similar
most developers would probably opt for the open site policy on the UNK open site erm area on the basis this would better meet their functional needs
they don't have to worry too much about the UNK and all the other sins that the planning process is concerned with
so a local authority might then find itself in a situation that it'd got a two tier site
one which the developer would prefer and one which the local authority and maybe sustainability policies would prefer
in this case the developer would probably say to the local authority i want this site and it's all or nothing which then puts the local authority in a dilemma and in the sense its allocated sites are now seen to be some form second status
and i can't help thinking that we might end up with a sort of repeat of the sort of situation that's occurred at UNK site which is erm mentioned in the erm the paper UNK this morning whereby er a sort of market led approach which puts a lot of pressure on the local authorities may be at the expense of the planning led approach to erm deciding where development should most appropriately go
but i'd i say that with full acceptance that there is a dilemma in trying to attract erm development to er to areas which badly need them
i think that the question is how much are we going to sacrifice in order to satisfy the UNK erm er desire to have UNK guarantees that the site will be available as and when they want it
thank you for that
mr UNK and then i think
thank you chairman
erm i'd like to make a point about the this question of an agricultural land quality criterion in the policy
erm it seems to me erm that there's a danger that if professor lock has his way when the elephant comes UNK through into the clearing he will be sending UNK sheep flying in all directions and er will be er affecting lots of other agricultural creatures at the same time
erm what i think we need is an alternative to the suggestion made by mr UNK erm is simply erm a wording in the exceptions policy should it be er carried forward that makes it clear that the agricultural policies in the structure plan do still apply erm to those proposals
now the reason i make that suggestion is that erm policy a two for example looks at not only the erm quality of the agricultural land but also the effect of development proposals on erm the maintenance and economically viable erm farm units and so forth
er and therefore it looks at erm the indirect impact of development erm and it's more sophisticated one might say than merely looking at the quality of the land
thank you
thank you very much
can we break for tea now come back at twenty five to four
no let's make it twenty to four
then you'll have time to enjoy your tea
thank you
mr allenby are you ready to burst into song
UNK speaking
oh yes i don't know about song chairman but er suppose i'm singing a song of some sort
erm i'd like just to re remind the county if i could about the question i did put in my opening er remarks that er we would like some view from them as to whether if their if their strategic exceptions policy isn't er ultimately included in the structure plan they would object to the principle of us er pursuing this sort of approach through our local plan
obviously that's in general terms as a matter of principle
i'd also like to just come back on one point that mr UNK made about a two tier approach to employment sites
er that in my view won't happen because the i five sites we will still be allocating in and around the main urban areas
a strategic site if it comes forward would be away from the main urban areas and would only be available for developments that could not otherwise take place on the i five allocations
mr williams
thank you sir
a few brief comments
erm i suppose scarborough borough council er having the most acute unemployment problems in the county er is as interested as anybody else in attracting new investment but er i do wonder whether this particular approach is the right one
erm it seems to me that we've been talking about UNK elephants but er is it really a UNK horse
oh this gets worse
erm the county have worked er very hard to produce a balanced strategy
they they've looked at erm housing and er industrial development er i wasn't at the discussion yesterday but clearly they've put a significant effort into deciding what the appropriate level of new industrial development is
and er with the exceptions policy erm how many exceptions would we allow
i mean we're told that these erm types of development are few and far between
er supposing the economy did take off erm we used up all the industrial land that er had been allocated to the districts
er which took care of all the local needs reduced unemployment er and we have a lot of these exceptions coming forward
er do we then have a situation where the county's UNK significantly undermined
we attract a lot of new housing er requirements for new housing development er commuting is patterns have significantly changed
erm i just feel it's er it's a dangerous policy
thank you
thank you
could i er david allenby harrogate
just a moment just a moment mr allenby
could i just respond to that chairman
alright yep
erm that i think wouldn't be the case
if er i five sites have been taken up and employment needs of districts have been addressed and the county in general have been addressed then er an inward investment wouldn't provide or offer substantial proven employment benefits
those benefits don't need aren't there because there is employment
so that consideration would be UNK in the balance and clearly erm it wouldn't be right to those sort of developments
i don't i don't there is a is a problem in that respect
thank you
sharon UNK craven district council
er i think from UNK point of view erm we couldn't really see any justification for a strategic exceptions policy in UNK case
erm UNK economic development strategy is based on growth amongst small local businesses erm and we have very few large employers
erm UNK mostly our economic base is through small businesses and that's where we see er the future growth of employment needs being satisfied
erm i perhaps do have some sympathy for UNK position
erm they perceive a need for this policy er they have a perceived structural changes in their economy and er there is UNK fear erm that perhaps they would not be able to respond UNK enough er with the policies that are in place and see a need for this additional one
from a purely selfish point of view if the policy were to indicate specific areas of the county erm where this policy would er be appropriate and would apply erm and as long as it excluded craven then i think
clearly you know we've er it being in
how however i mean from a broader point of view i think i would have some general reservations as have been UNK previously by mr earle and mr jewitt
erm but i do have some sympathy with UNK position and indeed UNK position er to some extent
but certainly in the craven context i do not feel there is any justification for this policy
no i think your neighbours to the south have a different perception to UNK strategic role
yes they do
if only in housing
mr UNK
UNK ryedale district council
it's obviously time for all the districts to nail their cause to the mast
if i could make clear that should the panel consider applying the exceptions policy to particular districts within the council with the county in fact then ryedale stands alongside hambleton and craven and scarborough and richmondshire have enormous UNK about the application of this policy certainly to our district
thank you
mr UNK
thank you sir
s UNK les UNK d o e
in making our representations about erm a major exceptions policy erm the regional office had thought of it very much as a UNK policy to deal only with exceptional cases
erm certainly we'd not anticipated that it would UNK existing structure plan policies or UNK existing policy e two
erm it would be for the policy itself to define the criteria such that it did only refer to exceptional circumstances and the occasional one or two cases
i'd submit the erm humberside policy e four erm not exactly as a as a model policy or even as best practice
you may get one example of what in a joint local authority have done
perhaps if we if we looked a little at UNK experience
erm to the best of my knowledge erm policy e four has been UNK only one since this structure plan was approved in nineteen eight seven er enabling erm one the districts and myself back to the UNK to acquire an international erm company
erm but it hasn't to the best of my knowledge it has not resulted in a rash of developments and motorway UNK
i quite accept the m eighteen m sixty two is not the a one or the m one
erm but erm i merely pose it as an indication that erm it is possible for local authorities to erm not open the door to development speculative development er if they do not wish to do so erm because it does not ride UNK existing structure plan policies
erm others have suggested that it could be handled through the existing
if a major proposal came along and the local authority wan district wanted to grasp it with both hands they could use the er existing erm development plan process to do so
erm even if it was contrary to existing erm adopted local plan
all i would say with regard to that is it would seem to the regional office that consideration of those proposals that were in conflict with a with an approved development plan would be erm more easily UNK if there was an approved strategic context against which they could be judged
erm and it would in us suggesting to the county council that they consider this policy we had in no way expected it to result in wholesale de erm development
but er just a one the exceptional cases
and as a UNK policy erm it in their it UNK all parties in er dealing with er applications that come forward that are contrary to UNK development plan
mr williams
thank you sir
david williams scarborough borough council
could i just clarify my position on this
clearly er these are my personal comments because the issue hasn't been debated by the council
erm first of all i i'm not in support of an exceptions policy
er if there were to be an exceptions policy the suggestion has been made that certain districts perhaps could be identified er as being a suitable location
erm if there was to be an exceptions policy er i wouldn't like scarborough to be excluded from it
because er as i say erm if the opportunity came along and er given the unemployment problems in the borough erm it may be that we would wish to take that opportunity
erm i mean i don't see it but if the opportunity came along i think it would be UNK to have a policy which er only allowed those exceptions in certain districts
thank you sir
thank you
mr UNK do you want to come back on something
erm i didn't but i shall
if you leave it long enough you get picked on
obviously
UNK ryedale district council
in not supporting the application of such a policy to ryedale district i'm not by any means saying that the district council would never support erm such elephants as er as have been referred to
merely that we would not support the application of such a policy
we'd rather deal with each proposal on its particular merits
yep
anyone else want to make any comments before i is this to pick up points or can i
chairman yes
come back to you for something else
yeah okay
it is er chairman
er ken williamson north yorkshire
it's in response to mr UNK question we seem to be UNK waiting for i think he posed it some time ago about the county council's view on whether in the absence of a strategic exceptions policy or whatever you call it a major exceptions policy in the structure plan whether the county council would object to it being pursued in the in the local plan
chairman i think er i don't think we've got any option but to say yes we would
i think at er the sort of level of development and the location implications of er such a strategic exception fifty hectares in some location which was totally outside the context of approved locational policy this would represent a significant element of really UNK with the plan
i think we'd have to have to make our views known on that
chairman i'd just david allenby harrogate borough council
i'd just like to come back on that because i'm referring here to erm county council paper n y seven which was er relating to the i five i twelve issues we were issuing yesterday
er in paragraph a hundred and eight of that paper and i'd like to read er read a quotation out however because an exception is not acknowledged it does not mean that provision could not be made for this
much would depend on the particular circumstances at the time either in the context of a planning application or a local plan proposal
the policy as expressed does not necessarily exclude development outside the area specified but UNK development areas as a primary consideration
therefore it is for the district council to justify any local plan policy which UNK from the county structure plan
there seems to be some sort of implicit acknowledgement in there or even explicit acknowledgement that if we were able to justify the approach we could pursue it within a local plan and that doesn't really square with what mr williamson has just said
david potter north yorkshire county council
erm i was actually going to pick that point up in summary but er mr allen allenby has raised it
i think er what the county council's position is in terms of the statement he's just read out it is that er the county council strategic framework the structure plan alteration number three the high fly policy which we discussed yesterday is an attempt to address the needs of the districts and if we've got this right then sufficient land should be identified or allocated to the districts within policy i five
erm we perceive no need at the present time for such an exception and the borough council seem to have accepted that
they see that their i five allocation is sufficient
er but we acknowledge that over time circumstances may change and that it may be appropriate and such circumstances erm needs may change different circumstances may arise and they would have to be dealt with within the strategic planning framework
erm if at some time in the future a local plan picked up a change in circumstances and made a UNK argument inn favour of varying from the strategic framework we would have to consider that on its merits
the elephant analogy arose because most of us all of us recognize an elephant when we see one but it is very difficult to describe it
and mr potter has gone some way to UNK that in saying that the circumstances may change
however if this UNK elephant arises bearing in mind the time the development planning process takes is it reasonable to think that the elephant would wait around long enough for that to happen
we i think we discussed this briefly earlier in terms of erm if a proposal came forward it was perfectly within the remit of the applicant to make a planning application and to argue that circumstances had changed
erm and there was nothing within the development plan system which would UNK this
mr heselton and then mr earle
thank you sir
terry heselton selby district
very briefly because i think that the senior inspector's partly er UNK answered i want to make
but erm apologies for going back to the to the discussion er yesterday but it it's merely just to remind you picking up the point that mr UNK just made that certainly as far as selby UNK concerned that circumstances have changed very UNK since the situation of ten years ago when the er the structure plan policies were first drawn up
er and this is why we ask for greater flexibility both in the allocation and in the wording of the policy
and that's why i think i can give my qualified support to the proposal for an exceptions policy
i think it it's clearly a problem for the panel to UNK with as to what response can the alteration make to changing circumstances particularly in relation to er to economic development
i know we've had that debate at length in connection with the housing issue but i would just like to leave you with that point again
thank you
mr earle
thank you chairman
patrick earle richmondshire
first of all i do have some sympathy with my colleagues from other districts who while not being in sympathy with the policy wouldn't want to be excluded if there's er certain development opportunities being thrown in
having said which er i i've already pointed out that i see no great potential for fifty hectares in our area
but going on i'd like to pick the point made er from the department of environment about the exceptions policy and the way they envisage it
because i mean are we talking about a policy that says these exceptions from other structure plan policies erm may be judged in this way
in other words would the individual applications still be regarded as a departure from the development plan
i that hasn't been made clear and erm you then end up with getting down to the UNK is this an application you advertise under the new procedures for ad advertising UNK from the development plan
bearing in mind that this is i suppose now going to be one of the performance indicators er that local authorities have got to er publish every year
er so in other words it UNK the water and it seems to me that it's quite UNK because it be suggesting a policy which is to UNK the effect of erm section fifty four a
in other words trying to restore the status quo er the status er that existed before section fifty four a er and UNK flexibility that was perceived to exist then
now it does occur to me to wonder and i again a personal view to wonder whether intended that section fifty four a should be UNK by the terms of the policies that followed it
do you want to answer that one mr UNK
i think the number of er ex i think the fact that this is merely an exception a major exceptions policy that deals only with exceptional cases and the humberside structure plan refers to possibly once or twice over a planned period erm might er indicate it's not intended to open to UNK section fifty four a
as for er as for UNK a strategic context in terms of a structure plan policy erm that allows for major exceptions will must surely assist in considering any application that comes forward as a as a departure under
chairman
david allenby harrogate
sorry mr allenby i mr earle was shaking his head there
sorry
er is that in UNK or disagreement
bit of both really chairman
er patrick earle richmondshire
with the greatest of respect the point wasn't really answered
er perhaps it is impossible to answer it in this forum but i think it remains an open question sir
chairman i was er UNK to answer it actually erm
my view is that erm
UNK your colleagues UNK go on
my view is that er those proposals would still stand to be considered as UNK to the structure plan
er what the policy does is to set out quite clearly i'm really looking at the humberside structure plan policy as an example as to how the material considerations would come into play in erm UNK if you like the UNK the other policies of the structure plan
and far from UNK the waters i think it makes clear that there are certain considerations that are acknowledged er which would allow certain proposals to come forward
rather than rather than having a sort of under the counter scenario where er material considerations you know will be considered when it when it's a separate planning application comes in there are there an UNK there is an acknowledgement or a framework which is in a formal local plan which identifies what the main considerations will be
thank you
professor lock do you want to pick up the points that have been made so we can move on
sir i i'm just not sure how you how you want to play this because you may feel i beginning to feel we're probably getting to the end of this circuit here
i thought i thought we'd given it a really good UNK this
yeah
afternoon and i was going to ask you to sort of sum up with your views as the sort of
i'm very willing to do
UNK of this er
if you're feeling the moment
particular animal and then ask mr williamson to or mr potter to conclude for the county
thank you i'm very happy to do that
david lock
the erm the discussion has been a great UNK
the erm what we've not erm what has not been er challenged is the argument that it is a good thing for north yorkshire and for the region and for the united kingdom and possibly for the european union that UNK inward investment sorry UNK investment of erm strategic importance should erm be capable of being attracted to this county
nobody seems to have challenged that building brick
so it's a it's a good thing to be able to attract inward investment of that quality and significance
there is a dispute erm between my report sir or what north yorkshire county council actually does and what the planning erm representatives here say they do
and er you've been given a document by the county and you'll take your own view on that
erm all i can say is the county council economic development people are there on the ground with their UNK and the cameras when UNK clarke comes in or the central science laboratory and the car people and so on of the moment
erm in planning terms i five that's where all these last two days string together i five does not enable this kind of inward investment to come
there are finding fifty hectares or thereabouts for a development of this kind and characteristic out of the UNK allocations on the one hand in their geography you know that has to be broadly speaking within the existing settlement pattern on the other not possible
so i five doesn't help us
e two if it was carried forward sir after this morning's discussion also doesn't help us because as the county made clear this morning and made very clear just a minute ago it would use such a policy it sees its position as being to block erm the er inward investment planning terms to block it as er erm being out of tune with the county's general conservation and environmental policies
so we really do have a problem here
we've got the local authorities at both strategic and local scale quite keen to welcome inward investment
we've got a an emerging altered structure plan here which as it stands doesn't help
and so the issue the discussion has focused on from where i'm sitting seems to have focused on is you know can one afford to let loose a strategic policy and could such a policy be written in a way that it would work for inward investment attraction without being a UNK horse as you know letting in a lot of other nasty things
now the erm major contribution has been from the department of environment who have pointed us at UNK
not only is that generally helpful in being a recently approved structure plan that's been through the secretary of state's hands but of course it is also part of this region
and it is the yorkshire and humberside development association that is the one that in this locality the county takes the lead in attracting inward investment
UNK it seems to me that if erm humberside erm finds a need for such a policy erm then the remainder of the yorkshire and humberside development association area erm should also have such a policy
so that association can actually employ erm the yorkshire and humberside area in an intelligent way and not in a divided way
i referred sir at the beginning to er the limited experience i've had in nottinghamshire where erm a criteria based policy was put into a structure plan erm for er in that case for a prestige business development i think is what they call it prestige business park that was a criteria based policy as a way of containing stopping this strategic issue becoming a UNK horse for lots of other things
and i pointed you sir to the fact that in that county at least they found that to further contain it helped to name districts
what i hadn't expected was the reaction we got here today which is that erm whilst there are smiling dis he's smiling now there are smiling districts who might be pleased to be named as areas in which a major exception might be accommodated and i hadn't expected the others would like a bit of it if there was one going too
so this all suggests to me that the establishment of fierce criteria could make this a very rare exception is the key and erm i think we've had it in the course of the discussion it'll now be on the record erm an exploration of the kind of criteria those could be
and erm you've got that harrogate goes into it in some detail
but erm my closing remarks we be these sir that the actual reality is that north yorkshire and some of its districts want and deserve inward investment
the present planning policy framework UNK that objective and an enabling policy framework is now required
a legitimate moment to put it in place
everything we've heard today this afternoon shows the UNK of the county planning department to be flexible and enabling on this matter
it is just not their UNK
and so it seems to me that erm we must look to you sir and miss UNK to say what you feel as er independent erm UNK to the debate er we it's time as i would say for erm north yorkshire now to face up to what's going on in its own territory and remove the planning UNK to what is actually happening and just to make sure that it's safely tied up with criteria to make sure it doesn't erm unhappy consequences instead of the happy consequences that we are trying to achieve
thank you
thank you
mr williamson or mr potter the UNK word
thank you
turn to mr potter i think he's been dying to get back on this so
i wouldn't quite say that
this is the UNK to the summing up
erm david potter north yorkshire county council
er the position of the county council is that we remain UNK of a need for such a policy
er the county council UNK that inward investment is important but because of the nature of the local economy and competition elsewhere i think we UNK look at it in terms of er it going to provide a small contribution to the local economy
and that's acknowledged by the economic development officer
and i would add that the economic development officer also UNK that he must work within the strategic framework which is the policy of the county council
and the county council feels that it has adequately addressed the needs of the districts within the county erm obviously that's up to the panel to determine whether you agree with that and we believe that the strategic framework is capable of addressing any changing needs or circumstances without UNK to a policy which we feel would reduce the clarity of the structure plan
that it
that's it
thank you very much
well i can draw the e i p to a close sorry
why
do we
mr donson yes oh that's right we posed a question to you on the elephant analogy
what is the equivalent on affordable housing
i thinking about it over erm er coffee sir i think the answer is an UNK erm because its smaller than an elephant it's UNK to the united kingdom it UNK into the landscape but if you ignore it could be just as UNK to your health
excellent
well with that i think i can draw the e i p to a close
can i say it it's er we've had a good day from my point of view anyway
erm some days have been better than others but i have in UNK enjoyed it UNK though it is
er and from our point of view er erm the panel erm this is only the end of the beginning for us because we've got a lot of other work to do
er but certainly we are grateful for your participation erm some very good contributions
i'm also particularly grateful for and i said yesterday to our two friends in the right hand corner here who've er done some sterling work
i'm grateful to north yorkshire and through you to the UNK people for the arrangements and the use of the village hall and i think i must commend mr UNK for his UNK through the last week or so
because even if he wasn't participating he was sitting listening
thank you very much
chairman before you do finally er pack your bag and UNK off back to wherever it is you're going could i on behalf of the county council and all of our participants here today and those who've been around in the last fortnight thank you and miss UNK and your assistant able assistants er mrs UNK and dave in the programme office for the sterling work they've done
and for making the e i p erm an interesting and er fortnight and i think er UNK on the way that you er and your colleagues have handled it er all the way through and er we hope that er at the end of the day we'll get something back from you fairly quickly which er we'll act upon
i won't promise
thank you very much chairman
i shan't promise before christmas
erm a number of issues will come through in a moment or two but first of all can we start this morning's business by calling on the chair of the standing orders committee john to give report number three
john
thank you
standing orders committee report number three
settle down colleagues please
president congress
i wish to move a short report on behalf of standing orders committee
london region have withdrawn motion fifty two due for debate on wednesday afternoon
northern region have withdrawn motion eighty two due for debate on wednesday morning
the committee has accepted an emergency motion proposed redundancies at a b transport limited to be moved by midlands and east coast region as emergency motion number three
we would ask national officers to respect a time limit allowed for their reports
president congress i move this report
thanks very much indeed john
conference accept s o c report number three
agreed thanks very much
colleagues i'd just like to put one of er john's themes and that is that for the next couple of days we've got a hell of a lot of business to get through and er we've done quite well so far but er i would certainly be looking where possible colleagues for formally seconding er as often as possible if not all the time and i really appreciate your er your assistance in that regard because we have a great deal of business to get through in the next two days
we can do it you can do it i know that and er so if we all act with a bit of restraint we'll get through
the other point is i gave you an undertaking yesterday to come back to you on the UNK of the programme in respect of items that have fell of the agenda during the course of the week
now what i'm proposing to do is to issue a revised programme in respect of the afternoon session this afternoon which will take in some of the business that er has already fell off which would be at the end of the private session this afternoon so we'll try and get in er rule twenty regions in their manage and their management which will take in three motions thirty six thirty seven and forty and then we'll turn hopefully to the social security payments resolutions you'll remember that they fell off composite two eight three motions three seven nine three eight five and three eight six
er equally colleagues i intend to try and take er key national UNK report during the course of this morning
you'll recall that the key fell off the agenda as well earlier or should i say wasn't very painful
should i say the report fell off the agenda
so that's what that's the way i'm hoping that we can proceed as i say yes with your assistance and then if we can get through that business then equally tomorrow morning we'll be doing a similar thing we we'll issue another revised programme which will er take in some of the outstanding stuff that's fell off
yes
president congress denise south western region
as important as those motions are we have also missed some very important ones which i think should take priority
on page six of our agenda there are congress organization motions which clearly need to be discussed some time during this congress because they concern rule amendments and if they do fall off the agenda because debate is long on the other things i really do believe they should take priority because we won't be raising them for another three years
there's also on page ten the motions regarding timing of congress which clearly concerns next year and i do believe that these should have priority
right i think you have missed the point or may not have understood how we deal with the business of this congress
nothing at this congress falls off the agenda nothing
unlike some union conferences some business is not taken but this conference all business is taken
all business is taken so that particular those particular items that you've referred to i am already seeking to schedule that business for tomorrow but i don't want to UNK the situation and chance my arm any further than what it is because i could end up falling on my face and i want to try and avoid that
but i could assure you colleagues that business will be taken okay
right thanks very much indeed for that colleagues
now it's now my pleasure to welcome on your behalf chris the secretary of portsmouth trades council
chris has been secretary for trades council for ten years he's a w e a tutor that's his er profession he's an organizer and he UNK courses throughout hampshire and the isle of UNK
more recently i understand that chris has had er had a very interesting made a very interesting study of the french trade union movement that must have been fascinating
erm difficult job difficult part of the world for the trade union movement
for his sins he's a member of e m e s a but we won't hold that against him
just a very warm welcome on behalf of the g m b please address our conference
thank you dick
actually the last time i was stood up on a platform and did this was in front of erm a s g t congress in UNK and i tell you i had to do it in french and it was much more difficult so i'm hoping this one will go UNK but i what i'd really like to do is begin with is offer you erm delegates and platform both a very warm welcome from the trade union movement in portsmouth
we're absolutely delighted that you're here in portsmouth for your congress and it's very important to us and i think perhaps i'd take a little bit of time to explain why it's important
the first thing is erm those of you that know this area will know that it's er not like the rest of hampshire er leaving aside southampton
it's an industrial city it's a working class city it's a city that has been very hard hit by recession
the unemployment level is twelve percent and rising
more UNK thirty percent of the jobs in this city are linked to the defence industry and we all know and i don't need to remind you what's happening to the defence industry here it's going down very fast we are losing jobs out the UNK but we're also losing the jobs that are associated with the m o d with the royal navy er and it's extremely worrying for the trade union movement in the city
it's also a very poor city in the sense that wages are low
the history of this is that for many years m o d were unhappy about expansion of the of the port er for commercial use and the reason they were unhappy of course was that erm commercial use was competition that they felt would be likely to drive up wages
at the time people felt they had secure jobs er in the m o d and the UNK and so people accepted that with pensions and everything that goes with that sort of secure job now of course the whole situation is enormously UNK different and i was saying to i have some french people staying with me this morning and i was they were asking me about wages and i was saying to my daughter who works er on a thursday evening in the local sainsburys UNK more per hour than a friend of mine well two friends of mine one of whom is a carpenter a fully qualified carpenter and the other is a motor UNK and that's an indication of the sort of level of wages that people are paid in this area
so we're particularly pleased that you're here for a slightly UNK reason actually because with a thousand delegates coming into the city it really does boost even for a week UNK the local economy and that's very UNK
the second reason that we're delighted to see you is that as a trades council we have been trying very hard over the last six or seven years to raise the profile of the trade union movement and this has been quite difficult in during the thatcher years during the anti trade union legislation the UNK by the media trade unions er the profile of trade unions has not been easy to raise
however we're beginning to make some progress and we're making some progress for a number of reasons
first of all i think we have worked out the importance of establishing a very good relationship with the media and that's developing and that means that the views of the trade union movement are beginning to be heard er when we when we spoke to the editor of the local paper for example we pointed out that on the business page there's nothing about trade unions and did he think that business er existed without er on just on one side
didn't he recognize that trade the trade union movement had a role to play er in that in on that page and to the to the credit of the local press they had responded and so we are now asked to put forward the views of the trade union movement something i think which local trades councils should be doing should be the role of local trades councils to do that effectively
we've also looked at the needs of our local community our local trade union movement and one of the things that we're extremely concerned about is health and safety
er i mean that's not just here it's everywhere but one of the things that is very clear is that people often do not have access to the sort of information that they need about UNK
and so we are in the process of setting up an online database UNK which would be accessible by not just branches but individual erm health and safety reps for a fairly minimal affiliation which will tap into the latest information which will be updated er every three months and we feel that again that's something in conjunction with clearly with the unions in the city something that a trades council should be doing something that raises our profile explains to people what trade councils what the trade union movement is all about and does it effectively using modern techniques and modern methods
we're also now that we have er erm the council's actually hung but now we have the labour group largely in control of the direction of what's happening in the city er we've been able to raise some issues that were extremely difficult to raise under the previous tory administration
one of the things that concerns us is provision for people who are unemployed and we are we are speaking and working speaking to and working with the labour group and the labour party on establishing a centre for people who are unemployed
particularly i think to the to not to provide something that they encounter elsewhere the UNK they have to go through in order to get benefit the UNK programme we're not interested in that we're interested in solidarity support UNK confidence keep keeping unemployed people in contract with the local trade union movement and that that's something that i personally regard as extremely important and something that erm with this partnership of the labour party the labour group and the trades council and the trade unions in the area i think we do very effectively
so we believe that unions should be effective should be active trades councils should be effective should be active should be using modern methods but without and i stress this without losing sight of our traditional concerns and values
now we're delighted to see you here because we know that the g m b shares this view and we know that you've also been in the forefront of introducing technology er and we know also that having you here er having your conference here helps us enormously to continue this process of raising the profile of the trades unions the trades council the labour movement in the city
the amount of press coverage that's been generated this week by your conference has been enormously important to the local trade unions it's something that we can build on it's something that says to the local press to the local media trade unions have got something to say trade unions have got something to put forward and it's that's something that we will come back to erm afterwards after you've gone we can use that we can build on it
the third reason why we're pleased to see you here is that erm as a trades council we've and this er and dick mentioned this in his introduction we've initiated a major international programme major in terms of our size obviously as er as a local body involving links between union activists here primarily in france er in northern france but also links now developing in spain with the new UNK going between portsmouth and UNK we're starting to meet with the unions in spain who are interested in speaking about the differences in wages in terms and conditions working for the same UNK company doing the same jobs in the port a comparative look at how the wages terms and conditions differ and we want to we want to go and visit them in the autumn and work out and work on more links on a sector basis so that our colleagues down in UNK in northern spain can link up with people in the in the in similar sectors here and we've done this over the last three and a half years with the unions in france we've had UNK of all sectors the public sectors transport erm health social services shop workers
it's been enormously successful because we've done it on an activist basis so that activists have met one another all those prejudices and all those UNK have immediately UNK as soon as people have stayed in one another 's homes and realized that people have the same problems they have the same they have the same problems and the same difficulty er as difficulties as we do
maybe their UNK organized differently but fundamentally the problems are the same and that's given our people the confidence that they needed because they've been able to see that people everywhere it's not just them isolated in you know tory britain who are facing these particular difficulties but issues of privatization for example as the same in france and actually about to get much worse er but and i think that helped erm our colleagues from france who've also got a perspective on their UNK and their battles we've been able to support one another with information about companies working multi national companies working on both sides of the channel
one example er a couple of examples erm we've worked together with the unions in UNK in northern france who bought swan UNK er which is where the g m b is erm is highly organized and er in those er meetings between the unions in UNK and swan we've been able to see the UNK between the conditions and the wages and be able to speak about ways in which people can go back to their to their er workplace and work on that with that knowledge
er we've done the same for UNK trucks in northern france and in UNK brought the unions together simply through the contacts that we've made here in portsmouth
erm so we are particularly pleased to have you here because we know as well that the g m b is in the forefront of erm establishing activity within europe one of one of the few unions i think is that the only unions will have an office open in brussels
er something that is UNK to me that the other unions don't do it because i believe it's gonna be enormously important to our trade union movement
so our international work has er been important to us and we are pleased to s to see you here to raise that profile as well
erm so finally i should say that above all we are very pleased to see you we're delighted to have you here
erm we hope that you will come back soon because for all the reasons i've outlined it's tremendously important to us and it's nice to have a body of a big large body of trade unions in the city in terms of our feelings as local trade unions as well
erm i the UNK the UNK flashing erm
i thought for one hopeful minute you were gonna wind up then
i am gonna wind up i'm just gonna say if anybody wants some information about our database which is open to anybody in the country i've left some leaflets there erm i've been asked to plug trade union news which has been important to us too so i have erm and i finally i'd say thank you very much for inviting me to come and speak to you
chris thanks very much indeed for that very UNK and welcoming address
i'd like to present on behalf of congress to you a banner bright by john and also a UNK suitably UNK
colleagues er back to the agenda national officers report duncan
president congress duncan national office
at last year's congress i outlined the UNK effect that the recession was having on the engineering UNK and aerospace industries
i recall the catalogue of redundancies that have been declared in nineteen ninety one nineteen ninety two
unfortunately that story continues and ninety two ninety three is seeing even more of our colleagues made redundant not in hundreds but in thousands
engineering employment in the first half of nineteen ninety three is estimated to be a hundred and twenty thousand fewer than twelve months earlier and it is forecast to fall another forty five thousand in the next twelve months
two years ago norman UNK gave the UNK conservative view on unemployment
he told mps rising unemployment of the recession have been the price we have had to pay to get inflation down
that price is well worth paying
figures alone colleagues cannot show the misery of redundancy and unemployment people who have been made redundant are thirty times to more likely to commit suicide than those in work and time ten times more likely to be seriously ill
mounting debt problems and the possibility of losing their homes all that's stress to the redundant workers
is that the price worth paying
a long term coherent policy for industry is needed
what agreed by government management and trade unions a policy which UNK industry not leaves it to the market forces
the collapse of the dutch parent company of UNK left thousands of jobs in UNK whilst the UNK dutch governments took immediate action to try to ensure the survival of plants in their countries our government sat back and waited to see if another chunk of british manufacturing would disappear
the g m b and apex partnership shop UNK stewards and representatives of UNK played a magnificent part UNK jobs whilst at the same time looking after the needs of those thrown on the scrap heap through no fault of their own
i now turn to the most UNK act of the government in nineteen ninety two
in order to achieve its UNK of UNK the coal industry it UNK with british coal to close thirty one pits
no consideration was given to what would happen to those working in the industry their families or communities
what the government did not bargain for was the public UNK and the massive support given to the demonstrations
the high court ruled the closure plan unlawful and UNK and the employment select committee UNK the government's actions unacceptable
heseltine promised to call review which was delayed until it could persuade sufficient tory members to vote for it
under the review twelve of the thirty one pits are to remain in production but for how long without a market for coal being expanded
to pay for the pits the government told british coal not to pay four hundred and eighty one million that it owed to the UNK superannuation fund
not only has this government got no policies for industries it has no UNK either
equally the management of british coal once again have not honoured their undertakings they promised me that once they had considered the UNK report into the reorganization they would consult with us
i learned of their decision colleagues last night on television when the chairman announced at the u d m conference who are not involved in this issue at all that three thousand redundancies of management and clerical staff were going to be made
when will the government and british coal learn the basic principles of industrial relations and understand they are dealing with people not machinery
the next three months will be crucial within the industry
there will be the closures and UNK of pits there will be a reduction of apex jobs under the reorganization now taking place and steps towards privatization will begin
colleagues the government's UNK in tackling the crisis in industry UNK from the fact that it has convinced itself if not the general public that there is no problem
this must be UNK
i commend my report
thank you very much duncan
page forty one forty two forty three forty four forty five yes
president congress
mike midlands and east coast region
duncan two things
first a note of caution on your report on aerospace
you mentioned the UNK deal has been announced but so far it's only for the tornado and not the full go ahead to
excuse me
also there's been no announcement so far on the UNK trainer which involves most of the four and a half thousand at as many more in british aerospace and other companies
secondly for your efforts in putting for the recent joint delegates conference on the out UNK and that's a company's way and not mine
of the information and technology department by british aerospace and that thanks is not used from apex it's also from m s at or acknowledged it was your efforts and not their that brought that conference about
this out UNK could put the software technology for the defence of the country into the hands of a foreign controlled company and it could cost another two thousand british aerospace jobs
thank you duncan
forty six forty seven yes
president congress ron yorkshire and north derbyshire at the moment as far as i'm aware still employed by british coal
duncan salary and conditions claim i quote due to the UNK within the industry at the time of UNK this report we have not as yet presented a claim
duncan we have now gone seven months without presenting a claim during which time our members have continued to work hard for the corporation
we are doing our jobs it is not our fault that the board members and the government cannot do theirs but as usual it is always the workforce who are suffering
don't let us lost a year if we let them use UNK in the industry as an excuse for not meeting us we will never sit round a table with them again
we are going to be asking our members to pay a further ten pence a week to maintain front line services but they feel they are not getting any
simply duncan when are we going to get in there and negotiate before we start losing membership for reasons other than redundancy
thank you
and forty eight

president congress ed westminster trade union and political UNK branch for the london region
congress i think it's only right to draw to your attention that in item five b UNK that at the last UNK conference there was a motion passed saying that there should be recognition for the independent trade union within UNK which is ourselves g m b apex
however since that time there has been no recognition granted by UNK the main reason for which is the general secretary who allegedly had said that because his organization is not a profit making organization there is no reason to have a trade union there
now these are the kind of people we have to deal with and i know duncan has a problem in UNK there's gerry the UNK for the london region
i think that conference should know this is the kind of employer that even the trade union political UNK have to deal with
president as far as UNK concerned yes you're quite right mick my report says about the UNK deal
some of that deal has been produced as far as the UNK concerned but again you're quite right we're waiting for the announcement of the er orders for the trains
er as far as out UNK is concerned when we learned that there could be two thousand jobs lost or out UNK from british aerospace it was my opinion in line with those of our representatives that we ought to UNK a meeting immediately of all shop stewards and representatives who would be covered er through those discussions and arrange and organize a strategy to oppose it
this i'm pleased to say is being done a meeting has been arranged with british aerospace it should have taken place on monday er mike was UNK me at that meeting and i'm waiting to see what the outcome of that meeting is
ron as far as the UNK claim is concerned you will be aware that i have written to all regions explaining the reason why we have not presented a claim no other union has presented a claim in british coal and if we do present a claim at this point in time i'll tell you what the answer will be
that answer will be that we they th british coal will not give an increase this year
i have said consistently we don't want to be the first in the industry i would rather UNK either n a c o t n a c o m or the u d m seeing what they the outcome is there as we have traditionally done and then take it from there where you must agree that we have usually improved on their offer when it's been made
as far as UNK concerned yes we've still got the problem with UNK ed gerry has worked UNK on that UNK er problem er to try to get recognition for our members
i am aware he has met on a number of occasions with our members and he was UNK in selecting a team which met with the general secretary of UNK who said that they had a er a er reasonable meeting with him
we're now hoping to get a resolution to that problem
we need to recruit more members within UNK but i'll give you one guarantee it's one battle within the trade union movement that we must win
thank you
thanks very much indeed duncan
colleagues we now move into the jobs and recovery debates in which we'll be taking composite eight motion two seven eight motion two seven nine composite ten motion two eight three and the emergency motion number two pit review and closures to move by the midland and east coast region
so if the mover of composite eight would come down and standing in the of the northern region to be seconded by lancashire but as we're now formally seconding the er the formally UNK will not be required to come down to the front but the UNK will
mr president congress john northern region seconding composite eight
despite the promises of tory ministers during the nineteen ninety two election campaign the past twelve months witnessed even further decline in our manufacturing industry
as britain falls into its UNK recession over fifty years the since the recession began in nineteen ninety the number of employees in industry has fallen by one million five hundred and fifty one thousand with a further three hundred and sixty two thousand self employed forced into UNK
sixty five thousand training jobs cut making a grand total one million nine hundred and seventy eight thousand jobs lost
most shocking of all colleagues over eight hundred and fifty thousand of those job losses have come from our already UNK manufacturing base
today in britain manufacturing the well created section of our economy accounts for just over four million employees from a u k total of twenty five million
against such a background mr president is it any wonder that our nation faces enormous social problems
is it any wonder that crime homelessness and deprivation rises or that health and education standards fall
colleagues the greatest single challenge that conference is a task of UNK our once proud manufacturing industry
we need to direct and target investment into training into research and development and into our regions
we need to challenge the ideology which claims the market knows best despite claims that we are coming out of recession we are still losing thousands of jobs because as we know all too well the market will always neglect our UNK long term interest for the short term profits of UNK and asset UNK
congress the g m b as a union founded and built around working people as a duty an obligation to accept that challenge and to lead that campaign
i urge you to support this motion and to put the great back into britain
thank you
formally seconded
thanks very much indeed
motion two seven eight social UNK london region to move
president congress and all the teams at this congress
michael london region moving resolution two seven eight social UNK
colleagues as the resolution says and as we all know we've all experienced it the last fourteen years have been a catalogue of disaster after disaster for all sections of the society and especially the disadvantaged those the young the elderly the disabled and the unemployed all been attacked
there has been no area there's been no need or entitlement that has escaped the thatcher and the UNK acts
one of the difficulties that results from these cuts and that tax has been that there had been so numerous that it can't keep count of how many times they'd changed the goal posts how many times they imposed cuts but you know a lot of the government's ideas are that it's money but it's not all financial it's been physical and mental
remember the cuts in the people's rights at industrial UNK that have had a profound effect on employment rights the attack on local democracy rate capping the cuts of tax on local government have had a UNK effect on housing and the social fabric of local community
what's the new thing that the government's brought out care in the community what's it supposed to be freedom to do what you want and what's happened
my own experience my own area we have harry he had cancer hospital no family he had a home carer for two hours a day he lasted two days and died
nay and i call that an injustice
you get ann UNK they had to get the UNK off the gas fire because she kept turning it on and off without it being lit again found wandering in her UNK injustice and then we found UNK who was in an upstairs room yes she enjoyed that life for about five years great council house then she had an accident and then because she couldn't re house her she was a UNK prisoner inside her own home that she'd made up
is that a social justice
it's a social injustice
colleagues as i've already said the list is endless er but we would like to draw up and prefer in conjunction with the t u c and the labour party at least of these major cuts and their effects restrictions in the tax introduced by this tory government including benefit cuts in pensions housing legal and employment rights which should be published so these might UNK
president i move two seven eight
formally seconded
formally seconded
you have formally seconded it over there
i thought i'd come and see you president congress keith london region seconding motion two seven eight
social injustice is brought on by an economic policy UNK by the tories and their
it is our duty the g m b to stop the decline in social injustice and its damage to the u k
there have been many attacks on our society the trade used by taking our finances and yet by their economic mistakes and UNK we the ordinary working people pick up the bill
they may have sacked the chancellor but they're still committed to capitalism and economic policy which is UNK opposed to any form of such a justice
so as hey the need for our welfare state good health service education social housing and all the rest
the labour trade union movement to meet the needs and that's of our people
congress pick up your UNK and look at page seven clause nine rule two
it's all there to promote or support legislation especially in connection with the legal rights of trade unions industrial health safety and welfare and social economic and social welfare
congress need for this motion
this is already happening
it's for our people
i second
motion two seven nine london region to move
mr president
brian before you start no laughing this time i couldn't stand it again
honestly
i've been on tablets all night
alright
brian london region moving motion two seven nine
mr president other honoured guests
this motion UNK rise in unemployment caused by the incompetent handling of the tory government's economic policies and i ask for support of the t u c campaigns for the unemployed but i would beg really that when we do campaign the t u c gives us more than two days to notify us of UNK and meetings
like other unions we suffer from the severe loss of members due to unemployment and we are UNK at the UNK of family life when the UNK been UNK cast on the scrap heap and the behaviour of the government it throws whole communities into UNK without a chance of any hope for the future and their children
mining communities the dock areas liverpool all these people the only crime the only crime they've ever committed is to stand up for their rights
the unemployed are having their links with hope destroyed with the closure of some c a bs due to government and local government cuts
unemployed centres are UNK and closed so the only hope left is us the trade union movement
i know some regions send messages out to their members who've just lost their jobs expressing hope that they desire please stay with us we can help ya
this we must do we've gotta help our unemployed members because some of those who are unemployed have been some of our best fighters and they're still in there fighting despite the fact they haven't their jobs
we've gotta support these colleagues
we must contact these people we must build back the confidence to the unemployed we've given these people who are unemployed our good training we need their expertise to come back and fight again if we're gonna have any hope for the future
hopefully we can if we can retain some membership then obviously hopefully we can put some money to return to these unemployed centres and give the government what it needs a good kick up the UNK
do i get me UNK now
i move
brian have a UNK tea
two seven nine formally seconded
thanks very much indeed
composite motion ten unemployment and work for lancashire region to move
yeah no if you if you're supporting it colleague we've not been taking support in all week and indeed i know how important it is and we'll pardon
no if it's thirty seconds for you it's thirty seconds off somebody else colleague
i'm sorry
the only exception was yesterday in the debate on the toxic syndrome that was the only exception i do apologize
mandy
amanda lancashire region proposing motion unemployment and benefits it's been UNK
congress president this motion is calling for an economic policy that UNK mass unemployment
that is probably an impossible dream as far as this present government is concerned
this evil and UNK tory government are responsible for destroying millions of jobs as a conscious policy and continue to pursue the toll with further UNK tactics like v a t on fuel
the government policy for creating jobs is to re introduce UNK working for benefits no pay britain
this policy is back in the desk UNK at the moment but it is clearly going to be placed back on the table since the government is even considering charging thirty pound a night for n h s beds
UNK is about doing away with jobs employers will want to substitute UNK for real jobs reducing still further the number of people in work increasing still further the poverty and misery suffered by millions in britain today
the government does not encourage investment in industry even in training the workforce or providing a long term investment bank
the government fails to support industries that are of strategic importance to the economy like mining and ship building no support for laying yet when it comes to the arthur UNK the unscrupulous employers the get rich quick merchants it UNK up the cash
it proposes to provide these UNK with subsidies in the form of free labour
how long will how low will this UNK government UNK
i move
thanks mandy
formally seconded
thanks very much
motion two eight three UNK london region to move
president congress roy moving motion two eight three UNK
the word UNK is a term we have imported from america the america where if you are unemployed homeless you're a UNK a drop out a no good something less than human
therefore if they the unemployed want help from the state they must pay back from that state with some form of work because you can't have something for nothing not in a capitalist market economy
it will undermine the work UNK
i say that philosophy is rubbish or to use the language of the shop floor it's a load of bull
unemployment is not the fault of the individual worker he she is the victim not the blame
in britain in nineteen ninety three we are hanging on to the remains of our welfare state by our UNK
it is being attacked daily by that real group of UNK the tory party the tories will no doubt bring in UNK just as soon as they've UNK up the wider public with their UNK friends in the media
the tabloid press will publish stories of dole UNK laying in bed all day living the life of UNK on the dole blaming the unemployed and making them feel guilty for a desperate plight
colleagues the types of work that will be offered in an ac to the unemployed will be community work clearing rubbish from sites cleaning public buildings and open spaces
jobs which should be done by full time workers paid at proper rates of pay real jobs to put back dignity into the lives of such so many of the unemployed
if you really want a market economy to work then you pay workers decent rates of pay for their UNK
yet we find our leading members of the labour party accepting the argument for some form of UNK
there is a strong moral argument within the labour movement that UNK and other half baked schemes which do not give a fair day's work for a real fair day's pay
we want real jobs for real money
this union along with the labour party should have no with the philosophy of UNK it once and once and for all reject this philosophy and send it back to the bad old days of UNK parish UNK the real victorian values
colleagues reject the ideas of UNK make sure the ideas are not adopted by the labour party
two eight three formally seconded
thanks very much
emergency motion number two midland and east coast region
linda midlands and east coast region
emergency motion number two pit review on closures
president congress i first pay tribute to the women against pit closure group for their UNK determination and yes sheer UNK
they stood up to be counted to save their men's jobs their community and their UNK and i UNK their courage and wish them well in their pit UNK
congress this call review was a whitewash the tories UNK the strength of public feeling against the pit closure programme
in fact the proposed mass redundancy in and around the mining industry was probably the straw that broke the UNK back for the british people
i've never seen the president of the d t i look so UNK and frightened for his own future
did he perhaps realize maybe he's been set up as well
the was once described this country as a lump of coal surrounded by fish which highlighted our two great natural assets to which oil and natural gas has been added
we have an energy rich country and a massive trading balance so why the hell are we UNK electricity from france which i believe attracts the nuclear and UNK coal from dubious sources and i have been told that some of that coal has been extracted by women and children often in UNK unsafe conditions
we are now going ahead in burning of our UNK natural gas resources like there is no tomorrow
congress i'm not an UNK but none of this makes sense to me relying on heavily subsidized coal UNK leaves us wide open to be UNK
when we shut our pits the price of these coal UNK will go up a pit closure brings massive hardship in the surrounding communities
redundancy payments go towards paying off house mortgages but these miners can't then sell up and move
little industrial units employing a handful of people working for UNK is not the answer to mass redundancies anywhere
there is a personal concern in all this for me i ain't a miner but i do work and represent g m b and apex members working directly for british coal
we manufacture the UNK belts that carry the lads to the face and bring the coal out
between six and ten years ago there was a hundred and eighty pits in this country yes a hundred and eighty pits now we have a handful left and it has been UNK that all thirty one pits will still be closed within twelve months done quietly and by the back door ignoring procedures and over the years this is what has been done
arthur UNK love him or UNK him has been telling us but nobody UNK
well we know that in our company by the jobs lost we know that in the midland region because it could be a loss of up to ten percent of our membership six thousand members
i took over a hundred members to the rally in UNK park erm two thirds of my workforce and it was magnificent to see all the trade unionists there especially the g m b UNK
some of my members were overwhelmed by the sheer numbers there and it brought a lump to my throat but that's what it's all about solidarity
now take note members of the press when the UNK the big UNK and the c b i start UNK there's panic on the tory benches
the coal review did nowt for them either
sadly mass closures and redundancies have become UNK it's no longer hitting the headlines just a few small columns in the paper so i ask you delegates go back to your branches raise the issue not just about coal but about all unemployment chase up the media write to your m p especially the tories support the UNK and maybe a petition from this conference could be organized but i say raise hell give them no peace one job loss is one too many and we ain't gonna accept redundancy in any of our sections without a bloody good fight
so let's take the gloves off now please support
well done linda
is emergency motion two formally seconded
thank you very much
i'll ask the general secretary to reply to the debate
john general secretary UNK to the debate on jobs and recovery
as you may have noticed other debates have attracted rather more publicity this week but the theme of our congress is jobs and recovery because jobs and recovery is the most important issue for our members and for britain
sometimes the UNK between the performance of this country and the performance of other countries UNK me
we're often told including by government ministers that we should follow the lead of japan to UNK their manufacturing methods and copy their working practices
so how did japan respond to the recession
the japanese government announced two spending packages UNK to over a hundred and ten billion pounds
public works programmes new transport investment house building investment and industry
UNK economic package reads like a resolution to a trade union conference
so does kenneth clarke copy this example
does he hell
he says the most important problem in the british economy is public borrowing and that britain will make cuts in public spending
the analysis is crazy the reason why we have a public deficit is because three million people and more are out of work and paying no tax
the best way to cut public borrowing is not to cut public investment but to cut unemployment
i trust that will be the simple and single point which will be pressed very hard by the labour party in the economic debate in parliament this afternoon
the one certain thing is that UNK has no place in the economic policy of a UNK country
that's why we urge you to support composite ten and motion two eight three
although i have to say that the implication in two eight three that labour is UNK with UNK is UNK we've said some harsh things about the party this week but there is no possibility that i know of the labour party supporting any form of UNK whatsoever
motion two seven nine makes very sensible proposals about how we might support unemployed members
we would like to examine those ideas in more detail and i hope that london will agree to refer so that the examination can take place
so support composite eight composite ten motion two seven eight and motion two eight three with that qualification emergency motion number two and let's campaign for any effective policy for jobs and recovery and not this nonsense that is served up every week from this silly government
that's my response on behalf of the c e c
thanks very much indeed john i propose to take the vote
composite eight has been accepted
all those in favour

that's carried
motion two seven eight has been accepted

that's carried
motion two eight three has been accepted
all those in favour

that's carried
and the emergency motion number two is being accepted
all those in favour

that's carried
conference linda in moving emergency motion number two referred to pit closures as a disaster but there are certainly even greater disasters of pit closures and in nineteen fifty one forty two years ago there was a disaster at UNK colliery where eighty one pit men lost their lives
more recently local trade unionists and many of the members of our organization in UNK decided that to UNK the occasion they would work to get a new trade union banner for the UNK trade union council and that's the example and that's the reward of their particular work a magnificent tribute to those pit men that died eighty one years ago er forty two years ago
to mark the occasion doctor david UNK the very reverend bishop of durham blessed the banner
the church and UNK and radical thought don't always go hand in hand
david as some colleagues will know is a member of the house of lords and there isn't much radical thought in the house of lords
during this particular week we've had a number of speakers guest speakers at the rostrum and there'll be others that will follow the reverend UNK to the rostrum but the working people of durham and trade unionists and the miners in particular have very good cause to thank the reverend david UNK
during the miners strike you will recall he was tremendously supportive and UNK and is still UNK against this government's attack on working people
the people of durham as i say are very fortunate indeed
amongst all the speakers we've had here this week i don't think that there's any of them more supportive to the trade union movement than the very reverend david UNK
he's certainly amongst friends this morning we're his friends and we ask him to address conference
thank you very much david
thank you very much mr president and as you've been friendly enough to invite me and given me such a friendly welcome i thought i ought to risk speaking to you as UNK as i can about what is going on in our country and our communities at the moment and whether by the end of the thing i continue your friend is another matter
in my part of the world which is north east england and especially county durham nobody much really believes all this talk about an industrial and economic recovery which will be so strong and so widespread that most people will be back in the sort of jobs they used to have providing they get the necessary training
in our part of the world we keep up the brave talk for the sake of the image of the region so that there may be at least some inward investment and so that those UNK small business training centres local enterprises and UNK which are struggling so hard to make a go of it will not be UNK from at least having a go but there isn't much hope and conviction really
for one thing the region is faced with a UNK example of great in er investments of human resources skill and modern technology being simply thrown aside as at swan hunter and in our coal mines
for another thing the region is one of the edge of things if i may so put it and that's why i'm down here i mean as i know when we're up there we're at the centre of things but lots of people don't
it's all these odd ideas that go around in the UNK south that's the trouble
but there it is and outside and foreign firms will put money in especially if subsidized by temporary government measures for as you know public investment in private industry is judged to be UNK correct while public investment for public and community concerns is judged UNK to be harmful but the firms are interested in making money out of the region if i may so put it not in UNK world promotion and healthy living in the region
one shift in the market and investment is withdrawn firms close production is transferred so it's UNK
for another thing the most profitable processes today simply do not need large amounts of labour and is it seriously expected by the government that as long as we avoid being tied down by the social chapter we shall become such a UNK of cheap labour that we shall become cheaper and more UNK than the labour force in the third world
is that the way we are to become competitive again
so i have to ask has anyone and i underline anyone who talks about economic policies UNK and jobs yet begun to face up to the way everything depends on growth as before and even more growth than before
yet we are in a very UNK situation with regard to growth
a small example of this which we are UNK living within the north east is the following
when our locals assessed success story the nissan plant sells less cars it's an economic threat and could become an economic disaster when the plant sells more cars it adds to the increase in number of cars on the roads which represents a pollution threat and UNK to a pollution disaster let alone traffic problems of course
it's as well to laugh and i'm especially able to encourage you because i being a christian know you know that sin won't have UNK over you so that you needn't be solemn about it
but it is serious
and you see this contradiction is there despite the fact that the factory and the company are actively concerned in UNK pollution
they are responsible about their productive processes and they are responsible about the design of car engines and we are told that the market will find ways to deal with this but surely it cannot for after all the market is UNK so it cannot take into account either the future or the needs and wishes of people other than those who have the purchasing power for immediate consumption
so well before we get on to any issues to do with the structural poverty of the third world maintained by the wealth UNK efforts and arrangements of our western world we can surely see why quite a few people do not really believe in recovery through economic growth and consumption and we need to ask whether we ought to want it anyway but people in the tory party and in the labour party in the city with a capital c and the trade unions with a capital t and a u go on talking as if our goal must be jobs and recovery in the same old way UNK and UNK of course with strong UNK of management UNK and so on
but in no way basically changed
are we never going to use our various collective skills institutions and organizations as well as our particular UNK and UNK to face up to this false UNK false UNK we are trying to live by
now i put it to you that it is obvious that we all know and suspect it is a false UNK and that the sort of recovery it implies is just not on
our behaviour shows it although our talk discussion and our political agendas and conference agendas do not
look i'm afraid for example at yourselves there we go
all you are contributing to the political debate in this country at the present moment is a UNK about the trade union block vote in the affairs of the labour party
the press therefore has a field day the labour party is diverted and UNK and all the politicians have joined a family UNK on an alleged matter of vital principle but it is all to do with power within the party so we are entirely diverted from the questions we ought to face but cannot face up to
these are questions about what sort of growth in what sort of industry and commerce would actually be UNK in UNK ways not only in our own country but across the world but it is just too much of a challenge to face up to the question of how you get power to influence that
so we stick to arguing about power within i say a party and we do not get on about policies and programmes
mind you in the trade unions and in the labour party are no worse than anyone else
that's where christianity comes in again actually solidarity
we go on hoping and fighting and UNK despite whatever goes wrong with anybody but the tory party is UNK itself with internal UNK and in focusing attention on whether mr major will remain prime minister or not and this is presumably so that they may ignore the real issues of how to the get the country onto some shared basis of consensus trust and pragmatic politics which would give our society a chance of facing up to questions of economics politics pollution and living together in community in the sort of world we've actually got
now just in case you think i'm UNK into the role of a self righteous preacher who enjoys telling other people off about their sins so that he doesn't have to bother about his own
and i should warn you that once i was asked to go to a series of lectures in a certain cathedral on the seven deadly sins because the UNK who invited me said he wanted a married man who was good on lust
against it that is
i must add in all honesty and so we must face up to things that the churches at any rate in their public and visible life are in just the same state
in my own UNK we are UNK among ourselves with intense energy about whether women can be UNK about who is more catholic than their neighbour and about a whole host of internal issues because we apparently have neither the grace nor the UNK to face up to the real issues which are the business of the church in the current world
you know issues such as the credibility of god the resources available for UNK of hope and the help that is available from religious sources to overcome misery in our society prime in our neighbourhood and UNK and UNK all round
in our various parties organizations and institutions therefore we urgently need to recognize that most of our programmes not least the programmes of our conferences and UNK if i may leave you together in sin brothers and sisters
are most of the programmes are really to do i would say with displacement activities rather than replacement activities
that is to say we are we all need renewal and new ideas but we stick to old UNK and re run old battles because we don't know how to face up to the real problems at the present nor to find ways of working together for a worthwhile future
of course we cannot just get out of the UNK and UNK and problems we are already engaged in
it's important for instance to guard safety at work
you have to try and improve trading skills and efficiency and it is vital to maintain organized groups of women and men who are committed to fighting locally and at all levels for ordinary decent UNK and simple justice in the way people are treated of course but we have got also to find ways of getting together to face those problems no one knows how to solve
our future requires that we focus our images on finding ways forward to a possible UNK and UNK society instead of wasting our time UNK with our allies and colleagues
if we cannot even face the present of course we cannot build the future
let me therefore suggest three things i am clear we ought to bother about
pragmatic UNK collaborative democracy and local communities
that sounds splendid i'm sure when translated into management jargon but let but let me repeat it
pragmatic UNK collaborative democracy and local communities
my rule is when UNK on thin ice move fast so i shall get
pragmatic UNK
our present party system and the way it works in elections has passed from being nearly useless to being pretty dangerous
it is obvious that the government doesn't know how to respond to the UNK it has partly created and partly suffers from
yet no one stops it or UNK it to change its mind
we have already had reference this morning to the UNK against the handling of the mine closures and it was immense the case was made by the parliamentary success er select committee for some serious thinking about energy policy for the future yet the government did not think again the political debate was at the level of whether mr heseltine would remain in power and nothing was changed
there was in other words an immense amount of political activity with absolutely no result and the details of that already has been referred to in moving energy both erm in emergency number two so i can make need make no reference more reference to it but we have left ourselves surely totally dependent in a short future from outside the country on our energy
where shall we go then
what is that to do with investing in enterprise
again whatever the problems about education they are clearly great
how can you develop schools for children and UNK for developing intellectual social and personal schools skills in UNK with parents teachers and pupils if those in power neither consult nor trust nor show any signs of UNK the opinions of those persons most UNK involved
yet the plans go ahead UNK and so on
there seems no UNK in our government to listen and learn for argument no capacity for trust and no ability to face the facts which include the vital issues morale and motivation ways of running things which you simply can't put down to cost accountants but which is absolutely essential to do with solidarity and caring and so on to make things actually work and as for economics whenever UNK economy from the germans upwards or downwards so to speak is in trouble the future is clearly frightening isn't it
but the political UNK continues the labour party and the unions UNK and the notion of UNK is constantly UNK
now i would say how stupid can we get
have we become so depressed about any real prospect of UNK that we've decided to enjoy our chains UNK dwelling on our UNK and UNK
is it beyond the wit UNK and grace of ordinary men and women to re UNK in UNK on the basis of fresh thinking
across parties across UNK and fixed ideas to UNK for a real change which surely must come
the task for collaborative UNK is clear firstly get rid of the tory government
i think they would be relieved
they obviously need a rest
and further and this is not meant to be a joke in my own experience if they get time to think quietly and UNK i believe a whole lot of decent conservatives who used to think UNK and with respect for local communities would emerge to contribute to a UNK for the future over against the ideological block that seems to think we use people to make money instead of making money to serve people and their communities
now UNK which changed the face of party politics would stimulate fresh approaches to our problems
it is surely obvious that we cannot go on as we are as we UNK the world and as poverty increases along with violence vandalism and random destruction more of it at UNK last night apparently
we have immense UNK and communication resources
if we had to think and had to think together we would surely find ways forward
we could be aiming our political UNK towards facing the real issues
we could stop pretending that some of us have solutions which are vastly and obviously superior to others when we all know really that our solutions are not good enough and in this way you would come together in creative activity instead of UNK into ever more UNK and destructive activities which are technically called displacement from one another
a lot to learn from animals including the fact that animals can't actually be UNK
that wasn't in the text of course
so seeking pragmatic UNK needs to be combined with a new commitment to collaborative democracy
UNK government whitehall as the founder of all regulation and one party in UNK power is an obvious recipe for incompetence even more than it is for UNK although bureaucratic UNK and arrogant assumptions of having no need to listen do produce threats of UNK
we need to restore a whole range of intermediate institutions unions come in here as do professional organizations healthy local democratic government and voluntary and charitable bodies not to mention the churches
such bodies are needed to break up UNK power to encourage participation and restore morale to ordinary people by convincing them that they do count that they are listened to and that they can participate
in short UNK ordinary people as part of the we who run things rather than the them for UNK to be regulated managed i fear even UNK and certainly simply left out and the chief place to focus our search for pragmatic UNK and cooperative democracy must be in our local communities
that is where people live and that is where we must support one another in UNK the present while we imagine better things fight for better things and gradually achieve better things
i am personally impressed and encouraged by what is going on in some of the hardest hit areas in my part of the world and by a series of what you might call chance accident we've actually got a sign on it on the platform here
were you to turn over that banner which is i think UNK designed you would find the other side is entirely about international connections between workers and various groups and so on so it's got the international the wider version and i'm delighted to know that you have here you i understand that the g m b is perhaps the only body which has the nearest thing to a formal alliance with the trade union in germany i mean this is tremendous
this is where the future lies however you have to deal with the particular problems of maastricht and all the rest and on this side and it really was very moving that in a way by chance but you know again i believe i think sometimes god is in you better of course
when i went to what was in effect not merely the memorial of the fifty UNK after fifty two years of the people but of course really the funeral service of the pit and when i went to that here was the chance to UNK that also we did it actually at the memorial garden where all the pit people are buried and that is right you see picking up out of the past not sticking in the past and arranging it as you might say as in that banner to move on into the future
so i was very moved to find that this has arrived and i don't think it's UNK nonsense i think it is related to the business of getting people together locally
people are realizing that you just cannot expect much of them and that one way of improving local lives is to get together in local communities and groups and participating wider area networks and in such UNK of people th they manage to keep some sort of community spirit and activity going
they find new ways of sharing what resources there are whether UNK in local policing or working with health authorities or whatever it is and i think they form the base for renewal of politics because we have to UNK politics for UNK upwards and here just finally UNK my arm i must just frankly say that i am not clear that over large UNK of unions will be much more helpful than over UNK government UNK
one of the advantages of not knowing too much about things is that you can keep sacred cows in the without UNK
of course we have the additional UNK that the over large government UNK at present run by a political party which seems to have given up thinking about anything much other than staying in power and i know and hope that you will be part of thinking about much more than that but still even with a large union you could regulate concentrate on UNK the grass roots and then on building upwards
anyway i was asked by the UNK to contribute to the debate on jobs recovery and communities
i have done my best
i hope it does not encourage you to do your worst
but rather to join in the search for new ways forward for the common future of our society and i suggest you might do worse than try a few committees and working groups on pragmatic UNK collaborative democracy and local community
thank you
thank you very much indeed
you did say er bishop that you were going to be frank and you certainly turned a few corners there for us to think about
thanks very much indeed
er colleagues rule forty five workplace representatives motion eighty three to be moved by the northern region
president congress tom northern region moving motion eighty three
colleagues workers' unity is the only force which protects working people against exploitation by unscrupulous employers
yet in almost every workplace in britain we all know there are people who are willing to receive all the benefits of working in a trade union workplace but too unknown to their colleagues refuse to pay the costs
such people colleagues are usually the first to voice their concerns first to criticize union officials yet UNK at the end of each week their pay packet shows no UNK for trade union fees
if trade union solidarity is to mean anything it must mean that each and every worker sharing equally in the benefit of members and paid equally for the service
UNK in our society is common place however in the g m b organization built upon the principles of justice it is a duty to cut out all such UNK
congress this motion would make the UNK obligation for all shop stewards to honour that duty and to UNK members not just from the exploitation of employers but also the exploitation of UNK
colleagues i move
thanks very much
is that formally seconded
formally seconded
thanks very much
i now call colin with the c e c are seeking reference
colin to put c e c point of view
pardon
yes
yes we're doing eighty three at the moment colin
just eighty three
on motion eighty three the c e c agreed that membership
yeah
that membership UNK is important but with check off and other payment methods and the issue of computer printed cards valid for two years we feel that there are alternatives and better methods to investigate
in order to allow us to do that examination i make a recommendation on such erm checking
thank you
thanks colin
does the northern region accept reference
yes conference agree
thanks very much
report mick
the legal and political context within which they operate has changed dramatically with more UNK legislation
since nineteen seventy four over two hundred separate regulations have been introduced and increased european influence has seen ov over thirty new sets of regulations and amendments currently in the pipeline
as these regulations come into force shop stewards safety reps and members place extra demands on the specialist providers of the union's health and safety service
but to our UNK and as nigel mentioned also that we have seen a UNK of factory inspectors and this is borne out by the fact that figures at the present time show that an average workplace can be expected to be visited once in eleven years
there can be no doubt in anybody's eyes that the failure of the h s e to enforce the law along with unscrupulous employers UNK low inspection rates mean that the role played by g m b safety reps and those who provide our backup service are more important than ever before
with increased accident rates and the ever increasing development of small workplaces with little health and safety protection where our members are mainly women part time workers in addition to the growth of sub contracting and competitive tendering and the increasing number of home workers mean that we have to re evaluate our priorities and as such our health and safety service must be equipped to provide all the necessary support and information to UNK our activities in these vital areas of recruitment and growing sections of employment
the introduction and distribution of safety representative UNK is an important factor in the role of g m b members at local level and i'm proud to say that in my own region ninety three percent of the reps receive their UNK
and it should be used not only to enhance the role of health and safety standards as well as business performance
throughout the review which is clear that the un where the union's information and the role of the regional health and safety officers secured a high profile then we were successful in getting across the message
we in the midlands support the role that the health and safety review document puts forward and in UNK president i would just like to pay tribute to my regional committee and the work that they did in getting the review off the ground in the first place
colleagues to all of you i would say support the health and safety review come back next year let's do a good job throughout the next year
thank you
thanks very much ken
tom
president er congress tom liverpool north wales and irish region congress it is well known in the trade union movements that the g m b is the leader on health safety and environmental issues
in the scale of unnecessary occupational accidents and disease we must ensure our service support effective activity at the workplace
at work every week in the u k there are around eleven people killed six hundred seriously injured and there are around ten thousand reported injuries where people are off work more than three days
figures from the nineteen ninety labour force survey estimates that a true figure of one point six million accidents occur every year
these accidents result in over thirteen million working days lost through work related injuries
the survey also indicated that around two million people per year suffer from illnesses that are caused or made worse by their work
at the beginning of this year new regulations covering the management of health and safety all work equipment manual handling workplace standards display screen equipment and personal protective equipment were UNK in the u k
these resulted from european health and safety directives
in november last year at a conference held by the g m b we highlighted the priorities needed to deal with these regulations
the scale of death injury and disease in the u k and the UNK implementation of new regulations should demand priority action from the government yet their actions look set to attack health and safety standards
they've cut the health and safety secretary's budget for this year they're looking to UNK many of the h s UNK functions they've set up a review to identify health and safety legislation that is a so called burden on employers
they will eliminate the grant for safety UNK training by nineteen ninety five how will any of this improve health and safety at the workplace
congress it won't
the government don't insist employers comply with the law they encourage the law to be ignored
such is the u k's contribution to european year of health and safety
the government are failing in their duty to protect people the employers are failing in their duty to protect people
the g m b must continue to fight for the best health and safety standards at the workplace
this special report provides a base from which we can develop our health safety and environmental service into the next century
it will be needed when we consider the challenges to workplace standards that exist
on behalf of the liverpool north wales and irish region i move in support of this special report
thanks very much tom
congress thank you very much indeed for that debate
it seems to me that there're just one or two points in which nigel er needs to respond so i'll ask him to do so briefly
nigel
thank you mr president just two points
erm there was a specific point raise re raised from lancashire region regarding briefing sessions for branch secretaries
that is our intention er we are organizing briefing sessions for officers and taking an approach which we want to get the information distributed to the workplace and that is clearly an area that we wanna develop
erm in the point that was raised from the london region talking about resources in dealing with er regional health and safety officers and their time part of the er document itself is looking at consultation so that the resource implications and the necessary action that we have to take in identifying priorities deals with those things and those things are now opened up to discussion er by accepting the report and we'll be looking at that over this next year
thank you
thank thanks very much nigel
colleagues i put the special report to congress all those in favour
against
that's carried
thank you very much
i now call motion two five eight cancer screening to be moved by the liverpool region
mentioned earlier colleagues that erm there are a number of motions so if the UNK and supporting speakers could come down to the rostrum it would be er helpful
president congress theresa liverpool north wales and ireland moving motion two five eight on cancer screening
it is a national disgrace the u k is the only country in europe to deny this facility to its citizens
employers are prepared to spend millions of pounds on new technology new machines at the same time not one penny on our members' health
do these employers not realize these machines need us to operate them
they need our hands our feet and most of all our minds colleagues what we are asking for is not a lot
the right to time off with pay for cancer screening
colleagues what we are speaking about here is death
the death of a member the death of a person the death of a mother
colleagues i move
do you want some steps UNK
thanks
why did you say that
i'm sorry i'm gonna pay for that and i'm sorry about that UNK
president comrades president congress UNK liverpool north wales and irish region seconding resolution two five eight
conference hundreds of young women could be suffering from br breast cancer with little chance of it been detected
UNK evidence that the national health service cancer screening programme doesn't go far enough was revealed last november with the release of shock figures from action cancer in belfast
they found that two thirds of women who contracted breast cancer were outside the recognized screening age bracket of fifty to sixty four
in the past three years some nine hundred and thirty seven women have died from the disease a hundred and forty six of them were under fifty
more than five hundred of the deaths were in the sixty four plus group
under the present system women aged between fifty and sixty four are UNK invited to be UNK by the health boards
action cancer UNK seven thousand three hundred and forty women at its belfast clinic from january ninety one until march ninety two
of these fifty five percent fifty five percent were under the fifty were under fifty another forty one percent fell inside the n h s brackets with the remaining four percent sixty five years and over
the incidence of breast cancer detected is at odds with the government's claim that its programme has sufficient UNK
of the under fifties it was found fifteen had breast cancer compared to sixty in the fifty to sixty four group
this means that only a third who were found to have breast cancer would have been detected by breast screening
conference these statistics have been proved in one small area of the united kingdom the results if the same exercise was carried out across the length and UNK of the country would be frightening
but maybe if we did this exercise UNK and enough people UNK pressure then possibly we could force this government to do yet another famous u turn and start to inject some real money into the n h s
just think what we could achieve with enough investment
doctors could buy the much needed equipment they wouldn't have to work such long hours there would be no need to close down wards aye or even hospitals
there would be no need for patients to be turned away through lack of beds
congress support the resolution i second
thank you UNK
colleagues on composite motion thirty two toxic shock syndrome i notice a number of colleagues went to the meeting that was held in the conference hall at lunchtime and certainly for a few minutes i had the opportunity to listen to some of the discussions that took place
erm i'm bound to say to congress that under normal circumstances we don't take additional supporting speakers on resolutions er and the reasons for that is very obvious it's because of lack of time
however i've got to say to congress that i consider this particular resolution and this particular matter very serious indeed and i do know in fact that there are certainly delegates who're actually suffering today er from this particular er disease
so what i would like to suggest on this on this one occasion only and without any setting UNK for the future either at this congress or future UNK that we make an exception and that in this particular UNK debate we take additional speakers
i hope that congress would support that
is that agreed
thanks very much indeed
kevin
president kevin lancashire region in the light of your comments i must admit i don't expect anything less or more of g m b than what it always does and that's put its actions where its words are
today the eighth of june should have been in manchester in UNK in fact for the family there should have been a birthday party
a young girl alice would have celebrated her seventeenth birthday today
sadly in that household today there'll be no party
let me tell you UNK story
alice she could be your daughter your girlfriend your wife
alice in november nineteen ninety one twenty fourth the sunday she had a headache wasn't feeling too great during the evening she was able to watch television but she was a bit sick during the night
although very pale on the monday like many of your sons and daughters now she decided it was more important to go to school to sit her mock g c s es
so she went off to school
she was sent home after a short while because she was suffering what it looked like a flu symptoms
she came home went to bed
