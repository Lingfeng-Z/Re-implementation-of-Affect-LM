they'll be playing their match against sheffield UNK at the ice UNK at half past one
and the main points of the news again this lunch time
a court in london has heard how a taxi driver sexually assaulted a female passenger after driving her to a UNK spot in UNK park
preston UNK crown court has been told that the two boys accused of murdering the merseyside UNK james UNK each blamed the other for attacking the child
and calverton colliery has been put into the review procedure by british coal
they say the UNK lost more than six million pounds this year and its prospects aren't good because of a lack of markets
ten past one traffic and trains and planes in full
on the trains british rail say it's all fine no problems east midlands airport it's all fine there no delays to the services at the moment
let's listen for a space with annie smith
in nottingham city centre you'll find space to park at the UNK centre and UNK you won't have to queue for the victoria centre car park but UNK square that's proving to be fairly busy so expect a short wait to park there
no problems if you want to make use of the park and ride service
the forest race course and UNK they've all got plenty of space while in the centre of mansfield you've got room to pork park even at the UNK street car park
finally taking a look at the traffic on nottingham's roads as far as i can tell it's all moving fairly UNK
annie smith radio nottingham travel
i suppose you could pork if you wanted to couldn't you
you could if you wanted to
nobody would know
well thank you have a lovely afternoon
and you
tarrah
bye
erm other places to watch out for in UNK the work is continuing on david lane and UNK street the crossing there is closed UNK are in place and there have been long delays in the area there so unless you have to i wouldn't
in the centre of newark there's works on UNK hill part of UNK and UNK have been closed and UNK are in place there
and on the a one there are lane closures at UNK just south of newark and south UNK is closed in UNK between first avenue and north UNK
that'll do us for now we'll update the traffic again for you in half an hour's time radio nottingham f m one o three point eight and ninety five point five nottinghamshire's favourite station with the weather forecast for the rest of the afternoon
it's going to remain dry but dull the temperature only rising to seven celsius forty five fahrenheit so it will feel UNK in the UNK
mainly light rain expected this evening the UNK should die out around midnight the rest of the night then being cloudy and UNK with a little UNK in places
the overnight low six celsius forty three fahrenheit
and wednesday another cloudy day with the risk of an odd shower it will be warmer than today though UNK high twelve celsius fifty four fahrenheit
the UNK and er and part of the union and i'm UNK informed by john UNK that the UNK are supporting UNK at the concert hall in er december so there you are one to one
this is radio nottingham it's a quarter past one at these are the clues for kids' county what are they on about here
who are they on about here
he's famous he's got a wife he's normally on the news he's posh and he dresses up smart he writes he writes papers out
those last clues he's posh and he dresses up smart somebody rang and is it dennis no
it's er it's not brian UNK and it's not kenneth clarke and it's not d h lawrence either
erm terry from top valley is on
hello
hello mate
are you all right
yes not bad are you
well i'm fine coping with it all
oh jolly good
are you going to bonfire at the weekend
er might do yes

might go to UNK corporation on the forest
er oh right i see
pretty safe isn't it
yeah there's our action line are doing a bit list of bonfires and you can ring them up and they'll tell you where to go
oh i didn't know that
in er in the UNK possible way
oh super
so er if you're stuck for one to go to give them a call four double one two double two
and er they'll tell you where to go
similarly if people are organizing bonfires and they want their bonfire to go on action UNK list then they can give them a ring as well you see
mm it's
what's
a good idea
what's the number terry
er four double one two double one
four double one two double two
four double one two double two that's it
that's it now don't forget will you
sorry yes
just checking
yes
have it written out five hundred times by the morning
else there'll be trouble
now and are you doing any exciting today that you can tell us about and share with us
no not a lot really no
nothing
no just listening to the show
oh yeah listen to the UNK on and everything
yes it's good
what do you think about these erm the this UNK thing and these trees down by erm the church
well myself personally
mm
you mean the er stone the
yeah the one that's by marks and UNK
i think it's superb
do you love it
i do
so you don't you don't want them to move it at all
not at all
any what about the trees that are around it as well
i think well i mean the bit of UNK good isn't it
well i you know
i don't think people appreciate art a lot do they
there are some people who think that you shouldn't be allowed to cut trees down
no i do i believe in that as well think you should keep a lot of er green about looks good
but i think that i think the plan is to move them and to put some other ones down as well
oh yeah
i'm going to try and get them to come on and talk about this tomorrow
yeah that's right
these er these council people cos it's
yeah
people ringing up about it and talking about it all the time aren't they
well that's right yeah
i think the plan is to shift the UNK somewhere else
somebody said the only suitable place for that daft leaf is in the middle of the UNK lake
not at all
i'll take it put in my back garden
well you know you have it then if they're sh
i would
if they're short of somewhere to put it we'll send it up top valley terry
it would take a lot of doing
well then i would get up there although no
er look erm kids' county anyway who are they talking about
i think its john major
john major no
no
no it needs to be somebody who's connected with nottinghamshire
ah does it
you see
ah
yeah un unless er he might have moved into top valley
you know he might have a little weekend house there
you never know
just opposite UNK
yeah
might be but i doubt it so no it's not john major but it was a good thought terry
okay

guy UNK has got to answer for hasn't he
in a few days time we'll be sitting him on top of a bonfire and standing around in the cold night while we light up the sky with loads of colour
bit strange when you think of it like that
it's the time of year of course when the fire brigade can be busy when things go wrong
mike stone is an assistant divisional officer for the fire safety department of the nottinghamshire brigade
most of our extra work comes in fact the run up to er bonfire night
certainly over the years the major proportion of our fire fighting in terms of secondary fires what we term secondary fires the bonfires was always concentrated around this period and going back quite a few years we used to have special appliances put on standby extra crews and so on
but because of the UNK now of erm organized bonfires that risk has UNK but having said that it has only UNK not gone away
these problems is erm young people using fireworks in not the proper manner
we still get an er quite a few calls where fireworks have been pushed through letter boxes in including UNK boxes and they can cause all sorts of UNK although they'll not do an awful lot of damage to individuals
but then of course with erm the modern fireworks there is still in injury problem
seventeen people were injured last year that we know of er probably many more were injured that never even bothered to report it and that's just in nottinghamshire
so we and that's that really is er is too higher proportion for this day and age particularly with all the publicity that's being put out
so what care should you take when handling fireworks
richard UNK and jean UNK are the directors of fireworks UNK in UNK
the first thing of course is to follow the firework code which is to keep the fireworks in a box and closed until you're ready to use them
to read the instructions which is UNK and every firework has instructions on
to light it at arms length and then to stand well away while it fires and never return to a firework if it doesn't seem to go off
and particularly don't do something that's foolish or UNK or silly
use a bit of common sense because they can be quite powerful
when you start to build bonfires in someone's back garden there's never enough space between the fire and the property and consequently you can get all sorts of damage er either of a minor nature of UNK or at the other end of the scale complete burn out of the house
bonfire night is one of those traditions that we UNK and if it is to be UNK then go to organized bonfires
you'll get better value for money better fireworks and it's going to be a d a UNK sight safer
one classic er case that only occurred a few years ago and it was way before bonfire night but erm people working from home to try and make a little bit of pin money a young lady had taken on the task of putting UNK into five into a little bag for a particular manufacturer
this was done from her own home and there were something like fifty thousand UNK in that house with young children running around
now when we came across that it was dealt with very quickly and the er UNK were removed but er you know the potential danger there particularly with young children running around might want to play with a UNK with thirty or fifty thousand of the things in the same room
so that sort of thing we've come across
other things are where people are throwing fireworks around thinking it's a great joke erm serious injuries have occurred in the past with that
we've had houses set on fire we've been to a furniture factory manufacturers er they have had a loss of massive loss through erm a sky rocket falling into their timber yard
so you know there are lots of things like that happening

the concert is by the ted heath band and it's a gala concert at the royal centre in nottingham on friday november the twelfth because in attendance will be mrs moira heath UNK widow er jack UNK will be on UNK baker on trumpet and one of the country's great song UNK will be the guest singer
dennis lotus who's on the line from his home now
good afternoon
hello dennis
you've had to wait for me i'm afraid
well that's okay i'm lying in bed so it didn't make any difference
no that's right you were supposed to be here facing me in the studio and you gone and got ill
i know i'm sorry about that
but okay you're going to be all right for the concert a week on friday
well i hope so i sincerely hope so i think i shall be though
you must have been spoilt rotten dennis lotus er singing with a band like ted heath
how can you sing with any other band after that
oh i don't know actually it was it was quite dramatic when i left the band because i went into variety you know and er some of those put bands are something else cos some of the guys were sort of semi UNK like just come from the mine shaft you know
i remember going to one UNK up in durham and i said well where's the trumpet player and they said well he hasn't come off shift yet
oh dear oh dear bit frightening isn't it
oh yeah but still you know we got through it was great
but it was a marvellous UNK wasn't it ted heath
ah tremendous i mean it's a wonderful apprenticeship i mean i don't know where the guys go now young fellows
right i put this together ah very quickly just before you came in i thought it would be useful to get some feedback on the education the two educational events that have taken place so far now unfortunately i couldn't go to UNK printing but you were there ann
were you there as an
i wasn't i wasn't there i'm afraid
i thought you were right none of us were there the feedback that i got was that
this was the at
that it was extremely good but in actual fact it went on until twenty to nine at night
goodness me
but fifty per cent of the people who said they were coming didn't turn up and most of them didn't phone in or anything like that which was a little bit of an upset for the host erm and consequently there was a bit put in
that's right because he discussed it with me
yes
UNK was he upset
a little bit i think that he was just concerned that perhaps there might've been other people who might've wanted to come and if people had rung up and you had a waiting list something could've been done about it
there was no waiting list er
but i think the other thing is that it's just a question of the people in our business supposed to be being professional UNK
yes
and you're not commissioned communicating professionally or particularly UNK if you don't ring up that day or the next day anybody understands if you have a UNK a road accident a client UNK but there's nothing to actually stop you ringing up the next day and saying so sorry you couldn't make it
that's right
and there'd a much worse instance similarly with the i p r at when forty two people had signed up for something and only five appeared
ah ha
and i think my concern is that i p r and b a i e might being to get a bad name with UNK if that got known
mhm
yes that's a bit embarrassing
well talking headlines we have fifteen people wanted to come
in the event eight did but everybody who couldn't come phoned up or got somebody to phone
right
up on their behalf so the message got through it would have been nice if we'd got ten at talking headlines this room takes ten UNK um but jack had done his homework he did a super presentation had everybody rolling around in
aha
UNK so that by the time we came to do the five practical ev exercises you know everybody was in a very relaxed and jolly mood but i think that's was it's about but from the results that we were getting from the practical exercises clearly what he said had taken root you know roll key words roll them around in your mind er try running through letters of the UNK to match up with your key word chains and you know if the word is ball try roll see if you can get it to UNK and ultimately the UNK de la UNK is if you can actually get the title of a song or
yes
a well known phrase or the name of a television game and then so that had obviously
his delivery i found very solid i mean i didn't find it particularly UNK but i mean people weren't laughing that much were they
i mean smiling
standing up at this end was a lot were you here when he went through all the old headlines of er
yes i was surprised people i suppose most people have seen those before actually
oh i mean these are UNK
UNK
oh i mean many of them were taken out of a book which had in the front price five and sixpence so a so i think that went very well and er i mean jack was much encouraged by it so much so that he's going to actually offer to do it for another organisation that he's connected with
aha
he was so pleased with the way the way it worked out he had never every done anything like that before
oh right that's nice
is he retired now
he's retired now yeah and sometimes well he used to go in and help carl out at the scottish office when you were away producing your UNK he UNK
he did the issues he did very well
yeah
better headlines than we did
he sometimes comes in and helps me out as well so very first class chap if you know anybody that needs a good headline writer UNK your man
yep
UNK events
talking audio visual that's an event that is taking place with s k in glasgow on the second of february i'm disappointed by the number of people who have said that they want to go largely because we've gone out of our way to do something in glasgow
it's always the same
and the glasgow people aren't UNK
yeah how many people have you got
i can probably tell you i have phoned
and said could you please put the word around your people um well there's yourself ann UNK erm
what time is it george
it's six o'clock at s k so that's erm
mind you i've had an s k presentation before so
is three of UNK is four i would probably go through would be five would go through that would be six
i'm going to try to get to that one george i'll let you know
aye if we could get ten it would be nice
it would be nice
but i mean they were sort of saying anything over twenty four and were UNK a bit
one of the interesting things about s k is that they clearly see us as an organisation they want to court
they put up a prize at the awards ceremony they're prepared to do all the art work for nothing or at cost price for the awards ceremony they laid on this evening for us now if three people turn up at their evening they gonna say as we putting our money in the right organisation
yeah that's right
so it's more than just an education visit here it's actually
its a real p r visit isn't it
is it worth actually circulating any of the p r firms in glasgow like
what's happening is that the membership handbook should have been out last week but i think it's actually going out physically today and i've done a reminder UNK be UNK out with it erm making one or two little pointed remarks about blah this is a very important event and please note it is not in edinburgh you know erm s k are very supportive of us we should you know take advantage of this very important
but were they really hoping for twenty four people
they didn't know what they were hoping for quite honestly
yes
but i said that you know eighteen might be a push but i wouldn't be surprised if we got twelve or fourteen at that time of course we hadn't actually had any education events cos the one that we scheduled has been cancelled so i was perhaps a bit naive about how many people actually turn out to these things
yeah glasgow you would really be pushed to get though mind you the attendance at the black museum was quite good
ah ha was that an i p r thing
no that was ours
right okay so anyway that erm one's causing a little bit of concern i've got another one scheduled for march which i was going to centre on here where will come along and talk to us about the editor and the royal visit and you know ee UNK dear me how glad i am to be away from the scottish office
ha
everybody's like a UNK virgin on their first date when you phone them up and ha i'll need to get permission and have you spoken to and you know and we may need to talk and all i want you to do is come along for
i know
our mutual it helps them if we know how it works it helps us if we know what problems they encounter
yeah he's talked to me actually as well about dealing with people who from the inside have dealt working with him doing royal visits because obviously that's quite useful a lesson for them to get over to people
i mean we could probably both do a royal visit ourselves i've done several
and i mean i have done several since i left the scottish office as well which is quite good and i thought that i might put sandy at his ease by telling a couple of amusing incidents that have happened post the scottish office days
yes
er where i was asked by remember
yes oh
who was the navy p r o
he UNK into my office is a UNK figure who UNK a UNK pipe
whilst you're UNK like me
mm
gotta royal visit coming up he said you've worked at the scottish office do you know anything about them and i said yes tell the scottish office they'll do all the a royal navy one i've got to do it i said fine when is it
tomorrow ah have you had a dress UNK
there's one happening today in ten minutes i've got a car waiting outside
so i said right i'll come down and give you a you a hand with it and it was the re dedication or re commissioning of a ship
right
a very small ship a UNK and er the captain was at most lieutenant commander and the princess royal was doing the re dedication and because it was the winter it was being done inside a big shed that's the background
we got there and the lieutenant commander captain who looked about thirty two or thirty three ah was about six foot two with a great shock of UNK hair and of course i immediately UNK him UNK because he looked UNK
yes
and a he had the same UNK attitude to life that germans would have and a very bad temper
so we got there and he said right okay you're the press UNK he's right i've put your press people over there so while respect lieutenant commander that really won't do because everything including the band of the royal UNK is between them and the princess royal so we argued about this and the compromise eventually was that everybody would have to stay there until the ceremony started and then we could bring the UNK round to the end and up to one side where it was all happening mainly to get a picture of his wife cutting the cake
this is a tradition in the royal navy when a UNK being re commissioned the youngest rate and the UNK wife cut a UNK cake using the UNK
right
right the royal UNK stands to one side and UNK so you know we could come in for this
so i told the press the next morning who were UNK at all of this and i don't blame them so when the ceremony started pat took the UNK photographer round to the front and the television guys as the princess began to inspect er the crew pulled all their gear through the band of the royal UNK over their toe UNK under the UNK and pressed their cameras under the nose of the princess royal which wouldn't have happened had the lieutenant commander been prepared to listen to us and of course you could see him getting UNK and UNK
oh dear
then when his great moment came and his wife came to cut the cake all the UNK suddenly decided they needed to clean the UNK of their camera and his wife's picture was never taken
so the message i think got through
so that i thought was a nice tale
yes good one yes
i'll tell you a lovely story when we had the queen at the day before when we had the dress UNK i'd been out to erm london to pick erm up an old lady who's now dead who very seldom got out and was pretty well house bound to come and see the UNK as a little sunday treat
yes
on the way down on that stretch of road from death one to death two i call them the roundabouts i suddenly realised if we were going to have a UNK we needed to have a UNK of flowers didn't we so i UNK out of the car picked some weeds tied them up with a piece of strong so that the chap of our staff who was going to be in front of me was going to hold them during the UNK whilst i UNK up to play first of all the lord provost and then the queen or the lady provost as she then was
anyway the next day UNK is UNK and i can see the captain pointing at me my UNK was showing my UNK was showing my hat off and afterwards i said to him erm what was so funny oh he said i was telling the queen about you having those weeds for the UNK yesterday and she thought it was terribly funny
so it took me a long time to live down my weeds the lady with the weeds
that's right
UNK a UNK
UNK yeah
but mind you we had much worse a problem that day because we had two sets of UNK dogs who didn't like something and the first lot that were in and didn't like something that we'd
and though they went away and the bomb squad came they went away they had a problem with their vehicles and the second lot of dogs didn't like the area either
oh right
in the meantime UNK was approaching and this one horrendous photograph of me looking very UNK you can well imagine and my father ever UNK when he saw this photograph said huh where were your directors wasn't one of them in charge and i said no they were away having lunch they were just going to arrive when they you know anyway
it's all good fun royal visits i mean the last
that's right
one i did was with UNK paper at UNK and the UNK or the UNK whoever own
UNK they are
were absolutely UNK
we UNK it and we UNK it and i mean i didn't mind they were paying the bill for and i literally with a college took up residence for several days before it in a local hotel and we went through it in every fine detail
yes
and we knew exactly what photographs were going to be taken who was shaking who's hand and you know
right come the morning arrived and somebody else i can't remember who though and there we were all ready to go and were walking with the press into the massive great shed where they roll the paper and make it a massive place the size of a couple of football pitches we were just going in the door and somebody said to me they're no gonna be using their flash guns are they
i said yes why they cannae do that mister he said it'll affect all the UNK on the machines oh ah
the whole place was gonna come to a halt if anybody fired a flash gun and UNK fred grabbed the royal people and i grabbed the UNK and we started UNK the present so they could take place under the enormous great windows that there are in and nobody had said at any time a flash gun will stop the machines
these are the sort of things that are
oh no
where's that going to be
well do here i think
and when
it's march sometime erm
do you have a rough date
aye
you've got a firm date haven't you
let's find it you see the trouble with efficiency is that i find er so much paper
if you give me my basket i think you'll find it in there actually
the fifteenth rings a bell
fifteenth of UNK
er no fifteenth of march
no march
rings a bell er because i a circular out about it
right
fifteenth of march in here
ya i thought that sounded right okay
right what day of the week is the fifteenth
it's a
tuesday
a tuesday yeah okay good right
i wonder if that i'm now being serious is this room big enough if a lot of people want to come
a lot of people won't come i mean i erm fairly confident now that if it's b a i e only we even out at about eight i mean twenty can put their names down eight will turn up
yes
yes i suppose actually really you see it's like the network evenings that there used to be in that UNK little pub at the west end
ah ha maybe we should get a licence for this
definitely
all i'm allowed to retail in here is UNK whisky
well that's right
you can provide the whisky and we'll hire the glasses
that's the way round the licensing regulations
erm right
what time will it be
aye is it not in there
no only
then sandy hasn't given me a time but i think i'd suggested to him between six and seven i think people like that they don't have to go home and
but talking UNK the next one is that the one that we'd originally called talking print buying that i'd got
yes so let's dwell on that because you've got some information UNK you've got some information ann
yes well i mean about two lots of minutes ago
ah ha
i put in a square bracket on the minutes
right
in october i think it was
yes you're right
which i couldn't find today did i not in the actual end approved version does it not say that i've got the tape and people fixed
it's blue paper that it came off the fax machine i'm sure er
no this is the minute which was posted to you before i went to the states
right then it won't be on blue paper if it was posted but you did put down that two
that's right
indicated that they're willing to come along
right and you've got
i've got the by manager for h m s o willing
tremendous
to take part which should be quite interesting i haven't really discussed it in detail with him because i wasn't sure who else was taking part and what sort of format we're thinking of having
right let's kick that about then scottish homes have offered us their facilities they would act as host
and would you think that was six o'clock again or would you like to make
six o'clock seems to be a nice time scottish homes said they would lay on coffee and
and what number of people can they take
again er they were talking at the higher reach of our number
twenty wasn't it
aye
they said something like that they seemed fairly relaxed erm now what UNK is this one that there would be any value opening up to others for the whole thing
i think that if you've only got twenty spaces then that's difficult because we've got a hundred and something members most of whom are in the central belt
but only eight of whom will come
when you mean others who else do you mean
well i was thinking not so much the edinburgh communications group
but that's now got forty six members some of whom are mutual
yeah
but that means you've got potentially mm a hundred and thirty people perhaps
of whom
why don't you wait and see what the numbers are like and then you can always ring up a few people and say we've got a space if you'd like to come
right okay when should we try and go for that maybe at the end of april beginning of may
end of UNK fine i think
right erm
what we're gonna have three people taking part are we three sort of speakers or
well do we need three speakers erm
we've got somebody from haven't we the printer
yes we have
so we've got one or two people because they thought they'd do a UNK on design and print buying from them
how long
i mean could they do that in about quarter of an hour
why don't you say to them that they each organisation i mean h m s o and have ten minutes each for a presentation
yes
ah ha
and then the rest is questions and answers
yes
we could happily give them fifteen minutes that would take up forty five minutes
yes and then
h m s o
print buyer
print buyer
and design and print buying then you have a slight break in the attention span if each person's fifteen minutes
ah ha yes
and then question and answers
yes that seems reasonable what's the kind of remit of their presentation going to be are they going to look at problems which arise or
i think what we want to know is er the UNK at
now we all know because we're print buyers to a larger or greater degree but they're clients they over estimate they add about twenty five per cent more on than they need and you have to send them back to UNK their UNK several times before you've seen the estimate they of course know that all print buyers are UNK who keep forgetting all the important things and don't give them half the information they need like the weight of paper or the fact that there's to be a pocket at the back so i think if we got the man i think if we maybe started off with h m s o the print buyer which is more UNK to what we are and say well you know these are the problems i've got i'm sitting with a six million pound budget buying for the whole of the government of scotland and i have problems and these are the problems that i have then we get to the wee man from who says now wait a minute boys i get the rubbish that you send out that was the message and let's make it funny but slightly aggressive let's highlight the real problems because that's what it's about we're not here for a nice night we're here to learn
yes right
and then finally we could finish off with bill and ben the UNK men or whatever they want to call themselves from and they could say well we're the guys in between we've got clients out there but we have to deal with printers and UNK and this is what life is like for us
i don't know if i'm unique i suspect i'm not but i go to my two design people and i say right blah this is what we want to do but you organise the printer i want you as the UNK to find a printer that you can work with but here's my timescale and it's up to them
erm yes and some of the design houses will mark up what then handle some of them won't in terms of after the design stage and that i think is something that some people don't always realise
ah ha
yes
but some parts of the job if you do it yourself you're gonna save some money
mhm
whereas certain parts of their handling are going to be about fifteen twenty per cent
yes
okay right let's define this task up a little bit
then right
i will unless anybody else wants to do it i'll write to UNK and say this is what we want the UNK to do
yes i'll contact
could you firm it up a little bit with him you firm it up with i'll talk to scottish homes
yes
and tell them what's the nice UNK at scottish homes
she's married to an advocate isn't she
is she
think so
right
she doesn't spell her name like that and i'll speak to within the next couple of working days
can we have a date end of april
fix up a date end of april or the beginning of may and
do you want a little bit of done about each person
it would be helpful but i'll introduction
h m s o have x million clients blah
yeah
so that gives them a little bit of introduction for each one
so that we know and also it puts the guy in context for i mean these if i remember i mean h m s o are UNK buyers
and even bigger now
aye
they have this sort of automatic UNK system with key information just goes shooting out to the amazing so yeah a wee bit about each one would be helpful
ah ha a little UNK bit
and then a discussion afterwards
ah ha erm yeah well i mean okay if we say take fifteen minutes each and we start five or six minutes late each one will UNK by three
so they will have finished their speaking by seven and
by seven and then it's up to the members
yes is the proposal for the is it coffee and sandwiches beforehand or at the end
i'll ask
do you happen to know
but um i'm a great believer that it's rather nice to have that going on while the event is going on you know you sit and UNK a UNK beef UNK as you UNK your coffee down the front of your shirt
you can tell
right okay
okay how're we UNK how we UNK
good
right so
i was going to speak in terms of numbers george it was just a wee thought that if there's going to be three or four of them we want at least eight of us if not it's gonna be a bit
that's right
that's right
UNK
i'm very happy if i could see fifteen or sixteen coming to this
me too fifteen or six i think we need to think about you know the timing
absolute
got fifteen
again i mean i maybe shouldn't do this but i tend to take a very relaxed attitude to these things and if somebody wants to bring a pal or if somebody that would be interested i see it as p r for the b a i e you know
yes i mean my view is that we put it out for members we see what the UNK is and then we can always look at the list and ring certain other people
you might get some of UNK might want to come along UNK people
sure great ah ha
or if we're stuck get our heads together and drag in a few extra bodies
that would be great but it would be nice to get about sixteen people
yes i think so if it were just three or four of them you've got to have
well that would make your twenty wouldn't it because if you have four speakers and you're aiming for sixteen UNK
twenty people
i mean let's be honest if we all turned out that's five and if the rest of the executive committee turned out that would virtually take it up to ten we wouldn't be looking for many more after that
well the committee is fourteen people anyway isn't it or ten people
aye but i mean some of them are on this committee as well i mean wendy and i for a start erm so that would be good right let's try and give that one a
right okay
let's now say that a joint event with the i p r and the e i c g i'm having a lot of difficulty making contact with the i p r
why
and i don't what i get
i never have
for my hundred and ninety pounds a year
do you mean with the i p r in london
no with the i p r in scotland
well what's the problem
right the problem is that i can't seem to get through on the telephone i phoned and her secretary came back and said you've to phone and she gave me a guy's name like and i got a number for him so i phoned it ah he works in our edinburgh office i phoned the edinburgh office
i'm sorry he's not in today i said that's okay i'll call tomorrow
i don't like leaving messages
yes
on b a i e things cos i don't know how other people's offices react
so i phoned him back the next day ah he's in our glasgow office today so i phoned the glasgow he's on the phone i said that's okay i'll call back
so i called back again and the number was engaged so i called back again and got through and he'd left for the day
ah ha i tell you
i phoned the edinburgh office again the UNK and i thought i'm giving this up i'm gonna write
george funnily enough the time that we did a course with i p r before
mhm
we actually ended up with a lot more i p r people and we'd done all the work and they got most of the money now that's fine that's the way life goes sometimes but i must admit i think that depending on how big an event you want to make it you're maybe as well to keep it an b a i e event and open it up quietly at the end
yep
i mean what about the e i c g again this seems one that i thought might interest them
who are by and large edinburgh based as well
yes i mean i don't think there's a problem about opening it up to them except their meetings traditionally are in the early morning
ah ha
erm
anyway i've spoken to and is tied up until february which is fine because
right
basically so am i i've got to write a news in the next few days so i'll see in early february tell him about the ideas i've also been in touch with another lobbying firm i say been in touch but it's quite easy because
not the westminster whatever they're called
no um michael UNK associates have now started a lobbying operation which is run for them by the former chief executive of the tory party in scotland whose name i've forgotten but he lives down at UNK in east lothian ah now if i could get him in if fred doesn't object and again if fred didn't object and the other guy didn't object it might be worth getting a member of parliament in
that would i mean that would determine which day of the week you'd try and do it probably wouldn't it
erm well i mean there are some mps any day of the week will do you know there anybody's for a good meal but erm
i mean ah i know i know but then he's pretty tied up and i know very well but even trying to get lunch with is difficult but there may be there may be i mean i know quite well but would want
he is
what about somebody like
i was gonna say he'd be very good
yep
no i find him quite helpful
aha
when i've taken things to him i must admit
right well that's a possibility i mean
so when are you thinking about that in the summer
well i don't know it would probably have to be may or june i think erm
may or june right
if we if we get it off the ground at all it may be we'd want to carry it over till the autumn and start the new season with it
so that's really just to let you know
right
what's going on at the moment and where i am with it
i'll quickly UNK through the next one effectively nothing more has happened at napier they went off for their christmas holidays about the fourth of november and came back about the nineteenth of january er not quite as bad as that but nearly as i mean they've even longer holidays than we've got and we get a fortnight at christmas and new year
i think you meant the fourth of december and not fourth of november
well november i meant the fourth of november it seems to be for ever anyway i spoke to the head of the department when they came back and he said i must admit we've done nothing from the point of view of putting things on paper but a lot of thinking has gone into it i must really sit down now and commit things to paper
but he UNK we would be on course for a start in april for the er certificate er which would be twelve half day release courses
i was interested in the thing in b a i e news which you had been talking about getting grants for people to do it
yes that was a bit that's been a bit UNK up erm
that UNK me because it didn't seem to me that it was to be eligible
well the have a training roll and it may well be that the will be able to i mean i haven't spoken for example but they have taken over the functions of the old UNK services commission training agency
also organisations like ours are members of the construction industry training board so for instance if was going along we might get a from the c i t b so i mean grants might be available if people UNK around for them
so that basically is it how would we see the UNK structure i don't think we've got time to do that today i wanted really to just to throw some ideas with you good folks and get the benefit of your thoughts and experience so that i could go back to napier and say this is what my committee says
yes i haven't brought the UNK things i mentioned to you on the phone the other day but i think it would be very useful to sit down and look at UNK that
yeah
which is what i've done for something else and what we simply did was to take an a UNK landscape sheet erm and UNK a syllabus over i think that was sixteen or eighteen weeks or something up and divide it into you know units of competence elements of competence and the assignments and the homework
to my mind probably the most hardest part of teaching somebody something at napier will be actually how to write ah everything else is a mechanical function that they can learn layout UNK photographs like that
how do how do you teach somebody to
well there's an interesting chap who lives in south UNK who does writing courses for the public library
ah ha
and my japanese when i was in the states found the leaflet and when i UNK back she said wouldn't this be of interest to you for my own and then she said and what about your project because there will be people there who write and dead true
you know i've got quite a lot of material from the corpus from it
nice chap and he teaches creative writing in glasgow used to be a teacher then a teacher trainer and then i think took early retirement and he does this but made the point that he simply uses it for extra income for pleasure and interest as opposed i suppose to a way of writing you know so
but he's never been a journalist
no but again in terms of creative writing and feature writing that's maybe you could get two people to do a UNK one from the journalist side and one from more general side
okay i think what we might think about doing is maybe just having a meeting for an hour one evening on that one subject
yes UNK i think so
i mean UNK ill and UNK got stuck in manchester
right
both of whom phoned in this afternoon
i think it would be nice if we all got together so will we aim to do that sometime in the next month or so and i'll tell napier that we're doing that
let's do that
would you like to see a sample page of this other thing
aye why not why not the final thing was
is it going to be based really on what's in the
UNK handbook
UNK handbook in part
yeah that's the core but it needs UNK out more and a has agreed that you know it's if you just stuck to the UNK handbook it's too narrow and it does need i mean b a i e in london thus far are being extremely helpful if slightly cautious and i've to go down and talk to the UNK education committee when the UNK education committee gets around to having a meeting
well it's due to have one very soon
i mean there are all sorts of little UNK for example you do not have to be a member of b a i e at any level to sit b a i e exams
that's daft
i thought you did because to do
exactly
i know hang on i'm not sure whether that's right
well i have it i have it from the words of himself er
because i thought you had to be in post this is what we had a problem with UNK request for recognition
you can take a b a i e examination without being a member of the association at any level because i've said that what we should do is we should insist because napier want to bring a lot of students in on this
mm
and they want to make it an elected module for people doing other things
ah yes but now that's very interesting because that's not the same as was the old regulation with the h n d recognition with napier and it used to be as i understood it that you had to actually be in membership and leave a period of time between doing the certificate and the diploma
anyway there we are erm so i mean there are things like that also er we need to work out how we UNK up the exam fee i mean i've said to b a i e but they haven't so far
the exam fee
yeah they haven't so far
what do you mean by the exam fee
the forty pound fee to sit the exam
ah you mean UNK it up with who
with napier b a i e charge
but napier are going to be teaching the course napier
sure
aren't going to be conducting the examination
ah well you see that's what i'm talking about as well napier are saying if your guys want to set the exams fine but we did in fact in the last exam paper find a fundamental UNK
there was a question that could not be answered by students outside london because
who sat that
a london UNK has been used napier were saying that we're doing the UNK we would be happy to set the exam paper but with say
but the exam paper was common for the united kingdom
sure well er
so you're saying you want to make a different exam paper for scotland
no what i'm saying is i think that's something that the b a i e education committee nationally should sit down and have a look at i mean it may well be that at the end of the day napier would set a better exam paper than they would er also i've suggested to them and again they haven't that napier UNK the course do the marking but with perhaps two b a i e fellows
yes
as part of the team
yes that's right
and if we UNK up the exam fee on a fifty per cent basis it would mean that b a i e were getting twenty quid for doing nothing but probably more twenty UNK than they would get normally because students who would be attracted in through napier would be paying their forty quid as well
mm
right
so all of these things are put so finally
can i just go back
you've got children to collect
what i don't understand though is if napier students get a certificate or a diploma are they going to be able to call themselves d i p m a i e without being a member of the organisation
that seems to me a complete and utter nonsense
that's right
well if yes if you can sit the exam already without being a b a i e member presumably you can do that already it seems daft carol please
george i'm not being but is he sure he's right
yes
do you want to set a date for another meeting just now or do you want to get in touch later george
i think it'd be better it's just than i'm under a wee bit of pressure at the moment to be in thirty five different locations
okay give me a shout then
i will do i will do i mean it's actually easier
carol give me your number
and your address
i've got a phone and a fax
how's by the way
slim i'm still involved with the prison service thing but i need something else
ah ha
bits and pieces but i need something else of the same size you know
right
so i'm looking for one other thing which is not too big and not too small
how
does the prison service come out
quarterly
is looking for a job if you need an assistant
i'm sure he is
i was talking to him yesterday
he's con how's his UNK going
i haven't heard david sounding so lively
yes
and UNK for many years
yes much more relaxed
but did somebody else say to me that he's taking action against the scottish office
yes
according to a daily letter he and
a quarter of a million i'm not sure of the figures
post traumatic stress i have my own views about what will happen there
yeah
the lawyer the UNK lawyer seems to think they've got a good case
who's doing it
the fellow who did the
ah the people who do the
what erm what was the name of the disaster
piper alpha
that's the one so they seem to think we've got a good case so
when i mean
the interesting thing about that is why didn't somebody of his maturity and experience ask for it
well that's a good point you see somebody who has UNK their way for a decade through messy complicated family litigation or have even represented myself in court in front of a judge in the court of session and one and i'm very proud of this i did this last may um i know how tough the going is
yes
er when you know you go home and lying on the UNK on the friday night is a great UNK of paper that came second post which made me out to be the biggest UNK thief UNK and UNK in the world
of course
and after a time you know you say ha and you just because the lawyer for the other side always goes for the very worst scenario
yes
and i can't see the two people involved being able to stomach that very easily because questions like why did you not ask for counselling at the time or you were in charge and why did you not ensure he had any adequate
yes
i could see this getting very nasty very quickly
i think i'd probably settle out of court
aye
aye
very happy
aye
shut them up
aye
quarterly
right
it's just about to come out in three weeks time
oh really because it would have been nice if you could have put something in the corpus about the prisoners who help with the corpus actually
or a bit in the b a i e UNK newsletter in scotland you know here's a member that's launched a new publication for the scottish prison service
yes we could do
but it won't be read by the cons it'll be read by the UNK
that's right
who are in some cases worse than we thought
carol thanks very much for coming in okay
thanks a lot be in touch give me a buzz any time okay bye
goodbye home right the structure of the course
aye let's have a separate meeting on that i mean i've largely left it up to and one or two others that i've met up there
who else have you met up there because i was so surprised
UNK on names i can't remember
because i'm so surprised that and said they didn't know anything about it
there were four people at the last meeting er and two others from the department a male and a female who looked after the bits of the department but i cannot now remember what their names were let me just see if i've got my notes which were written on the inside of a british airways flight ticket come in hi ya
hello
you're being recorded
the ill one enters the room
what's her name again
UNK
just one message for you
oh
aye he's off now
i'll call him tomorrow
finished UNK those notes
but you must be fairly near the end
aye hope so
aye
they seem to be going on and on and on
right okay
i'll do that first thing tomorrow morning
bless you
come in which will be about what lunchtime
i would reckon i'll be finished with norman about ten o'clock it takes me an hour and a half to drive down half past eleven say i'm in here about twelve o'clock right cheers
okay thanks a lot goodbye
we have i mean this company
you've got n v q stuff there which is that
this company moves at such a rapid rate of knots that i have a meeting tomorrow morning with the managing director building and property development at his house in UNK which is the only time he's literally coming back to change his shirt before he goes wandering round the world again so the only way i can get him is to go up and stay with the in laws over night and see him at breakfast time tomorrow
i haven't in fact got
right don't worry
so erm i mean think we're in their hands and that's why i was a bit UNK about doing publicity for it at such an early stage because i like to see i's dotted and t's crossed er but however i'll chase them up again in the next few days
but are the point about how it's structured is if for example it's going to be open to students at napier
napier
what about the students in the communications department at queen margaret college
if they wanted to come along to it they could
but why don't you allow them to run a similar course there because it would mean more student members
two things
and more students doing the exam
right two things first of all i mean i think this is the first one and once napier get it up and running i think it's UNK
yes but i think when you look at how it's structured and whether it's UNK structure and its content it's got to be written that it will be united kingdom UNK not merely
sure i mean yes napier have
well i think it's been open to any higher education institution to grab this idea because it's been around for a long time the great beauty of napier is to some degree it's a centre of excellence it's got its b a course so has queen margaret but at the bottom end but why should i say the bottom end at the bottom end it's got the b a communications course at the top end it's got apprentice training for printers
so everything's there printing UNK separation houses sheet film computer set up and apple UNK and everything is there it's actually a very impressive set up erm the queen UNK course i'm slightly dubious about i once had a colleague i'm going back a decade who had been employed on the basis of doing the communications course at queen margaret i think and it turned out that it wasn't communications as we understood it wasn't our sort of communications p r newspapers and things like that it was communications on a much broader front so it didn't actually fit in to the world of p r and what happened was i then had to sit down and train this woman from scratch and get rid of a lot of the UNK that she had come in with she had brought from queen UNK college
i mean i've had UNK college on the phone as well saying you know why can't we do it and UNK we're really now we can do no more until napier come up if for some reason napier fell down on the job then i think i've got enough knowledge about what we're doing now but i would start running it round the other colleges including telford who are doing a distance learning course
oh yes but they've been doing distance learning course they've got the biggest distance learning course in europe
yeah but they're doing the distance learning course at the moment on publicity and p r i think erm i had some papers about that somewhere
well this is the open learning opportunities here they've got erm various things including the communications and so on
right they're doing an h n c in communications for business and there are UNK in that would actually suit some of our
who have you met down there
i haven't met anybody they mail shot us um i thought i'd brought it with me
cos i've met i've met with them before
aha
on some of their things and in fact two of their people came to the intellectual property thing
right
so i think in a way it would be quite nice to sit down with somebody from each of the colleges to hammer out the syllabus because napier will see it from UNK point of view about what's easiest for them to teach and what this and what the other whereas i suspect if you also sat down with and people you might get a broader discussion base
i have a built in um caution of those who wander in the UNK of UNK i always feel they're a bit divorced from the real world
i don't think you would i certainly don't think you would find divorced from the real world because he's involved in consultancy work and research work with the national companies out with the organisation
i'd like to see what hard UNK er b a i e people would make of it you know people who are making a living from doing the same well you know when i employ somebody coming into the business this is what i want them to be able to do um this has always been of course an a criticism
yes could we sit down and write the two of us some pages to put to this next meeting so that we have actually got some meat in front of us
well we could try and do that my i've got a workload that would UNK a camel at the moment because i'm also the admin officer at the moment for the public relations flight of the r a f e r
because of a lecture i gave last weekend i've to write a paper on how p r audits can be applied to the military which is great fun and an acknowledgement that people of a senior level were listening to my lecture but um it's put quite a bit of work on me
but by all means if you've got something bring it along and that would give us a starter for five i'm keen to see us also trying to once we've got this going down the s p q road ah had lunch with the other day at i mean it was i mean she wasn't meeting him necessarily wearing a b a i e hat of not um and i think she i think she touched on that though while they were UNK erm i put down progress because i was thinking of the UNK progress at the time
erm yes it's quite interesting i mean the if you go and look at the UNK facility that i'd found about communications training there are something like three hundred and ninety two sources of training in scotland
those obviously include all the further education colleges that do the basic um and the basic things and then the h n c h n d it gives you the open learning things which includes then the private sector people communicate and all sorts of other agencies erm it depends really what you see as a UNK do you mean a UNK in the communications field in its entirety or do you mean a UNK as an in house industrial editor or a UNK by definition a UNK is not likely to be a UNK
aha that's right it would be somebody of one rung down perhaps from and half a rung down from if you can put that in context i mean is an absolute UNK she knew nothing about this business two and a half years ago
what had she done before she came to you
she was the office junior
right
and she had one or two UNK including higher art and then somebody said oh that would be good for the p r department is looking for staff so she now is doing a superb job running a marketing operation editing an internal newspaper it all herself and erm all of that i taught her now i want to move her on to the stage where she can get professional recognition for this now that is what i call an absolute UNK
yeah so do the certificate
to do the certificate
yes
and then with great UNK after that the diploma so that she could be erm
do you know i'm still UNK about saying to do it
well but the important thing is she's engaged to be married i would reckon by the time she's about twenty six she'll be looking for time out to have a family but by that time hopefully she's and when she's thirty two or thirty three can come back into the business and say i've got a and the door opens that much more easily
of course i mean the government view is that people will come back with s v UNK and that is what's going to do it
being certainly lost an opportunity by not being it's only body there is an editing element in the book publishing section from the p g b and there are elements relating to us in the s p g of the UNK training council and there will be bits of them in the public relations in the marketing one of which i've got a copy of the draft but you know there is nothing all UNK b t e c do graphics and UNK but there is no single forum i mean that's what so astonishing and interestingly somebody at b t e c told me the other day there's been a bit of a problem about the book editing part of the editing level three element um and that's partly political as to editing versus production because UNK level four and editing is level three and that has made some problems apparently
right what i see as an interesting possibility the papers that we got in this week from telford college that came to me
about open learning
about open learning and they've got an h n c in business communications now they also say that you could do this as a student at the college
there are three elements of that fall within the scope of b a i e type learning one is an interviewing technique one is an introduction to public relations
yeah interviewing in terms of staff interviewing
i don't know it was a two UNK um an UNK an introduction to marketing and p r and an introduction to internal communications were talking about you know the house newspaper now that's the
and this is distance learning
yeah
yes
this is three elements out of about nine or ten now if they could be persuaded that if people phoned us up and said blah i want to learn this we could say well telford will let you do this one unit of the course they learn the one unit of the course they say right i'd now like to learn about let's say photography and we find out that queen UNK college in their course have an element on photography so we point the student in that direction and then they do this hold on a second
but you can't you can't dip into UNK of that can you don't you have to do the whole thing
why can't they dip into UNK because once they've learned that they then come to us and we say right you're at the stage where you can do the certificate in industrial editing sit our exam
but i think the difficulties buying into sections of an h n c course
well that would be up to the colleges if they're UNK they'll say right yeah twenty five quid for that in fact it would be a lot less because it's only for three months
but i don't think i don't think i think you have to pay a candidate fee as well as the course fees so you
right well that's the sort of things that i think we want to find out and in slower time i was actually going to ring the yeah at telford and say speak to me about this and maybe pop in one morning on my way into town and just say this is the idea how does it grab you and if they say you're not on fine but it's things like that i think we want to explore
napier have said that once they get this course up and running there's absolutely no reason why experienced people like us can't dip in and out for a one off
ya the other people who i think would be quite interested at looking at something like that would be the new business development centre at queen margaret i think that's much more up their line
is this erm is this ann UNK enterprises this
no this is them wanting to get off a course off the ground
right
in fact the girl who did the mailing for them didn't do it properly so in fact it's unlikely to happen erm they asked me because i know that since she's now leaving the vice principal through network erm and they were thinking of getting something together like that i didn't write this that's not my writing but just let me tell you i don't write a twenty four clock twenty four hour clock with full stops in it
aha right it's a bit odd isn't it
erm so no certainly they asked me about it and so on but i think that rather like their food forum they might like to get a communications forum going erm because they've been thinking about having a business club and various other things because they're involved with the management programme and all sorts of things and they maybe going to do some training for heads and people like that
i mean this is something that we could maybe be of help to in fact maybe something that i could be of help to them on because i actually do lectures on public relations how to assess what i mean at a very basic level you want to communicate with press how do you do it but before you do it why do you want to do it
have you made up your mind what your message what've you got to tell the press this is how you go about targeting
i know i had to explain to somebody in chambers the other day something to do with the corpus that it wasn't where was the story there wasn't a story
right
erm
people get great ideas we want to give this a big show at the press to which i say well ho step back
but they are going to be running short courses there about
well if they were interested in speaking to me i could probably put them on to not just myself but members of my flight it isn't my flight it's flight erm and there are several of us in scotland who could come in and do things like that for a modest remuneration erm
ya they're feeling their way it's only been open
i mean you know well is probably just about to become a member of our flight i mean he's going through he's just about to go to the r a f college in UNK
yes to do what
there is a specialist public relations flight in the royal air force volunteer reserves
yes and in the air force reserves
he's just about to come into it
oh really
yes
he's the young lad who was at s t d he's now working for himself
that's right that's right and now that he's UNK off the scottish office i invited him to come along to it as well so we may find
but how do you i mean do you have to be taken on as officers of the r a f
you have to go through a short course at the r a f college UNK and then once that teaches you the r a f side of it makes you into an officer because at the end of the day you maybe there to do public relations but if the UNK hits the fan you're an officer and you're a UNK and you know you carry a gun around when you're in a war zone and you know you're expected to use it and if the senior officer of the unit next to you gets shot and you're the most senior officer then you take over
you're then commanding the unit
it's always a bit a it came home to me with great a UNK and enthusiasm when i was walking round the UNK station at r a f UNK with a supermarket trolley getting it filled with kit and when i got to the end they handed me my dog tags and my gun i thought what have i let myself in for because i'd never worn dog tags before and i'd never had a gun with live UNK in it that got UNK to my hip and you suddenly realise i'm going into a real war it was quite a nerve racking experience for a few days
but had you had presumably training in all these things
oh i trained in all of these things yes
where did you do your training here or down
UNK usually
oh really yes
with the r a f regiment yes um i mean that's where we do the military side of things in fact i'm just organising that now for the flight for february but we have the probably the most famous member of the flight for it was founded in nineteen forty was h e UNK
oh really
erm
now i was reading about him a few days ago
that's right because they've just released papers after thirty years of work that he was doing for the m o d he was actually doing it in his role as a member of the p r flight UNK sold the government this idea
just so can we get back to research about UNK because i'm worried about how much there is on the tape and you're about to drive to UNK erm basically you have to define a UNK to see what they want to do
sure that's right but i mean i think the UNK are the people coming in new to the UNK
when you say new to the business do you mean new in terms of employment as opposed to say graduates from queen margaret or napier or anywhere else
i would say in employment yes or people that want to get employment example would be yeah at m d secretary suddenly shot into the job of producing the company newspaper now i mean somebody like very quickly has to get to grips with this obviously cannot give up six months to go and do it so you do it on a half day release basis
but she's had quite a lot of training in other things actually and with the man marketing department that they've got there they might not need that the thing coming up i've just had what's interesting about that and what i don't like about it is not to because i have a lot of respect for her
but they don't tell you who is actually doing the delivering so you're buying blind
there is nothing here either that i see that is immediately um relating to the b a i e type of business
effective writing skills presentation skills and working with the media i've got here thursday twenty second nineteen ninety four
now i've got here ah learning outcomes erm some topics preparation and agenda type management issues the meaning control skills that doesn't
well time management could be for a lot of people
yeah
that was something people had asked for working for the media here
but it wouldn't er now you've got a different programme to me i've got learning outcomes again is that the same one
no this
i've got the i've got
this is
right i've probably that one
no that's just the
i really just wanted to see er just wanted to see the sort of range of things they did now this is more like it you see effective writing report writing technical report writing business sales UNK editing house UNK writing for publication desk top publishing things like working with the media these are more the sort of things that i would see people
oh that's for in house training for actual customers in their own organisations isn't it
sure but again i mean if there was a market for this i am sure that to take that and UNK it off into a unit it costs money to get people that want to come into this business
but the interesting is i was talking to one of the training people at one of the big finance houses recently about whether or not one could UNK back on some of their courses or whether in fact some of the in house stuff they do they would like to deliver to external b a i e people
right
so that's something else to look at but it takes time
but i've got this c i t b n v q stuff really to sort of to see what went into an n v UNK package
well if you'd like to come to UNK street one day you can see twelve inches of it
i see erm it also UNK me here because i'm involved in designing a television series as well on the construction industry also gives me some interesting data about the industry was it ten per cent of the UNK workforce works for the construction industry which in an average year will turn over thirty five billion pounds
well the industry c i t b industry training board premises are just near one of my sister's houses erm in norfolk isn't it in norfolk somewhere yes
kings lynn kings lynn
well you drive through it on the main road and it goes both sides of the road
i've never been to kings lynn
can i ask you em age
r a f me
please to complete the form thank you
fifty two
thank you sex we think you're male accent do you have an accent
yes scottish
erm do you happen to know
about thirty two and female
um right i think i need you to sign it actually so if you could just sign here
so that UNK er are er erm protected by him erm in leicestershire he says it's open countryside and he says i don't lose that many by foxes he says i'm more er at UNK with other things
getting to the tenant situation i have never dictated to tenants
in actual fact i have bent over backwards i was the only councillor that went and welcomed one of our new ke tenant farmers quite recently having been on the agricultural environment protection committee and been on a board of er interview panel
i actually asked prospective farmers what they thought about certain issues because i think the leicestershire county council er and our department are probably some of the best farmers landlords there are in the country and i think our tenant farmers know that in actual fact i asked the question to several of the members er the potential er clients erm what do you think about foxes
at no time did i ever have one of them ever say to me that they were erm against foxes but all of a sudden we find ourselves being issued with a er petition from tenant farmers which says that they are against er people like me that er pro UNK it's very like er mr we can't attack mr cos he's no longer here but on the on the issue of er i c i brought ou
i said to the farmers we s you should cut grass and you get UNK into the water and i said to the farmers er about their UNK throwing erm a muck across the land we know the problems that causes i said if we came out with UNK which were would you buy them if it UNK a bit more
ninety percent of them said yes that it depends on how you present the figures so in actual fact i wonder how our tenant farmers all of a sudden find themselves in a position that they perhaps would rather sign a petition and not put their heads above the UNK bearing in mind you are in a community bear in mind you are connected bear in mind that your UNK is with those others and i have to say it is true that a certain business in my area connected with farming has been threatened
that the hunting UNK have passed the word round that it to remove your business because it's UNK that person is involved with er people like me
i think that's that absolutely UNK and that has come from one of the practice partners and not the actual himself
i think that's terrible
to put that type of pressure on individuals i think is absolutely awful
going on again on the tenant farmers i actually think that er we are very good landlords and i think our tenants would rather us keep us as landlords than the private sector in actual fact we will have no doubt a debate quite soon on that issue when the government makes us sell off all areas of er th our interests and that one i will tell you this i think that some of the members all sides of the fence every side of the fence have been UNK behind the tenants if they're gonna be sold off by now they'd have been sold off but i think it won't be far long before we have to take education first social services first the elderly before er your side with your government to come forward and say to us we don't want you UNK with anything like that and being bold business get rid of but that's another debate that will come up later on
monitoring
i trust our tenants at the end of the day if it is illegal i'm sure that our tenants will not do it
when it becomes illegal which will i'm sure all people will UNK by the law
i'm sorry about the turning a blind eye i er i er mr i really do feel that if you are UNK about it the one way to get rid of this debate is to vote for my motion
because there is a way forward it is about negotiation it is about hunt the hunting community it is about sharing ideas and looking for a way forward going forward from here well to turn a blind eye to what goes on and vote for that amendment is very similar to what hitler did in germany fifty years ago
the national UNK actually turned a blind eye to UNK that were happening with human beings
it didn't just start off with human beings they s started in sectors and it spread
i don't think it's as bad as that here but i don't think it can ever happen here hopefully
but on the same score i'm afraid i must be an a narrow minded urban socialist well okay i've never lived in a city but if you want to call me that fine
but what i do say is i am a trustee i am a trustee not of farmer's land not of your land mr not of your land mr not of your land mr every person in leicestershire owns that land they have got a mark and i'll tell you sir four thousand five hundred signatures made in one weekend are saying to us you are a trustee of our land it's not your land our land i keep hearing it's our land it's not our land it's the people of UNK land and what the people of leicestershire land are saying to us sir they're saying to us you cannot continue this UNK killing of foxes
if it's a UNK it properly get the authorities in we've got more and more specialists sitting in those chambers telling us what to do on farming issues on b s e we've got coming we've got a team of experts well not one of them has told said gone down in favour of hunting
some of them have actually turned round and said keep it up mr keep it up mr we will see the end of it one day
not all of them i accept and they've been very helpful and when it comes to erm any other issue i think basically unfortunately sir i think that we have UNK from the debate we've UNK onto ethnic issues er and i think it's a shame mr there was no need to introduce that and of course it was bound to bring a backlash it was bound to introduce it it's coloured it it's made UNK the issues because you make it complicated in actual fact er i think that er being a governor of a school i think that's absolutely marvellous that some youngsters the future i think the future will decide i think there are kids out there will turn round one day and say how could you have done that
how could you really have witnessed that and when i say that finally i want to talk about terrier men because basically they're the people who've ruined your sport the terrier men are illegal the terrier men are doing something that is definitely illegal in this country
to open a fox hole and to introduce a dog into the UNK to come across an UNK she's bound to fight
survival UNK is absolutely incredible to see the UNK of a terrier and a fox when they have locked jaw locked and are pulled UNK out of a hole i think i am deeply concerned about anybody here today that can turn that blind eye because what their terrier men are doing is dog fighting make no bones about it they won't be interested in laying the UNK they will not be interested in being UNK and helping your UNK
they're there for one reason and one reason only i know cos i've been involved in fox hunting i've shot and UNK but i'll tell you something was also trained to hunt humans going back many years ago when i was in the UNK islands training for the event that happened eventually
one of the things that i used to do was train and i know the feeling i know the excitement i know the UNK that pumps round the body when you go in for the kill
i know because i've actually done it
i look back now and think we are actually still doing that not in the military aspect in UNK street we've got people real nice people you talk to them on the street and you get them at the kill and the UNK go up you can see the UNK pumping round their body you can see the kind of excitement in their eyes and you can see the terrier men UNK by the UNK of the neck bleeding and then throwing
did you watch the v video when the terrier men having a fox fought for its life okay to have killed it there and then i would have accepted
i could have turned a blind eye but to grab it and to throw it to the hounds i think was absolutely UNK
i hope today we can get rid of this issue we can put it where it belongs in the house of commons we can get rid of it and make sure that leicestershire helps that and i am still willing to talk to the hunt
i am still willing to get a forum together
i am still willing to negotiate and talk to the organisations and look at the sport
keep the UNK
keep the jobs
let's go forward together not in not against each other
adrian it's near time
let's go forward together
thank you chair for the time
thank you for listening and i hope today
that we all vote just this once and get rid of it out of our hands into the place where it belongs the house of commons
thank you chair
i will now put the vote on the amendment
that's a surprise

yes i mean if by any chance that was passed i don't think it is if by any chance it was it would just be the same as the amendment we had
is it c is it carried
yes i think it probably is back to page er twenty thirty three two UNK so it's carried forty two thirty three in total
the result of the vote is for car is carried forty two to thirty three
UNK
we will now proceed with agenda item number six report of the policy and resources committee
mr the agenda item number six please
after this agenda item we will take a tea break
mr
thank you chairman i think that i'll take it easy until the chamber empty and so
can you proceed mr
i cannot find the page now through all that excitement here when i get to it i'll get to it some time page twenty five i'll be alright
can i say chairman on this report of the policy of the old policy and resources committee on the internal management of local authorities that was a very important issue because it's i all issues are important but in particular the seal the report is to inform the council of comments which the policy and resources committee has agreed to make the association of county councils on the recommendation of the joint working party on the internal management of local authority now i'm sure you you've UNK through the report at least some of the during the last er week or so that er that you've had it well i would advise you to turn to page thirty and thirty one because there's lot UNK and it'll make life easier for you if you do that and there on the bottom half of page thirty you will see the decisions of the policy and resources committee
i can't remember at the policy and resources why it was decided by a majority because in UNK to this report on making our comments to this report i first had consultations with officers to go through some of the items that we had done and issues that we had covered in this authority especially the members' services sub committee and we knocked off the bare bones of er a report to the policy and resources committee and the policy
should keep them brief
a result i can't hear myself speaking if i are the policy and resources committee there were other they were erm er in the debate there were some very good cases brought in to it and some erm good recommendations and this is why i'm surprised i'm er forget now why there were some who were er against by majority because i believe that when we look down on the decisions of the p n o we have made some very good recommendations if i say so it says on twenty paragraph twenty in and you people on this authority members of this authority have been saying a clear definition of the role of the local government now and for the next twenty years should UNK any consideration of local authority management structures and the role of members and therefore the joint working party's consideration begin from an inadequate base
so what we're saying is really is that the UNK definition and the role of local government should have been debated i think from starters
when then we could have we could have operated UNK recommendations from a different base
on three if you see then three that we the county council will not support a development of capital cabinet or executive management arrangements which would tend to concentrate power in the hands of a relatively few members UNK public debate and UNK the role of the majority of members
i think we have quite some time on this one and i'm sure you will all agree that a reply that we do not go down the road of a cabinet government
i never would be a believer as was others of a cabinet government
i'm sure it's been operated in some places but your policy and resources committee do recommend that we do not go down that road
for as said with all three of the county councils not support the taking of new powers to promote experiment cabinet of executive management arrangements
what they've been saying is that some authorities might have experiments in the cabinet arrangement we're not advising to go down that road because and on which point we don't agree with that type of government
and on h little h and i'm skipping through them because i'm sure a lot of you would like to get to the tea pot
here
here i second that on h on page thirty one very important one the county council UNK the recognition by the joint working party of the importance of meaningful support services to the elected members and the UNK recommendation that the secretary of state should review and clarify the powers of local authorities to meet costs of services provided to members to enable them to carry out their duties as councillors now the erm members appointments of member services sub have been discussing this issue and i would like to point out to members that we are not claiming the amount UNK for the paying members allowances we erm we're way below the limit that's UNK by the government now before anyone say well what have you done about it
i and some others have tried to do something about it because you'll remember in the last year last two years we have put in a sum of money in the budget to increase the allowances for members and for resources to support members
not because i suppose and i must condemn any particulars group we all in the end said not this time
but i say you're foolish not to have put that in the budget
because it it's an essential part as of running a good authority and that is to have the resources to support the members of that authority because it is a profession a semi professional job you sit on committees that make decisions
i think you should allowances should be at least support you in that and also from those allowances other resources that provide for research etcetera for the members
so i make no apology for raising this one
i will never make an apology for increase in UNK allowances and resources to support members in training etcetera and the tools to do a good job given the tools give you the tools to do a good job
i hope i will that we will have support in it on this issue and i don't want to take up all the time but it is something that members do approach me in and others on the members' services sub and i hope we have time chairman to er give this report some consideration and let's say it's a v it's a very important if you chairman want any UNK to the recommendations or if you say we're going too far in the recommendations because those recommendations you have down in front of you will be UNK on and you're officers and your policies and resources they've given some time on this report and therefore on the bottom of page thirty one the motion to be moved says that the comments of the policy and resources committee and the recommendations of the joint working party and the internal management of the local authorities be noted for submission to the association of county councils as appropriate
i move
seconded reserve the right
mr
thank you chairman
these are recommendations from a joint working party d of e of the erm local authority association and they are to almost unbelievable for us to consider and i can only assume that the that we must remember that this is really a response to what i call UNK last squeeze which was the idea of executive UNK and so in a sense lip service which has to be paid somewhere along those lines but it does recommend that we think seriously about cabinet UNK government about single party committees and i can't imagine how anybody in their right minds would argue now that the cabinet government when they see what cabinet government leads to in westminster and what de UNK cabinet government leads to in majority ruled councils up and down the country erm there is of course a i think a misleading er UNK point the idea of relaxing restrictions on members allowances but members must realise why that is in there
it's in there because you can't have executive style cabinet government in local government unless you pay executive councillors executive salaries it's got nothing to do with the idea of you getting thirty five pounds rather than thirty three if we stay here all day erm i would just i'm really UNK advised to make one point er mr er was c wondering why this didn't have majority support actually most of it did i think mr will confirm that he and his colleagues were happy to support all of the proposed responses from a to j on page thirty and thirty one but were not happy with response b and i would like to er that erm that er when our responses do go forward it is made clear that apart from little paragraph b there was all party support because i really feel that our local authority associates need to know that and erm i hope that will be little b was er a piece that erm certainly i and my colleagues supported er rather
i mean in response to the general tone of the argument which was they want us to increase the leadership roles in the in local government and in local communities and local councils we would we thought that
that was inconsistent with the continual removal of the responsibilities from local government into UNK and er and er mr and his colleagues were not happy with that
so with that er suggestion chairman i'll i think i'll let you all get to tea
mr
thank you sir
yes that's erm correct er the majority UNK recommendations er did come from discussions and a large measure of agreement erm between er all three parties on this council
er and professor is right that it was paragraph b er which at the time was a er it's now b that caused er me and er my colleagues some difficulty erm in er policy and resources and it will be the reason for which we don't support it this afternoon
erm er perhaps i could refer just briefly as to why not
paragraph b suggests that er we're dealing with a report which UNK to address er community leadership and representation that's not the purpose of the report
the purpose of the report is set out in erm paragraph two three of appendix one and that's on page thirty seven of the council report er which says quite clearly that things are changing in all areas of the public sector
new management styles are being developed to deal with new roles new circumstances
local governments at the forefront of this changes
the local authority has to look not only to its traditional role as provider of services but also this is the critical bit to one where the emphasis is now more on UNK requirements coordinating functions monitoring performance
the existing committee structure and many features of common practice erm as the best ways of managing service provision
it may not be so any longer and it's because this report deals with this aspect that i feel this a vital and important matter er that in fact comes in front of us
unfortunately erm er the er argument has been UNK into a UNK about whether you've got more powers or you haven't got more powers and er and other matters and er i don't think if we're gonna get a sensible response to the d o e that we need to axe er grind axes in that way
there's no doubt chairman local government is changing erm the leicestershire management initiative actually acknowledged the need to change to an enabling authority
would that it were as easy as sticking your hand up to vote for it because i have to say that i see no evidence since that motion UNK the management initiative was passed of labour and liberal members doing any more than paying lip service
we've had at least two opportunities in the past two years for UNK our own structure
we started with committee structure those attempts have UNK on UNK over the whole nature of a review process
even as late as last may we had the opportunity for restructuring a number of committees we UNK it
what in fact oh no
what came forward was the lowest common UNK the least er the least that could be agreed without any argument
it was a UNK first step as to what compared with what we ought to be doing
well thank you indeed
if you'll allow it
oh you're too kind
you're too kind
now chairman
chairman wants his tea
chairman wants his tea not yet mr
i do
if we are going to deliver to the people to whom we as elected members owe the highest duty that's the people who are in receipt of our services the sort of quality service that we that they deserve then i have to say that we can have as many reports of this nature as we like but you have got to acknowledge the need to change and you have got to stop UNK the rights of parents and governors to run schools you've got to stop being UNK to competitive tendering and you have got to stop arguing for the retention of services where it's UNK obvious that there's over provision
now but you don't have to but it in fact if there's no point that's it get you
do your arguing through the chairman
if you wish to continue or you wish to UNK a nineteenth century UNK local authority that's fine
if you wish to deliver
inappropriate services at a higher cost than necessary to members of the public that's fine
at least have the honesty to admit it and not to vote for an a management initiative that says we're gonna become an enabling authority and then it subsequently to deny every single measure that will allow that to happen
thank you
sorry mr
thank you chairman
erm i heard er professor have a go at cabinet government
can i throw one back at him
because one of the liberal democrat experiments in tower UNK er UNK real power real power to area councils or community councils
has suddenly UNK and allowed a UNK element to it to creep in because if i might just carry on
what happens is that the council is liberal democrat controlled and the area council is labour controlled and these two fight and that's allowed the third UNK force to creep through so it's not just conservative cabinet government that is the problem
gentlemen i do want to make a point because i know we're not ready for elected UNK or cabinet governments but i do think we c we can do a lot more to er improve our own internal workings here
th there's still too much UNK on committee agendas
w we still seem to debate certain things three four and five times they creep their way through to the main committee and full council and i have to say that the point in para b about the report we've been sent not recognising the reduction in local er government responsibilities it is it's a bit rich because our response to that report doesn't recognise that when i first arrived here chairman we had the education department which was responsible for all the schools six colleges of further education college of art college of agriculture the teacher training college at and a major UNK
it had three education sub committees a major education committee numerous sub committees working parties and all sorts
all that's now gone
schools run themselves some have left the authority we still have three education sub committees a major education committee numerous sub groups and working parties and it's gone time we recognised the changing world and UNK the members side of the education department in the same way that the officer UNK been UNK and UNK down
thank you
er mike
mrs
like UNK that tenant
you've spoken
i would like to
mrs is speaking
mrs is speaking
chairman my point of order my point of order i second and i reserve my remarks i was waiting to see if you called me last
right
i assume you were asking me if i got any remarks last
i got you down in sight yes
thank you chairman
i'd like to congratulate the officers and the members on the UNK of these decisions
all of them as far as paragraph b is concerned it deals with the reduction in local government responsibilities and the growth of non elected bodies
need i remind council about such things as charge capping the fact that the government wishes to remove non elected members or a majority of them from police committees
need i remind council of the fact that the funding for grant maintained schools will be entirely in the hands of fifteen people that are nominated by the government and nobody else
no
and as far as non elected bodies goes about two fifths of all public money is now spent by UNK who are not accountable to the people of this country in any way shape or form so i recommend all of these decisions including paragraph b
it is absolutely essential that the democratic base of this country is not eroded in any way
there should be a majority of the citizens involved in the decision making of local government and national government
i and my colleague here have the pleasure and the privilege of serving on a vast majority of a liberal democrat erm local authority
heaven help it if we or any other minority among a majority party of any colour of any persuasion was allowed to UNK as an as an executive
that would be totally wrong and totally UNK and heaven help us if we ended back in the situation where we had a lady in number ten UNK street who UNK the hand bag at all and UNK without any thought at all for the democratic situation
can you be quiet please
the democratic base must remain as wide as possible and i commend all these paragraphs to council
thank you
i'm advised that the chairman can call the reserve the speaker who reserved his remarks at any time
now i appreciate my there wasn't time to UNK really but in this incidence do you wish to speak but if that point can be made so that it for future debate we know it
right would you want to speak you reserved your remark
not really just to endorse the comments that councillor made
every council er every councillor on this authority is of equal value to the people who elected them er and to the electorate and their role is very much diminished by anything to do with a er executive erm er government of that nature
i endorse everything that was said and everything that said
mr do you wish to reply
i must er thank mr for really UNK what it's all about and cover all the issues because mr referred to no part being taken away
mrs quite right what about the UNK
they're growing up all over the place and as you say ernie he did say about education but whose gonna run education in the future same as social services you'll soon find they'll social services up into the health service
the health service which we've ignored democratic likes of people just appointed
is this wha what you want for the future
i think the i i'm pleased that this is in the in b because let 'em know how we feel about it
we'll not follow these UNK we're not for taking away the power the power should mean at least we're accountable
councils are accountable to the electorate and that's how it should be
because you say about he is accountable to the people because the councils win the ballot box
and the members
the members are accountable and let me go back about the committees
i make no apology for the number of committees that we have and i make no apology for the numbers on the committee
because it makes sure that it is UNK run
let me point out and another thing to that members are allowed to play as full a part in the decisions of this council
because was before the observations of mr it just that you're going back to cabinet government anyway cos you say t take a few on each committee just have a few small committees and they'll do the job
i can tell you you're in for some trouble if you start that because i is you you're all in trouble if you want to start these smaller committees we have looked at the committees and as i say we make no apology for the number of committees or the number that's on 'em
but on the question of competitive tendering i think mentioned by mr which he says we should have a different attitude
we will have a different attitude we'll bear to watch what is happening in competitive tendering and to ask questions and to get the right the facts on competitive tendering because we found a lot of these round the competitive tendering don't you don't you worry and we ain't finished with it yet i can tell you and also we have ev the people who are the in house walking in the house have a right to have some protection from it to see that when we dole out those contracts that it least they are genuine and they've got a someone to see that their interest is looked after
i would commend the motion as it stand chairman and hope that the that the council will vote for it
and now i will take the vote
those in favour please show
it think that's carried chairman
yes
those against
that's carried
that is carried right thank you
we will now have a tea break back here at five and twenty to six
right i think we'll call them to order shall we
yes let's
a thought er went slipped by me er we must upon this council thank the committee staff that controlled the multitude outside er they weren't trained for it but can the er thanks of this council for their UNK in keeping the situation calm be recorded
er now then next item er the moat centre highfields youth er marked mr
chairman
can i can i informally move section b on the policy and resources put forward
you can
moat centre and UNK youth community centre because chairman that there is er some amendments i'd formally move
secretary has reserved the right to speak chair
amendments have we got
amendment by mr
erm we feel we need to move this amendment cos it appears to be the only way to actually get the council decision implemented chairman and to avoid a continuation of the UNK tactics used by the labour group
every time this UNK been before either committee or council there has been a majority in favour of the merger principles
the delay in making progress has UNK the development of the provision in the area and in particular the UNK of the report of the problems of the moat centre has brought some dreadful headlines about the area and i hope whoever UNK that document is pleased with himself herself himself theirselves
now i understand chairman that the UNK have changed their minds now and UNK to the demands of the labour group
i will not support this amendment
i find this quite extraordinary chairman after two years of consistently arguing and voting in committee and at council they appear to have been bought off by the labour group and now intend to support a UNK half merger half federation option
if they really believe that the merger was the best way forward they must now be supporting something that they know to be less than best and this is now UNK all the bad feeling and all the destruction of the past two years a complete waste of time
if this is what is offered as the advantage of a hung council i fail to see the benefit
we remain convinced that full merger is the best way forward and the amendment will e enable the project to make progress if the UNK have changed their mind chairman and do support the forthcoming labour amendment erm th the worst aspect for me is that i've lost a bet because bob bet me a year ago that the UNK would not last the distance and he's been proved right
now what have we got
mr
thank you chairman
i assume chairman that if this amendment is whether it is carried or not we should be debating the other amendments separately
sorry i'm sorry i was i was looking for speakers i'm ever so sorry chairman
yes
we shall if this amendment whatever happens to this amendment the other amendment will be fought separately and it will be debated separately
there are no speakers on this so put the amendment
well may i may i second it please chair
if you yes
yep
do you wish to speak on it
yes please
i do second it because if all aspects i actually supported that is to say i support that the first part of the of the amendment which is the motion from the policy and resources committee as well as the bit that has been er added on erm as far as the latter is concerned i support it largely for the reason that mr has explained
it is not a particularly satisfactory way of progressing i accept that
but on the other hand the delays that have been caused by procedural motions
and i accept that nevertheless contributed a great deal to added uncertainty and added UNK in the highfields area
at one of the effects of that delay i suspect has been the need for the supplementary estimate which is measured er mentioned in part b
a good part of that is i think a consequence of the delay that we've had in implementing the wishes that this council has expressed before
thirty seven thousand pounds is a lot of money it's a lot of money even compared with the five hundred odd thousand that's already in the revenue budget for er the operation of these two centres
it's even a lot of money i think compared with the what is it one point four million pounds that is transferred th through the youth and community budget into the highfields area and that itself is a lot of money when people recognise that we are actually spending the equivalent of one tenth of the total county youth and community budget in one area of the county
we had questions at the very beginning of this meeting which seems an awful long time ago now er asking for youth provision in other areas of the county
well i'm sure that those other areas are would be just as anxious of the people to have
can i have some respect for the speaker
adequate youth and community provision in their areas
i know i would and i wouldn't blame anybody else for doing so
so the situation in that is quite serious and it UNK us to take it seriously it UNK us to make sure that if we are putting resources of that UNK or of any UNK perhaps then we have to make sure that they are managed properly for the effective delivery of the services which we intend er that them to be used for
it's for that reason that i still support the original line which was to merge the centres with a common management structure headed by a single head of the project
that i support the addition that we that we should get on with it as quickly as possible and i suppose also that i regret the support that the request for an extra thirty seven thousand or whatever it is pounds in order to enable that to be carried out
so therefore chairman i do in fact support the amended er motion
professor
thank you chairman
i agree with a great deal that has been said by mr
he knows we have always been of the view that given the limited resources that the best cost effective use of those resources would be to merge the administration
but as he has also said for longer that any of us care to remember all attempts at rational arguments over the best use of resources in highfields have been UNK out by noise from the UNK of axes
vested interests have UNK the status quo with great skill and determination and they've had their axes UNK using er UNK by the oxygen of labour's irresponsible backing off
money and effort that should have been devoted to supporting the ordinary people in highfields has been wasted on power politics and i agree that it's time surely to put an end to that disgrace now there is a certain logic in mr amendment it basically says let us put the implementation of council policy in the hands of the director of education let him take executive control and let us take politics out of it and if i thought that would do what both mr and myself want to happen i would support
but er unfortunately those on the ground who have shown their skill at UNK anything that doesn't suit their purpose with the support of the labour group those on the ground will still be there and i don't believe that er giving the director of education the executive powers is going to stop them continuing to take the sort of action they've been taking
nor do i actually think it's going to stop the labour members of this council from continuing with their support
so i don't think that it's now the logical way forward
furthermore mr himself has said to me on more than one occasion that given the history of the situation it's unlikely that we would get anybody of UNK mind to take over the running of the two centres
for that reason we will support the amendment that's been moved by labour
set a single head to a single head of the two buildings
there will be a single budget which we've always argued for in the management committee the head of centre will and this is very important and i hope members are clear the head of centre which is the head of the moat centre which is the proposed under the amendment will be appointed within this financial year will be appointed out of the existing budget
the reason why this amendment in my view is one that can take us forward is that it places responsibility now for clearing up the mess clearly where it belongs and that's with the labour group
this is a labour amendment it is up to them now to implement it implement it within existing budgets is what it says and we shall see whether they take their responsibilities as seriously as they should
labour will now be on the line they will have to deal with the axe UNK instead of helping them to UNK their axes and the difference between ourselves and mr and i have great respect for mr and i believe his attempt to keep the debate about the future of highfields and moat on a rational basis has been very positive but completely unsuccessful and i believe now that we have to look for a way forward
we are not being bought off by labour
this is less than best but it's better than nothing that's the point and it is very nearly what we have argued for from the very beginning
i think that mr has lost his bet because we are a party who is not obsessed by ideology we are not prepared to act UNK like UNK in a china shop when the owners of the shop have an infinite supply of china we want to move forward and we want to move forward in the real world and the idea that a strong government and sticking to what you want through thick and thin when clearly you're not going to get the result you want as indeed the government did over the poll tax in the end you have to recognise the reality the labour group as much as anything else are part of that reality
the responsibility will now be theirs and they'd better get on with it and better show things that they've been arguing and get along
mr
i was er a little lost there er mr chairman
do i understand you are handing over your responsibilities to the labour group washing your hands of them
you said twice just now it's up to the labour to put this into effect
now i don't call that er democracy that's a washing of the hands er i've followed with interest this moat centre which as you know is w is one of UNK many village halls erm
for those of you that don't know can i remind you that in the last few years one million pounds of capital was spent on moat centre alone on the cost together the moment of running moat centre for UNK youth is five hundred thousand a year
ridiculous waste of money
now i suggest that the labour and the liberal think very carefully about this
you might get a backlash you might find that the rest of the citizens of this county want to know want to know what on earth you're doing pouring money into this area when the rest of the county gets nothing
they'll also want to know why you're doing it when there's been constant obstruction for two years
there's a supplementary estimate here
i'm delighted to have given them two er security men does it mean security men are now available for all the county
if any of us have got troubles at our schools where there's vandalism will you provide us at the tax UNK expense with a security man
you pour the money into this it's UNK back on you but as usual there is no limit
i've heard members from the other side say money doesn't matter this is democracy
this is what the people want and money must not interfere with their wishes
that only seems to apply in the highfields area
i suggest that the labour and particularly liberal feel think very carefully about the quality of service that is provided by this county er council cos at the moment there is neither justice or equity in it
there are areas that are just what they want things passed on the UNK left right and centre when anyone else outside these areas wants it we're told no money no capital can't be spent this year wipe it off and i think you should be very careful or you might have a backlash where you least want it
thank you
mr
thank you chairman
erm i think really for mr to talk about washing of hands er he's got some brass neck when i remember every year every year i mean hopefully he won't be able to do this next year what does he say it's your budget and he looks over there your budget you implement it
if that's not washing of hands i'm not too sure what is
er chairman erm i do believe that this has always been an issue erm of vested interests and bureaucracy administration but all i want to say to members of the council today as a member of the youth and community advisory committee is that extremely serious er far reaching decisions are gonna have to be taken because we were told at the last meeting of that sub committee that just to stand still because of the changes in legislation regarding transfer of funds to the er f e funding council we will lose a further two million pounds next year so even if we er do not have to find any cuts within our own budget that money is going out of this UNK budget it may come back in commissioning agreements but because of the different timescale that the funding council works on we probably won't know that when we come to set our budget and really the issue for the labour group i think in particular as councillor has said is the question of budgetary control
because i would say that all members of the council face those kinds of cuts
faced with those kind of possible reductions in service if there is a penny one penny more than necessary spent on administration and bureaucracy wherever it is in the youth and community programme that is gonna be less money for front line vision and the labour group can have to think very carefully about that and the issue is gonna be that if we're spending too much money or if they're coming back to supplementary estimates which won't be available er given the financial situation next year if we're having two heads of centres or whatever when we could have one that is gonna mean less money for front line services to the people of highfields and there'll only be one group that will be responsible for that if that does come about and i think that's something that we all need to bear in mind because what we were told as members of that committee is that the youth and community budget is gonna be in for some very serious times in the future and it's mainly the government's fault because of the way they've decided to re organise the situation it's going out of our hands into the control of an UNK body and like most members of this council i think we would oppose that but that's the reality of the situation and i could not support any increase of funds er for any community centres if i knew it was simply gonna be spent on administration
thank you
mr
could i have mr chairman cos it's a is it an order of government to support mr at the same time or should i do
no just deal with this and let their deal with the amendment as it is
as it is
i'm sorry come again clarify
i said would it in order now just to deal with the amendment on my own sir or support mr at the same time
we've only got this one
no we've got the other amendment but it's not been moved yet
it's not been moved
no you'll have to deal with this one because the other one has not been moved yet
right i'll deal with this one i i'll deal with this one and be very careful as i say
i wanted to make three points really
er i did at the last council urge that we actually needed to break the UNK my er a and i thought that was very important
i was ruled out of order i erm i there were point out then that twenty five new councillors and i understand it wasn't legitimate if i wanted to restrict the vote only to those twenty five so that the rest of you would actually realise that this has gone on far too long i only put that as a i think it is very important erm that we break new ground
at the last council meeting we did two things or two things have happened
one we set up a w er a working group which has brought together that consultation addressed that consultation argument and i would point out that mr amendment er does clearly UNK that as obviously something which is now seen as useful er and i think that's important
the thing i don't like about this amendment is it actually moves us nowhere and we cannot after what we've seen over the summer move nowhere
now those of us who've been involved on the moat highfields sub committee will have a need to know that when we were faced with really serious and horrendous problems we found when faced with the reality and a great deal of detailed information that an extraordinary amount of three party cooperation was achieved
it resulted in the erm extra requirement for security which does happen to which mr has referred and i think it's very important to realise that if that three party cooperation can be achieved as it should be bearing in mind what simon says that we are going to have to do this with horrendous problems in the youth and community project in the future and we would be failing completely in our duty not just to the people of highfields but to the people of this whole county if we simply allowed politics as has been done in the past to lead to UNK positions and the idea of simply saying to the director we are in a mess therefore will you please deal with it all is i think UNK irresponsible and i'm very surprised indeed that erm that point should be put
the UNK the UNK proposals which are contained in a very thought out amen which has in fact contains ideas submitted by many different people of different UNK to try and ensure that ideas could be erm worked at UNK does break the endless delays
it means that there is a way of going forward the only question that remains was that head of project as professor said who is in their right mind would want to erm apply for such a job at the moment it's probably an UNK idea
if in the future the single management committee on the two headed centre decide that they want a single headed project then only UNK hearing which i always UNK to that it should be decided locally they may have that said project i'm sure you'd agree if they choose to have such one if they feel that they need it but we want to ensure do we not and the amendment doesn't do this that we actually get a move on that we spend the money we have what little there is and there is very little on delivering the services that we fuse the bureaucracy which is clearly contained in the other and clearly contained it's spelt out in tablets of stone in a way that's never been done before
it is extremely positive it sta it UNK these points up and answers most of these questions so i would urge mr chairman that to on sheer education on terms of provision of services i'm not party to all of the politics i agree with what you said absolutely crazy
i would however i with great UNK as i don't think i've ever UNK do it before er is try to actually clarify the thoughts of my leader erm it is not erm have i your permission erm i feel i feel he may i feel that
may have been a professional slip of the tongue i in saying that now be up to labour it is not up to labour at all it is up to all of u it is up to all of us it is up to all of us all and you and you and you can't dump responsibility it is up to all of us all of us
to work together and deliver an effective result because nobody gains anything in the eyes of the people of this county by allowing this thing to go on and on and on and what they feel is if we can't get to grips with it what on earth are we doing with our existence
that is why the amendment is a far better thing than this rather UNK amendment we have before us
mr
thank you mr chairman
i've followed the events of this erm unhappy but UNK some time now erm i've found it unusual because there was no liberal UNK face until now and er quite a lot of things happened where the liberals changed their mind and i naturally started to wonder what has happened to make this change of mind come about and all i'll say is i hope that it doesn't have much to do with events in other counties or with any by election
ooh
at least we have a mind
thank you yes are there i think this is unique er a unique occasion where we haven't got a labour speaker so if there's no labour speaker then
right we'll press on those in ing i accept that
but
put those against
those against the amendment is lost just
we now move have we another amendment
yes the purple paper
the purple paper the mover please
mr
i've been i've been advised chair that i've made the same mistake as you did so
they're so particular aren't they sometime but there you are chair chairman i'm grateful er from the indications that have been already made by a number of speakers that they are UNK to the contents of this amendment
can i can i say before i do launch into the amendment to mr that you have played your card at the last election and the leicestershire public has UNK given their answer to your particular policies
so i don't think anyone here as an elected member needs to defend their positions if they wish to move from a political or a bureaucratic policy to something which is more UNK and much more representative of the kind of policies that this council should be discussing not only now but also in the future
no one has to defend anything to anyone
chair and
and at the same time can i say that you do not UNK views and UNK and UNK that they may have down in the county somewhere with the kind of deprivation that people face in the inner cities
you do not UNK that it is irresponsible and i'm s i'm sorry that the these remarks were made earlier
chairman can i say briefly that the merger and i'm quite pleased that we've finally er there is a death UNK to this awful word it's been UNK on for far too long it's been perhaps the single most controversial issue that has been debated by this authority along with some other UNK issues and no one here would not admit er to the fact that it has been opposed on such massive scale and even today we've had a further petition of three hundred and ninety five people opposing er this dreadful merger decision that was hanging over the er the two centres and i'm pleased that er this er amendment this er erm this petition was brought forward today because it does indicate the continuing support and opposition to er the kind of things that we should be doing and those that we shouldn't
can i also say chairman that there is now a possibility of implementing a UNK of a UNK provision er which will take into account and recognise the very important needs of that particular area
importantly as it's highlighted in the petition
the much valued community education services offered by the multi cultural family orientated highfields youth and community centre and the kind of development of services that could take place at the moat centre
now we hear time and time again of the one million capital that was spent and yes and i do hope that the provisions that will now be made through a combined budget which mr seems to think is half a million but i can assure you it is not half a million however i do i can further reassure him that by the time the highfields er and moat management committee have gone through with this it will be half a million there will be a proper budget provision as it should have been in the last five to six years
unfortunately that hasn't been the case
chairman er i don't want to UNK the debate because as i've mentioned before there is indicated support from a number of people er but i'm grateful er to the liberals in the fact that they feel that they are in a position to support this amendment
much more importantly not only does it preserve the integrity of the people of highfields but i guess in many ways it UNK the integrity of both the parties concerned while moving and supporting this particular amendment
can i say finally chairman that i will be UNK a er a request er i shall be requesting i should say perhaps to the director of education that erm the three party spokesman on the management committee and all those officers who will be involved in implementing this decision will get together at the earliest and i'm UNK possibly next week so that we can be on our way to plan the next step forward to a concrete implementation of this particular proposal
that's how serious we are and although mr er has to give his little laugh but i hope that he is just as much serious er particularly now that the political UNK are that we will have a way forward of not only supporting the delivery and management of community education services in that particular area but a clear focus has now been given hopefully after this amendment er has been carried to the education authority
thank you chairman
have we a seconder
right mr
chairman i've listened with erm interest to professor erm UNK words explaining that he didn't mean what he's been saying for the past three years and trying to explain away what he's effectively and he might as well admit it a complete UNK face worse than that his agreement to an arrangement which he knows is second best
i also listened to mr i didn't understand what he was saying but i did listen to him er the bit that i did er catch was his UNK that erm the revenue budget for moat and highfields was half a million well he's quite correct because i've got the figures here
they're in fact five hundred and one thousand one hundred and thirteen and if mr is UNK by one thousand one hundred and thirteen pounds i would hope he'd forgive him the fact is that this year's budget for those two buildings er is that amount
er mr might have added that er the village hall management committees which er he has a great affection would not be unhappy if they had the sum of five hundred and one thousand one hundred and thirteen pounds with which to provide sources er resources for the communities that he represents
chairman er in his remarks a bit earlier on professor said that he did not think it was appropriate to give executive power to the director of education i wrote your words down at the time he did not think it appropriate to give executive power to the director of education and he said despite mr 's clarification you want to move a bit nearer if you're going to be his UNK mr that in fact he didn't
that liberals are incapable of UNK er the same argument in committee er sub committee main committee and council and i have to say er that erm er placing a bet with ernie was taking money off children
and i'm i i'm delighted er i shall be encouraging them to pay up promptly
now i do ask myself this question erm i can recognise the argument that if you if you're not actually going to achieve your objectives you have to change your mind
i'm surprised that comes from er professor and his party who have for example UNK for years for proportional representation they know they're not gonna get it but are they gonna change their mind
precisely either professor and his party believe in the that certain courses of action are right that they UNK certain policies or they become hopeless UNK
now we on these benches have UNK that in fact the liberals are hopeless UNK for a number of years
leave that to john major
er what i need er and is helpful er it would be helpful if professor could give some confirmation of this
because it's quite clear from UNK there is a moral to be learned for this saga
all you need to do is to be sufficiently UNK for a sufficiently long time and his mates will turn around and throw up their hands and UNK and turn UNK
now er i have to warn him there are that sort of conduct has been UNK in to the UNK of the people of highfields over a significant period by the labour party
i have to warn professor that there's more than one party can play that game and if he thinks that it is sensible to run the affairs of this council on deliberate UNK on the basis that if you go on long enough you can wear people down then i think it's unfortunate it's bad for this council bad for the people we serve it does frankly nothing for local government and i can't blame central government if it loses patience so i recognise at the end of the day that erm mr has had troubles with some of his erm er UNK he obviously needs to re establish some control over his group
i could recognise
i can i can UNK i can recognise when the and tail are UNK the dog
ooh UNK
he needs to get his act together because if this continues then it will be moat today and it'll be other issues tomorrow and frankly the business of this council will grind to a halt
i think to support this motion is desperately unfortunate for a number of reasons
thank you bob you certainly you certainly get us some fresh speakers in and mr
i think that to support this motion would be extremely unfortunate and would lead to potential disaster not for the county council but indeed for the highfields community
i'm not surprised that mr is happy to propose it because in fact it actually means that the status quo will in fact be UNK that the situation that we've been faced with will in fact be UNK and supported by the council and the labour party have been consistently advocating that really a and they will get their way if this motion is passed
i have to say that i hope mr in fact didn't actually write the words of the motion it looks to me and those members of the education committee will know what i mean like another version of the UNK back garden UNK
when somebody tried to UNK an UNK tried to correct that embarrassment by totalling UNK an issue
because what will happen if this motion is implemented
there will be a budgetary meeting of the county council the education committee will sort out its youth and community budget and it will decide just how much it wishes t to put to the combined centres
the management committee will meet and it will divide the money into two and give each one however much the management committee feels that it should have and that management committee need not meet again for twelve months because there will be nothing for it to do
the two issues the two places will be operated separately
if any party on the management committee doesn't like the split it will five member it back through the whole structure to this county council and we shall have proceeded no further
instead of having a working arrangement it is will in fact be a total administrative disaster
i suspect that if i had to find an alternative to what we've already proposed and what we've constantly supported i would actually go right back to the i would actually go right back to the beginning erm because it would be cleaner and it would be clearer
there is no way in which any of us can advocate responsibility for the decision
there is no way that any party there is no way that the liberal party can say to the labour party or to anyone else well we'll support you we think you're getting in a mess but it's your problem you can carry it because that roughly is what they actually said and if it does go wrong as it is sure that it will i am quite sure that it will be quite wrong to blame the labour party entirely for that process because it won't be entirely their fault
i therefore have no hesitation whatever in opposing this total and absolute UNK
there are two members i think have spoken from the liberal benches concerning funding bureaucracy and i would agree entirely with what that means but they've also mentioned in the same bet budgetary control and if you're going to control budgets you have to have a minimal amount of bureaucracy and the function really of the head of the er of the project er the head of the post that's now slipped into UNK with this motion would actually have been to do two things it would have been to hold the two groups together and it would have been to have overall control of that budget and it wouldn't have been easy and i wouldn't have like the job and i UNK applied for it and certainly would have been very difficult indeed
but this really was the only way forward that i can see
so there chairman all i can do is UNK the situation that we've look like arriving at i think it's the worst of all possible UNK
n
chairman
it ill UNK the party of the famous poll tax u turn to lecture the democrats on consistency
here
erm anyway that goes without saying i think
chair i think what needs to be said in this debate is something positive about the work that has come out of particularly highfields er and indeed to some extent moat in the past
there's a lot of extremely good youth and community work has come out of highfields youth and community centre in the past
here
we have had committed staff we've had committed voluntary workers there and there's an awful lot of good practice which can still be upon within that centre
to do that you're going to need the good will of the workers within the centre the local community the workers within moat and the different UNK within moat and the one thing that the tory line did was to unite all those UNK against what the county council wanted
no matter what bob says or harry or any other member of the conservative group and i accept that they've always been consistent on it the same as the labour group has always been consistently against the merger i accept that they've been consistently in favour of a total merger
but politics is the art of achievable and what the tories wanted was not achievable on the ground
indeed it could have led to great problems
i was annoyed really to hear harry speak and i don't normally get annoyed with my friend harry from UNK er but i was annoyed to hear him talk of disaster if there is any disaster involved in this we are UNK disaster today and this is a significant decision of the county council to move forward
all the other decisions that were taken were bound to be opposed by the local community the local youth and community staff and so on
it was known at the time that there was going to be opposition to them and it was an absolute recipe for debate after debate council meeting after council meeting committee meeting after committee meeting
those of us who sat on the urban policies committee for a number of years seeing moat UNK and all the UNK and problems there knew that you were taking the wrong line
the officers never recommended to us that we should have a lock stock and barrel merger
the officers recommended federation and something similar to federation is what is on the table now
what i would say is this three things
one the director of education has now got and his staff have now got to accept that they are no barriers to prevent moving forward on a linked a form of linked centres
the second point is that the staff and the community with the support of the labour group and now the democrats have finally got a compromise solution which may not give them everything but again gives them what is achievable within the political UNK of this council and they must now accept that there is an onus upon them to make it work and thirdly we have got to make sure that the staffing arrangements that are referred to in here and i quote there there'd be posts for each centre who will be expected to add each with staff teams to coordinate the delivery of services by the two centres
there has got to be a willingness on the part of all the groups on this council and the officers of the various connected departments of this council to make sure that those teams are given the UNK support in delivering the youth and community service that the highfields area needs and deserves
the framework is there we i think know what the decision is going to be today
let's not chance that decision let's all move forward together and cooperate and make it work
let's not have UNK from the tory benches once we've taken this decision
it has the UNK the general support
maybe the UNK support of part of the community
but it can work and it will work with our support
there's a lot of good practice to build upon in highfields
now we must do it
mr
thank you very much mr chairman
i think erm mr was UNK in er very interesting political rhetoric during his speech
here
i'd be very interested to know er in terms of u turns which i'll come back to how he's going to deal with the next item on the agenda er whereby the liberal democrats have been consistent about their policy in general with a lot of obstruction and being caused problems and how mr will agree in this chamber to actually close some people's homes old people's homes
thank you friends we all know him as the one million pound councillor
he's cost us cost us a million pounds in the first year he was a councillor
now with regard to this particular thing er this particular motion
you have to come to a conclusion and professor er described how we've had to come to a conclusion
the options seem to me as mr said that the thing had got so UNK and confused that the simple option seemed to be close it all down and i would imagine that groups other than ourselves who've had people like me in the group who've said why are this thing coming up again let's close it down and have done with it
that is the easy option that's the option of people who've got nothing between the ears
people who have intelligence and a conscience UNK with these problems and we've come to a conclusion which is as good a deal as we think we can get with the people of the area and with the labour party and i think he said that if people in this authority are sufficiently UNK for a sufficiently long time then people will change their minds
but there's another side to that
if people are UNK long enough you listen and you think well why are these people being UNK
are they are they have they are they stupid have they gone totally mad and they're UNK this thing for ever and ever and ever just for the sake of UNK and you have t to listen to what they say on this the argument that we're having here and have had here and the argument that we've had about old people's homes they've been two running UNK in this authority and hopefully today in both of them we'll be making progress and i think i'd like to
here
thank you and i think i'd like to just point out to mr
he's always fore he's forever UNK er these er centres in highfields with his village halls and er small village halls and that and that's very the very truth i'd like to refer him and he knows as well as i do that what he should really be comparing with are the youth and community provision across the county which is an enormous amount in excess of the amount we put into old people's homes and as mr so rightly said they're problems were gonna have to UNK with in the future and so you then look at what has been suggested what has been proposed and the point that professor made about the labour party having to make it work is because it is they and everybody knows it's they have been five UNK this thing all the way through
now they are putting their name to some positive action
now we and the conservatives in the past have been in favour of a decision and a positive action and we would have seen it through
it's only the labour party who's UNK it so now they're putting their name to this they're the ones who've changed they're putting their name to something different and therefore they're gonna have to live with it and if you look at it what have we got
what we've got is two centres working together with a member management sub committee they've retained the power to determine future management and UNK and staffing arrangements based on the principles set out below
so if that management committee decides in a year's time or two year's time thank you when we've been rolling on a bit and a lot of this has died down that they want a single headed project
we will go ahead and do it and local people will own the problem and own the project and if they want to continue to have two separate UNK it would show in the budget and i don't think mr 's right
i don't think that management committee will meet divide the money in two and then race off and never meet for another year
i think they will manage these project together and over time they will come together and they will work together
thank you
mr
thank you chairman
i would like to support the amendment and i would like to speak especially now the UNK tears from the tory party concern for the UNK
four speakers from the tory party mentioned the damage will be for the UNK area
how many times shall i stand up and lecture them about UNK i don't know
i have been here for more than two years i have UNK them
i have told them time and time again and the people have endorsed them and endorsed in voting pattern by giving me eighty nine percent of the vote
last april
how many times shall i remind them that
how many times i just don't understand
on the amendment side i am reluctant it does UNK on a local democracy but i agree with the liberal democrats it's a way forward and it's a responsibility of all of us i agree with roger when he mentioned that professor mentioned that this is the labour party like usually always mentioned it is your budget when the budget is approved it is the whole county council budget every member should be responsible for it
not just one party or central party or the third party
how many of you know what UNK yesterday this time outside moat centre
how many of you know that
there was a woman who was assaulted the UNK from the restaurant came down and beat a single man outside the moat centre
for mr when he mentioned two security staff they were er UNK they didn't do nothing whatsoever
yes we should sack him
we should all of us be responsible for that building not just myself or yourself
everyone should demand if the security guards are not UNK their duty we should not let them go by so
who insisted what
what
don't get into arguments carry on with your speech
unfortunately this is the way the tory always play their UNK on UNK they always think they are the champions of UNK issue unfortunately they do not know what UNK in that area they do not know the deprivation in that area
mark market might think a backlash they they'd better look for himself to remind himself there's no backlash in UNK
if you support the amendment it is a way forward for all of us and i support the amendment
thank you chairman
mr
thank you chair
can i first of all thank er mr for his er his concern about my having to er deal with new young members
could i in return could i
could i in return UNK with him for not having any new members
beg to differ
because i do feel sorry i sorry i consider it for not having any young new members
but i do feel i do feel that er he will be he will be assisted by having close people to clarify his thoughts for the council members
now erm if he had any as somebody says well no i think he has some thought er simply
might not be the correct ones
simply confused
erm i think the charge that has been laid against myself personally and my myself and my colleagues is the charge of UNK and changing our mind and i and i am grateful to c my colleague david for reminding us that we have in this county had two years two years when the labour party and the conservative party have been hand in UNK absolutely determined that the way forward in relation to homes elderly persons homes not that's not to close any and now we've had a complete UNK face when they've changed their minds and they've come along with us
how interesting
mr has also asked me whether it is true that if i can't get what i want second best will do
i think the argument should be put slightly differently
would you prefer to have nothing rather than something
because for two years for two years the intentions of the conservative group which have been the intentions of ourselves have delivered on the moat UNK questions delivered nothing
that is the reality of what er mike said and i'm sorry he pinched my line politics is the art of the possible and that is a message i'm afraid that the conservatives on this council have never adopted
time and time again they sit on the UNK saying this is what we think don't talk to us about it don't debate it don't ask us to think about it take it or leave it if you don't give us what we want we'll sit back and UNK and UNK and they've played i think that's a very irresponsible line they've played in the five years i've been on this council and i hope that er again the issue on the next item on the agenda represents a change of heart on their behalf
of course goes on about what he always goes on about and er i would remind him that the supplementary estimates which is in the amendment here is also in the amended motion which is proposed by the conservatives and had all party support on every committee that it's come to
finally i would say that to erm mike i think the amendment that is now before us which we are supporting goes considerably further than the original UNK option
and has a combined budget which is in my view the important thing that i believe was necessary in the life of the economic circumstances
that combined budget will inevitably involve a redistribution of resources you are going to live up to what you are now putting your name to
i don't think that mr remarks were helpful
because i don't think the question of what's going on outside moat centre today or yesterday or the day after has a lot to do with the actual alternatives that we've been
what it does have a lot to do with is that the moat centre has not had clear significant management on the ground and what we're proposing here today should produce that in the very near future and what the proposals that mr proposals would have done is not produced that in the significant future and i think that's the point that really needs to be stressed
thank you
mr
it's not my day really earlier today i had to admit to being grateful to john UNK now i'm gonna have to be
i know it's terrible isn't it i never thought i'd say that
now i'm gonna have to say i'm gonna be grateful to mr it's a really bad day
no i am grateful to mr because he's finally UNK in my mind something that's been UNK me the longer i stay on this council about exactly what the tories see their role here as and it's now very clear to me more than ever and that is that if you want to be UNK and negative and if you go on long enough being UNK and negative what you can end up doing is that you'll find yourself eventually in a position going on long enough that you can make totally meaningless speeches but at least you'll get nice headlines in the paper and that seems to me the whole essence of the tory strategy
when my colleague to my right here roger and myself put forward a motion at last council on this issue UNK led by our glorious leader to my left i would like to say that we've set up
now what i would like to say is that we've made clear that we're with certain very clear objectives in pushing forward in saying that certain things had to be achieved and when i read the UNK piece of paper or whatever colour we want to call it
i see a set of conclusions that achieve almost everything that was demanded at that time and i am grateful to everybody concerned who's actually sat down and actually really thought about what we're trying to do and everybody has made some compromise here and i shall certainly support this amendment and i shall make the compromise because the one thing in here that i thought was necessary that isn't there is the statement that there will be a head of centre and having actually worked in a project head of sorry head of project and having actually worked in a situation where i was a joint manager erm in the long run i think people will see the wisdom of a single head of project
but that's up fo that's up to people experience t to conclude
but the main there UNK is we haven't actually changed our position we have actually stated clearly that we wanted to achieve something we wanted to make sure that what was being provided in that community was the best thing possible within the resources available and that things developed on this amendment takes us that way forward and we are at least being clear to our principles rather than just being UNK
mr
thanks chair
i just like to start off by saying and just reminding the council well in particular mr in light of what he said that he doesn't understand what mr is on about well he's never understood the issue of the merger in highfields
mr has made more publicity on this issue than any other councillor
i think there's no issue in his patch that he might want to talk about
but he's made national headlines local and every other headlines that comes about regarding this issue of the merger
but i think in seconding this motion i think it's a way forward and i think it's better late than never i think what it talks about that we would not be here today mr chairman if this would have been agreed by what was put by the officers two and half years ago
it's not a UNK system it actually positively talks about moving forward as professor states it in the economical situation the council is in
it talks about one budget covering for the two centres and it also talks about two heads of centres which is more UNK and more rational than any other s situation that would have been if the merger decision would have stayed
there has never been an argument put by anyone to convince myself or people who have protested against the merger a rational argument has never been put against what people have said that the merger is a rational way forward
i think it would have been a disaster and a recipe for disaster because practically if you know what the situation is in the moat centre and the highfields youth and community centre then people would have never UNK to that change
i'm not saying that people would have never changed their ideas but if it would have been done in the manner that it would have been done in the first place and if people would have been told about their future lives and if people had been would've accepted what was going on in light of all the decisions that have been taken previously regarding the merger issue
i think these proposals not only are a way forward but also in light of what is actually happening in the area of highfields with er the high numbers of unemployment with the high rate of people UNK in education i think for the last two and a half years there has been no clear guidelines or structure that has UNK brought about any results in the two centres to move forward where people have lost out by this issue being bureaucratic and a political football that's being kicked about and i think it's about time where we now have cross party consensus that we move positively forward and work towards these proposals
i mean in so i come here today with a petition that i presented that also talks about proposing to abolish the merger i mean this is a move just one step away from that but i still feel in what was proposed at the last full council meeting and i would express my views to the officers that in light of what has been suggested today is actually implemented to the wording as it stands because the joint working party that had been er written up previously never did meet although if i can inform it was only the officers who actually met up and i hope that in light of all the working group and the two heads of centres covering for each other would be UNK applied
in light of er
near time
all the consultation that also talks about in this paper is met with the two centres the management committee of highfields youth and UNK centre and also the users of the moat centre and i think in light of everything that's gone on i think it's substantially a success to stand here and say that we have at least achieved some result and i formally would welcome the UNK supporting this afternoon and i'm grateful for the turn that the UNK have made and in light of er what er mr the involvement mr has put in
time now please
thank you
thanks chair
mr do you wish the right of reply
no it's mr
mr
not really chair
i'm mean we've discussed it often but i would be grateful if we could
it's mr i'd hate to stop mr in full cry
okay then chairman i would er recommend that we support the amendment moved by mr
right those in favour
the answer too is other than to try and work towards the two communities will agree on something and that's how your how you'll like it
agree
well don't have to be just
john created
i mean it's looking now
i mean there are some people in britain who feel that if we were to mount a really effective counter terrorist operation
just say it was some revolutionary group
i mean that people like you know have said that the british secret intelligence have been have been doing now for a quite long time have been UNK a sort of UNK war and er i'm sure some of it's true
m i five operates it in northern ireland and has got this whole series you may well have seen the television programme recently about these people who work UNK and who work for the intelligence and they work themselves into the i r a and become members and then they feed the information back to british it's been very successful and a couple of UNK is risky and we eventually when they are discovered who these people are they have to be given new UNK plastic surgery and the works
could u n troops be sent in
it would be very difficult wouldn't it because the british then would be sort of UNK that you know what would they do if their own troops were sent in what would they do
well they'd basically do what the british troops would do but they wouldn't lose much hate against them would they
hate but there'd still be this kind of feeling that you know why are they here what is the purpose
you see the problem is we've yet to discover what the purpose is of all this
i mean for the UNK the purpose is a united ireland
for the UNK the purpose is to remain part of the u k and those two are so far apart those two positions that it's impossible to see a bridge between them and that's the difficulty
that is the big point
what are the UNK like in schools
sort of history and things do the UNK teach in it's the UNK fault and stuff like that
a lot of bias yeah i mean because that 's that's the way it is over there there's an awful lot of prejudice and there's an awful lot of
they sort of bring up
they bring up their kids to hate
yeah that 's and it's got worse in the last twenty or thirty years it's got much worse i think
breeding another generation of terrorists
exactly yeah
all the history is about erm years ago when and all that
oh yeah
so it's actually all about what the english did
yes it is
comes down
it is yeah and these stories are passed on about what the british you know troops did a hundred and fifty years ago
it's a sort of passed on from one generation to the next and it is you know you will see people hear people talking about it as if it was yesterday
this UNK builds up and is then passed on to the next generation
o k so i thought that was useful because it might actually is something that because it's been in the news a lot this year hasn't it
if i was setting an exam paper for summer it would be something i would think about putting in not that i am setting it in case you think i hadn't
what are we doing now
er we're still looking at erm and congress that essay is due in today isn't it
what
present UNK essay
alright
sorry
you you've had it for about three or four weeks
sorry
you being serious
i am indeed
really
yeah question of it was
using and instead of or
oh that 's
remember that one
thank you
one question finished
well we've we're looking at congress now until that that's it it's our last topic
yeah
o k can i have those in then fairly shortly
yes
i've got UNK i've got UNK i've got UNK so who can i hassle michael well done
UNK
right so david i reminded you about that letter when are you gonna bring it
tomorrow
tomorrow are you going to give it to mr or do you want to give it to me to give to him or whatever suits you
give it to you
right
in registration yeah
o k so look let me just go through these notices er for today's tutorial period one or two changes erm again a thought for the week from the UNK to begin with during the approaching season of lent the best thing we can do is to centre our thoughts on what jesus christ did for us through his passion death and resurrection
he paid a debt which he did not owe because we are a debt that we will never be able to pay
please also remember that ash wednesday which is this wednesday is one of the only two days a year on which we are asked to fast and to UNK from eating meat
if we're UNK another possible act of UNK would be to UNK from alcohol or cigarettes
whatever we do for lent could be done for an intention or our families
usual er mass times throughout the week eight thirty five all days this week including thursday but wednesday which is ash wednesday there's a mass at five past nine in the chapel so what's normally at nine o'clock on wednesday
UNK
so UNK is not there this wednesday
mass at nine o'clock this wednesday with no mass on thursday at ten
so there's gonna be a few timetable UNK
there's no UNK on wednesday
there's no UNK wednesday morning but it UNK it UNK on thursday
when
i'll tell you in a minute
so timetable changes for the week and taking that into account include like you said like i said mass instead of UNK on wednesday
no other timetable changes on wednesday but on thursday nine to ten forty is a double UNK
now how's that different that would normally be
thursday
yeah
that's right it's a two normally
well it isn't this week so it's d one d two d one from nine to ten d two from ten to ten forty
so your UNK that you miss on wednesday makes an appearance along with the other UNK that normally lives on thursday in a one and a half hour session from nine to ten forty
ten forty registration ten forty five break
i'll send this round in a moment er double UNK b between break and lunch is that usual
yeah
erm a two is now at one thirty
so that's when the d two would have been after lunch yeah
instead it's a two which would have been at nine o'clock and
from nine to ten forty five or ten forty instead you've got the UNK from the afternoon plus the UNK from the wednesday so double UNK one and a half hours on
yep and then e one e two as usual on thursday
second year parents' evening on wednesday seven to nine o'clock er second years you know that it probably makes sense to be there erm with your parents er this wednesday the no not this wednesday week the twenty third which is next wednesday there's no leisure centre for first year students er and in fact there are no wednesday afternoon activities at all next wednesday
that's not this wednesday it's wednesday the twenty third
erm it says they'll be a tutorial period for students to work on record of achievement UNK and personal statements o k that's second and first years
i don't know good question
er UNK two thousand er was last thursday afternoon at three o'clock er a number of students weren't able to come some people may have forgotten
i don't think there's anyone here in this tutor group who didn't go who were supposed to go
private exam entries
if you've been entered privately then you need to pay your exam fees for this UNK exams er as soon as possible er mrs is collecting those
the twenty four hour fast is this wednesday because it's ash wednesday is that right
it was last
was it
no it was last week that's right
anyway any money sponsorship money erm you're asked to hand in to mr as soon as possible
one year student interviews i think doesn't apply
er notes to all students it says it is not acceptable to take food and drinks into the corridors
i have to remind you all you that food and drink should be kept in the dining room sounds reasonable enough
if you want a note about timetable change i'm sending this round so note it down
so er
has christine been seen this morning
right erm some UNK were you away on friday
you were slightly late weren't you
margaret i've got you down as absent tuesday wednesday thursday friday last week

yeah i was away on tuesday and i trip on wednesday
so visit
i was here actually
and you were in thursday friday
can you do one of these please for tuesday
brian were you in monday and wednesday last
wednesday you were
david i need to ask you what that's there
what's that
oh god
hello catherine
hello sorry i'm late
that's nice
does she get upset
oh no
right i'll be for the rest of the tutorial really erm find yourselves something to do i just really want to follow up er the little amount of time that i spent with second years er looking at their action plans
er all of you all of you UNK some sort of organisation and planning of revision so i've got some ideas that you might want to try on that score so first years i'm sure like clare you must have some work to do
so you're not here on wednesday as well anna is that right
sir
you're not here on wednesday either
really
yeah
that's all
it's going
is that going
no it's stopped
fair enough
right
okay let's come on to the report itself erm tt okay i've forgotten who was
he was based there basically
eh
okay and he was
right
no i it was i think richard and i
well
were doing the first
mm
yeah
yeah so erm i can start it
okay
and i think erm the article itself erm s says in the first part it seems to be written in a very sort of erm very pro peasant style it's like a justification of things that are happening he s says that the reasons for the peasant movement were the exact opposite of what the gentry in UNK and UNK were saying erm that the that the party that the revolutionary authorities had taken wrong measures because they thought that the reasons for these movements were otherwise and these we they were considered detrimental so they had to change these er original wrong UNK measures to benefit the future of the revolution
now the development of the peasant movement in UNK may be divided into two periods
now the first period erm which runs from erm the first part of the first period sorry runs from er january to june nineteen twenty six
now that's when the movement was erm mainly underground it was erm s organization and working together er in a sort of a UNK manner things were very UNK er and then after june it became more open as it became the er movement became more accepted or well known it became difficult to continue it underground so it became more open
now the member ship up to nine september nineteen twenty six was between about three and four hundred thousand but usually what happened is that when people would join they put their name down and it was the whole family joined
do you think er i don't know if that's true
yeah i thought that was a bit erm
cos he's saying he's saying by twenty seven some time in twenty nineteen twenty seven there were two million about two million names and therefore that meant that there were ten million members
yeah
mm
obviously
well after reading
right
yes i think they they're gonna take an optimistic view aren't they
they're trying to i it it's er
yes
i it is trying to er to sort of talk up the figures
mm
to put reasons why that this doesn't mean the it actually means more and i think to a certain extent there may be justification some people may have put their name down and meant the whole family
mm
but possibly this wasn't the majority case
er but i think that's the theme that runs through the whole thing especially when he's talking about his fourteen great achievements is the fact that basically i mean he's trying to sell himself as you said before he's a pretty UNK member at this you know erm at this case and there therefore obviously he's out to make a name for himself
yeah because the UNK going back to UNK and he wants to impress
yeah
the leadership in UNK
and i think obviously everything that he says has to be taken with a pinch of salt but we'll come on to that
right now the second period returning to the article
sorry
was
from october to january nineteen twenty seven and this was a period that was is really UNK by revolutionary action
membership of the party increased dramatically to two million people and then the masses under leadership again saying there was they're looking at about ten million and they're saying half the peasants in the are organized that these are people who are who are at the forefront of the of the movement involvement is very high
now the main target of the attack were the local tyrants the evil gentry and the UNK landlords people who'd previously held power before who the peasants or who the communists were trying to take the power away from they were people who were it was possible to UNK the peasants against er again UNK everything er the people are evil you know that they were tyrants
and in passing as well as the movement gathered pace they also hit out against UNK ideas and institutions other things that the peasants could be lead to believe had UNK them
and that the peasant associations had now become the sole erm sort of er th they were the authority they began to take over control they were th the leading the thing
now erm the wealthy peasants or and sort of and other people who were possibly sort of er small landlords they were trying to get involved in these associations because they felt they could see they were gathering pace and that the cost of exclusion would be very high
it seems they had two er registers really one register meant that you were a part of the movement the other register i imagine meaning you were actually an enemy of this movement so if you got on that register you were in that would er spell very bad news so consequently you were trying to join the first association
unfortunately the people er involved in the associations we were trying to block people joining if you were wealthy in any way or if you had er you were a landlord they didn't want you to be to be er a member of this cos i think there was fear that if you were to join you may be able to yeah
yeah
UNK your authority
so er i mean the power of the gentry just moved very rapidly towards the power of the peasants in a
very short period of time
now erm everyone thought basically this was terrible that i mean that erm er people i think a lot of people would see this the violence the UNK and say that this is bad this is very unlawful UNK and dangerous and this is it is not acceptable
just before you go on sorry erm er would an official of a UNK peasant association walk into the house of a rich peas peasant register in hand and say will you please join the peasant association how would the rich peasant answer
a UNK well behaved one would say peasant association i've lived here for decades UNK my land i've never heard of such a thing before and i have managed to live alright i advise you to give it up
yes i
so isn't that what are you saying
well i think this is in the very early stages er of the association when things were
mm
beginning to go when they're looking for members it was important to get er high involvement in this
now their the prime target the people who they r they really want to join i think are the poor peasant
now it goes on to say that they need to get the middle peasants to join and to go out and do more explanatory work among them
yes er i mean they er they want the whole peasant movement involved i mean after all the peasants they're although they're a wealthy peasant these people are not enormously wealthy they may be wealthy on a relative scale in a village but certainly not er you know er half as UNK anything like as wealthy as a the landlords the large land owners and so on and that it is a peasant movement the whole peasant UNK they wanted to involve
yeah because only but we're
but all mao's
talking about the whole peasant population
mm
but all mao's trying to say when he
but rich peasants
yeah but all mao's trying to say was
are only ten percent so why are you try why are you saying they want to get the rich peasants when the poor peasants UNK seventy percent of the peasant population
well i think that they want people from they want the whole peasant base they want UNK they want as many people from the peasant base as is possible
now in the early stages you certainly want to encourage as many people from this base to join when the development the movement UNK pace it's possible to say right we possibly w there's some sort of the wealthy peasants we don't really want they're the ones who UNK under the old scheme of things they were the ones who had some power and influence and er by even drawing them into the association there is a danger that they may sort of assume the lead or take an active role which would be detrimental which would UNK the movement and try and make it er less revolutionary and more UNK they would go back to sort of reform of the old system rather than the UNK
but i th i think what we're talking about is the fact th that ma you know he's writing in nineteen twenty seven that he's not quite sure about the means to an end he's sort of writing he you know it's in a way it's like writing an essay
it's to a certain extent you start writing the essay and then once you start writing it you suddenly realize what you want to say i mean he started writing this erm and he he's not quite sure i th i think you know where it's all leading to
er i think what he's trying to say about the rich peasants is that er that they were always UNK the movement it was only later on when they find that you know that they need to get involved otherwise their own positions are er threatened then they're joining and they're only joining but were not actually participating in it they're not moving along and so that's what that's why he's making a distinction between different types of peasants
you know he obviously sees rich peasants as you know a more er UNK class of peasant i mean he sees the poor peasants as the real er UNK of the revolution the people who have done all the work and erm UNK er security at an early stage
mm
and really got the momentum going and that it was the middle peasants that he needed to get the support so that they can move forward and have a revolution
yes so in he he's very much putting the emphasis on the peasants and the poor peasants
yes
and it it's really saying okay you it's okay to exclude the rich
mm
is the point that you're making is that when you look at the evidence later on it sort of conflicts with that
erm to a certain degree
i was just i was just
yeah
but we might come across this again a bit later on th that i it's entirely possible that what is being said at the early part isn't actually borne out by the details that come later on
mm
cos he changes his actual definition of peasants later on doesn't he
yeah
yes yeah
but no wh what i'm when i said borne out later on i mean later on in the report
right
not later on in terms of time
right okay
yes i think so erm er i think really it's that as the movement UNK pace and landlords or small landlords and other people who have UNK under the old scheme try and gain admission they are blocked
mm
because there are fears that they will be detrimental
now there's obviously this is quite a th there's a lot of violence involved in this the targets are being hit and i it's not political actually it's active people on the streets erm there are some people being killed there's
yeah
injury and all this going on
now to a lot a lot of people this is unacceptable and terrible and er it's er he's arguing here that the fact is that the peasant masses have risen to fulfil their historic mission and that the forces of rural democracy have to rise to UNK the forces of rural feudalism
he's sort of saying he's UNK it in a very marxist way he said this is our duty what we're doing is natural it's a process of his history you know that there's nothing we can do avoid this and we should in fact be pleased to see th this actually taking place it's er it's not a question at all of the parents going peasants going too far it's not er a UNK of terror at all erm in fact more than that it it's a sort of erm it it's not even UNK i it's a it's a course of history
and he then justifies particular incidents of er of violence and attack by saying that it's the local tyrants the evil gentry the UNK the UNK landlords who have driven the peasants to do this anyway
the most violent of the UNK and the most serious disorders have occurred in places where tyrants UNK the worst UNK
it was er i mean the peasants apparently were sort of accounting they were looking and say well this particular er landlord was very UNK he was very anti us and in er because of that he will get a worse erm punishment than the other ones would
