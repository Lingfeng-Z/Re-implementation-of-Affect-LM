now th he was saying that it's being argued here that very seldom is it that the punishment exceeded the crime that they're able to assess look at the behaviour of the people in power before the movement er gathered pace and to assess how they er they were how sort of UNK and so on and by saying that depending on how you did before hand you w you now your punishment it will be a UNK accordingly which is an interesting concept i'm not sure quite how accurate these assessments could've been i think really when things get going it's er really very difficult to stop them
and also that he then goes on to say that the revolution it isn't it's not a re final thing it's not an UNK er he says it's not like writing an essay you know all these er UNK that i mean basically the revolution is an over it needs force er and i it's it is a violent y you don't in order for the revolution to have been a success it needs to be
right
UNK
so he's setting up justification for
yes
violent revolution
yes
right
mm yeah there is a need to exceed proper limits he says that proper limits have to be exceeded in order to right a wrong er it's also he says necessary to create terror for a while
erm you know almost you have to go too far or to go such er an extent it would be erm and the force simply to erm stop counter revolution and to UNK all you know deep seated authorities that had lasted thousands of years i mean to overcome that you do need a revolution
erm when he moves on to talk about the movement of the UNK this is
right can i just stop there just for a second
er
yeah
are you happy with this as a strategy
as a strategy to involve peas as a justification do you mean or
mm
erm yeah i mean i suppose so
i mean if they'd been UNK for thousands of years i mean the whole power of the landlords is in the councils in the erm UNK everywhere
i mean but they can't
have they been UNK for thousands of years or was it more recent
well i mean relations have existed for thousands of years
i mean for in order for there to be peasant power authority i don't think it can come gradually
i mean they do need the greatest force
mm
and if they do they do things at half measure it's more likely to be UNK i would've thought
i reckon revolution
oh yeah but
UNK gotta be violent as well
mm
but erm i mean obviously
we've looked at the landlord tenant relationship before erm and we know that it's got worse you know with the nineteen thirties and the world depression
this is nineteen twenty six
but yeah exactly which is why as UNK as i would like to be this morning but
but basically what i'm trying to say is that erm you know it's nineteen twenty seven the world depression hasn't happened yet erm and he's assuming that you know well you just said UNK masses for thousands of years i'd say you know balls to that
erm ba basically i don't think it's that bad and i mean obviously he he's making the picture i would say he's making the picture out to be f far worse than it actually is because he is taking an extreme sort of left point of view so to speak
UNK on the situation that's getting worse whereas i don't think it
was it nineteen twenty seven
yeah i don't think he's making it that much worse than it is i think it is still quite bad at this point in time but it's you know since revolution yes the landlords still hold
the landlords still hold all the power
hold a lot of power but i mean
as you know as everyone's suggesting
but they may have been in UNK and around UNK
i mean i it was a UNK area
there clearly were a group not j the UNK but underneath them a set of landlords who were extremely you you've got this gentry who are probably UNK the peasantry
and e even if it's not general th there may be something in the argument this was what was happening in
yeah
in UNK
one thing about the strategy is that it seems to me the ultimate goal is perhaps to get rid of the UNK
yeah
and then perhaps you know UNK
right
generally erm and if we're talking about the strategy we've gotta sort of er sort out for ourselves whether we think the strategy of getting rid of the local tyrants and the evil gentry is the wa right way to actually achieve that the aims of getting rid of UNK
yes
a are you happy with that
erm no i well
i mean well y you know you're a UNK of this are you are you gonna go along with that
i'm not quite sure really
you see i think if i i'm trying to en envisage it if you are erm you live in an area and er there have been some er UNK of violence of you know a nasty nature some people have been killed there's been sort of erm disruption and er and so on i don't know how you'd feel i think you may feel erm a bit concerned about this you'd see things breaking down and you wouldn't see quite where it's going to lead
you may come across er UNK like this but you wouldn't be sure when you they're UNK it by saying that this is natural this is a progression in er a historical progression and that in fact that it's a erm it's only because the landlords were sort of evil and nasty to us that i it that they this is happening
i'm not sure how well that would wash with some people they're i in an area that like yeah which was very er UNK and where the UNK and the landlords were UNK the peasants i can see that there's enough UNK up er fear er and UNK so that this might work but in other areas i don't know effective this would be that you
er we said last week that the on the only the only real way that the peasants were gonna er mobilize was if they thought that they could actually win and so surely the violence would have been a means of saying we're a UNK force to be UNK with
yeah
and that would attract more peasants wouldn't it
i mean he does actually make er expose di differences between different areas where he says peasant associations er where the landlords are the worse they will suffer the worse punishment whereas
mm yeah
er people that have behaved more er better you know they may be only fined or whatever and er although it's a revolution i mean it's a rise of an association of a power to sort of to erm to UNK landlord power so become this sort of balance almost
i mean in the end he's talking about they've got the supreme authority but er but not actually yet even though he talks about revolution they're not actually UNK the land unless they actually think the UNK done something wrong like erm rents or whatever
i mean so then it's a reaction
mm
not being er pro active
so are they looking for it to lead to a sort of getting back to last week's terminology a restoration or are they actually do they know that they're getting involved in a revolution
ah
well what can i put it slightly differently i mean what is mao talking about here
he's talking about a revolution
yeah
mm
there's no messing with that
no he's
mao is into revolution
yeah well we wouldn't expect him to say anything else really
right
the wealthy
but i think the
peasants are hoping for restoration or he's
yeah
implying you sort of see that they are reluctant to get involved in this they've got a lot to lose from this
i mean if you if things are going if you're doing okay
well they're not necessarily
then you probably don't wanna die if you've got absolutely nothing
mm
to live for then it's different
but are you living are you living are you okay so you've got nothing to live for erm and you're finding something else to live for is that revolution really do you want the
okay
and everything or do you just wanna get er say system twenty years ago
no revolution i'd say
for the for the poor peasants who al almost have nothing to lose
mm
mm
from this then i think that in fact the they would be more and more involved the more sort of radical they're going to
and do they think they've got everything to gain
oh yeah
well i mean it's UNK i think it's quite important to remember it's sort of a means to an end
i mean we we're only talking about you know er an area very close to er whatever it's called
mm
erm
erm you know i in the area UNK erm and that therefore i mean how relevant is it to the rest of china
and sort of mao has sort of done this report and he's then sending it back to UNK and my impression is that UNK is then taking this you know t to be read that basically that's the situation in the whole of china
mm
and sort of you're jumping to enormous UNK
yes
erm we i mean we we've looked at the peasant tenant relationship erm and my opinion is that basically you know it wasn't quite as bad as everyone's made out erm but al okay we're saying that UNK were very UNK and they were a huge fact to be considered but in UNK and within the south erm eastern region say
mm
but i mean i still think at the end of the day that you know we still have to realize that we are only looking at a minute erm area of china and therefore you know how relevant is it
this is this is a period before the kuomintang sort of you know decided came into power or whatever and
bu but no it haven't they just UNK
th they've come through and they've taken control of the area
and isn't that why he's been sent there rather than anything else cos he's trying to see the effects of the new control and see if you know
yeah right yes well yes
the peasant associations are
right yeah
and it well you know it wouldn't really be worthwhile him going anywhere else because that's where
mm
UNK
i thought they came in s sort of like i in into proper power in nineteen twenty eight
nineteen twenty eight yes i mean a as a sort of central government
bu but yes i mean er at this stage they'd just got rid of the UNK
mm
and the kuomintang is not yet set up any local government or national government it's before that but there are but it is i mean i take your point about it being sort of a UNK
yeah
but i if we take it first of all back well wh okay what was happening in that UNK and then the extent to which you can UNK
right
but see hold on y but you're saying an and this broadly would be like the er quote right wing view that there's nothing really much wrong in the countryside landlord tenant relationships are not that bad we can just really leave it alone and certainly we shouldn't have any violence because that's gonna be counter productive
mm
and what mao is saying is quotes such talk may sound UNK but in fact it's wrong
firstly the local tyrants evil gentry and UNK landlords have themselves driven the peasants to this so th there is more to it than that and secondly a revolution is not a dinner party or writing an essay or painting a picture or doing UNK it cannot be so UNK so UNK and gentle so UNK kind UNK and UNK
revolution is UNK an act of violence by which one UNK another
rural revolution the revolution by which the peasantry UNK the power of the feudal landlord
and then going on to say in doing that you've got to be violent
mm
now they are two clearly very different UNK
there is a no we mustn't no things aren't too bad just leave it alone it'll be okay and somebody coming in and saying no that's not the way you should look at it that there is UNK if you're gonna have a revolution it has got to be violent and it is right to be violent
mm
cos i mean it's easy to think cos mao we know he's a communist or whatever
mm
to think this report would be about revolution and erm i mean what strikes me is that there's a real debate going on between
yes
the communism the kuomintang which are united at the time and obviously the kuomintang putting forward the idea of a restoration
mm
so that the landlord class is still you know to be preserved and obviously he's UNK that
right
and so all these things like er is it terrible or fine
yeah
or is it UNK or
yes
blah i mean it's er one er just the two sides you know whether you see revolution as necessary and right and
yeah but i think that's the importance basically i mean reading through this it's very easy to sort of in a way you know go to this point of view because it was written at the time but i mean we still now that it was a very sort of say left wing point of view
yeah
and therefore what he said was should be taken with a pinch of salt because i mean he was selling his idea
but it but it's still gotta be taken seriously
yeah it's gotta be taken seriously but i mean you know there's no reason why we should believe every word he says i mean he's sort of
but the other thing is though that he's er he's also saying that you know this i if this is an actual situation
mm
i mean if the communists actually saying this is a force i mean he says at the beginning
yeah
erm several hundred million peasants will rise like a UNK storm like a UNK a force so UNK and violent that no power however great will be able to hold it back
and obviously you know the idea of this report is to say you know should the communists er trail behind and or stand in their way
and obviously the kuomintang are rather s he sees them standing in their way or
right
at least UNK behind and he wants er the communists to ma break away from this idea and to really lead the peasants
he says that th the communists have got haven't got the erm the reasons right for this and that they ne if they don't get them right then they are going to it will be bad for the revolution they need to
right
get these things sorted out
cos i mean you could say he was biased but i mean he obviously thinks this is actually what's happening
tt and he obviously thinks that you know well you've got to move with it
i mean he mu he must've believed that there is this UNK force building up
yes
erm
well i was gonna go on actually and erm slightly and talk about the violence his justification of
yeah can i just stop you just for a second
if we just go back to what we've just said and read the first paragraph wh what he's really saying here is that a revolution is taking place
exactly yeah
and erm that there is this UNK and he goes on in a very short time in ce central southern and northern UNK i e the whole of china several hundred million peasants will rise up like a UNK storm like a UNK a force so UNK and violent no power however great will be able to hold it back
there is a revolution is in process and it is it it's going to ta it's gonna is going to take over
twenty two years later
you can't ma you can't
what
no i mean th that's what he's saying but i mean
right
basically he's studied this minute area of china and basically from that minute area of china from his experiences bearing in mind that he's obviously trying to sell revolution he is then UNK about the whole of china
right
now from the from the evidence that we've all looked at over the l past few weeks and tell me if i'm boring you
erm from the evidence we've looked at over the past few weeks you know i would say that
i'd say i'd say that was a bit of that was erm a gross UNK erm
okay
maybe even a lie
well
right
but this is what he wants
well you know over the last few weeks we know that er
well yeah it's er this is pure propaganda isn't it
yeah
we know there's a huge increase in
well i think as long as you realize that
UNK and so as contemporary surely you know er he hasn't got or anything so he can he he's got his own er political UNK
yeah
but erm i don't actually think that there was revolution in process going if there was if you know a UNK a huge increase in
it must be more than propaganda though
yeah
he must actually believe in
he was a UNK
i yeah i think
to his own committee to his own he would actually say well i've been to er lead them into having a revolution to open their eyes and then to UNK them erm now he's not saying that he's saying that
no but if he was saying that about UNK well what chance do we stand if we're not even you know
right
getting some control of UNK then
right just to get a bit of where did mao come from
i mean was he a rich peasant was he a poor peasant or
er his father was a rich peasant
oh
but i think he seems to be somebody who is who wants activity who wants heavy involvement
mm
personally an and from er and the rest and he he's gone to this area and he's looked and he he's seen and he may have interpreted this or wanted to interpret it so that when his report went back that the he was saying that we must get a move on to the people in the party saying that we need to get involved now we need to be in all these areas we need to be helping things develop and being a part at the front
he's trying to give the impression that you need to do something immediately
right
so what he's saying is l look you guys a revolution is taking place and we need to be in there leading it
yeah
mm
and it is not just a revolution it's a rural revolution it's a revolution which is taking place through the peasantry
now
but that UNK what we were looking
i think that's fair enough because a revolution could actually happen
at before surely
no i mean i think that
i mean we we've been looking before you know that the situation got
yeah
incredibly er you know UNK basically during the nineteen thirties
yeah
and w we haven't suggested that there was a revolution already taking place
right
so it's entirely possible that all of this is UNK
well that's what i would argue
right
okay
but he may he may have seen things and
yes
either UNK or consciously interpreted them to mean something other than actually what may have been taking place
he may because he really seems to want something to happen
mm
he wants activity that he may have er or alternatively maybe the area is genuinely
and we might we might be wrong
okay isn't it is it that there is actually some change going on
no
there is some change going on in the rural economy and perhaps he does want to interpret it as er a revolution which the communists can actually get involved in so he's writing his paper and saying look this is happening it may not be a UNK revolution but it
but yeah well it may not be you know
right
erm a purely class thing erm but we can actually get in there
right
and er lead these people and
yes
yeah
right
and clearly something is happening i mean millions of peasants are joining
mm
are becoming involved in a peasant movement are joining peasant associations that they are they're taking up arms the they're doing a whole range of things something quite big is happening here
but perhaps it's i mean you know what you've always argued the reason why it's happening is because of increasing UNK
right okay
and th that's why the UNK changing
sure
and mao's just
but it but it's okay but it's still happening that change
wha what
can we just take this on a on a slightly more political level
why do you think he would need to say this to the communist leadership and why might it might be quite contentious and controversial th this idea of look a revolution is taking place and it's led by the peasants
well they may want to lead it themselves and actually
who might want to lead it
the communists
right
and in actually UNK
and what sort of revolution would the communists be leading
a rural one er the pe poor peasants
go back to a marxist position
they'd want a they would want class revolution through
right and wh which in classic marxist ideology
UNK
urban UNK
which is the urban UNK
mm
right
and what's your wha what's the classic marxist view of the peasantry
there were absolutely conservative
right yeah
and they the you don't get a revolution from the peasantry
mm
er pre precisely the revolution is led by the urban working class
right yeah
the UNK
and here is mao coming along and saying look a revolution is taking place and you guys don't know anything about it and it is being led by the peasantry
communist with the kuomintang i mean wo would they be of the opinion that revolution should happen but maybe they would be thinking more in terms of an urban revolution or would they be er very similar opinion to the kuomintang you know
the er certain sections of the communist party of which mao was a member and certain sections of the left wing of the kuomintang were taking a very similar view on rural revolution
erm the kuomintang make no mistake about it were committed to a national revolution erm an and therefore they were revolutionary they were they were claiming to be as revolutionary as the communists
okay there might be a different way of getting there an and they might er wouldn't have sought to do it through ca class conflict but they were as revolutionary
so and certainly mao was not that out of line with the left of the kuomintang at that time
but they were talking about forty years or so
yeah sure
so wh when we actually say communist i mean it does seem odd that it would be controversial to the communists for mao to come back and talk about revolution
indeed
UNK er particularly a rural re led revolution
but he's also saying isn't he at the end of this paragraph or he's implying that th this is this revolution is not happening because we the communists are making it happen it is happening and we need to react to it and somehow we've therefore got a choice we can either trail behind or we can lead it
and mao is making a bid a revolution is taking place and b we have got to lead it and it it's a rural revolution
now those are very big challenges
yeah
to the communist party given their approach
no you're absolutely right it might all be wrong it might be totally UNK in which case it's likely to go wrong but to begin with we have to accept that this is what mao is saying
i mean mao will have no merit in actually UNK it deliberately to try and UNK his leaders because
er
b because i would've thought that
if he that in the sense that if he came back and said the UNK already happening all we need to do is to get
yeah
to the front and lead it
yeah
but i mean if that actually wasn't happening you'd think UNK come back and said we've got to get in there now you know get our message across and make a revolution movement
but they could he would almost need a different emphasis
but what better what better way to sell yourself
you're a member of the radical party
right
right
what better way to sell yourself than come up with a contentious issue backed up by evidence that you
but i mean it's sort of it's
which is exactly what mao was trying to do
but couldn't you just first the potential i mean it there wasn't there so let's get in and really
you know the course of revolution
i think if mao was to go back and say it's happening you've got it wrong i've seen
yes
i know he's it's like a claim to i should be in charge
yeah
well
it's a sort of well
but if he's wrong i mean you can't just come back and be contentious if you're wrong cos i mean otherwise you know it's of no pr of no work
well he possibly may have felt that he could erm very quickly UNK things up but there we it wasn't quite to the extent that this was happening but there was the chance it would
if he doesn't want to talk about potential because it will er not make the necessary action immediate but if he can come back and say i've seen and i know what's going on
which he is saying
i think it's very important the second and third sentence
yeah
he says that he's called together these fact finding conferences he's got the information therefore he er he has a right to say something he should be listened to cos he's done the research
yeah
and the people sitting in UNK who have never been in the rural areas which is
yeah
was true they don't know what's going on
look i've been there i've seen it got the here we are
mm
but he s seems to be making a claim to be to sort of promote it within the
yeah
the system he wants to be
sure but is it well i'm not sure one could say he wants his ideas to be accepted not necessarily it's not a bid
not po personal or anything
so presumably he's actually believing these ideas i mean i would've thought he if he came back and said there's tension there's you know it was between the two classes and we go in and we direct them in a certain way put the right ideas in their mind that we can UNK the revolution
but he's not saying that right UNK thought he he'd actually come up and say er he would have said that for you know for his sake and also for the good of the party
yeah i mean it's there's an interesting issue that whether you whether mao really believed this
this is psychology really
or whether it's just that this is the best case that i can promote
yeah
i mean how do you know
but i mean i think it is important to establish that this is what he's saying
and he wants to at the very least i think it's reasonable to say he wants to influence the communist party that this is the way you should be looking at the world and it is different to the way you were looking at it
and it has huge implications for the communist party that look a rural revolution is taking place and it's being led by the peasantry
i mean that it's an enormous challenge to the whole ideology of the of the existing party
mm
well it's quite it's very threatening isn't it
he he's
right
he's looking at the their UNK source and saying i it's not the case
yeah that's right
and he's saying look er you need to get organized to do this and it is okay to be violent
so he's arguing for a violent rural revolution
it's under way and this is the way to go with it
does anybody object to this strategy of violence
i think it's i'm not convinced about it because i think there's s some people would don't will not want it to be to be involved in violence i wouldn't think
mm
some people would it may be in fact a selling point direct some people who'd felt they'd
mm
been turned over by UNK they want to get their own back
yeah
so i mean i it's a split depends who you want er on your team really
but i mean are there er y you're UNK you're not er violence
no i mean i don't think the situation is
mm
i think a means to an end he's trying to sell himself erm okay changes are happening but you know changes in the early nineteen thirties you know
right
erm
he's ahead of his time
yeah
i think if you can see your lot being UNK though and er you've got nothing to lose why not
i mean i wouldn't have any feeling
but i mean that is
for the landlord okay i'd be quite happy to
certainly the case for the sort of the UNK and the very poor peasant and i think this is why the medium and the wealthy peasants are less interested to be involved they have got things to lose
it depends if you need them they're involvement then you may have to do it a slightly different way or maybe it's the case that they have to accept this or that you're gonna turn them over too
yeah
mm
i mean once violence starts er moving then you know the middle peasants have to join unless
mm
them themselves become targets
so you know
but i th
can get more support
mm
some violent
but it's a dangerous strategy though because when you start implementing these things then they can go out of hand and you've got these measures and it's turned on to
oh right yes i it may pay to go out of hand
well that's a revolution isn't it
well er yes but if it ca goes out of hand against the communist party which is
right yes
a possibility i mean UNK sort of affair
yeah sure
things have turned round and you UNK violent measures there's no controls left
yeah
so can you if you can UNK it
right
you feel you can it might be a good strategy if there's a risk you can't it might not be
right
right
erm all i'm sure about is that there was this change going on in the UNK
yeah and erm i would probably argue that the peasants set up their some of their mutual aid associations and their associations to actually restore some of the er UNK that they'd had before
sure
would you support violence though
yeah that's the UNK isn't that the crucial issue
i mean ar are you going are you going to be a real revolutionary and say look this revolution is so important that
well there's
i'm gonna co i'm gonna accept violence UNK violence
okay i mean y you can look at it from a point of view that mao is a real revolutionary and that's what he wants
right
but you've gotta question whether the peasants are
okay yes sure
okay
and i can't personally
are you gonna support violence or not
erm
no
right
no i didn't say no i think that erm
but you said no for me
i think no i could be persuaded to support
y you're okay for violence bit
i'm very happy with it
you y
i don't really understand what you mean by just the i don't understand what you mean by just being okay
well i i'm
for the violence bit
well i'm gonna go and kill landlords
mm
eh
we're gonna kill landlords evil gentry tyrants
they're not evil gentry they're not tyrants
definitely justification for it if you're a poor peasant
poor peasants
i think i think that the fact that
we're talking about poor peasants
what we were talking about the poor peasants last week the week before last they're not that poor they're
they're living they're living at a subsistence level
they wanna get on their bike you know go and get a job
it's not a problem
do you know how many rolls UNK there were in china
they're so they're so UNK to eating you know UNK and sweet potatoes and having that day in day out
you just looking for the excuse to
but what's the justification what's
what's your justification for going out and killing the UNK
because i mean you want to improve your lot because you know you've been UNK by the landlords
it's the only it's the only way
no you want you are s you are s
that's a lie because you don't wanna improve your lot because you've been happy under the UNK
no
and everything
well not any more because the landlord has abused his position and
why has it suddenly changed since nineteen hundred
it's getting worse we already said that last week didn't we
because
i mean the landlords have changed
oh god
they're now UNK they're a UNK landlords they're now increasing rents you know they're increasing a cash er deposit all s you know all sorts of things
i mean the position got worse and
communist left wing propaganda
no the situation was getting worse and the only way that they we er that it was gonna be made better was by violence and cos the violence is the only way
that they the only way that they're going to change the existing order
not at all
i mean you find any other method
well how else would they do it
they can't just er say the UNK the landlords
elections
were threatened say oh okay fair enough it was good i mean you know
talking about i mean us six er pe peasants we've got a landlord you know oh shall we go and kill him he he's got all the authority he's got armed UNK the works now to me he could have
got armed UNK
yeah that's true
in certain cases the UNK would use this but how often we've already talked how often did your landlord they used er sort of agencies to collect only but how often did they sort of er did they the UNK on them
how often do they sort of UNK
they have positions in authority local government which means they have you know the arms of the law
as system
hold on c can we sort of stop this now or we'll go on for ever
y you're absolutely right that there is some doubt about this was really whether the countryside was like this
on the other hand i think we have to take seriously what mao is saying that and it may conflict with that other view of the countryside an and we i think we do have to take this evidence into account i think it's more important to accept what mao is saying
c can i come back to y you're about to go on to i think the UNK and about the revolution
could you just say a bit about that
this i was gonna leave that to UNK
right
considering we only got half the
well i mean now basically the ri er the question about a UNK is er just back to the old idea whether you're going too far or whether
right
er it was basically the kuomintang are just saying that the people who are actually leaving associations are UNK you know
yeah
they're not particular er able or
mm
well meaning people but i mean the reason they're saying that is simply because they don't like what they're doing full stop
i mean the fact that they're peasants means that you know they're not worth much
right
erm so the fact that now peasants are running their own associations isn't you know a UNK obviously the peasants in your point of view
right
yeah
erm now he talks about the UNK of UNK i it's just his distinction between the types of peasant erm he looks at the rich peasants first of all and originally they're not into revolution at all you know they don't want to join peasant associations because they've got nothing to gain erm as er had said before you know p if you ask a rich peasant to join he's gonna say well you know i've never heard of such a thing before you know i've i can manage to live alright i advise you to gi er give it up or alternatively he may just say you know good god no you know it's too dangerous i don't want to be knocked off by my landlord
erm however w with the changing environment erm such as the bigger demonstrations also the continuing victory of the nor the northern UNK erm it was more easy to join these associations er indeed the there's a sort of climate of opinion that you know if you don't join that then you'll be left behind and threatened yourself
erm and so now rich peasants are actually actively seeking to join er associations but finding it difficult i mean they have to be er pay an additional admission fee may be ten UNK or whatever you know usually far higher than the normal peasant or erm they have to get someone to actually put their name forward to say that you know they're not such a bad bloke
erm however even if they have joined they aren't actually actively erm
right
erm supporting it i mean they are just putting their name down so that they can stay out of trouble
right so was it they were getting they were joining cos they wanted to they didn't they were joining cos they actively wanted to be involved in a revolutionary sort of
no they weren't
i mean
and they were just worried that if they didn't join in they weren't part of the club then er
mm but evidently they joined
you know they'd be put on the other register
yeah but they basically just don't want to lose out either way i mean there was no reason for them to join originally but when events happen and they see the tide turning almost you know get with the UNK i mean they don't want now to be seen as the minority and the ones under threat so you go with the er majority with the stronger force
mm
whatever at the time
so peasant associations were quite influential by this stage
you know they
yeah but as they become more influential and er basically he talked about the erm demonstration on the anniversary of the october revolution erm and then UNK of the northern UNK and et etcetera and various UNK erm i don't you know there is a the idea that you know the tu the tu er tide is turning erm you know they ought to join now rather than be firmly left behind
right
and you know UNK with erm tt landlords
yeah
and suffering the consequences
erm then he moves on to the middle peasants erm they're similar i mean once again they they've got enough to eat they are they aren't under as much stress i mean th they can su survive and so the idea of them UNK all to support a revolution would be very er you know very risky at the time at the beginning er the opening period erm so once again th i'd say their conclusion is afraid not you know i won't join a peasant association i it won't last
erm they're in no hurry to join but with this second period er from september or was it october and erm once again there is this idea that you know the tide is turning and they will now join erm they won't find it so hard to join as the rich peasants but once again they're not as enthusiastic and maybe they should be but they are they are helping more but er and this is the key er for which you know mao talked about later is that we've got to get the middle peasant actually actively involved
right
in the revolution because they are such a large proportion er we can't really have them an UNK you know part erm cos it'll al UNK too many and you know we won't have enough support that we need
erm the last group obviously the poor peasants which is the real UNK of the revolution he says erm he says they have fought UNK through the two periods of underground work and of open activity they're the most responsive to the communist party leadership
they are deadly UNK of the camp of the local tyrants and evil gentry and attack without the slightest hesitation
you know they joined it right at the beginning they they're the ones where the UNK come from erm they're the ones asking the rich peasants to join them the middle peasants and they're the ones leading the revolution th they are the UNK if you know want to take one view erm they haven't got anything to lose because of their position er as erm a rich peasant may say you know what is there to keep me from joining yo you people have neither UNK over your heads nor UNK of land under your feet and it's true they have got nothing to lose but these are the ones that are pushing the ideas forward and forming the associations
erm he makes a distinction between poor peasants some being utterly UNK and some just being less UNK but er basically as er seventy percent of the population erm they're the main group that's pushing revolution forward and s so therefore i mean it's this group that the communist party mustn't UNK you know they mu mustn't do anything to harm this group associations the communist party mustn't attack erm the associations
it says leadership by the poor peasants is absolutely necessary without the poor peasants there will be no revolution to deny their role is to deny the revolution to attack them is to attack the revolution
so i mean these are the supporters that they they've got to sort of focus on erm even i he does say that some of the erm er leaders of the associations aren't actually up to scratch but he says eighty five percent of them are and it would be wrong to attack or to arrest you know the other fifteen percent and it's got to come from their own discipline of the association you let the movement grow together don't try and er become er you know UNK forces because er these are the people who we've got to erm s stay with and to look after to UNK erm to work for and er so that's basically is his conclusion
don't you think he's asking to much or saying that the peasants are doing too much
i mean they're time in the UNK t
but the fact they're doing it i is because they want a revolution they're actually saying they are motivated these poor peasants you know the fact they are UNK i mean if you are comfortable then you're not gonna go out and
mm
an and start attacking er your environment and
yeah bu but that's
when are you gonna
okay going back to the
they were they were actually after a revolution or just after a rent you know
yeah
the UNK come back on
yeah
you can be as thick as two short UNK but i mean if you haven't got enough food in your UNK you're gonna be wanting to do something about it
right
but you're able to
i thought i thought they were comfortable though now i thought
so why are they doing it
he's just highlighting a problem
the ones who decided they didn't wanna
but it's not a question er of saying erm of saying it's he's saying that they are already doing this and that
we need to react to it and adjust our methods
but
you can't stop them they're the driving force
okay but
er yeah but why yeah okay i didn't mean that actually was he asking too much i mean are we interpreting the peasants as having done are we over interpreting what the peasants have done basically
yeah i i'll agree with that it was er in UNK you know he suggests that erm
she
ownership erm
they
that erm when in all the UNK the peasant UNK when the communists actually tried to propose more than just rent reductions then the peasants tended to lose interest at that
yes
so but
right
the these the UNK were happening but whether revolution is
right
contentious
was UNK which area was she talking about
it was wasn't it or
er sh yes she's
mainly
but i mean i think that what she's saying would ought to apply more generally
yeah
i if that's the way the peasants see the world in so they're gonna see it the same everywhere
and peasants weren't by nature in their in their processes erm violent it was only
right
it was mainly the communists
right
that used violence
so bu but what mao is saying is something fundamentally different
yeah
he's looking he's interpreting the peasants as being a very different their nature UNK being very different and they are th that they are taking action and what he what he's saying here is that not only is this a peasant revolution taking place but it is a it's a peasant revolution which is being led by the poor
but i think UNK does say that they are violent though
yeah she says th that they are
i think the only the essential difference is that erm i've forgotten what i was gonna say now
sh she said that they mainly use it er as self defence and to
yes
protect their own person
right so yeah she's certainly not looking at them as being revolutionary
yeah
whereas mao is now
mm
but i mean i isn't he right in saying look this is this is the erm figures he uses are seventy percent of the population that they are if you like our friends an and if you're gonna have a revolution successfully you've gotta make distinguish between your friends and your UNK and the poor peasants are your real friends
you've got the landlords who are the en the UNK you you've got rich peasants who are broadly gonna be opposed to you and will only come in on your side at the very latest stage when they've realized that and then you've got the middle peasants who are UNK in the middle but will probably support you mu certainly much more easily
bu but it it's momentum is being given by the poor
mm
yeah but we're now talking in erm class awareness and class consciousness terms but
yeah
but they actually realized that they can no longer look to the landlords as their friends or their
yes
erm and so they've got to get together in class groups
i mean it's
although peasants sort of
not but you do explicitly have to talk about class because ten to fifteen years
well he's beginning to he is beginning to
yeah because ten to fifteen years earlier there wasn't this amount of class consciousness and now you're saying that UNK completely broken down which i may agree with you on but they're now organizing themselves purely on this hey we're all friends now or s and we've gotta gang together all seventy percent of us against the landlords which wasn't
well
the terms they were talking about ten years ago
isn't exactly what's happening i mean what what's happening is that if they ri erm increase rents or whatever the people who can't pay that they get together and they demonstrate
mm
and then find out
but what
they've got you know similar objectives and whatever
but isn't this something new
isn't this something very new for them to do
sure surely er there is
yeah which is happening
there is an element of class consciousness in the fact that when the leaders of these er organizations were often put in prison sort of five or ten thousand people sometimes used to go and destroy the prisons like to get them out so surely that's so that's
yeah
UNK isn't it
yeah bu but all i'm saying is though it's not they're not it's not simply the idea of class it's the idea that
mm
the people worst affected are suddenly UNK
all of the same class so perhaps we should er
but yeah but their UNK and then and then from that from demonstrations
i mean it would be very easy to say that basically you know i don't know the poor peasants UNK around all peasants you know mao saw them and knew that this was where the core of erm the revolution
well wh what is it they've all got in common then
eh
what is it that all these poor peasants
have got
i'm not saying they're not a class i mean i mean
but the i mean the reason they that they have things in common also was when governments and other erm agencies began to get involved in rent collection
it then focused attention rather than on individual landlords
mm
we who maybe only had two or three tenants to these collection agencies so you concentrated their focus onto er they had a common target all of a sudden
yeah
which was a UNK factor
i think the peasants may not immediately sort of i mean they wou they would have sort of linked together to
so they just wanted to get rid of this common target of the rent collectors
they didn't wanna get rid of the landlords
oh and of the landlords
and then the idea of class you know similar UNK
well they didn't they didn't immediately they individually wanted to get rid of their individual landlord but obviously you can't as y you get together with all the other tenants
they want to
of this landlord and you find there's three of you would struggle to UNK your landlord
however if you can UNK against a target then there's a lot more of you against this thing so what mao i think is saying that if we can utilize this
yeah absolutely
and im impose these class ideas on them they're not immediately thinking like this you can say the landlord can be treated as a class they're all the same and you
right
are you know
but mao's not saying that mao's saying they're already in a revolution and we're we should
yes then er
go in er and lead them he says so
and the way to the lead them is to impose
he's not saying
these class ideas on them so that they can UNK against the landlords
mm
but he is saying that there is this process under way this revolutionary process of UNK the system as it stands
mm
so on a c just to summarize and then go on to the fourteen great achievements
what he's saying is that a revolution is taking place here and it is within a very short time it's gonna spread on into other UNK
erm that i it's a rural revolution erm it is a it's it is a revolution which is being led by the poor and you can't dismiss this as them as being UNK they're they are the poor peasants and whether we like it or not they are leading our revolution
and he's UNK it being a violent process
now th that if you like is the new strategy that he's putting to the communist party and he's saying look you should recognize this is going on there is a there is a growing class basis to this and we must lead it because it is the way forward
now he then comes on in the second part of the report to look at the fourteen great achievements and i mean two things a what are those achievements and do those achievements back up and support these kinds of very general maybe propaganda kind of UNK that mao is taking up in the first part of this report
er
well i can tell you i can tell you th the first part erm about what the fourteen great achievements are erm and only then could i could i sort of try and answer
right
the second question
before you er c can we sort of stay with this for another ten minutes or so
erm still with the
s so it's okay
mm yeah
i just you know some meant to be meeting at five past one
right
sure
well do you wanna start then
before you go
oh no i'm not gonna go i'm er just gonna
okay
carry on
mm
carry on
well would you like to know what the fourteen great achievements are then
yeah
erm well i think it probably most important i think
erm i mean he starts by erm you've got he stresses that these fourteen great achievements are to the credit of the peasants and no one else really
erm and he said that erm many people have peasant these peasant associations er but peasants organized themselves into peasant associations erm and there are four grades of peasant associations as he sees them
one is nearly all peasants are organized the second one is the small sections remain UNK er the third type is bulk of peasants remain UNK and er the fourth type is completely UNK
erm i'm not quite sure if he gives any detail on sort of no he doesn't
er
erm and again i have UNK i do have an actual problem with this two million by january
yes tha that's right nick th there is a there's a big problem with that
yeah
yeah
erm and then once they've organized themselves into these associations their first er job should be or was perhaps i'm not he's talking about what has actually happened i suppose
mm
er i mean i have a bit of a problem with him sort of going in and identifying all these fourteen ten UNK if you like of er what er the peasants have actually done because i don't think
but this is the point
revolution has already happened i mean according to this the UNK political UNK been smashed
yeah
and i mean this hasn't happened
yeah
there's a
but he's saying it's happened
he's saying it's happened but i mean
wh whether it's happened i think is another matter this is what he's saying
mm
oh yeah okay
right okay what he is saying is erm that first of all the peasants hit the landlords politically erm and the first thing they wanted to do was smash the political prestige and power of the landlord class erm without victory in this struggle no victory is possible in the economic struggle to reduce rent and interest er to secure land and other factors of production
erm there are methods of doing this nine in total er ranging from er checking the accounts of the landlords who ran sort of pr who collected public money erm to imposing UNK er i don't know all this contribution minor UNK major UNK which apparently involved a crowd of fifteen thousand er UNK to demonstrate against the local UNK the gentry erm and then they'd often crown the landlord villages
they can wear silly hats
say that erm at least one hundred and thirty pigs were killed
i don't think yeah but i think that overall we could discuss the er purely well the very irresponsible attitude of these peasants towards factors of production and
were they not UNK against this sort of UNK that they saw going on in erm and think that well if we can you know if we can somehow stop this UNK perhaps then er then
we'll all get back to where we are and you're the expert on UNK so if you'd like to er
i'd rather the fourteen great achievements than
well okay
well after they've UNK the landlords
they could lock up the landlords er and perhaps even UNK them
erm or UNK them that's the last straw apparently
erm the third they did
yeah
was er hit the landlords economically erm and this is this is quite interesting sort of UNK erm sort of stopping the grain exports from a particular area to er bring down grain prices and er secure grain for the peasants themselves
erm UNK er increase in rents and deposits er UNK on cancelling of UNK and er a reduction of interest which all seems to me fairly restorationist really
right
yeah
er not really looking for a revolution just looking back to where you were before
right
erm try and get on
yeah
you're on a roll
erm having said that though i think that erm perhaps the next few great achievements were perhaps more revolutionary really erm because they were s now he's now talking about UNK erm the feudal rule of local tyrants erm UNK the armed forces of the landlords UNK the political power of the county magistrate and ov this one's possibly the most important anti revolution restorationist one i think probably the UNK of UNK authority of the UNK and the UNK
erm i suppose we could talk about that highlights that a man in china is subjected to UNK of three systems of authority er the state system er which is political authority the UNK system the UNK authority erm ranging from the UNK temple down to the head of household and a UNK system which is erm religious authority
erm and he then saw that the political authority of the landlords as the UNK of all the other systems of authority
erm and if that UNK the UNK class authority the UNK authority religious authority and the authority of the husband all began to UNK
right
right so erm okay so we'll look at the UNK authority
erm
so something erm i mean it just seems strange to me that you know something which has exist existed for thousands of years you know he's suddenly sort of UNK so to speak erm and i mean obviously the fact that there was a revolution twenty years later or whatever erm me means that something must have been wrong but erm you know i it's strange how he's suddenly UNK and how the criticism hasn't come before how nothing's happened before how this seems an UNK moment for it to happen
erm so anyway the fact that it did happen obviously means that something's wrong even though i'll argue that it didn't seem as bad as he was presenting
erm he then goes on basically erm to talk about spreading political propaganda which was obviously very important to his cause erm an and he was saying that basically you know suddenly with the rise of er peasant associations erm everyone would say down with UNK down with the UNK down with the UNK officials erm you know and that these you know basically he he's then highlighting the fact that these political UNK have found erm have found you know you know er importance with the with the young the middle aged an and the old but basically obviously he's trying to target the school because that's where he's hoping where the re UNK start
and i mean er you could argue that you know because he's er erm you know targeting the young and people who are at school in particular the fact that you know if he's successful in targeting those then by nineteen forty nine those school children will be sort of will be the peasants will be farmers and therefore will be more willing you know having been UNK by his thoughts er or by the communist way of thinking then erm for the revolution
erm so i mean and then you know he describes various examples where you know if you get hit by your best mate you basically you know instead of telling him to f off you say down with UNK type of thing
you know it seems remarkable but there you go
erm he then obviously goes on to erm to erm talk about peasant UNK and UNK erm and for some incredible reason the peasants suddenly take a UNK to UNK and UNK smoking three things that i couldn't think of anything i'd like to do more erm
but you know the peasants rise up in peasant associations and decide that these things are bad erm and they've got you know they don't want to do them any more
erm UNK in case anyone doesn't know is basically you know when they play ma UNK and
UNK
play UNK and drink coffee and play UNK and card games erm
those three are absolutely all the basic things in chinese culture aren't they
yeah so it's a revolt against sort of social
yeah
which is why it seems to me i don't know you know UNK slightly far
UNK in a way
yes but still you can revolt against something that you like doing
yeah
i mean if i was a peasant and someone told me to give up drinking then i'd you know
i wouldn't be very happy about it obviously
think this is the right way to do it
erm so
i think free beer on the other hand
so he makes quite a big point out of that you know er that and then he obviously talks about other things the flour UNK erm you know which basically UNK performances of
in public places UNK chairs don't carry them erm
but no and then he goes on to
he lists er a wide range of things that basically you know should be banned or basically erm sh should be sort of cut down upon
erm i won't go into them because you know basically erm i think the three main ones reflect the fact that he's saying the peasants are rising up and they're not only changing their political views erm but are obviously changing their cultural values as well according to according to what he suggests
erm he then goes on to talk about erm UNK erm wh which basically erm where the peasant associations are powerful enough erm you know where the people rise up UNK don't exist because the people have risen up and you know are strong enough because they've got UNK because they've got UNK they've joined together to get rid of the UNK
erm and he's saying obviously that's a good thing and i'd agree with him there
erm it's quite important from the next thing that he talks about is er ex UNK obviously he says as the country is not yet UNK and the authority of the UNK and the UNK have not been UNK there is as yet no way of removing the heavy burden of government taxes and UNK on the peasants
erm however he's saying that you know where there is erm you know pe peasant erm associations basically that they are trying to you know get together club together and make sure that say the UNK of each of land erm is at least being re reduced or abolished
yeah he's saying how the UNK imposed on peasants should be removed
yeah
yeah
yeah
erm okay
erm and then he's talking he's going on to education which er obviously at this time he would think is very important erm because that's how he would start the revolution you know i in the first place
erm and he's saying that you know to start with basically education has always been the preserve of the landlords er the peasants haven't had anything to do with education have always been poor UNK peasants erm and now he's saying that because the landlords have been UNK erm suddenly peasants er have you know are forming erm schools and have been able to be taught various things
erm and these
doesn't he say something about there's gonna be ten thousand small schools in a few years and erm
yeah and i mean that's absolute bull but er
well in my opinion
nice idea though
but a nice idea yeah he's saying before long tens of thousands of schools will have UNK up in the villages throughout the UNK erm and that basically the peasants like the old style schools which is basically a chinese way of teaching as opposed to erm the education which the landlords received which is the foreign school and he's saying how when he was a student erm you know he used to think that the foreign style schools were UNK er but has now realized that actually you know being i mean
being a man of the people that that's not the way forward and erm but you know i mean basically you've gotta go back to basics
erm but he i mean i think that's quite an important
it's a familiar ideology isn't it
erm you know but he's saying the developments of the peasant movement has resulted in the rapid rise in their cultural level erm you know so on the one hand he's i mean in a way he's trying to re educate the whole peasant class erm and change their way of thinking which previously has obviously been going on you know since UNK
mm
UNK ideas were founded
erm so i think it's important to realize as i said before with er with you know with the ma UNK or whatever and UNK smoking you know that he's it's not just a political struggle that he's
yeah
that he's talking about it's also a cultural struggle
yeah
erm he's saying that the way forward is through the cooperative movement erm and this again is ties in with the fact that you've got peasant associations erm and that you're gonna be that the average UNK gonna be a lot stronger in the cooperative moment system
erm you know he he's and here he decides basically marketing and credit UNK he talks this but obviously you know everyone gets together
this is basically er what was saying about self help wasn't it
mm
yeah
yeah
well i dunno i suppose yes
i'll agree with you
erm and you know er you know they were he's saying when the landlords deliberately stopped lending there were many attempts by the peasants to organize credit agencies
erm well okay fair enough you know bu but there was obviously there seemed to be an effort for them to get together
he then goes on erm going on from that going on from say UNK increased UNK erm that there's an effort to build more roads and repairing and that basically there seems to be a picture that the peasants are getting together to try and improve their own lot
mm
erm you know and these achievements he's not saying that you know re UNK the way forward he's actually saying look what's happened before under the system that existed er previously er well it actually existed you know at the time he was talking about there does seem to be an effort by the peasants erm you know to improve their lot and therefore wha while he UNK revolution in a way you can argue it is a bit strange because they seem to be according to him have improved their lot under the system that was there in the first place erm
i is this a it's a that's a sort of UNK thought isn't it
is he putting forward a UNK idea
he well the idea seems to be er coming in at the end doesn't it
it's yeah but i mean th you're right th
ideas of UNK of
mm
er of collective labour to build roads etcetera which is gonna be a feature going all the way through is there really quite this
yeah
early stage
yeah
yeah
but if you put all of these together do they amount to anything more than a restorationist position
yes
erm i don't know
sort of restoration with UNK on
right
who actually
yeah
sort of improve
but i mean i certainly if you go through the early bits erm i mean i if you take well okay the organization bit to begin with but then hitting the landlords politically er you know y you're checking their accounts you're imposing their UNK when they've been a bit naughty you're letting contributions erm you're UNK them and going through the streets you're UNK them up you're UNK some of them you might be UNK some of them but i it's only specifically where they've offended against your view of the moral economy where they where they've sort of been naughty in terms of
yeah
and the same is true with the economic bit that they are there's a UNK on sending grain out to the market out of the area because that will help the peasantry within the area y your UNK on increasing rents and deposits UNK for reduced rents and deposits UNK on cancelling UNK reduction of interest it it's the cl it's the classic restorationist position isn't it
it is but i mean if you look at point four UNK the feudal rule of the
oh yeah
tyrants i mean that is that is more than that he's saying that y the power base at the two level er two i think the local one jurisdiction UNK people in control they have got to be UNK now that i think is revolutionary
so i it's politically it is more revolutionary than economically
yeah
but economically it is restorationist
i it's a means of making the system work
mm
but i if you s looked at all those points and you know you say the er capping of er of increases and so and so could that be UNK as a sort of a stage towards collectivization
well
i mean does er are they doing that
i'm not sure consciously
but they yeah i mean there's something in that
but take er look they if you look at the terminology here and if you take your okay your point four UNK the feudal rule of the local tyrants and evil gentry
tyrants evil gentry are legitimate targets for their restorationist view
th er it's not UNK the gentry there is very little about the landlords themselves
i it's only th the attacks were against those people who abused the system not the system
and s something perhaps this is the spreading of political propaganda
yeah
this point eight and it's down with UNK down with the UNK
yeah
down with the UNK officials
right
and down with the local tyrants it's down with the system as it stands or
right
and it's i it's e exactly i mean it's not down with landlords
no
i mean i dunno i think in this point four he's ta he's not talking about landlords he's talking about the tyrants and gentry
yes
he's ta talking about specific
but it's always evil gentry
yes and he's trying to sort of to put a erm a picture in your mind of these er specific things and here is one here is one they're not all like that however i think th this may be a very good way of er of getting the whole lot UNK he may be erm i mean how do you how do you define these things
i mean people are
well
always gonna see to feel as if they're being
yes
feel as if they're being UNK and they will look to them and say well this is obviously the case whether this particular guy who is who is our erm leader is erm
yeah but you'd know you'd just know if there's like six or seven UNK tyrants in the local district or whatever and you'd go after them
and the point is that if they then change
yes
to being erm being nice to you or whatever then you don't go after them it's no longer revolutionary you're not out to get them you're just out to make sh get the local tyrants and the evil gentry
but i think i mean they seem these people had a jurisdiction of between ten to fifty si fifty or sixty thousand people now so th he's mao's saying that not all of them are evil not all of them are it's only some who are but i think every sixty thousand more than likely are gonna look at theirs as being the evil one that they are going to want to UNK
yeah
or er
can i just say that i think it's interesting that mao's sort of targeting the local tyrants and the erm the evil gentry i mean because you could you could ar argue that basically the landlords are only trying to get a return erm which is which is equal to what they can get if they invest all their money in or you know erm or whatever or big cities
mm
so they weren't actually what mao is saying is exploitation is not actually exploitation it's just the UNK landlords working in an economic way
erm but they're an easy target to go for as opposed to i mean mao could e perhaps as easily as argued saying you know UNK is not the way forward erm and we don't want greater interaction with the world economy erm as opposed to saying you know UNK the local landlords
right
but
erm
but he's not saying UNK the landlords
well he's sort of blaming the peasant you know the peasant situation on the local landlords
o on tyrants and evil gentry
yes
he surely er from his point of view all landlords just by the fact that they own the land they're gonna be er
landlords yeah
no he he's gonna see them all as being evil from his own political ideology
ah
but
i if you define all landlords by definition as evil
yeah
but that's the reason i don't think he's doing that
er i get er i think he's being very clever here so that he's gonna if any peasants were to read this which is UNK but
right
erm he would get he would get a lot of support because it is it can be read as r as being restorationist but
mm
i ca i mean
yeah i think he's dressing up a revolution
yeah
in er restorationist terms
from his marxist UNK
or i or is he
or is it something slightly different that er the actions of the peasantry i think are la are very largely restorationist but in the process they are actually going further that th that they have challenged that th they've done more than just want to put some of the rights wrong that they are actually beginning to challenge the system
mm
and they are beginning to put a new system in its place so that it is beginning to be revolutionary a an and UNK a restorationist approach can lead on to revolution
they are beginning to take the law themselves
right
in
but in a political sense not an economic sense
i e
yeah
i it's not being done through okay let's UNK land let's UNK land and then we'll do it's the reverse
y you make this political challenge and this sort of cultural attitude sort of challenges and then you will come on and mao's very precise about this it's the political change that comes first
mm
and then you can get the economic change
i mean er yes as soon as when you start making political change i think that's revolution really i mean you're not
yeah
when you're putting your own people into or taking the power away
right
that acts as a sort of
right
but
change of a system
yeah
do they see it as that
well this is it
i mean he's trying to put it all in a very restorationist point of view
well i don't think he is i think what he's put what he's describing is a restorationist response initially by the peasantry all o almost all of these actions could be seen as restorationist they are an attack on the system not working because of the actions of evil gentry UNK local officials etcetera
so they could be seen as restorationist but he's making restorationist into a revolution
yes
i think that's how you can interpret it i don't think he was i don't think he thought in those terms
er
bu but what was happening seemed to me to be consistent with that
mm
yeah i think
so why does he talk about revolution you know on several occasions
b because that that's the way he sees it he's he is interpreting all of these things as revolutionary right i'm not at all sure if they were
i think a lot of it is restorationist
oh
so it's revolution
right
yes
an and he's taking up what might we might want to or what could be portrayed as restorationist as being revolutionary where i i'm not sure that it fully was a revolution er a and i you see what mao is saying is that there would have been a class basis for all of this they were doing it as a class of peasant they might not have been they might have been doing it just for restorationist purposes
and this might have got them far enough and therefore they so the movement is not gonna go on from there it's stopped because the peasants have achieved everything they wanted to achieve
and the UNK er mao sees this and the communists step in
right
but it's
well is it ever gonna stop though
i mean if he's i mean he says or the implication is that it will stop when they get everything they achieve or perhaps they've already got what they set out to
mm
achieve but i don't think they ever will that i mean once you start you
ah well if that's right then mao is right at the beginning where he's making his sort of UNK statements about the UNK storm
that's consistent with what he said
the other point might be if you take these fourteen great achievements they are essentially restorationist and to interpret them as being a UNK revolution is fundamentally wrong
and therefore y er in a sense he was he was acting on the basis of a false premise and therefore the wh sort of the whole set of conclusions he draws could've been wrong
and there was no need for a revolution because they'd achieve those fourteen massive achievements
you know why was there a revolution
well yes
i mean if he's saying that these were amazing things and they
they were
improved the UNK lot then you know why did the peasants
because surely w once you've started that political process it's it goes on
i mean
UNK local tyrants take the armed forces from the landlords it's not you'd think they'd all they can't defend themselves now we might as well have a go
mm
bu yeah but they can stay as being landlords
th there's no challenge here to landlords per se
no but you're taking their power away and you're making them UNK
oh yeah UNK you take the political power away so that they will have to reduce their rents and do all of that but you're not challenging the landlord system
but you're taking you're n you're not immediately challenging the system but you've taken their armed forces away
yeah
as well so they
right
are vulnerable
i think
right
it wouldn't be more than about twenty minutes before the UNK the peasants would've thought well maybe
okay yeah
yes
but i it it's interesting though there is no statement whatsoever in the report that land redistribution is taking place
n no nothing about taking lands away from landlords UNK
he doesn't wanna frighten them you see
right
at this early stage you know
who doesn't he want to frighten
what the people
the landlords
yes
or
no bu but mao's er analogy is that you shouldn't drain the pond to catch the fish
right
i'd love to tell this last one
right
erm he he's saying he's saying here that basically UNK erm and all the people of have s have talked about the fact that erm you know they wa they want to UNK the masses of the people but then that they're gonna be scared to death when the masses do rise
what difference is there between this and 's love of the UNK
explain that story at the end was so fond of UNK that he UNK with drawings and UNK of them but when a real UNK heard of his UNK
he was frightened out of his UNK
then UNK mao UNK uses his me this UNK to show that though UNK and his like talked about revolution they were afraid of revolution and against it
i just wanted to end on that bit
story about
okay
well i think we should end on that
er possible to do an essay on
yeah
alright
oh it's still going
oh god
no i'm do making a right mess here
yep
that's good
i've seen it down over there

there's some of the things you know carly put on there
i had cardiff didn't i
i went and put cardiff on
actually manchester
don't sound so excited carly
but a UNK not
erm where were we down to
eighteen was you saying phil
seventeen
sixteen
fifteen
for a UNK not too bad
i had something
fourteen
thirteen
ooh
we've got lower than fifty percent now
yeah if it makes you feel better now they'd have only cos UNK was there
the rest of them still to go
i know it's not too bad
twelve
ha
ten
i had eleven
just over half
that's okay
i'll save you going any further i got below ten
i choose not to UNK
i make no excuses
my UNK terrible
i'd
eleven
ten
nine
UNK
eight
seven
six
five
four
also i had put more than that
i got eight
eight
eight
seven
yeah seven
seven
mm
yeah seven
six
no
you need to look
ah yeah
you cannot talk about moving parcels around the country if you don't know where the towns are
you don't have to visit all those you didn't get
oh yeah
i think in their own time at their own expense
that's right
yeah
i just get my UNK of three the wrong way round because i know where they are
i think before we go
i know the midlands is in the middle and the south is in the south and
not to your customers
might be some
it isn't
not
well
your customers
what's wrong
well i know the north is in the north and the south is in the south
i just don't know where the towns are that go with them
i know the numbers of the depot
no
you do need to get
that's what we need to get
very you should have a national map in front of you
and not just you don't want just our depots you want them in relation
that's the thing you see the
to their customers there
a lot of them places yo they're not sort of like famous are they
you know UNK and UNK and
they are to us
yeah they are to us but
they're extremely famous to us UNK
manchester
was a nobody until we put a depot in it
UNK is famous UNK
no i don't mean that i mean yo it's not a popular yo like a
to start looking for UNK
just because UNK
on saturday
UNK doesn't have a UNK football team doesn't mean to say
no
it's not famous
no
aye
UNK is famous for
tottenham
your
can i just say that
the manchester depot actually in manchester
yeah
UNK beat tottenham
it's in stockport
it's in stockport
yeah it's not even in manchester
i know
but you're right
so now the south east most of those depots that you're looking at UNK isn't in UNK
no
so what i'm saying is they're just th they're it's just for er
the biggest place near it
the biggest place near it
now what
i'm saying is you ought to get very close to that geographical map because it's the UNK er difficulty with getting and you ought to know where there are mountains and where there are UNK and the fact that in south wales they can't just go across country they have to go back down the valley after the m four and up again
cos we're driving lorries we're not driving little you know trial UNK that go over mountains like the UNK and stuff you have to
but we do use the sheep in some ways don't we
that's right that's right we do use the sheep
but not for
no
the sake of the
no right
what
what i'm saying is you know you can't go from UNK to aberdeen in a couple of minutes
that's big country up there
and so there's a big mountain range running up the middle of the country someone thought once was the english channel
well that's okay cos we've got a tunnel now
yeah we got a tunnel now
yeah
the english channel not the UNK
but they're going where's the UNK
erm what i'm saying is
i'd say i don't know where it is at all
i am saying to you now folks become familiar with the erm depots
now what about the depot numbers
no idea
no
forty nine
not at all
forty six
forty nine
i'm gonna call them out
write them onto your sheets

that was the last i should have been market trader been shouting out that voice and
that's well
he's like UNK int he
UNK
thirty
belfast
thirty five
erm
on belfast i've been told and my UNK beg your pardon that erm i mentioned the four regional
the branch that
managers
because of the nature of that
being across to water
sorry phil are you alright
it's alright
don't worry i did go at a pace
because
okay
i talked about four regional managers they were mainland u k
er brian is also a regional director for belfast and the serving areas of belfast as well okay
he has sole responsibility for belfast but he does have regional directors going to but brian tends to cover a general manager role and with erm dick ma
no not dick who's in er belfast
tom
yeah
and er himself run the belfast operation across all the regions
but sometimes because he doesn't have hundreds of depots i think he's not regional but that's my own fault
brian is the northern ireland region
well done
do get a er buy a map spend some money to get one
you may have in your depot you may have in your depot a map which have UNK the t n t depots
does any has anybody seen one yet
yeah
the big wa UNK one which you can draw on
yes
yeah
they're er well they're not UNK
well
but they're UNK aren't they
er so you can wipe them clean if er you use a special pen
but what i'm saying is if you salesmen particularly get one you'll need one to get round the country your patch but you need to get familiar with the towns up and down the country for UNK for delivery cos your customers will talk about the area and you're talking to someone from a transport UNK you haven't got a clue where the towns are
i mean you know where's your credibility
and write down erm it
i know north of border nothing happens south of the border and like but we do deliver down here so do give yourself a little practise of that
now i'm going to ask you to do another little test for me
simple questions ten questions alright
do you want ta tidy up your little bit of paper out the way again
and there's ten questions about the conditions of carriage
name on the top of the list
now how many people have not seen a list of the
carriage yet
er erm
nobody
i think i have not
you haven't paul
i don't think so
it's the of the company and fax it
i'll look in mine tomorrow
you think you have
see
if i don't know by now
see how you do
we won't it's just
a very casual sale
well i'm not
just think use your options
this is so you know so many days
yes
yeah
just use different options
alright
better put your name at the top of the page as well
we'll go through the answers anyway
instead of just UNK at me i'd just like you all to engage brain with
do you do i've got one wrong
alright just make some notes and stuff that you've got already
right
i got lost
what happens in is you do have the people in that area in the first few weeks
the customer is same there
the same as in c
finished
pass it to your neighbour and once again
well i've read a few of the it's just a case of remembering the precise details
cos i know i know it means roughly in common terms cos i got a sister to interpret it
finishing her law degree
alright
come round the corner
and that
no it's not it's pass your one
it's just remembering what's actually on the sheet
and then it's mine one pass it down to
is it pass it twice
yeah pass it
round again
t n t
oh
no i'll do like this
right
well se see what you can do just now
i can't UNK obviously
but having well a regional a regional visits every once every how many weeks
dunno
just until we come through
exactly right
yeah i know
it's seven thirty
did you do that
yeah
well they well er no it's feet u k national
let me just da dish this out
and it's
do you want to score that for me
centimetres for worldwide and euro
let's score the paper then we'll go through the er
i'm sorry
i got number one
ah
i sa i said i got number one
that's what i wrote but i thought i didn't put that it didn't exactly right
but still if you but definitely if you feel like that and it goes
it's the t n t express
i don't think it was right
it is
i could be wrong
look
there
oh
this is the trouble isn't it
but some are good especially
kathy is it
you might be buying more
have you just got to sort of like the these open to interpretation or has it got to be word for word
well we'll go through it
giving us the answers now
because don't
yeah
good one
do a tick and a cross if you interpret it interpret it the way you want to
if you think hang on
that doesn't sound right we'll discuss the answer as we go round and we'll have a group
i've got the questions wrong here
have another go then
there yours take those
what's that
give me a paper please
mm
yeah that must definitely be right
it's up there
yes
right
is that
well it's a
if you're i think there's only two wrong here
just
that's right
pick what you think is right
if it sounds right then put it up and we'll discuss anyway
alright
ha
mm
you still add a mark if you put then would you give us the same mark as before
oh you've got to have that on as well
well it's just a legal
i think so
that's a good idea actually phil
oh i'll tick that right i don't care
that's right
mm
did you tick that
mm
mm
i give half for your number four by the way
i meant a fifteenth of the following
i'd be i i'd be inclined to give a half
i meant the following month
a half for one
but know why i did
i'm not gonna give him that i'm gonna give you half
i'm sorry i can't give you that
got a half of what
got to be strict
it's not very good
once you done the fifteenth
i bought you one
that's all
what was this
going to
definite
well you give me one
yeah you need you need one
so would i
give half for that one
there are some which is distributed things distributed by a carrier
say that to me again phil
there are some which is to be distributed by a carrier
i'd say no so he's right
definition of a consignment
yeah
well
i will accept that sort of answer
it is the this specific thing about it is from
yeah
one place to another thing
the one time one load
classified being a consignment
from one address to another if is the important thing
yeah plus it was
the important fact was covered in that
who's got that
i'll give you that
oh yeah
so the no two labels showing destination
i could give people the last part be careful in the second one
okay let's discuss the let's discuss the answers
yeah
let's discuss the answers
where's there's any UNK
ooh
discrepancy i wish i could take the UNK teeth out
you should be able to know them all
and put my own in
let's see if we can clear up any discrepancy
what is the legal title of the company
did anybody get it technically correct
it isn't just t n t
john
u k
no
didn't get the question together
how many got the first one right
t n t express u k
john did
UNK
yeah
wo oh
no i put i put
yeah UNK did
carrier
well what have you got in
you put the word the carrier
i just put carrier cos
we i understand what you're saying because yo that's what it's used erm
i'm looking i'm from sort of like
in the conditions
a legal point of view
yeah
i understand what you mean
UNK point is valid there because when you're reading a legal document t the t n t express u k will UNK be known as the carrier
carrier
he's put so we wrote
so really that's saying the title
yeah the legal
actually
title it does say
but i was just gonna say it's understandable
mm
him thinking in terms and conditions of carriage
yeah
yo you wouldn't have just put the carrier normally would you
that's what i'm saying so er just er interpretation of the question slightly misleading there
right
no worries
what is a definition of a consignment
now if you get these right word for word you'll be er i do conditions of carriage UNK on selling skills courses and the amount of people that get this right i can count on one hand in the last three years
who got it right
david
word for word
what was the bit you did
not word for word now
what did he say please
he said one or more items to one address
no not comp
no
no
not complete
what was the completed
andy
bit
so did i phil
that's not right
UNK got it right
oh
er parcels a number of
package goods
parcels UNK then together
that's what it means
and carriage
but it's not the same
that's not the exact not it either
collect the UNK goods to be transferred from
oh i've got it
one place to another
oh stop it
consignment as agreed
no that's not enough
what's mine
no
then
david is the
no it's
nearest one
UNK the number of parcels
that's what i put
a parcel or goods or a parcel or a number of parcels from one address to another
at one time
at one time
in one load
in one load
in one load
that's
aha
i those points are all valid
if there's
i missed that
a group of parcels going in two loads it's two
i put and i crossed it outside
two loads
UNK
UNK
if it's going erm
to different
to two different
i got that one
addresses it's two UNK
that's what i meant
if it goes at different times it's a different consignment
so in parcel or parcels going from one address to another at one time in one load that is a consignment
if you just say erm a group of parcels er in one load that's not enough cos it can be
yeah i know
part of a load
i missed out the from address to address
one address to one address
it's
yeah
quite er distinct what i di a what you'll be determined as
cos some people er may think you know the agreement because i have split the load you can still charge me the same price and it may not be the case
right
next one
what's the question UNK andy
what is the UNK sorry what should
what should
the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment
what was some of the answers there
UNK put name address from another consignment note filled out and service requirement
and weight of the consignment
yeah
so what we were looking for was something more er erm
did i answer that one
no
i didn't get round to it
anybody get what we were looking for in the yes you should
what should the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment
well obviously the delivery name and address is important and the UNK so you didn't get that wrong but there was what we were looking for as well a full written declaration of the nature of contents of any consignment containing dangerous UNK contaminated
aha
or UNK goods
in other words is there anything did anybody pick up
you got that
yeah
unusual
i did
i might have given you one there that looks good enough
oh
did you get that there
i did a part of it
oh
i reckon UNK got enough cos
what
he's got times
time
when ready weight number of packages destination and then UNK
well done
UNK will do nicely for me
that's what we're really looking for UNK
yeah
goods
well done
because how can i say
even i take
we've you'll see i mean there's a not a very good illustration of a the UNK with the yellow walls of the UNK belt behind you but you can see the fairly plain packaging that parcels come in
the more er sophisticated erm wholesale er UNK now know that people just pick up from stock a box don't they
and they may have one display displayed but if you go to somewhere like a warehouse or distribution where you go round and pick up your you can go to a garden you'll pick up a box that's UNK a UNK lawn mower or something and it'll er they spend a lot of time and money on the packaging but a lot of people for UNK reasons don't illustrate and that's good practise not to illustrate from our point of view what's on the package
but you must know what's in it
just knowing the size and the weight isn't you might that's alright that's only for the price what's in it is vital because if i asked the sales people from their top ten major customers what do you carry for them
do UNK can yo can i can you guess at how many would say i don't know
major customers
half a dozen
it's a lo i i'd sa they wouldn't admit it bill they might say something like erm oh it's electronics but they wouldn't know specifically what electronic
would that not cause er security problems if you put exactly what was on the box
you don't put you shouldn't but you should know
you should declare it
they should declare if it's UNK i it will what's word you used
UNK weren't it
UNK
was that a word
UNK
UNK contaminated
yes it is
or UNK goods
dangerous UNK really he should declare it and people don't you know unless you ask
right
right
next one
what is the customer obliged to provide da to load and UNK a consignment
who di who got the answer
not exact
i er i said suitable lifting or moving equipment
i'd accept that
plant power or labour
moving equipment then
yeah
that's
i got that one
what i said to you
ah
i got that
did you accept it paul
it got one
yeah
yeah you did
yeah about lifting equipment
about power lifting equipment
yeah i'd accept that
cup of tea for the driver
what we actually put
cup of tea UNK yeah
what we actually put is er it is the responsibility in the conditions of carriage
it is a responsibility
where would you find the conditions of carriage
on the back of every erm contract out there
on the back of every contract
because it is subject to the conditions of carriage that we accept their business and therefore we have to provide them with written information
now it is down to interpretation i er and it on your next courses you may do a more in depth conditions of carriage quiz which will ask you to study the conditions of carriage at night and produce a bit more detailed answer in the morning but we're not gonna expect you to do that on this course
erm number five erm can you read that out for me mandy
what sorry go on
go on
when would you cube a consignment
what did you put bill
what did bill put
that's a very good answer then
it's one i could think of
gets me out of trouble that one
i got one
did anybody get that one right
no well i
i thought when the mass
i sa er
is greater than the weight
you know
yes
that's right
cos i put like
i put
if you're taking six foot of film it won't weigh much but it'll take a lot of room up
that's fairly accurate that
i just put if you've got
oh you're having that one are you
if you've got a load if you
it's a good point
if you've got a er
more UNK on it
dead we or gross weight
yes
well
and the big package
that would have meant
then it go in a large
that's correct
dimensions then you cube it
we're gonna do UNK in a minute do a few exercises on UNK
yes i mean UNK mandy said er if we've got any consignment which UNK one point five cubic feet per ten kilos
but you usually know don't you if
it's lower than that actually but er sorry
mm
it isn't
i said yeah a cubic foot is se six point six then
that's probably right yeah
one point five per ten kilos
you can usually tell when you get used to it and we're gonna talk about visual identity in a minute but when the mass seems greater UNK large to the weight is what er UNK sorry mandy said and i think that's a good er a good er analogy there
i got if erm if the size is greater than the weight actually
yes
i got that
i'll accept that at this stage alright
next question is what's number six
who can read it out
er six
can't read that word
UNK
oh
ha
what UNK weight is used for UNK
six point six per cubic foot
did you get that right
i did yes
mm
yes
what UNK weight
did anybody get that right other than dan
mm
the man
i put one
UNK got it right
ton per cu well it's per cubic metre
i know
yes
because in my last job that's
three feet
how you worked it out we didn't work with feet
we worked in metres
getting you excited now bill
yeah well he does it all the time
it's only UNK it's only twenty six point six two
is it
yes
i dunno i mean i got
a metre no it's not a ton
and if you do a cubic metre in my old
yeah but yo
it was one it was like one ton per cubic metre
that's when you used to work in weight and measure though isn't it
yeah
we do plus a thousand
they did
kilos per metre squared
yeah if you work on is it is it always on cubic feet or do you actually do it on metres
well
we always wo
we tend to go back to feet i must say
yeah
but i don't know why
unless it's euro or international and then it's in metres
what are you refer what are you referring to that one that what does that
that's for loading containers
that's what you ship in
yeah that's for international you see
oh right
it's a different one
i didn't realize i was
no
international
no
it's not the same
that's what containers do don't they
they seal containers and export it to different er ratio
but the cubic idea is the same but it's six point six cu kilos per cubic foot
so a metre would be about three it's a cubic metre
we'll work on that one
gotta be nine
nine
nine
nine
cubic metres in a
metres
yard
about the same sa in ten
mm
it's about the same
what i can't understand is
not a ton
is why we mix why we mix the measures
neither can i
we've got kilos for the weight and we've got cubic feet
mm
mm
mm
mm
terry do you wanna re write the cu the UNK manual
please
make it simpler
maybe then i'll get it right
make it simpler for the new babies coming in
no you didn't you got it wrong
oh right
er seven
to what extent is t n t liable for indirect or UNK loss
i'd say we were
answer
no
anybody get
it's not
it right
yes
yeah
i got one of them
and a show of hands
does everybody understand
a lot of people
what UNK loss is or indirect loss
you lose the parcel but it's end up for example in the they used a contractor at the other end because we lost the parcel but they're not responsible for that
we'll just take the blame for it
if yeah we don't
and erm
insure documents anyway
we don't er offer transit liability on documents because we only that is a flat piece of paper to us it isn't a valuable item
we don't con the you know what the arrangement is
mm
if it's your marriage contract and you don't get married because you don't got that's not our fault
we just cos we don't ins it's only a piece of paper to us you see
so documents do not get transit liability on them at all
and UNK and UNK can be particularly sensitive to that but you cannot offer transit liability
but even if this tape is going to record the last speech of somebody famous and it didn't get and therefore they couldn't record it that is co the consequence of a delay you know a fall of snow or our vehicle breaking down or something not being done or missed some in human some human error it's not our we don't lay we'll give we'll insure or offer transit liability on the value of the goods providing you've got additional full transit liability with us but we won't for the loss of business because you didn't get it
is that can anybody think of a UNK of documents it's still the same
i think that's why super mail offers on large goods
mm
it's better than one
mm
mhm
yes
no we don't do ta erm the conditions of ca there's a slight sort of
on conditions of carriage for the same day operation but not in that league at all
on super mail if that item doesn't arrive in a set time
mm
what do you make up for just their UNK
it might be more mightn't it
the consignment or
yeah
the nearest service value
if they send out a document that UNK a kilo for tapes and they sent that one they're losing twenty
it'll lose it's value
rather than say if it doesn't arrive at a set time
that wouldn't make any difference
then it's covered for them
it's e
just the UNK
class e
with post yeah
i'm talking about
yeah sorry
if it if it was like you
say
yeah
if they us if they use a contractor
that's what they're what we're saying
you might you might get
and that sort of from the policy
you might get it
no
for nothing
well er
cos but erm
but they still go there now
yeah i know but our sort of van
what would it cost
or
like
carrier like the local land owner at the house of lords can do that
i'll buy you a
yeah but she didn't say these are all wrong once i look at
yeah
the board
paper
most of them would cos they are going like far
and everyone's
you've seen people see
we only we only insure
i didn't say what the license is
we only insure for the UNK value of
and is there any situation
the item
that's all
right
but you guarantee them delivery
yep
on the piece of paper
i know but you've lost the
we give them their money back
i mean well it'll probably arrive it'll turn up somewhere won't it really
but se
could do
i mean send another one is what we're saying have your money back
if you haven't got the you should be okay
or
if it arrived if you paid for a before
one customer should expect it to arrive then
noon and it er
i mean same ta super mail we wouldn't give them their money back
i think that's a bit more than that now
but if you ordered a ten thirty delivery and it arrived before noon we would just give you the money difference the before twe ten thirty and the before noon price not the complete price
unless you wanted to argue about it
but we feel that okay you know it may have been a half an hour late but you got there
and therefore we have incurred cost and therefore but okay it wasn't the guaranteed service
but you could argue with us you know
and again a commercial decision is made locally based on the strength of the account
but we don't you've gotta be careful as you probably know phil the abuse can of the ca you know carrier you know can be a nice little UNK if you're not careful
and you know erm people can intend to fail in order to claim money revenue back and so on
d'ya know
or damaged goods can you know put the foot through it to get the insurance cover on what we pay and we're liable
so you've got to be very careful
having said that if you there's been a court of law we'd UNK if they'd probably erm
it's where to pay to money and you're having to go to the bank manager what would he ask for the business plan and you'd have to draw that up and do all the and you have to impress the bank manager before he will even consider an UNK facility or whatever a loan
this has already been used to secure UNK facilities
just taking this along and say well there's my business plan that's what i intend to do there's my profit and all the rest of it plus accounts
the bank manager's said o k an UNK facility while you're establishing yourself in your first year
not bad is it
and that's how important stuff is
and you're never in business until you've got an UNK
not a real business
using the theory that always borrow other people's money and you'll spend other people's money is the best way isn't it
tell you what you need to do to achieve your plan so that you can actually give all your targets your ratios and your activities it's alright if this tells you to do thirty calls it's no use doing twenty
you'll only achieve two thirds of what you wanted
and it will be that accurate
so you'll only be letting yourself down
and it's a good idea to let your partners know about his don't you
because sometimes you could do with kick a kick up the UNK at home
i certainly do my wife sometimes says get out there make me lots of money
tell you each if you're on track and so if the monitoring UNK in there show you what you are what are your most productive areas and markets are
associates tend to UNK away from their markets
we were talking about this when we were talking about that subject on monday weren't we
if initially you've got em UNK with the p a whe y e market and you've got the products you're going along quite happily and then all of a sudden you hear people in the banks talking about the business market and you go ooh i'll have some of that
that sounds very big and important and what's happening your business starts sliding down because you're getting involved in something that you're not yet ready for instead of establishing your business in a market in which you are good at
but this'll tell you if you're UNK that way so you can go ooh and perhaps spend one day a week on that just to get into it and the rest of it's going to be managing my practice
show your strengths to UNK on what you're good at o k but that's normally by the sort of products you're selling or it may identify to your manager why you're just selling covermaster has living insurance gone out of fashion where you are
it might have yes identify some strengths but at the same time identify weaknesses
show you areas where you might benefit from further training that'll be UNK get yourself on a training course yes and also we're producing a which comes out in early february on training which will list to all your managers everything that we do in training
it's a we tend to it's a bit erm if you like at the moment what each little department within the agency what every department do
producing a booklet so that the manager and yourselves will look at you look at area training everything that we do in area training head office training everything they do management training everything they do and the people that are involved in it
so you can so if you feel that you're a bit you need a bit of practice in a certain area you can literally look up the type of course that would benefit you the most
o k
show your trends in your business erm what do you think that means shows your trends in your business
it actually shows you the ups and downs
i actually first realised this at the second year that when i was looking for the previous year i noticed that in july the business went and i thought because everybody's gone on holiday
because i was in the domestic market school holidays every of everybody went off in july
so i thought whoa i've got july it's going to be a bad month this year so what i'll do i'll go on holiday in july too
but i'll have a good june
yes
i'll make sure may and june top up because i'm expecting to have a bad month in july but because i'm expecting to have a good month i might as well go on holiday myself
that's a simple thing that isn't it
but it's good planning if you think about it
it makes sense if you like
show you the value of your activities because what we'll actually show you and this is where it really comes into its own
let's see i very rarely have money but we've got some money
if every time you picked up the phone and made contact with somebody and i gave you a pound would you accept that as a deal
yes everybody o k now i'll pay the phone bill all i want you to do is pick up the phone and every time you pick up the phone and make an attempt to get me an appointment i'll give you a pound
everybody do that
yes
o k the only difference is that if you do make an appointment and make it a sale i have all the commission
no
yes
no way
mhm
you would
o k we we'll draw up the contract when we've finished today o k
you're on don't say any more you're on got it o k
so what you're saying is then you like the idea of every time you pick up a phone you make you earn a pound
if i said to you every time you pick up the phone it's closer to ten pounds would it get you very excited
yes
that's in fact probably how much you earn every time you collect a no
let's keep it dead simple
let's say we earned a thousand pounds commission on one case and i had to make one hundred calls to earn to get that one sale
to get that appointment that gave you that one sale
how much was each no worth
a UNK
a UNK right
would you think it actually takes a hundred calls to make one appointment but each sale is not gonna be worth a thousand pound though is it
it's not even going to be worth half of that or a third of that let's say
yes
so then break that down you are talking at least ten pounds a call aren't we
o k
your objectives should be every time somebody says no thank you for the fifty pound
your objective to get the value of your UNK from one pound to as much as possible
so your ratios and the things you should be looking at or the activity stuff is how many calls i'm making how many UNK do i get and how much is each one of those UNK worth
because what you do you go great i've made a sale and that earned me two hundred and eighty pound
no it didn't it was all the activity in front of that earned you so you have to break all that down
this does it for you
it'll tell you how much it's worth your activity
so that literally means if it's telling you right you're ten to one your ratio of calls and you earn from every appointment two hundred pounds you've only got to make twenty calls and you'll earn four hundred pounds
you'll double your money
this is going to be exciting stuff i'll tell you
it's a gift to people in this business i'll tell you
quite unique as well is this company
er we've got it right don't quote me but i think legal and general have got something similar i'm not sure if it's legal and general or general accident but the fact that there's only one or two companies got this but ours is the most recent
there aren't yes
it'll show you the value of your practice building with time
give you an analysis of your client bank it'll tell you how many you've seen this year how many you've seen in two years three years four years and it UNK the senior associates who have got maybe eight hundred a thousand clients and it said seen in the last four years and it's got twenty
you with me
all that's doing is for the senior associates saying well look i've got such a large client bank i can't service them myself so what should i be thinking of doing
i'll recruit somebody to help me service my client bank because it's better to have fifty percent of something than fifty percent of nothing
and i'll give the other guy fifty percent
are you with me
so that means you're gonna develop people
you to experiment with different assumptions on your own plan it's on the computer so if you come up with a silly plan you can even put your five year plan in there and say well this is where i want to be and play about and see what i've really gotta be doing
you might be surprised to find that it only means an increase in activity of fifteen percent of what you're currently doing to achieve something that's in year three that you've got as year three and you might think ooh that's what i'll do for year two
but make sure you keep it realistic o k
give you summary of the business written and issued together with the commission details and pipeline business
pipeline business is the stuff that you've sent to head office been put on the shelf and hasn't issued yet because of maybe medical in the writing or there's UNK with it you know it's sat on the shelf but it hasn't actually the policy hasn't UNK itself to the client
and of course i've told you earlier on in the week that you only get paid on
written issues
issued it's written when you fill in the application form or submit it it's issued once it's been UNK or been accepted by the drug dealer if you like
eighty five percent
do you all understand the benefits of doing that
so please it's a discipline you must get into immediately and you'll be starting that on thursday
what this thursday week down here
o k i think that it's an absolutely fantastic system please UNK on it
providing it absolutely free of charge to you really
er any pe people who've been in business know what was it did you ever get any management consultants in
or business analysis in
how much did they charge them
we were
yes they don't come cheap don't they
the UNK course
UNK
they've got six managers on UNK course nine hundred pounds each
nine hundred pounds yes
that's not cheap
that was six that was twelve evenings six oh
nine hundred pounds for that
it was eight hundred and something pounds just to do a two day time management course were providing all this absolutely free
don't take it for granted it's it stuff
it'll only work if we give in our hundred percent it'll only work if you give your hundred percent
because we want your actual figures in there and just see the whole thing UNK and come to life
what you want in life
o k
finally then in this session we need to talk about the activity you need to put in to earn a living
yes and this is why i want to look at this week at a glance diary so that you will go away and i want you to fill this in as i'm filling in on the board you'll go away with an idea what a diary sorry UNK there ha erm of what a diary will look like roughly so that you know what your diary should look like every week
happy with that
now it's going to be a bit UNK this and you just try and UNK it onto that piece of paper so you're going away with some idea
yes
so what i'm gonna do is i'm going go give you a list of things that need to go into your diary every week and i'll just put the list up and you perhaps write it under sunday or something on there because i'm going to work on a five day week monday to friday
of course you're free to work seven if you want to just for er training purpose i'm gonna work on a five day week
now the things that should go in the headings will be first of all company obligations and i'll explain these as we go through it just make a list first
company personal obligations appointments marketing UNK prospecting time self development time and time for administration what we're gonna do is UNK that into real life if you like so we're gonna to have monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
as i say this looks really messy but then of course we're going to have sort of eight o'clock nine o'clock ten o'clock eleven o'clock twelve o'clock thirteen o'clock fourteen o'clock fifteen o'clock sixteen seventeen nineteen twenty one will do eh
peter
yes
would you mind just moving the screen back
no i don't want you to see the screen
o k first of all i've got company obligations up here and you might think well what's that doing at the top of the list
my personal objection obligations are more important than the company ones
well a reason i've put company obligations at the top i firmly believe that you have got a franchise you've got a franchise
just think of what you're getting
i know you're giving up your time this week but all your UNK free
and we're providing all the accommodation and travel expenses and everything
we're paying for it
and i would like to think that you're getting good quality of training and reasonable accommodation during the training which you will get
you will when you get back to your branches get full management support and company support from all the people at head office all your administration will be done in the branch you'll be given a desk right which you don't have to pay for a filing cabinet which you don't have to pay for a telephone which you won't have to pay the telephone bills for eating which you won't have to pay the bills for lighting which you won't have in other words all we want you to do is go out and sell our products
we'll even provide the application forms the brochures everything to back you up to go and do it
i think it's a damn good deal
from a business point of view
yes
so if we're giving this is it fair to say we expect something back
yes
look we're it giving a hundred percent you give it a hundred percent we'll shake hands it's a partnership
if you only give us fifty percent well i think we've got funny conversations
and by the way if we only give you fifty percent we'll allow you to UNK our cage which is a bit of a cheek really but we'll allow it
yes
after all the things we're doing for you
so company obligations but the good news is the company obligations are for your benefit
sold or
what i mean by that is when you get back to your branches you will go onto further training programmes in branch training developing your practice training so each branch will vary how they sort of co UNK this but let's say we've been in a few months now and twice a week we've got to go in for training
so monday morning eight thirty until ten o'clock training
and thursday half past eight until ten training
the important thing is it goes in your diary and anything that goes in your diary becomes an appointment not to be broken
got that that's the important thing
it can be UNK but not broken
some of them can't be broken though
training sessions half past eight you shut the door
you've turned up at eight thirty one you've missed the training session because if you turn up late for training sessions you'll end up turning up late out there
and turning up late out there is no way to start a conversation with any UNK i'm sorry i'm late
i'm sorry you've lost the UNK points already
so it's all part of this but this training session this is when the management and the senior associates within your branch give up their own time to develop your business for you
you get senior associates saying this is the way i do it
this is the way i ask for referral this is the way i service my client this is what i do
then you get somebody else well i started the same as you but i do it this way i do it that way so that you can UNK your way of doing it
to your benefit so turn up at half eight nine o'clock whatever it is
it's important
once a month you'll have a branch meeting or an area meeting but the area manager will write to you and say between two o'clock on wednesday and five o'clock we've got i don't know if they're going to call them area now or branch meeting
that's once a month
so we'll stick that in there again it's an appointment
now this is where you go to the branch and the branch management team stand up and bring you up to date with everything that's happening in the company with product changes legislation changes yes some of it's boring but it's information you've got to have
but also they have guest speakers so there's UNK stuff there which you always will need in sales yes and also the awards
the best UNK to the branch yes
the best and you have i mean this branch has divisions and all the rest of it first division UNK division and all the rest of it
who's the top of the first who's the top of the second all these little awards
it might be a bottle of wine but a bottle of wine goes a long way and everybody you stand up and you get your bottle of wine and everybody goes yes feel good
go back to the wife hey i've won a bottle of wine
it's important that we get these things
we award people for doing things
it might be a nice rose bowl it might be a weekend in the UNK that's paid for you or whatever it's good stuff be part of it
the important thing for people new to the business you're rubbing shoulders with people that know the business and it's your opportunity to say hey i've heard about you i think ooh you're important and hello
how about me having half an hour with you my friend and tell me how you do it
yes
run with the winners run with the winners
so you get to know people as well don't you at those things
again all for your benefit
so company obligations always put them in your diary and anything that goes in your diary is an appointment not to be broken
yes
personal obligations well this is vitally important because you are going to need the people you share your life with
there's gonna be times when you're collecting more UNK than you would like to collect and you're gonna go home pretty miserable and this is the time when your partners have got to know what you're trying to achieve and maybe put the arm round your shoulder or butter you up discuss these things with them
so these people are important to you so it's vitally important that you don't let them down because initially this business has a strange effect on you in as much as it seems to take over your mind doesn't it
i bet it's happened already
but everybody you see now you look at in a different light
oh there's john i wonder if he wants a pension
oh yes oh there's karen oh she'll need a life insurance policy
already happening
your mind starts and the trouble is it starts UNK your life
what i'm saying here is don't let it
if before you became an abbey life associate every wednesday night you played UNK with three of your UNK as a UNK yes o k continue to do that in the future the only difference is i want you now to put it in your diary that half past seven wednesday night i'm playing UNK with the lads
that's the only difference because you'll need these things to get release from the business because it does take over your mind
what it means is you're planning your time so that you can work your work time this will fit in round it that's all we're doing
now let's says big UNK says take me for a chinese oh right dear so half past seven b h oh sorry this is b h chinese i might as well right the rest of the evening off
she might be hungry
yes i can't eat
now that goes in there chinese
i ring up richard
i ring up richard and richard says the only time i can see you is seven o'clock tuesday night and i've got no appointment
i say o k
no appointment
and i ring up b h and i say i'm sorry about tuesday night but i've got this guy that wants to see me it's really good and she'll say alright you're starting off o k off you go we'll rearrange it for next week
same thing happens next week
third time what's the conversation going to be
since you went to that abbey life i never see you know out every night
when's the last time we went for a meal
you think that abbey life's more important than i do d'ya want this and by the way the other way round
if it was your wife working for abbey life would you like it if she was breaking appointments and out every night and all the rest of it
you'd start saying something wouldn't you
so look where's he going to the next day
planet mars
that the only time he can see me is next tuesday night
no all i say to richard is i'm sorry i'm tied up
which is to my advantage anyway because it's telling him
i'm a busy person and people like doing business with busy people
and successful people
so i say richard i'm sorry i can't make it this tuesday i'm tied up but i have got next tuesday if UNK the best night for you
yes o k then right because it's more than a week away i'll give you a bell close to the time just to make sure you everything's alright
o k peter just send a confirmation
yes
don't break that appointment it's to your benefit anyway that you don't
by the way are you UNK that this week is for setting up appointments for next week
try and get that going as soon as possible
do you understand this
all this week is for is going on appointments i've made last week and for setting up my appointments for next week
it's given me five clear working days to set up my appointments for next week
so i'm working on what we call a rolling week
other personal things might be that tommy your little lad has a school sports day
tommy that again should've been blue
that says blue
write in here
put the damn thing down o k
now parents in the room who've got young children when was the last time you actually went to school sports day
you can't remember why
because you were working
all of a sudden you're self employed you can go because you're in control of your own time
so tommy comes up and says dad yes son can you come to the school sports day and you say when's that son
next week two o'clock to four o'clock
yes alright son really and he's dead UNK
and he goes off to school and he tells all his mates
and he says my dad is coming to the school sports day
and he's dead fast and he says he's going to win the egg and UNK race and the sack race because he's the best dad in the world
so there
you get up on the thursday morning and you say tommy
yes dad i'm sorry son something's come up and i've got an important client to see this afternoon and i'm not gonna to be able to make it
well tommy is a brave little UNK he says alright dad and off he goes to school and all his friends are really sympathetic about this
they get to the school sports and they say where's your dad
well he can't come because he's a great big UNK and he's very important and couldn't make it
no he's not he's chicken
what do you mean he's chicken
because my dad's come and he's going to win the egg and UNK race
no he's not yes he is no he's not
smack and you end up going to school to pick up the UNK anyway
look these people are important to you
don't let them down
don't let them down
they're important to you
the only thing i'm asking you to do is put them in the diary now
whereas before you didn't did you
if you take your wife out for a meal you invite her out for your meal you just say let's go tuesday night it never went in the diary
now you do
that's all i'm asking you to do
if you get your partner to help you as well you'll find that they start writing things in it
b h did she used to say school run tuesday evening don't make any fun she used to block it out the time that she wanted me to see me
yes so get them into the habit of doing it
moving on now to the important thing appointments this is where can go to
because i've done some red i'll do green
alright
so what i'm saying is here is again your ratios and anything on the computer it will tell you how many appointments you need to make just from your ratios
let's say then i just i used to have to work on eleven appointments a week because if i had eleven appointments a week two people would perhaps blow me out change their minds two people would rearrange two people would say no thank you and another two would say yes but i need to do it next month which might leave me with two sales
so i had to have eleven appointments to get my two sales a week
do you understand what i mean
so all sorts of things happen
so what i've got to do i've got to change colour not me pen
o k
and put my appointments in
well let's start sticking them in
let's have what a lunch time one there it's not very green is it
that's a bit UNK let's put one in there like that and you can pop these anywhere you want to
it's a bit UNK this giles but do you want to just sort of put a few appointments in there
let's have one for there let's have a breakfast appointment because you all got those didn't ya
shall we have two breakfast appointments yes
every tuesday and wednesday we'll have breakfast appointments and we'll have another one there and one in before we take big h out
what are we doing wednesday yes we'll have one there and we'll have one there i'm sticking them all over the place but you'll see what i mean
how UNK that
one two three four five six seven eight nine and stick another one here ten one on friday morning eleven
that's my eleven points
the reason i've used a UNK or changed colour is that now that the colour sticks out doesn't it
it's prominent yes
this is good because it gives me control when i make my appointments
what i mean by that is when i ring up richard we must give an alternative close mustn't we
daytime or evening or morning or afternoon whatever you your preference is i say to richard will a daytime or an evening appointment be more convenient and he says well UNK better for me
and i say o k i've got twelve o'clock monday or alternatively one o'clock tuesday
it's me giving the times
why
because they're UNK at me in front of me in my diary
by the way they're also made up for the following week as well in case if it's tuesday night oh let me just look at next week what have i got
green UNK or orange UNK yes i've got next tuesday night free at seven o'clock how about that
it's always me giving the times
so that eventually we'll find a UNK time
yet i'm in control
you must be in control
the minute they say well no that's no good to me you'll have to come and you'll have to come and see me at eight say well i'm busy then i'm afraid
but i've got the following week at eight so that's lucky isn't it
so it's still me agreeing because otherwise they di they're taking control off you and it's no good in business it's not is it fighting for control but it's as long as you're both fighting and both happy about fighting for it that's fine
yes use your common sense on that
the second thing it does is highlight the fact that you've actually got to put names in there because this is next week
so it tells me once i've decided when i'm gonna see all these people i've now got to get names in here haven't i
and unless next week's eleven boxes are filled with names this week doesn't end
are you with me here
i'm working this week to set up i'm over here i'm setting up next week
if i've got a couple of these blank i cannot finish on friday night i'm going to have to do some overtime
i'll have to do some more calls on friday night to try and get those appointments and if necessary i'll have to come in on saturday morning because you don't finish a week until you've got your appointments for the following week
because without those eleven appointments i've calculated i might have two blow outs two people might want to rearrange two people want to think about it i've got to have my eleven to make my two sales
if i close this week with only seven i may only end up with one sale and that's not gonna to give me the income i want and big h wants so i can take her out for a chinese
do you understand
so again it's a discipline
you'll be letting yourself
it's no use going home on friday night and going erm i've only got five appointments you're self employed it means you're going to have to work a couple of hours extra
i can go in on saturday morning and make some more calls you're self employed
you cannot have a week where you haven't got any appointments
yes
i know it's gonna be tough initially it is tough initially
but you've got to still come you've got to get the UNK up and then once the UNK up you've got to keep knocking it around
but getting the UNK up is the hardest thing isn't it all over the place
so please remember that discipline
personal obligations appointments marketing prospecting time
well marketing could be sorts of things it could be doing exhibitions which you've talked about it could be erm mail shots it could be looking going down the library to do to look up the electoral role to look up the names of people
whatever it is it's the activity that leads to appointments whatever the activity is put it in here
so after you've finished training you're going down to the library yes to look up the names of the people UNK in street and once you've been on that appointment you've got to go back to the branch and you're gonna do your mail shots whatever you're gonna do put it in there
so i'll just put prospecting
now of course the best time to do prospecting is when
the evening
no when's the best time to do your prospecting
on your appointments
what's prospecting
prospecting is collecting names isn't it
which is referrals the most efficient way of prospecting is on your on here so really on every appointment you should have a little p
or referred leads or whatever
think about it should be in there
now self development time
everybody in this room is a UNK on covermaster living insurance sexist savings plan and healthmaster aren't you
yes peter
no you're not
all you've done what have we done all you've done
is the basics
is passed the UNK test you've passed your driving test now you're going to learn to drive
drive
you're fully UNK with all the application forms aren't you
no
you've read all the product brochures haven't you
no
you've watched all the videos and you've really got a good working knowledge of these subjects haven't you
no
right well you're not going to be on a constant training course otherwise we'd never get you out there selling
so there's gonna be a bit of time gonna to be spent on your own developing yourself
for example that brochure never give anybody a brochure which you haven't read yourself
because they may might read it
eh
eh
believe it or not many people not many people do actually read them but school teachers and engineers the UNK the UNK minds they read the damn things and when they come back they ask you a question and you say i don't know i've never read it
what's the chance of getting a sale
UNK
so know what you're talking about
so the good news is we have got these brochures we've got videos and everything
why not do it at home away from the UNK of the office is the important thing
do it at home
take the video home wait for everybody to go out you can stop in UNK it pause it write down the lines or just study the subject
match it up read your brochures in your own time so do it at home whenever possible
because don't forget you'll have the formal training sessions in your branches anyway
so get it in there just before so you're up at six o'clock in the mornings are you
so self development should be in there
self development
whatever programme return
but what the best thing to do is get organised on it and do it on a weekly basis say self development this week is the personal pension plan
monday nine o'clock i'm gonna to watch the video technical video on personal pensions at home
yes tuesday half an hour i'm going to sp read the personal UNK brochure
it's like just ticking them off and surprisingly all this knowledge will build up inside you until eventually you know what you're talking about and once you know what you're talking about it UNK confidence and once you're confident it UNK itself to the people you're talking to and they like it because you know what you're talking about and that leads to sales
and sales lead to profit
got it
so it's not wasted time
this is the two hundred and eighty pound stuff i assure you yes
and then finally administration
when you've found out already that abbey life is responsible for the d the UNK of the UNK
we are look at the paper we've give you this week
and bumf
when you get back to your branches you'll be allocated a tray or a pigeon hole or something or other and you'll find within a month or so that you get on all the mailing lists and you end up with all this bumf
now you can come in every day and sit and sort out your bumf but i always believe that the great british public are out there so the more time you spend out there the more profit you're gonna make there's less profit being in the branch
and yet because you've come from a p a y e background you feel you've got to get up in the morning and go to work
and when you get to the branch you get your bumf and you sit there looking through all the bumf
and so you think you're working
guess what you ain't getting paid for that
it's non productive
however you need to keep yourself up to date with this bumf and you've got to control it
so you can do it every other day or whenever whatever your UNK is but what i used to do is do it on a friday
admin
and it used to all add up and go in on friday after i'd got everything sorted out go in on friday and get all this bumf and go to a desk my desk and i'd put it down get a bin right a cup of coffee UNK your tie and start UNK through it
yes
oh i've missed something
i knew i'd missed something
it's very important
approaching time
and i'll come back to the administration in a second
how could i miss approaching time
when i was asking for my referred leads yesterday what did i say
would you tell them that i'll be giving them a ring between half past six and quarter past seven
that's a lot to stay in because that's in the script isn't it you can say that because i'll be ringing at the same time on thursday
why could i say that
because you knew it
it was in my diary it was planned every week
that was my phone sessions every week
yes i allowed monday to get my eleven for the following week
i allowed thursday as my UNK in case i haven't got my eleven
yes
if i haven't got my eleven on a thursday night it meant overtime on friday or saturday morning that's what it meant
would it be fair to say new to the business you should be approaching every day
because you're new to the business
you'd be silly not to
until eventually you can get it to a stage where you're just doing it because you know you can get your eleven appointments
but again you've got to work towards that
so initially you're going to be approaching every day
now going back to administration i'd UNK through and it might say that the UNK being delivered so i've got to set up a policy delivery call
well i don't ring up the client now i make a note to ring them monday night because every approach session should always start off with warm calls i don't know if alan told you that
right your first two calls should always be warm ones
not mum because your mum will always love you
hello mum
hello well never mind son you know
i mean i'm ringing up john
hi john it's that time of the year for us to talk about your pension look i'm in your area next week when can we get together
alright pete how's things and all the rest of it yes one in the bag
hi charles it's peter you've got the policy document is that right
yes o k as i say i want to come along and check it and there's a couple of other things i want to talk to you about when's the best time for us to get together
i've got i've got they're oh cases i've got two in the bag
then i get on to my calls
my referred leads and all the rest of it
at the end of my little phone session i've one last in the bag hi mick peter as i said i'd give you a bell in january do you think it's a good time for us to get together now yes oh great o k i've got
so what's the worst i can get at the end of a telephone session the worst is that i'll end up with three appointments
so that's why your top ten names really the no the people you'll probably get appointments with you don't want to be ringing them all up on thursday night otherwise you'll blow them all
you want to UNK them don't you
so that you know at least when you ring one somebody you're going to get one appointment out of a phone session
so it should be like your close friends and family in the middle bob who's my brother he said he'd give me an appointment when i come back i'll ring him and then i go to the outer circle for the rest of that phone session
yes
so the ones i definitely know i'm going to get appointments with if i go and do that i put myself into a comfort zone don't i
erm and then probably you won't make any sales because they're all too close to you
do you understand my theory there
so all i do is go through this file that oh yes file it and then you've got your client files and everything file everything the pile goes down some of it's bin UNK
o k
what does that mean
so the pile goes down
and then what do you do then
well you always need motivating so how would you do it
four o'clock finish
home UNK
no
pictures
home m and s marks and UNK bottle of UNK
i shouldn't need one
question mark what that means is four o'clock you go home you pick the kids up from school you take them all to UNK you all have big UNK then you go off to the pictures and they all want to see arnold UNK blowing somebody's head off and you want to watch UNK or whatever it is
you're all having arguments about that you all go to the pictures an early showing you go home bung a marks and UNK meal into the oven they're great i could live on it o k just bung it into the oven pull out the UNK then you sit down wind down the week couple of UNK maybe a glass of UNK one o'clock in the morning here we come and all the rest of it sort the world out friday night wind down enjoy the weekend
they'll do that at the UNK tonight aren't they
o k let's do that sound good
what would it be like though if i hadn't got my eleven appointments
dreadful
it wouldn't be a good night would it
what happened was i'd go home go to UNK and have to go back to the office
but i didn't want to be in the office making phone calls to people who're rude and saying go away
i wanted to be at the pictures with my family
so what was it was a UNK
because i didn't want the kids saying ah you haven't got to and i didn't want to go in on saturday morning either did i
i wanted to go home and do that and in fact do the things i wanna to do at weekends
not worrying about what's happening next week
so put a UNK at the end of the week
in fact deliberately if you can't go there you're going to let people down so that they give you stick
good one
now what's the real benefit from this
the real benefit from this is that you've got a full page and a full diary
the real benefit is it gives you a reason to get out of bed in the morning
if you study the long term unemployed sadly what happens is they lose their job or they don't get employment and eventually they keep working hard right but after the period of time they get UNK when they find that people are not willing to take them on and of course it's a terrible thing for them to cope with
but UNK what happens is eventually they say well what's the point of getting up in the morning so they lie in till ten o'clock
and then they start thinking what's the point of getting up at ten
not going anywhere they lie in till lunchtime
until eventually they get up at lunchtime and they say what's the point of having a UNK i'm not going anywhere so they stop UNK
so what i'm saying is their dignity and you often hear them saying this their dignity is the important thing
the reason that is disappearing is because they haven't got a purpose to get out of bed in the morning exactly
this gives you a purpose and a reason to get out of bed in the morning
otherwise i've just talked about the alternative
your dignity will go you'll destroy yourself mentally
i've only got one appointment and that's wednesday and that's a bit UNK
you're gonna destroy yourself
it's not the appointments that matter it's the activity around the appointment the fact that i'm gonna get up on monday morning i'm gonna go training and once i've done that i've got to nip down to the library o k and look up that electoral role i've got an appointment and then i'm gonna go back to the office i'm gonna to do my mail shots and then i'm gonna to go home UNK the lawn have a bit of tea and then i'm gonna to my approaching and then i'm gonna go yes on that appointment there
it doesn't matter if these two people here these two appointments are a bunch of UNK or they hate you or you just it doesn't matter
yes it doesn't matter
if you don't make a sale or it was a successful day it's the fact that you've had a full day of activity that matters
so at the end of day you're tired you think UNK what am i doing tomorrow
tomorrow morning oh my goodness i've got that i've got that and i've got that
because i can promise you and i can promise you i get you a guarantee that if you get good at those things you'll be successful
if you continue a week like that sales will result
and sales result in profit for you
i promise you
you might even on the odd occasion go a whole week without making a sale
i don't give a damn as long as you do the activity
yes
anything
are you happy with that
the reason to get out of bed in the morning
it's so important for you
any questions
do you see the importance of planning millions of things you've got to stick down with think about think about your objectives get that see who it get that poster up really think what you wanna be in five years' time three years' time all the rest of it seriously think about it
men mention it this weekend to your partners and tell them to start thinking about it
so next weekend when you come back off the induction you should be fired up let's see what we're really gonna to do here yeah
what am i going to do
and then start planning it and the sooner you get your diary to that state the sooner you're on your road to success
are you happy
o k
end of the course
UNK
however sorry
a question on planning is it
now when do we get these UNK
right i'm just going to do
planning
alright what we're going to do now is just give you your er pieces of paper back so you'll need your logs yes
and also i'm gonna give you your diaries and UNK and things at the same time
so if a couple of you to save everybody getting up could you distribute those two notes could you two distribute the karen one of you do the UNK and one of you do the UNK there should be twelve
please distribute those alright
this is your life
UNK
thank you very much
or richard mr
thank you
the people doing UNK please
yes
erm want to come through into this room and we'll sit you down doing them now
stuart
just heard it this week
so the UNK people could they go next door and start doing the UNK
yes i think you can
it's got pockets yes you'd better not open those actually
they'll leave a mess everywhere
probably better just to take them home and look at them rather than compile them now
i mean if you want to by all means but it's just going to leave a mess everywhere
is there pockets in them
business cards
no these tax cards
that's just
i've never seen these before
er yes what happens is that venture capital you'll see that
yes the one i've got is i just bought my own from w h smith which has all that little pockets for plans and so on
they don't go over the rings anyway
m
yes potentially yes
but it's
what do we then do
on thursday night you can't make a phone call if you can't
what do we do if there aren't
it's just a matter of waiting for your references to be checked out or whatever the UNK is so all you'd do is stay i mean don't sit at home
you'll have to go into the branch but what if i was your manager i'd say well what we'll do is keep on working and training until it's alright
you'll be alright sorting your problems out
physically doing you can always carry on but you can't physically go out on appointments until you're admitted that's what we're saying
no alright
are you still keen
quite keen
erm just one of those empty boxes at the back there
right stuart
is richard UNK
yes can you just put that on his thing
make
he's got two i think
one of them's probably UNK
put these in your log if you've got them
log
in the log
he's got two so give it to him
that one
the new one
log that's the one i gave you on monday morning
graham hold on right
right
karen and she should
i've got giles or what
john and i've got a little UNK type thing and then i've got this
so that's what this is
UNK
we take this with us yes
i've got some more to give you yet
you couldn't help me by distributing those could you
now these have are the erm the logs i took off you on monday richard
now they need to go back this needs to go back on section two doesn't it
this goes back in section two yes and when they give you your induction report which we've still got to put some results on that goes back in section three
mick stuart can you put that on UNK for me please john giles richard there steve
steve for me
you haven't signed it steve and you've got to sign it because really just have a look at your management that shouldn't arrive here like that
you should've completed those things
you should have seen training steve
just in the front row because your manager will want in the back one
no
you know i mean it's quite realistic if you can change a video or even that if you'd written hadn't had time for whatever reason but video just point that out
it's no help to you now but you can certainly help
UNK
yes there's always the
that those yes that goes into your section two of your log
give that bob and then the final report i'll give you will go into section three
put it into section two now and you'll be alright
where does that go that one
that will go into three as well with the report i'm going to give you
graham section two that goes into karen
we've got sorry at what point do the first bits go
they go into
section
sorry the first two go into section three and they will marry up with your induction forms
thank you
that goes into two this is all section two
this is the stuff i took off you on monday
have you done anything to it
no i've just checked
right
that they've done what they've said they've done and made a note on the things they'd said they'd done but they hadn't done
right
have a little word in their shell likes
it's alright part of my job is actually monitoring the managers what they do as well so that they're doing what they should be doing which is fair enough isn't it
is that everything now
no there's something else yet i'm sorry
oh yes i can give you UNK because you want to get going don't you
well there's no harm
you can stop UNK
do you actually do this
i love it that UNK comment with practice on something we didn't do
ha
yes you did you all had a chat with each other at the end of the referred lead session didn't you
if you're going to be asking for a
the fact that you didn't ask for personal recommendations it's not my fault
every time you were gonna ask i said stop
what's the point then
so
well i don't know what to do with these it's obviously a
right let me go and get the it's next to the wall
reports
i beg your pardon
that's monday too
well there's not much of it
make the best of it aye
well i have to otherwise i wouldn't have any effect at all with my luck
i've lived all my life waiting for an opportunity like this somebody saying you're all individuals but when it came i was not convinced
i'm just going to grab a bit to eat because alan's still filling out the induction reports but don't leave yet until you've got your induction report please
as soon as you've got that you can
is that the results that you've taken today
we'll have to give up and good luck to you right
where does the induction report go in here
the report has arrived
it's coming it's coming that'll go in section three
let's have a look in
that's right section three it should be blank at the moment except for what you've just been given
oh i see not in here
i'm thinking
right well i'm trying to but it's very
stupid boy why hide it
right section two for the report
no i don't understand
that one that one page two get it the right way up that one like that that's it
now wait for me your UNK coming now
submit it and
section three goes in there and then i'll give you your induction report back which alan's got at the moment and that goes in section three and that's fantastic eh so let's have a UNK something to eat
so what have you got to take on sunday it's these two isn't it
i just think she's going to have to go and buy a UNK i mean i can't see any other way round it
so that what we did was first of all when you filled in your initial choice and then we got a team choice and now perhaps what would make a lot of sense is that if we have the first few er team answers one member of this team er and then we'll go through the others
and
alright
the one thing we will certainly mark is that the answer which you get does depend on the way in which you read some of the statements or some of the principles
erm but what i wanted us to do is to start getting some discussion going and so that you're actually getting a bit closer to one another
let's go through this team here
you can do it mary if you like
what did you get for the fir or what did you reckon the first set of claims you decided wanted to be UNK
truth
everybody agree with truth
yes
yeah
yes
yes
i think so
erm and that's not just in selling is it
i mean that's in everything
er you get sa UNK and they say that if a training course which is gonna start at half past eight on february the tenth erm yeah well that's what we gotta do then you gotta start looking to the planning towards haven't you
and you gotta there when you gotta there and so on and so on
so he gets the first and decide what you wanna get to
but if you don't do that any UNK get you there
and i think that's something that we'll certainly discuss tomorrow on thursday
if you are what i want you to do is to create a team plan and the first thing we need to decide in that team plan is where do we wanna get
what do we wanna do
not we wanna increase sales because everybody wants to do that but if we've gotta increase sales by what
is it five percent
ten percent
thirty percent
we wanna get more you know there's th thi this er there is no point really in saying things like what i'd like to do is to improve the quality of the appointments because that don't tell you anything
it has to be some solid reason
some absolute measurable thing
okay
any customers been another customer at all
all of us
all of us
yes i think so
i think so
otherwise we'd have all the i'd be discussing what it is
right
means testing
they're sort of sales for sales sake
yeah
oh
i'm
erm
just being awkward
i well
there's nothing wrong with that
as you know
there's nothing wrong with that
i mean we've all we've all seen the results of any customer who's a bit of a nervous so sort haven't we
well that's putting that well
i think we have
dave i think
as sorts
yeah you UNK you draw up one aren't you
mm
yeah
that's right
yes
i mean it's er it's wo that's one we refer to as the UNK mobile cos we can use that when the american express comes through
erm but the er yes any customer know knows when you're talking a load of nonsense
erm thought so didn't they
true
a UNK should never abandon hope of winning an account
which is really great
UNK
that's a good one isn't it
well you have to something there
does anybody everybody think true
no
yeah
yeah times change don't they
yeah
buyers change companies change attitudes change markets change
our
yep
yes they go off
what about this one
we'll ask linda this time when it says good plans sell require retain
i put false
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think that has to be the chain
yeah
because it might be a good plan today
mm
but i wonder how good it is tomorrow
you know with things changing and that and that
ah
here's a nice one
hmm
erm
mm
right the effective sales person puts most of his or her effort into prospecting for new accounts
false
false
true
i put true
true
somebody else er
you're prospecting rather than using your current
what about your time plan this morning
the sheets the sheets this morning proved that
yeah
three hours prospecting on the b l s and three hours prospecting from nine o'clock till twelve
yeah
that's six hours prospecting
i put true
i'm with you lads
yeah
er you did er have sort of fair factual discussion then
i were only one
yeah
who put true
right
these put
yes i'd have thought it was true
erm
true
i'd have thought that what is what is
i'm not saying obviously if somebody existing based on that
that is that is right
you have to look after your existing customers of course whether they are
well you see most of us don't do this
it doesn't say time peter it says effort
that's right
effort
yeah
yeah but you put you must be putting about five hours effort of a day into prospecting accounts
three hours nine till twelve prospecting or cold calling whatever you wanna call it
another two three hours of doing
but
this
yeah but you look when you're receiving the trade from the prospecting
when you receive your trade from a prospect
you have this amount of trade in and this amount of prospect and your telling me if i have half trade in and half prospect i'd like to see the difference in how much time you spent on
yeah but
on each one
yeah but the thing is you don't do it it's a
you don't have a you don't have a se
so you prospect
yeah but if you did yeah but it's a very difficult question
effort and then a prospect an area where you want
yeah
to you've got time there
yeah but you do well you do actually measure a regular more distance
at the end of the day you do need to get business
well i put
in
yeah but there's no point in losing business for new business
that's true
but we're not saying that
but it's
yeah but if
actually time spent prospecting
it's not time
if
yeah
then
even though it's not
it's not
well i think that's i think you can UNK you can say right e the effectiveness is if you spend seventy five percent of your effort getting prospect accounts on but you still use twenty five percent of it to
yeah
exactly
to retain existing then you're still gonna be paying the business on and you're still gonna be able to look after er
right
the existing
you just it's just
i don't know
whether you get that one percent
what d'ya think
a fortnight
sorry
it makes no
what d'ya think
difference
what do i think
yeah but john when you say the word
what d'ya think
effort you want
i think if tom was sat there it would be ninety percent
you know
because he didn't
he just
really wanna be in on anything else but except business
right
once you shared the time
honestly
number six then
i'm happy to be
UNK sales volume is the most important task of the sales person
oh solely
false you put here
i put false here
well i think you need to recognize that really sales volume is it takes us back again to the fact that any customer is better than no customer at all
we were saying we were just saying UNK sales as in more otherwise it's sales potential rather
yes
than
er what we're what
UNK what we've got
what we are about or what every sales company should be about is making money
yeah
and er and just increasing sales volume or UNK sales volume ain't gonna do it
ah we ought to more or less max UNK the
yeah
sales figures
right
it's UNK the sale of the revenue and rising the revenue is what we talked about
oh yes that one
what's it called
so a resistance can be used with that and of course it indicates interest in the product
true
true
all the time that that's what
yeah
an objection is
mhm
and i think that's there's something which we most of us fear
i hope not
so the resistance is diminished by stretching the novel features of a new product
jane
mm
what do you think
agree
we had a
i think
discussion about this as well
i think we misunderstood novel features as a bad thing to be honest
yes we were saying we can
no but you we were asking about
you can
novel features
you can overcome objections
novel is the word there
by offering the benefits of a product
not necessarily novel though is it
no that's what i'm saying novel that's why UNK the key word
novel
what have you got the one right wing here
nothing at all
yeah
but well
i had well i had
er
false at first and then we had a big discussion about it
yeah right
we had false particularly until we new product coming out
i would think that was false to be honest
yeah
er
it's the novel that did it
and well
yeah
i think what happens all the time i understand why if you put true you me you put it was that the one thing that sales people always desperately want is something new
okay
er differently that's not new
erm and i think that probably er i think that's false but it's er interesting discussion
yes
er when a sales person closes he though i suppose i should say that he or she should use that closing technique which is most suited to his or her personality
this is the one we were debating
yeah
i had true but i got UNK
i had true
so i put a false in that one
you got UNK
right
i had true
i had true
said false
me and david said false
true
what
should we be co considering the customer at any time
you see in my view each customer is different
you don't close the same way with every customer
right
so is it the fact that the that what th the close should be most suited to the customer
yeah
yeah
rather than ourselves
yeah
that'd be fair i think
because you close with your own personality anyway don't you really
right
i think
and also he's buying you as well as he's buying the product
yes i think so i think that is of course i think that erm that the close which you use
yeah
has to be geared to the customer
er and not your personality
and this is a nice one then isn't it
the direct close the most successful technique because it's the most honest
don't ask us
don't ask us
no
pretty good was it
yeah
we got anti
that's right
that's right
what about this side
well we got true but i
true
would say false
i would say false as well
he said true and we said true
he's well we start off with that
oh i'll let you off
it's an interesting one because er really the thing th the sentence goes or the principle works very well until you get to the word honest
yeah
that's right
exactly
that's what we're laughing at
UNK
that's what we're arguing on
what the UNK honesty got to do with it
ah i think er
the most obvious
yes that's right
i'm not sure that UNK a word which i would er don't get me wrong i'm not suggesting that a UNK don't think that
what i am suggesting though i think is that you know a close which is referred to as being the best of course is th the most honest is the
yeah the
well peter can can't you remember
UNK formula
yes
where we were UNK the UNK the UNK used to be UNK down for about five six seven years
that's right
so he would have known
that's right
assuming the
actually you could have gone to the a m express conference and heard it
i played a UNK actually talking about
UNK close
UNK assuming that it is question physical action judgements trapped the UNK close and ask for the order
that's right
so
how did you UNK that
because that's the way you learnt it
used to be in all the UNK
that's right
ever heard
yeah
of a UNK close that's right
what do
they all can
after you
everybody can remember what it stands for but they can't do it
that's right
well ask for the order it is
yeah
that's right
they all er ask for the order
it's the i the di they used the word honest
no
ah sure well that th that's what but anyway as long as it created discussion that was the point of it
and good product of service will sell itself
false
no
no
no that'll be the day won't it
false
yeah
false that one is
a knowledge of human psychology is important when
false again
selling
now then that's
only one of the seven up here we all said true
true
but bear in mind she's you know she's walked out of the
that's right
so what do you think of that
i think we all feel that's true don't we
i do
apart from the odd er fact and most of research we don't need
erm we don't need a degree in it but some
other people's problems
it's a
yeah i do
cos last time
i'm going anyway
with the exact same sheet that i did to start with
you said we didn't need anything because i
social skills
true last time
right
and it was
we're not getting rid of that now
social skills are relatively UNK for a UNK
false
i think we need certain social skills don't you
yes
erm and more so on the telephone than we ought and more on the telephone than some sometimes we do er erm face to face
a person does not buy the product but rather buy what it'll do for him or her
true
yes that's right
a former customer one who no longer buys anything is of little value
false
false
yeah
i think so
cos he changes doesn't he
and er okay
right well let's generate the do discussion and er get you all er involved in something else for three quarters of an hour
right
i want now to show you this er film then and there's no point in having alright we're taking on everything
doing far more than we can reasonably do and if you like doing it by very definition badly or worse than it could have done
right that's one message that comes out of it
what else
slow
no effort
right
there's no thinking time at all is there
no
right
okay
no there's no planning or nothing's UNK
everything's all
no plan
mm
no diary
there's no concentration
yeah
no concentration with the job in hand
everything
looks like me and jack
UNK him from what he's doing and he the UNK
the what
no plans
no details
never saw one job through
mm
he kept on doing one job
yeah instead of instead of from
one from the other
from start to finish he didn't just
finish one job at a time
finish one job
in which
yeah
it would one job less to do
so this fact that there's no plan or appeared to be no diary although there was a diary wasn't there
he had stuff wrote
yeah
down on it
yeah and he didn't he didn't listen to any of the people
yeah
what the people
ha
had to say he just said yes all afternoon
yeah he just
right
kept saying yes to everything just to barge them off
he didn't listen did he
no
no not at all
he had too many interruptions
hmm
er we said the said ignoring the needs
mm
where was that
well his secretary when he was on
yeah
the phone
yeah
and he kept checking up
and he
the guy in
sort of hung up on him
the guy in the car park when he forgot to ring him back about some important business
the managing director
he kept ringing
yeah
the managing director spoke from the car and he never followed it up
and he kept
that's right
he wanted to be the decision maker and he wanted to make the decision on every single thing himself and then he was turning round and saying to his secretary well can't you do anything
do i have to do everything
whereby he had obviously made it clear from the start
mm
he was the only one with the authority
he kept checking up on erm
not that he trusted anyone either because when they were doing the wages
kept checking up on people's like erm capabilities as well instead of getting on with his own job he kept checking up on their them all as well
so he's checking up on everybody
yeah
even if he lets them do something
mm
mhm
the wages he didn't trust her with the wages
he UNK about on the calculator
that's right
you'd expect a wages clerk to be able to handle it wouldn't you
yeah
er and also that er when he went into
hmm
appointment he erm he let he let the client take over the call because he wasn't erm prepared enough when he weren't there
right so when he went in to see somebody he had
that's it
done no preparation at all
no
had he
no
he didn't know why he was there did he
he wanted five percent discount didn't he
told him selling a million pounds worth of flour e er flour a year and he had his twenty first coming up and apparently he starts UNK the beans
good
on how much he had really
that's right
er
he doesn't a great deal with the guy cos he
so when he says no plan here so it's not only no plans in the day it UNK through to
his work
yeah
everything
his everyday work as well
yeah
mm
he just pu he just kept putting off important things as well
that's right
and end up with
er yeah i think i think it's this stress that he felt he was under which led him to panic
you could just see him getting more and more UNK up but if he just sort of sat down and wrote things down what he'd got to do and do try and do them in a set order
mhm
mm
yeah
that mr was a
and i mean that was the root problem really
that's it
but mr
mm
the director had him wrapped round his little finger for that five percent
didn't he
yeah
mm
what did he say tha then
because he really believes what was that bit
well he was just telling er mr
the person was telling him or the
th no he was telling the customer he was selling a million pounds worth of flour a year and that and i i've got a twenty first birthday er you know wi coming up party well after that
aha
he's not worried about that he just
yeah
wants his five percent
yeah
that's right
that's right
so there's no preparation a at all
oh no
on that er particular er interview was there
he didn't he also didn't let people know what he was doing as well
didn't keep staff informed
did what
didn't keep his staff informed of what was happening
just expected them to know
didn't tell them
when he met those three people
he didn't so
yeah he didn't tell anyone about that
he didn't and the guy didn't ask him
but why didn't he tell anybody about
cos he was scared embarrassed
he was embarrassed wasn't he
yeah
didn't wanna tell anybody about it cos he knew they could say well can't you organize things better than that
what's the real sub total now of this guy of ours
right so there's
he had no organization
none at all i mean he when he saw john UNK on that erm computer said what's that
he didn't know
way behind it
he was really sort of UNK about things like that
that's right
he was way behind with the technology
he thought he was helping everybody and doing everything for himself but he weren't he was stopping
he was just like a UNK wasn't he
what are we doing
yeah
he was causing more problems
yeah
yeah
that's what happens
he's trying to be all things to all men isn't he
yeah
yeah
and doing it's not so much that you're doing everything wrong it's just the one thing which being done right is that the other way of putting it that the guy because he's so well organized what effect does that have on everybody else then
it UNK doesn't it
it throws everyone out
they're like chasing their tails cos they're the ones who
yeah
they're not as stressed as he is at the end of the day because
well it
throws everybody else around you
that's right
they
linda
yes linda
cos he keeps starting something and then he UNK something else comes back and then you but you end up doing nothing gets done
yes
i see
what effect did it have on his private life
he sa he missed a party and missed a sa a child's party and er what have you
he planned to go out for dinner
well he's just so organized there
he planned to go out for dinner he's even forgot about that as well
with
he
his wife
but he lives with this he doesn't really make time for anything
yes
you see it's very difficult isn't it that we probably spend a third of our life at work which makes it very important
erm by as many definitions we spend a third of our lives at work whe where you spend the other two thirds
bed
and so we've got the other two thirds this between getting to bed and spending it with the family
and if you can't organize yourself at work then it's a ten to a penny that you can't organize the other bits either
and so what happens is th the whole thing just keep it's just UNK it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse
now i'm not suggesting for one moment that anybody who has all the problems that dear mr has there but i think we might be able to learn something do you
yeah
we might be able to pack put one or two things into some sort of order
what i want to do today what i've been trying to do today is to spend that time looking at certain aspects of the way the business works the way you work
you are very important people you are running one million pound a year businesses
and also for all of us to learn something about each other
because you're spending all day together and we'll keep breaking you off into in twos into your groups so that you can learn any more about one another
and also of course you've got the sort of social thing between you
well i mean you don't have to see so this you've got this sort of social thing there
you can actually learn something else about one another by normal discussions between during the course of the conversation now
what that will enable to do i hope is tomorrow to spend our time trying to put some of these things right
if right they need to be put
if you are already working to maximum efficiency then great
all you will have done so far is spent the two days here eat sandwiches followed by said a couple of jokes and come to that
friday afternoon we could and we'll have a look at
see what colin would make of that
though i suspect that what we will find if we really are honest with ourselves that quite a lot of things which we see here are not always exaggerated from the point of the exercise that we UNK things out of all proportion so that we can actually start looking at it and seeing
we will come back to that
in fact we'll come back that a bit later this afternoon
i want to ask you to do thought you content based on that
i just wanna be absolutely sure that you haven't made some terribly dramatic changes in your lifestyle which are not justified by what we've done
after
erm no i'd like just to go through that if i can
erm and then i wanna give you one last exercise before we go
not this sort of er this sort of thing
erm and what i want you to do tonight please in your teams i want you to make a list tonight in your teams of all the things you have to do at work
okay
everything
UNK as well
right
it can be yeah we had a stop for lunch we had to have cups of tea we had to go to ou out the back and have a UNK cos we can't smoke in the office
write all the things you have to do
okay
now don't worry about it now when you come back to this right you can do that in the bar if you like that okay
bearing in mind it's a team focus course so i'm not giving you loads of work which takes you apart from one another what we do is you talk together and spend time together
and at the end of last week they had a
no actually it was
no i think that
they er
er what
they might now
well you know
actually it's a bit boring down there now but they had to put my explanation of the price of petrol er down there's nowhere to thing cos th the last time i was down there i asked for a pint of bitter and this guy bought it me and said and i wanted two pound thirty or something
and i said to him do you know what they have to do a produce a UNK of petrol
and he said no and i explained it er you know first of all you created universe and then you then you get all these very important people UNK and they put er UNK and find th this oil underground and then you drill well it's usually under the sea anyway so you produce a and this go on and on and on until the guy's now wondering what you're talking about
and then when you get the to the end of it all you sa you say and they sell that for an eighth of a price that you charge for your bloody beer
and you know and there's absolutely no justification whatsoever
and but they er you can't do it cos they're all so bored to death with it now
give a brief UNK description of where you get a pint of petrol from
well then they charge you thirty p for it
but it costs two pounds
if you find nobody wants it
yeah
eh
just the fact nobody wants to do it
but he wants it to go up one percent
that's what i thought
it's like that when i do my victor UNK bit it's er doesn't go down very well
right now look th right so let's just have a look erm at UNK jeff down there what have yo what have you decided that you your thoughts are now strengths weaknesses or whatever how are you gonna change
or can you change
er strengths
well i think the first gotta be objectives
right
erm using team resources erm and commanding respect and you do this by enthusiasm
right
erm we're very good at lot of plans practical working and carrying out in a specific way
yes
and a bit of a change and again with self discipline we're UNK but we won't look at same thing
does the self discipline actually show itself
i mean in those time things that you did those time box did it show the self discipline
yeah
i think you've got to be
i thought it did show up but i mean it wasn't part of it's a natural part of
right so that's great
better for everyone
right
right so i want having all these virtues and whatever
what d'ya call the UNK then
well there has to be the odd one that'll take over peter
yeah
in the usual way
erm UNK problems
we seem to be more concerned with the job in hand i e our own team er and not with the other teams but if they're struggling then do offer to give them help
right okay
that's very gracious of you
well i it should be erm co cooperative of ourselves
right
in order to overcome any weaknesses that we may have that don't recognize
well
that we've got
right
now based on what we've talked about so far today can you recognize any that you probably didn't think you'd got
yeah
or did you now recognize something you needn't of got but now somebody else has bought you that you better do something about it
aha
and if so what are they
erm i didn't like i say i know people who erm especially with about ourselves or anybody else
right
so there's no real sort of company worked out erm in such details like that
we're paid to do a job to get the best for everything
right
and your best to do
aha
sort of concentrating if you like on that particular effort
aha
rather than wider things
yes
and so probably what we need to think about is how you can improve your contributions to the whole thing
that's not so you how i perform but how you can improve your contributions there we might have to
yeah
er erm look at that
yeah
erm we also again i mean as you say we always look at ourselves and say we're the best team in the company
right
UNK thinking that erm but then we put that out and get information an d so that's er you know
a team game
team game yeah
and get ourselves
right
and then we enable us to go on these and get a bit of information from the
yeah
we'd like to see some signs
give us a bit more cooperative and then
yeah
the then
yeah
erm sometimes that's about it but to be honest
well of course it does
sort of wandering round with your
you'll have black eyes by then
what ab about you two
how do you know he's right
how you actually feel
well i well i say we've looked at it slightly different because we've only we've only worked together for five weeks
right
erm so what we wanted to do was we've had we're doing quite well with the ov erm the five weeks we've been together but we wanna make sure that you do combat erm a successful UNK
right
so we looked at two areas where we've erm we were both very weak erm and i don't we could even we couldn't even see it with regards this
right
erm so we've what we were looking at doing is trying to create an action plan using those two areas each time to create strengths and the other will slot together
cos really
in the middle
the actual communication is there but it's not constructive enough
yes
or perhaps not about the right things at the time or perhaps concentrating on
but is that in some ways i mean you can't be too critical about yourselves some of that is because you lack of experience within the in
ex
the company in that
ex
you sell
yeah
chances are
so i mean yo
but i think that a sort of the time we have perhaps on a could be used a lot more UNK
well i do
you know erm
right
really
i mean we've both discussed we both know we've discussed things over and we've discussed a counter that we're trying look at why all these things happen
it's really getting things done in a like a i dunno a UNK manner like an ordered man so each what to do the we discuss what we what we've got an action plan together and where it's fired at so it does work
is it based on what you well the case UNK there i think i know the other than in performance but based on that you should be able to do that
yeah
oh absolutely yeah
i think it's just having a bit of erm
experience and
just having the discipline to sit down and make sure that we e do actually work this out and then do cover all the areas
alright
so what i'm what i'm sa saying now is this that based on what we talked about so far
mhm
is that tomorrow when we start getting into planning UNK looking at where the new diaries and all that sort of stuff
there's one of the things we will do before you leave tomorrow is you will have to produce an action plan
yes that's what
right
that's what we did
and it will be specific it will be measurable will be
yeah
achievable be UNK be
yeah
yes
mm
now if that's the case once we've done that okay
and we'll then type it up for ya and you'll take it away and it will be yours
right
i'm not asking for money or taking anything from you
you could say well jackie took this and you got one leg on this table shorter than the other legs and we've UNK it under there levels the table up
now what you'll be taking is erm
it's erm
so what i'm saying is we need to be very as soon as you get the stuff that if you wanna get anything out of this course at all and what people do get out of the course is the fact that by the time they leave here we've said right that's the way we're going that's what we're gonna aim for and it is reasonable time
mhm
yeah
cos they were only the real areas lacking and the i'm quite high on the complete UNK whereby
you know by your roads
you always go down the
right
road
that's okay
alright
jus just you
fairly true
yeah
of perhaps my characteristics cos i tend to go in to work at eight o'clock just before i write any more in and i do have to clear everything before i even start the day
which you don't get any assistance
i can't just sort of well i think
nor can i
i might get the odd done
yes i make it the other
that's fine
way round i shove everything to one side of the desk and everyone's gone home and then i start working
so it's perhaps an area that i could UNK there
that side of things to actually get things completed
okay
that's super
that's true
that's brilliant
what about you two
oh right
yes
we're both er UNK and enthusiastic strong UNK er we both top score in that source investigator
right
yeah
that's what i heard pretending
that's right
that's alright
we're both yeah we're both try and demand respect we both try and help people with weakness as much as possible
both self confident
we try and mould our ideas that we both have together what we get them from other people
that's alright
i'm impressed
i do i don't i told you that th that there ain't many players in this world who are who are so sort of you know started what
yeah
they did they nick everybody else's ideas and turn them into something else so well
well like we so we can try and e with regards to the teams we're probably a little bit more high profile than a lot of the other teams
yeah
at our depot because it's just the way just the way we are up north
a and your reputation
well no er i've been there a few times
yeah
and er so but we have divided it by the weaknesses and things like that
are what
planning
right
yes that won't be a strength will it
no
no
yeah
that's what we've gotta finish tomorrow
right well everybody's we gotta finish tomorrow
i know
yeah
god almighty
er we're not we're not all so self disc or
UNK about things
right
it takes the way things go instead of just making yeah instead of just sitting down and getting on with it
well one of the problems you see i if you are perceived as one of the best you tend to be in the top three or four or so on you know the people know who you are but when you are perceived as being the you know that sort of effort you sort of find it find it pretty difficult
and it's only the people who become well i mean i was gonna say sort of gold UNK and the UNK who are good at that sort of thing because the best in the world yeah
and they don't give them to everybody what you do is th the problem is that you see all that's wrong with the depot
yeah
now they er you know it's a bit of a bloody UNK operation i mean er one of the things i try and talk to people about here
yeah
and er i get on the courses is the fact that is very good attendance sort of thing for you to see t n t express has been rather than a depot
you never see a truck here
how many times does anybody see them
they're all gone by the time you get into work and they ain't back by time you go home
do you ever see a truck
no
have you ever seen the type of thing
no
well rarely
and so that this tendency you see for us to see how well our world has been rather than the depot and in many cases they do it
mm
they
mm
now what you've got to do the one thing you really have got to do is to is to start being critical of yourselves and well look am i doing anything wrong here
but rather than have you doing something else
mm
mm
and also we need to look at strict plans as i say because we're not particularly good at that
yeah
so you'll go away
and find that out
yeah
yeah well you better go and ask stuart
yeah
and if you just think oh well
you're talking to me you're talking to the first one round
following a plan and a system many times
alright what about jane cos she's looking at us
i'm a
well er yeah but it's
but er which is worse
that's right
the one thing we are gonna do is aim to do is concentrate on
obviously not now
erm it's if is a bit awkward bu you know our well our terms because you know how calls so jenny gets to have them she gets an awful lot
alright well th that's okay
oh yeah
lynn does
yeah
yeah
what about jack the lad
mm
er there's gotta be a UNK between what you're many of the figures made there
no that's right
erm of the three of us
er on the s e h which is the erm the organizer
the short one
right
we all came out fairly high on that one
and do you think that fits
does that gel with what you see
yeah
in your company
yeah
erm
where you work
i think we fairly we're fairly organized as a team now
and as i say we've been together for a long time and the appointment the UNK of the appointments
can i stop you
yes
was the help helping you pick up body language there
they both moved back
mm
together and they both move up
one knee was right over left
and the other was left over right
yeah i noticed that
erm i stopped doing that but
she
that was peter
peter
you got about seven hours tonight i'll tell you about it
we slept through that one last time
oh very funny
who gave you a
right go on i'm sorry i shouldn't have stopped you
go on
i've slept with worse than that before pete
ooh
everything's UNK and i never hope i ever knock this i don't know whether susan wants to hear this but since we started doing
the appointment side it really
in our depot it's really working
and erm
i presume so
we've got a very
yeah
good UNK with each you know we can sort o i mean the girls can sort of say what they want to me i say what i want to them you know we take a joke
oh that's nice
we got a lot of er
we got very good UNK going which is a big thing
i don't think the other team in the depot have got such a i shouldn't speak out of school but we have
ah that's okay
got such a good UNK with the UNK sales than i've got with er jane and linda
right
which i think goes a long way
yeah
so what would what would be the weakness of the team then
er well we wrote ta erm a couple of weaknesses down here
erm the weakness of the team was erm
you're not allowed to say those
yeah we need to brush up on er
and i'll have these
making changes beyond ourselves
erm
ooh god
any
ha
well based on what
that one's
we need to brush
change that one
up on erm
yes we need to brush up on UNK our problems before they get worse and getting them back into shape using our organized organizing skills and UNK
right
and has
plus
that go on
plus erm we sort of erm we need to get together more in the night and be brief we'd be briefing
i was just gonna say what you need probably is to
we
er i is to not meet for meeting's sake
yeah
and one of the things we need to talk about tomorrow is how we put together a briefing
yeah
i think and or a de brief what the hell do we do with this thing
erm and that i would have thought would probably do it or certainly helpful as long as you actually do it sort of thing
one of the problems
yeah
with de UNK is that what people do is sit down and say what shall we talk about now
that's right
or what on the night we have a chat with that area being on that day
right
individually but we don't get together enough as a team
no
oh
just sit down
the three of us
for half an hour
the three of us
that's what it takes
that's what it takes
yeah
i agree
it's just me or jack
yeah
her or jack
yeah
well it should be the three of us more
yes
just that since we've come back after christmas we haven't never have the time before er
oh well let's well
to get together all together it's we just haven't
i'm sure ah but with respect
i'm sure you have had the time what you don't do is make the time because
yeah
yeah
you've got too many other things
that's right
to do
exactly right
mm
and it's er it is one of the problems
that goes to the bottom of
yes
the pile
that's right
one of the problems you see is that
yeah
that people tend to see a meeting as having to be really oh it's gotta be at ten to five it's gotta
you gotta say
be on a friday
yeah
or whatever it may be
and i no the only reason for having friday meetings is because it's friday
yeah
there ain't any no reason for it
we a but we are on a regular day er
just stopped them
sales
depot sales meetings so on a regular basis now erm including jeff who's the general manager
all teams will go through a meeting about six every eight weeks
we've put a lot of erm
yeah i think that's what that that's
managers wo a lot of ma the managers a lot of the customers now you know can come depot
it was said that er
you know and it's being done and everything wants starting and so on and so on
right
so er we're on now on our last
you can't
erm comes out each week brought up each week at erm depot meetings
right
there's a lot of competition at the moment in between our territory team and the other territory team
that's good
where
right
erm but that's what we've had the meetings in
really about is we've listed our major
UNK customers and then listed UNK and the two gets first one and the most revenue started that's what we're having at the moment
having a little competition in between us both you know
yeah
well the great thing that you've
and it's
got going for you now of course is you have a very or a fairly good idea of what you're strong at and what you are weak at or what you one part of the weaknesses is planning things and UNK things
that's right
erm and so what we need to think about tomorrow we're organizing this plan or whatever is how do we implement that
er and i think what you need to do what we all need to do is when we've discussed all this stuff talked about it and i'm sure you'll talk about it again tonight that what we need to do is to recognize that this has to start on monday
mm
not monday week
mhm
think that
not tuesday afternoon
i think that our problem is like that we don't sort of like get together and me and i know what i m doing with jack and linda knows what she's doing with jack but me and linda don't know what each other are doing
that's right
and i think
mm
that is i think that's clear i think that's er you're absolutely right
mhm
but it comes up and i'll say oh did i not say that
that's right
did you
aha
didn't i tell you that
aha
didn't i tell you that
and i just
and it is
UNK you know
is it going down did you say
yeah
erm
you presume that each other knows when really
that's right
you don't
oh tell me about it
yeah
right
i never worked with anybody like that but i know who you mean
come on then
oh
there are some places where we keep the best till last
thanks
serves me right for i suppose
yes
that's right
so what are now
what are we what are we now
erm they would ideally like to
right
i haven't said something by the way
oh yes
yeah
mary's quite good coming up with new ideas and new lines of thought on various subjects
right
okay
and i'm supposedly the one that will carry it through
i er
and do you think that's right
yeah
yeah i think so
and she's also good at support supporting the team
right
ah erm and her loyalty to the company so she's always saying
i think you've all got that it's just that er i don't think that
yes yeah oh yeah
okay right
ah and also a good problem UNK as well
that mary will come across with something that you use on
mm
various ideas
the weakness that we've identified is that because we're new we haven't learnt the game
we've gotta learn the game
yeah
from the
yeah
type of
area to
i wish i could live
as much
in a world where none of you learnt the bloody
then we can actually get on with it
but erm yes i think there's the there's a weakness and a strength there you see
and a one of the reasons why mary keeps coming out with good ideas is she don't know the game
mm
and one of the days she'll learn the game i mean that in the UNK sense the th the game and when she UNK the game she'll stop coming out with ideas then
mm
we'll be
a and i think we all do that
the erm but most of us are when yo when you first join something you can always see the things that you ought to be able to change
and one of the things that is happening and UNK when i first came to this company was i couldn't see a straight line through
i couldn't see who reported to who
i can't i still don't bloody know now
but i mean i
i just couldn't i just thought suddenly i thought my god you know i can change this
so
it's not so much changing t n t it was changing some influences that's UNK mary
she's doing spending as much time doing tea and she sees as she is phoning prospects
yes
i think that shows in time
yeah
that's what i think one of the other ones is whilst we
no it's alright to laugh i go round picking up
that's right
once again we
yeah i know
de brief every now and then it's not being a full de brief
i'll tell alison the accountant then and she'll tell me what she's sold and how many contracts we've booked and but it's done in front of everybody else while everybody why everybody else who's on the phone
and we don't talk about problems who's done what how what problems you're having
mm
and they haven't done anything in a in a support group in that sense
but like just for you to know that i mean at the moment got a slight shortage of staff and us little express UNK are like we're all sort of desperate to please them well and because we need to if a customer rings we're always there for them and the problem is i've got like two phones on my desk at the moment so i could guarantee the minute i put my phone down if anybody else is on the phone ha bloody UNK still ringing i have got to answer it
there is times i've UNK picked it up dropped it on the floor and forgotten to pick it up for a while because i'm on the phone and sometimes it is quite loud in my ear
but like looking at this is what did it filling
well
in this
actually sitting there and saying not realizing a few problems that
too busy to realize
i'm writing
so i've looked at it at the end of day and thought well my god
and he's looked at it and just said well look at it
don't spend
but you see the
as much on the phone
th again you see the strength of this course is that if nobody had actually given you time like you'd have never known
no
this is it
you just get on with what you're doing
we had a secretary here a fortnight ago and said how good it'd been
so UNK
it was
oh
you wouldn't know you see
no
and the strength of this particular course amazed with herself she just sort of sat about once a day chatting
but the strength of this particular is that we now know an awful lot of about one another
mm
but we get
we're getting there faster than we think
we're getting there faster than we think
good
thank you for that
right
i'm now gonna give you one last exercise then which may take rather more time than we've got
and if it doesn't probably won't we'll be kicking away from here about quarter five
if it does then okay finish it off tonight
or do it before then
i want to give you i'm going to give each of you yeah if you just wanna just clear up some of the bits of paper then that's alright
yeah
