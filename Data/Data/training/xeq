people they don't rush back they don't wanna urgently express back a carriage forward they don't work
what they want is they get on the phone and say that's no good send me another one
and we send them the replacement and they let the broken one sit there
how many times have you supposed to have taken something back or have it repaired or something and it's sat there and it's sat there and it's sat there and it's sat there and it's collected du i've got things round the house that i've been working on and that i've gotta i've gotta and it's collected dust
you know that's another project that went sort of slowly the way
erm and what i'm saying is we don't address the things that aren't urgent
yeah
we only address the urgent things
but we do leave
yeah
ourselves well we've gotta protect ourselves as carriers against other people saying ah
we broke that or that was broke er but we'll blame the carrier now and look at it then our security guy goes out and they know it's been sitting around someone's you know it's been there for months
and er we are open to abuse on them
but that doesn't mean to say that what danny said was very valuable and as you said adrian the four the four parties the receiver the thirty party receiver the people who are paying the bills buyer and us are very happy in many cases with using carriage forward in a positive way not just for returns
mm
yeah
the returns do get a bit dodgy i find
but we still do it cos we insure it we charge an extra fiver every time then it's good money
i'm stopping you through your list phil
well i mean i've got a
any more
quite a few on here
is there any ones that you want me to pin point at all or
erm le what i wanna do is just get just insure that we know the difference between what is giving the customer the benefit and the features
so we probably won't go through them all
but
no
let's just discuss our way round a couple of other things because these are this is your product knowledge now isn't it
yeah
this is what you need to know about selling the service
it's no good er talking about how you do something how you do is not what they're interested in
so UNK that's how you do it
how do you do it
the customer
it's what can please me
UNK toy
what's in it for me
the with them factor
what it is in it for me
okay
i've got liability options
what d'ya mean by that liability options
well like being UNK like people have got a choice of different options of UNK and
that's a good one
now if i said ooh
we offer good liability options
we can give you transport liability at what UNK that
aha
five thousand pounds ten thousand pounds and fifteen thousand pounds costing three six and nine pound respectively
five ten and fifteen
which is forward transit
don't be like that
what is the free
fifteen pounds a kilo
sorry five sorry i got that one
three
six and nine
six and nine
and nine
and the free one is
fifteen pound a kilo
right
okay
now what i'm saying is we because we have good liability what can that imply
you're getting a
how can you sell it's properties then
in the likely event
in the likely event
in the likely event
likely event so
well we won't us it won't graduate any
but does it have to do got this
you're committed
liability
you're committed you're committing to your service
it's like life assurance
on the fact that you can offer you your high rate of liability
cos by offering a high rate of liability it's suggests that we
concerned
that we care
and say we co we we're committed
rather than see non damaged if you like
we're limited i won't ta i don't like using the word problems without
the reason why
what about the
we can afford to offer such good liability cover is the risk is very minimal
is small yeah
the cost is very minimal
yeah
mm
that's what you're saying isn't it adrian
yeah
good
we can get excellent
try to find the words but you had a good case there
we can get excellent rates from insurance companies
that's right
because we are so good
now we actually
yeah
we are our own
i know about this
UNK we're our own which means that we are our problems are so limited that we actually carry the liability ourselves we don't even have to use an external company to get the rates on
we are so what i'm saying is we can afford to offer marvellous cover because it's because erm the risk is minimal
UNK got er the same as ours really got
who does
who does
UNK
right
where they offer extended five year UNK
now the chance of you actually needing a
yeah
five year UNK on a t v is
that's right
they generally don't go well
my friend li my friend offers a lifetime guarantee on his leather furniture
lifetime
but the way
it's a it's not
it's a ex it's an extra selling point that's what
it's like when
exactly
you sell me a
when you go to buy it you think oh i've got a life i can change it
you take out i think most people take out
life insurance
don't you
you don't expect to die but you just cover every
that's right
UNK
that's right
that's the UNK
but what
yeah
what the insurance salesman do is do UNK you a little bit so that you will take it out you know can you afford down if you were forty having a heart attack leaving a wife and young child behind
i mean they do tell you they sell on that way don't they
yeah
yeah well they do
to sell them
they sell you som something to do with it
you say that is negative
UNK
yeah
you know when somebody's at when someone's at a lowest point that's when they go straight in
anything for a sale
yeah
and you get them to make a will afterwards
it's co
you see UNK is applying psychology you know and a lot of people i mean wha the reason why insurance companies are justified is a lot of people are protected by it you know
you don't always know what's good for you do need someone to say
mm
and you're twenty one
can you explain it to me again kath
mhm
about the options there please
right
what is it that you are you don't understand
well i understand that you get fifteen it's just that i've got a lot of customer where i got business that is depending on the kind of insurance that we give them based on what our
yes i understand
competitors are offering
erm the fifty p a kilo up to fifteen thousand that i
yeah
that's pro UNK
yeah
that i understand
fifteen pound per kilo
oh sorry i co sorry fifteen pound
yeah
per kilo up to
pro UNK
up to a thousand kilos
which is yeah that i
that's
that i understand
so if it only UNK kilos you will get how much cover
thirty quid
er thirty quid
yeah
you understand that right
yeah
now
but when you got to the options now
the full liability yeah
what are you saying now fi up to five thousand pounds
per item per assignment
right
regardless of weight
what's that what right
you're buying a aren't you
you pay three pound extra
oh extra
yeah
on top of your own
on top of
oh that's right
on top of the fifteen pound per
no
kilo
no
on top of whatever
no
price the customer's paying
customer's rate
how do you achieve a rate
sorry can anyone
say if you
can
well
i just say
he doesn't pay fifteen pounds a kilo adrian he pays nothing
he pays the rate you ask him to pay
yeah
and UNK in that rate mr is fifteen
oh i see
pounds coverage for every kilo of weight
that's right
so if you have a thousand kilo UNK it's fifteen thousand pounds
but if your item UNK a half a kilo we'll round it up to the first kilo so that's any valid for fifteen pounds
right
now obviously that's worth a lot more than fifteen pounds to you isn't it
right
so what i suggest you do is pay an additional three pounds which means that is now covered for up to five thousand pounds regardless of it's weight
right
now i understand
are you happy with that adrian
yeah
now the reason
yes
why you give them different options right
thank you
on the same day they only charge nine pound and i everything's valid up insured up to fifteen thousand pounds per consignment
are you happy yo you happy with that then
in actual fact sorry to point it that's consignment contracts
right
but yo
so
i haven't you know it because when you read it doesn't always make it goes in there and i understand
right
people getting a little bit confused about that
but that just means the levels of insurance as a risk ah you know and we've just put a rate in to represent the levels of insurance because we charge you more if we insure you for more then
erm
so if i've got a customer that's sending erm quite a lot of parcels but have got a
now parcels have what is the what is the what is the erm definition of a consignment
cos this is regarding consignment
when is a
ah sorry it's
so what i'm saying is
it's solely for it's erm i yo you could have six or seven parcels all picked up in one consignment if it's picked up by that carrier
by one carrier
going to one address at one time
so that's one consignment
now if say let's
so it's one consignment
keep it
so
to a dozen
okay so you got one consignment
you've got a dozen items i want a dozen items
yeah
which is made up of one consignment
one consignment
you're only covered per consignment so the whole twelve together are only insured for fifteen
ah
thousand
aha
what he must do
is make sure that each individual box
becomes a consignment
ah
he's got to label up and pay for at a consignment rate each item
he
cos
can't
i understand
can he put that on his er consignment
or
note
can he actually put a tick o on a box you know when you fill in a consignment note
yes
d'ya know when yo d'ya know when you put one on each parcel
you write a co UNK separate consignment number
yeah
for every consignment
if the customer feels that every item he's sending out
is valuable
is er is valuable can he do i dunno a dozen individual consignment notes and then tick the particular box
yeah
that he wants
that would work out
yeah
then
that one
because he's gonna pay
yeah
he'll be paying
if that's what he wants
yeah that's it
if he needs five thousand pound coverage on each item
on each one
he's gonna he's gonna have to pay for it
he's got to send five if you've got a twelve well twelve percent
now can i put it another way adrian
i'm just trying to get an edge on my competitors
right
cos i
let me put it another way then
this is only what we publish
if you know the value of the level of insurance your client wants
right
and if he wants to send them as one consignment but now the value is twenty five thousand pounds collectively you can ring up UNK and as or get your f and a to do this for you finance and admin ring up UNK and can you give me a special rate for these goods and ar can you give me what i can charge them for special coverage to take it higher than our normal coverage of fifteen thousand pound
oh i see
now what they will wanna know is the ins and outs of everything that you're sending
how delicate it is
as most UNK company UNK most UNK or people like that
how value it is and most insurance yeah that's right through a UNK
would you have to send in a profile
do you have to send it in
yeah
i've never done it but i think you do have to send that in
and can i please recommend you speak to your finance and admin people and they will say now don't expect to be saying oh that'll be no problem because we na we ain't got a f and a like that they're always to caution you know
they're all
yeah
don't think you can do that son
you know you'll get this thing don't worry say okay
cor
now do we
we don't know
been looking everywhere
i dunno
anywhere er
who would call
my husband
er erm you couldn't could put a call through
can't
er well you could leave a message then
no
well done jenny
very good
and just all the right format
yeah
of questions there
how did it feel about ringing and asking questions that were
did it throw you a bit did it
yeah
i mean really you're saying
i could
i can't think of anywhere to go my god
i mean she's saying well what do you exactly mean by this question
i mean i wasn't the world you know
now
erm
did she hesitate for some time before the answers
yeah
mm
and what did jenny do when she UNK
UNK listened
she did but she did something else as well
she went ha
she went off
she went
mm
everything
and you say ooh come on come on
come on
have i said the wrong th
did you feel a bit uncomfortable when she UNK a bit then
mm
you we and it feels like that when you're on the phone
now all she was doing
now you can see that you can read those messages about the hands went didn't they
the shoulders went the face went long
mm
ooh
er oh
you could see her thinking about it but you couldn't have heard that on the phone
yeah you do get UNK like that sometimes don't you
and you get UNK on the phone and you're thinking this is going down like a lead balloon
no
she's UNK brain it takes her some time to come out to the phone instruct the whole thing
yeah
don't worry about it ta the pregnant pause
is to use
on a UNK thought for them to sort of
did you feel the pressure of having to ask the questions till then when they were asking you to do it to plans
very much so
yes
and you will feel like that and you sit there oh god
i've gotta do that
yeah
preparation good preparation will help that
relax jenny relaxation will help that as well
just
mm
breathing UNK and waiting
and when she said anywhere was that enough information really
do you really wanted to know where jenny had where mandy had been on holiday
no
would wo would you liked to have known more
i would have
mm
mm
yeah
yeah
how could you prompt her to expand on that
er
could you give me a few examples
well done paul
that's oh yeah how did i repeat the question an and emphasize on the word
mm
could you give me an example
now if you say it in an ex in a in a do you want to give me a few examples
you're a bit yeah
all she'll say no i
no
can't
if you say ah
neil says you've been everywhere what are the type of things that you know you can use tone and voice cos they can't see you
it's all in the voice what you put into voice
bill had the opportunity to sit face to face with them and you catch his eye you used to er time to er use hand gestures and show things to them on UNK
you haven't on the phone
can you give me a few examples
could you expand on that a little
we what was your question phil
yours was a good one
aha
where have you been
yeah
th the fall on the UNK the broken record that sort when you repeatedly question
ah
where have you been
oh i've been to or you UNK it in another way
well done
very good
and don't lose just because she said i wanted to know they didn't answer me
stick with it
even if it means a few phone calls
what exactly do you mean by that
sorry i've never worked in your industry why is that
yeah
and follow it up with a new question
so the experiences although it's got nothing to do with your product is what is gonna actually happen to you on the telephone out there
yeah
mandy would you like ask jenny a question
yeah
erm how long have you been driving
two and a half years
so when did you learn to drive then
when i was seventeen
and what were your ideal car
er a rover
so i give you the choice of a UNK or a rover what would you rather have
a rover i think then
ah
so if i let you drive my rover home would you
definitely
yeah
and if i let you drive my rover home would you
she said yes to the actual question
that was more than a closed question it was closed
oh right
would you
you said would you drive my rover that's the question
when you said we'll talk about that question last
and the others will have to wait till they come up again
ah
right
well done
see that excellent
right
how did it feel jenny asking a load of questions
straight out weren't they
yeah when she was saying asking them
and the that's right
now the other thing is phil because he's got a new experience with it UNK to find a question
right he knew what she was talking about she'd got it written down and she was gonna get that information
but sometimes it can sound too i know this didn't happen
yeah comes a bit too
it's just
i mean i'm not suggesting you behave like that on the phone
but what i'm saying is awareness now i'm just UNK off the awareness
when it sounds UNK it sounds like that
and it doesn't sound quite as clear as if you have to think about who you're talking to
so the fact that you UNK phil
mm
to find the next question the customer knows you're thinking
ah that's interesting
try and get that now buy yourself a bit of time
mm
think about that
let me let me think about that
do you mind if i come back to you on that one
and if you can't stand the heat get out quick and come back to it
but it eventually it will sta you'll think afterwards oh god
i didn't know the next thing
analyse what you did
sure
then think about it and there's always another call
yeah
no problem at all
okay
now that was very well done
no problem at all there
paul would you like to ask carly a question
i didn't understand it
i've done three questions of each
oh god paul
do you understand it now
no i no i understand what you're saying it's just that i thought you said three questions of each
i done three open three limited and three yes and no questions
would you would you wanna erm d'ya wanna
no i've crossed them all out now
okay
go on
well away you go then
sorry well i've
the UNK
got that one
my must be my mistake
well i thought you would have got it in black and white
i got a big
no go on
in the mornings
go on paul
carry on
carry on
hello carly
hello paul
how long were you seeing your boyfriend then before you married him
er about six years
about six years
whose idea was it to get married
both of us really
yeah
right
how old were you er when you got married
twenty one
do you live at home with your par er your parent's home or erm do you live in your home
well currently with my parents because we moved down
are your parents ha
or moved up i should say sorry
erm are your parents happy with your choice of husband
initially no
well i was afraid of the answer then
well done
that was a very
good question paul
yes obviously
excellent
keep you on
excellent questioning paul there
well i did have some more but i thought no i
ah thank god for that
how did you feel about answering those questions
fine
no problem
no
again speed
but i think erm
sorry go on
sorry
no
answering back i thought he could have given me a bit more time cos i wanted to say something else and he was
ah
that's interesting
yes
you could have got more information paul
but i didn't
ah i know
but i didn't
but just
want any more
i thought it was it was it was en
no can i just can i say
UNK on her private business
the er yes i know
i know
i don't care
it's only an exercise and you
yeah
and you have e your own agendas there obviously
what i'm saying is sometimes slowing the pace and simply
yeah
let her think a little longer because and then she'll say oh
and then she's just think of that
with UNK we got a bit more
and phil was thinking i wonder whether this is about and i'm trying to think of the next question
no
which is the question of what you feel when you're in the field out there trying to work something through
which calls
actually you've hit the nail on the head there didn't you
mm
when you said phil thought he wasn't i'm not listening
no
because that's what it's all about
yes
and when you're listening you're watching for body language as well
mm
and so if you have not been concentrating on the question
yeah
you will probably have recognized the body that says i'm prepared to give you more
now to be fair that comes with experience
of course
listening as you become more comfortable and you become you've done it a few times you know what you're gonna have to say and then you er you listen more carefully to the answers
but the listening is the key
paul had it well prepared and really she sa but sh all his answers met with a logical sequence didn't it
mm
very well done and he spent a lot of time working on that did you notice
i'm not saying that's okay you got a bit UNK by the instructions but don't worry but he still gave you could see that you know he was you know he was just
yeah
you know he was caught in a
he was concentrating
train of thought
he was erm he was trying
thanks
very hard and e good preparation does take effort
i mean i know we're only playing here but it does take effort and UNK effort becomes easier it doesn't become hard work
it's like playing a good game of squash to get a better game and it's not so hard because you're off to you you're fit for the game
and that's what you'll do you'll become fit
you'll be a better player
as you say when you're on the phone you get those UNK you just of go mm
well done jenny
and like
well erm what's ha what would you call those
right
okay
they know you're listening
listening noises
that's very good
that's very good
right
all
can i do just make one announcement
yes
please do
just to illustrate how important this thing is you've probably all come across and it really UNK me you see people interviewing people on television and they've got their UNK there and they've obviously got a prepared question so they can't UNK and fine that means they've prepared it
and they ask a question and somebody's very open with the answer and they da they just sa expand on that answer and then two or
aha
three questions later they ask them the very question they just answered
e expect
and that really UNK me
and that's purely and simply because they're just not listening
oh
the easiest thing in the world to take off that question
yeah
so that it's
so think about that because
yeah
and you'll lo
you don't want to get the backs up of your customers by asking them questions
that is right
and you'll losing the point of why
absolutely
you're asking the question
see
aha
you're not you're not paid to ask questions you're paid to get in information
UNK
yeah
that's the point
so that fact that you can't think of a next question phil
mhm
don't worry you've got some information
we can all ask questions later okay
what you really want then is a way to sort of UNK or UNK because you're a bit stuck of where you want to go
mm
that's interesting
let me write that down
ah
you're giving yourself some new you know
i think one of the things phil can do in that si
don't worry about it
or anybody could do in that situation is having asked a question they're a bit UNK about er the next question then simply throw in there to buy yourself some time something like ee is that all
or is any more that you can add to that
just to give yourself a bit of time
mm
or repeat the question
for the next question
it will help
yeah
you
like we've just suggested
oh have you
or what was your way of doing it before you said
when you wanted to know where mandy went
can you give us tell us about that paul
well i kept asking her it made hard work yeah
yeah
what did you do to her
you've not been listening have you paul
you know whe when we asked
he's still
well i thought she didn't know that
no he's still sitting back on his reflected glory now
and rightly so as well
well done
carly would you like to demonstrate yours
kath
now
er
could i say something
yeah
i just think i just think it's quite important for us all to realize i did a when i used to do a similar job to this it took me a long time before i realized that the customer you know on the phone doesn't know that your you shouldn't have asked an open question there
oh
on the close and it comes it just comes with practise get all
right
from practise doesn't it
which is exactly it
what i'm saying is you can it doesn't matter how you ask the question but sometimes
what i'm trying to help you practise cos we're not we're very good at asking closed questions in conversations but don't very often recognize but you know we we'll UNK backwards and forwards and that's okay but i want you to do consciously is know what type of questions you're asking because you can sometimes be hitting a brick wall and thinking i'm getting anywhere here and it's because you're asking too many closed questions
mm
and you're making it sound like an UNK
erm especially when you're in front of a screen er or you're in front of a form that you're someone's saying get the traffic profile out and th what they send what they how many they send it can sound like an UNK
get the buyer get the product get the carrier get and so on like that
you've got to be careful that you are not losing the skill of a conversation
mm
open question what th UNK advantage of open question is you do a less of it and they
more of it
more of it
and that's why it on a foundation course we keep the questioning very simple
UNK experiences has UNK it taken it further than that which is brilliant and he can apply those skills straight away
and if you've got those skills apply to them job i'm not suggesting you don't but remember the first part of a UNK er a telephone or a face to face sales negotiation is th two of these and one of these
right
you should you be UNK the questions and letting the discussion take place
UNK the questions controlling it but UNK it and letting it go
right
and you're gaining information
when you've gathered information a and come to a conclusion erm interesting we may have something for you there
and that's when you get your UNK out and start matching to what the customer wants
now you've gone through an alternative yesterday and we know we ta we don't talk what is built in by design what do we talk about
we tell them what's built in by design and then we
tell them the advantages
of what they get out of it
and we keep it simple
one feature maybe one or two benefits and you don't have to tell them the whole story
mm
as you said bill pull out the benefits and features that are appropriate to what you've heard
er there may be something you're interested in there
now there are UNK ways of actual sales negotiations but we haven't got the time to go into it today
you'll have to come back on your UNK your course to do this
okay
or you ca if you can do it on your own brilliant
run with it now
but what i want you to do is gather information this is your answers and match what you're doing er what we sa provide with what you found out then
okay
and you'll find out what method by just simply questioning them about the
let me just check before we start that everybody's got this
i'm sure danny jenny and carly have but just because we've gone half way can i just let the other three finish off their presentation
cos they've sat and done the preparation
carly
okay
hello paul
erm i know you're allergic to food and drink so you keep on telling me what sort of food are you allergic to
just about everything under the sun
what sort
dairy products erm dairy products oranges various fruits
remember the listening noises
right
mm
yes
er can't think of anything else specific at the moment
but it's just about i've got a list at home it's about this long though
right
okay
erm do you actually
what type of question is that when you do actually him
what type of question
a minute
yeah
and then give him a choice like can you
a choice
what were you going to ask carly
do you actually
i was gonna ask him do you actually eat the products still to a limit
right
okay
it's a closed question there
right that's right
how can you change ask ge get to that but say it as an open question
if there are limits
no
that's a closed
question
what do they begin with
sorry they're the words which you were
which UNK which food do you eat
yeah
they're the words true
there is nothing to give me
there was no last night
these are open questions
you said do you actually eat the products that made you allergic paul
right
what you're saying how can ask any of those any of those sort of questions
this is a very useful one
just by
how can you ask but using that word at the beginning of it
i am allergic to almost an anything
and you wanted to know do you eat almost anything don't you
yeah
do you still suffer
so what word do you make it into an open question
can you have them
how
just
how
how much of this food do you eat
how much of these
yeah
do you
mm
which food
does anybody have any other suggestions
mandy you were saying
which foods do you eat
which food
i was gonna say which food do you
which foods yeah
normally
but that's still sort of limiting a bit though isn't it
yeah
what i want what food
types
what is it
what's er erm what off this list do you feel
it'll come to
yeah
you
alright
we're gonna ask another question then though aren't we
right
right well can you ask your third open question
okay
third open question
what was it
i can't
what food
what food
off this list what do you actually eat
no she's already asked him what they
what do you actually eat
yeah
please
yeah
erm what food
that would be useful yeah
yeah
what foods do i eat
erm i get everything i'm allergic to at the moment

lots of UNK i know it's not re i know we haven't talked about selling t n t and i'll your questions aren't really about this time i'll do that in a minute
what questions can we ask about t n t to t n t potential customers
we asked about music we asked about food we asked about holidays we asked family we asked about what was UNK questions to you jane
what was your
driving
question
driving
driving
we asked about what was your question to
music
music
er clothes to danny
what questions do you want to know from customers about what d'ya wanna know about them
their business
about their business
what about their business UNK
what is the question that you want answered
do they send goods out
do they want a carrier
do you use a carrier
right
how regular
can we assume that something moves out of most buildings
yep
yeah
yeah we can
what sort of things move out of any business premises
papers
letters
or letters
documents
that's right
something's likely to move
so yo rather do they send goods out
can we assume that one anyway ju maybe not goods
well i su
but there's something moves that needs a delivery
mm
somewhere
would you would wo i mean just the way what made you feel that it wouldn't be the case
but would you mean
well er well i've and added two hundred UNK
mhm
in like two days and
yeah
that's the fir and you ring up UNK and
mm
UNK and all sorts
mm
so you had to ask them
mm
a couple
some people just have some people will never have a need for a carrying service
yeah
no there is some
are you sort of
okay you were talking about you you're talking about your target customers were sort of like UNK and UNK and stuff like that
yeah but you know the UNK that we did i mean
right
that
they were just registered businesses
we were told to ask
right
you know
okay
do you ever have a need for a carrier
yeah
at all
you know before you start giving them all the UNK
what type of question is that though
do you ever have a need
closed
for a carrier
it's closed
yeah
cold
it's still a
you have to open
how can you ask to that
yeah you could say that
well there's they need to know a little bit about you
so you said you know good morning my name's kath
i'm a the business UNK i'm i represent th er t n t super mail i er am responsible for business development here
you've recently received er erm a some information from our company am i right
yes
yes
or i know you've recently received some information that's good
i can see that you are a UNK now what question do you wanna ask
would you ever need
how often do you have a use for a parcel carrier
how often would you ever send or something into your company or have something sent out especially by perhaps a customer request
so you need to know how often right
assume something goes
i guarantee UNK go
it might be once in
yeah
bloody blue moon and you may not be worth putting on your and calling every six weeks mandy but it might be worth asking it in a more open way
because UNK say if you ask it open you'll find summat out you never assumed
mm
yo you know
you never thought
well actually yes we're the head office
for a regional group here and as well as have a er an actual service for UNK we also have a distribution er control shop at the back
and we have our own delivery service to our cu to our own network
now what's the question you can ask this UNK that got his own bus i know i'm using a an extreme
mm
point they've got their own delivery service
what else would you like to ask
is there any place you can ever not go to
what areas does it do they tend to serve
what happens if give me an scenario a UNK tale like the insurance man does to his customers
you sell
god UNK
god UNK
god UNK that you should ever lose parcel and mrs on newcastle hasn't got a wig base any more
your UNK going to be in UNK isn't it
what do you do in that situation
what are you gonna do
do you know the one thing in that
god UNK
he said and i wrote it down here which i think is wonderful probe th the past problems and future worries
what would happen if
yeah
in the future
what has happened when
mm
is past
yeah
that's a very good question
that's how they do sell insurance cos e everybody knows who they've use had a UNK and not insured
because if you say have you what type of UNK this
have you ever had any problems
it's a closed one
na no
and what they gonna say
no
how difficult was it mandy to think when jenny was asking you about your holiday
it was quite difficult
why
mm
and you gave UNK what's the word
UNK
UNK
UNK
UNK
can't get my teeth right
UNK one word answers didn't she
long words like
what i'm saying is if customers
feel like that and if you ask if they must say yes no because it to engage hang on th the phone rings ring ya yes
yeah
erm yes right er yes
you know and they're in this sort of
mm
mo very
yeah
UNK ma frame of mind you got to demand and wait for the answer even though it might take a minute for the to say erm oh we use erm you know we've got a local van that comes and se like you know
what happens if well oh sa UNK i don't know i mean she has to wait for a week
you know
you know
or we rush one over to her specially make a special journey
right now where d'ya what do you wanna go what question do you wanna ask her next
someone other than UNK now
how do you achieve that
how do you achieve that
good question
what sort of question is that bill open or closed
open
open
wo
that is open question
how do you achieve that
now sometimes what salesmen do is suggest the answer do you do this
do you do that
do you do that
do you do that
shut up
don't keep on
how do you do that
quite difficult eh er well usually somebody goes in their car you know
she'll send her or i'll le i'll let someone go someone from the shop go
now what do you wanna ask
you think of the problems
could this possibly leave you short handed
no that's a closed question
closed
right a good question
a very good question
could it leave you short handed
change it to an open question
how do you manage when this person's out delivering the goods
hang on UNK
same question paul
yeah
but what it means is what's the difference
well you've gotta
that's right
or you shut up
and i start talking you'll find out more
how do you manage
really
god UNK
how do you manage
touch wood
oh
you don't say
honestly
you've got that you blow the problem up a bit
hang on in there now you've found it
mm
that's where you wanna be
i don't care whether you can't work a rate out i don't care whether you know nothing about t n t you've found a need
do you want some help

and they say
well yes
what are you offering

yeah
that's when you get your question
you're in there

i dunno if she's coming back
that's a closed question
ah
mind you well that is
shut the door
go and get yourself a cold drink and come back and
the only ones i'll let go are carly and bill they've gotta catch a plane er train and UNK got to come back before he heads back to the hotel
but while you're here leave it covered like this and it's a bit
this particular study for so he could listen to it
erm he had said that if nothing else he discovered how lively the children were at my school
i recorded it in a closed classroom during the lunch time UNK
and you can still hear the children's voices UNK through the double glazing
so anyway i hope it wasn't too UNK for him and that he was able to pick out erm the information that he wanted
so
thank you very much for leading us tonight and all here will be interested to hear what you have to say
thank you
will i hope i'm not going to lead you UNK
no
er one of the things that i do wish hand book writers would er do is to erm write whenever practical to seek out the strength of the group at the beginning so that for example how mu if there are those of us who've been magistrates or been before the court or involved in legal processes
it's to know that in advance because i think they then have a practical contribution to make
anyway before i say any more about that
i looked up the subject justice in the new dictionary and it said to treat UNK or to treat fairly and then it went on to talk about legal justice
but the subject of justice itself UNK on mainly the legal aspect which these notes deal with is i think one of the most UNK subjects have affect all our lives
so this little tape this little recording er highlights in justice which probably is even a more fascinating subject as justice
well the two in a way are UNK
right away we go
all being well that's if er th that's if er the UNK on
beautifully written
you heard it alright down that end
yes be okay
is that in the way
mind you don't fa no
mind you don't fall over
can i push it under the chair somewhere
i should yes
because you might
that out of the way
might fall over the wire
it occurred to me that so many of the people who influence our lives are people who have been UNK treated
i hope this is not a UNK comment but i think it's very UNK whether the christian faith would be known as it is today down two thousand years had it not been for an innocent man jesus being UNK punished and crucified and so many of the great UNK in the history of man men and women have died or suffered grave UNK because of injustice and in a UNK way injustice in a way yo you almost seem as if we need injustice to drive us on to get things done in a in a better way
so that i think had the subject been injustice it would have just been just as er exciting as justice fact or fiction
i hope therefore we will keep in our minds the meaning that justice means to treat UNK or to treat fairly and remember that it's a double ed sided coin
the notes that have been prepared for us go over er rather briefly the legal systems in our land and er even references made to france which has a slightly different legal system which may be a bit better than ours and so that in the notes we not only look at the high court the high court the criminal court the county court er and realise what an important part of legal proceedings er these courts fair as well of course as the largest courts of all the UNK court
now when asked if i would introduce this subject she said i think i'd better mention this for the sake of the truth
of everything er she said as you raised you been appeared in the paper obviously in dealing with something it seemed to you UNK our folks thought you ought to introduce this subject
so i thought i'd better clear that little matter up for starters because you would be very interested
for twelve months i've been trying to er when i realised that was put on my cleaning bill it seemed to be so unfair that the little UNK and the lady who up till now has cleaned for me because the home help service no longer just does cleaning
and i er and i UNK to be incapable and i and said i would like someone to go and help me do shopping home health service would have come along
yeah
because i was straightforward and said all i want is someone to come and see my place is kept clean and they said we can't do that UNK
they're not trying
and we will give you a er two addresses and so they gave me two addresses and to reach people at i've done the job quite well
broken down since the paper article hadn't had a sole come since that newspaper article
disappeared
and now and now
well i reckon so i i've arranged for someone else to do it now
er but the point i wanted to make was that after trying for twelve months first of all er i wrote to my local m p
i went through the proper process and the local mp er mp for labour didn't know much about it and he referred it to the UNK general i think it is who took three months to answer
mm
when eventually he was blaming the european union not european community now boys and girls that's right isn't it it's european union now isn't it
yeah listen i
yeah another european community
anyway he said that they had imposed this and the government couldn't do anything about it
it was the directive the word he used
on checking further with the european union i don't take anything for granted not even what mps say er it turned out that it wasn't a directive and that the government had freedom of choice whether it UNK it or not
so then of course i went to the euro m p
that's how i found out about it
then last november i went to see her she was out and i see her press officer
i gave her all the papers and erm she said well and that meanwhile had spoken to me on the phone and said she would do what she could
that the local mp and the and the couldn't do anything more about it
and er the UNK of all that was i got a phone call what three weeks ago from one of the papers saying we'd like to come and take your picture mr cos we're doing this article about on er on care services so i said okay so he came and took a picture
that's all i knew about it
you've all seen or most of you have seen the article i was never interviewed by the press whatsoever
oh typical
yeah typical
yeah
which and i was quoted as well they may i mean whether the press officer er press officer er quoted me and he altered my conversation with her i don't know
but the important thing was the impression that everyone er had who read the paper was that i had been interviewed by the press
mm
in fact it was only naming one lady on the paper
mm
i just mention that because that i thought you ought to know the truth of that you know and things aren't what they appear in the paper
no
can't believe anything can you
no UNK done really although i wouldn't have said what was UNK to me i wasn't UNK about the money
i never UNK about hardship
i was arguing about the principle that er i mean the lady who came to clean for me was a nursing UNK and if i'd had UNK she would have UNK me and done sort of thing as well
so that little old ladies who are decide or old gentlemen for that matter want to try and live in the community and then they stick that on their bill
it's the only and it's only because and this is i mean having to understand why government surely the majority of supporters of the present government wouldn't approve of this
the only exception in my case is that i've used a firm that does more than thirty five thousand pounds worth of work a year
mm
yeah
mm
and that the answers i got from government was use a voluntary body they don't have to pay that
er use the county council i said they weren't prepared to do it
but they would do cleaning just cleaning the county council will though it hasn't got the people to do it
but of course they've priced they've done this by charging eight pounds an hour
yeah
yeah
oh
for someone to come and clean and then you would have to pay v a t on it
you see cos they don't say that and anyone else who doesn't who does less than thirty five thousand pounds worth of if mrs down the street said i couldn't do forty pound then they don't have to pay that
but that was not the issue
and t and th then since the paper talk that's right it's nothing to do with it but it may have a bit to do with justice we'll get round to it in a bit
t since the paper article i wrote direct to the chancellor as he's living down the street personal letter to him
he didn't answer it personally eventually about three weeks afterwards i got the letter from customs and excise who deal with this saying in a rather remarkable last paragraph we have to charge v a t right across the board
in other words if any of you were wealthy enough to employ a lady or a gentleman t do the cleaning
to do the cleaning
then they have to charge v a t
but i always thought UNK was next to UNK
mm
i mean i didn't think he had to have v a t on i mean if it's a UNK you know and they employ la they employ people to clean
i was surprised that is put on cleaning
but because it's got to be right across the board and they won't make exception of people like myself and others who are living in the community that need home help
mm
so that's the whole story i thought you ought to know
yeah
this has been happening to me just the same
pardon
it's happened to me just the same
yes so er
what paper was you in
oh i don't know
mercury
mercury or post look
i saw it in the herald and post
mercury was yes i it's one in the mercury and the other one was the one with the picture
yeah herald and post cos i saw it
now then back to subject
sorry about that
are they any here who have been magistrates
UNK if you have cos i can't see your hand
anybody
no
no
how many of you have been to county court
no
no
no
what an innocent lot
we are good
we are
how many of UNK ve been before a judge
no
no
no
been to courts on purpose is the cases
at one time i used to quite often go to the castle
yes
and they were very interesting actually
i found it very interesting
yes
but never er from the wrong side of the bench you know never as a criminal
well now th this is where comes into his own you see
yeah
you would be
once was tried in a way but a judge er UNK to it and it was at leicester castle
had things gone wrong with me i may ultimately have been sent to prison
i was g i was going to get to read the newspaper report in the mercury and the mail and when i appeared at leicester castle before a judge but er i think and i was going to give you a clue
but perhaps we'll forget about that now
i can hold my peace
it was it was fifty four ago there's your clue
anyway so i appeared before a judge the only time when i've really been he was judging me
yeah
another time i more recently i appeared before a judge at norwich as a wi as a witness for people who have been UNK treated
i only appear in court when other people have been UNK treated
er i've been before when it was the UNK at newark
then i didn't anticipate i was UNK out of the back of the court i'd gone there to see some proceedings with people i was involved with and all of a sudden the barrister for the defendant said is a mr in court
so i got UNK out
mm
to go into the witness box and that was interesting really because that was a recorder then now it's no longer that's finished with now isn't it
we don't have the UNK
th the crown UNK taken the place of the UNK i think and then
it was a shame because it was very interesting
yes you have a judge now at the of the crown court i think
any anyway i appeared there this was interesting because being a friend i didn't swear on the bible it's something that's not brought up in these notes you don't think it's quite an important thing really so the clerk of the court with his bible would you know repeat this
so i said i'm sorry no i'm is it the law officer UNK of the moment i mean i didn't know i was gonna finish up there
i said i'm sorry i'm a UNK i will not we don't believe in double standards
mm
and erm the clerk was in a flat spin because he hadn't got a card which said i UNK that what i say is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and the recorder himself was about
who got a paper for me to read out then
so that was the time i've been before a recorder
er the UNK court i've been to twice
the last time in norwich about six years ago and then there were five magistrates out and the UNK went on for between two and three days
the norwich city council wanted to get a licence to be able to sell UNK at a new pop centre they were going to open mainly for young people and was a member of the labour party incidentally and a county councillor one of the city wards had the cheek to go and oppose the whole of norwich city council
i was nearly chucked out for that i left before they could chuck me out actually
er and i got up and i protested about it on the grounds that if they couldn't run a great big pop hall for and i wholly agreed with the idea of them providing the facility
could have said if the finances of that depends on selling alcohol then i think it's time norwich city council made a stand and say we're only going to sell non UNK drinks
mm
firm there incidentally er that's surprised me going to a mar court a court like that purely when it was a application for a er drink licence and still have to er
erm the other time was and this isn't a point either made in the notes erm when i was at wells next the sea
i had been the first chairman of wells next the sea town council but two or three years afterwards we decided to turn er the old cinema they wanted to turn the old cinema into a dance hall
i was an ordinary member of the council for that i had done me two years UNK and here again i was naughty really considered naughty
but next to the dance hall if we'd given them the licence to ha turn the cinema into a dance hall there was this little old boy who lived just the other side of the road in an old cottage and he was over eighty
i knew he i didn't know him i didn't know him but i do go and see him when i saw this case was covered up and it seems to be utterly unreasonable that this poor old chap was going to have doors UNK and UNK and then people coming out the dance about midnight and his whole life being UNK so i turned on there unknown to my own council oh they were cross with me
and i went to the magistrates and acted and gave witness on behalf of this old gentleman
the town council were so stupid there we they're the magistrate threw it out said no you can't have a licence because it'd be too big a public nuisance they decided to appeal
so then appears at norwich crown court now the case before us was a criminal case so that the crown court can deal with civic cases as well as criminal cases cos our UNK the next one was ours
and i forget the name it's the UNK was still judge there cos i saw his name recently
but when i went up to er was called as a witness i this was i amazed me the jury judge said i wish to UNK he wanted to know why
well i reckon that's a bit of a cheek really if you prefer to UNK and swear on the bible i don't see why they should challenge why you want to do one or the other
mm
so i said i'm a UNK
oh that's alright then mr
so i think we erm anyway the wells council lost it's case and was really in the bad books over that
but er so i've appeared in these places purely because i'm injustice you know UNK me up
and it's no good UNK so has to go and do something about it
mm
mm
and get into trouble
er but i hope for the for the for the right cause
so that's why i've been rather er you know had quite a bit of ex experience in the court
which is another point really that people i find even if they appeal for witnesses about something that's gone wrong people are very UNK the majority of people in the community are frightened of being witnesses
mm
and unless we are prepared to you know to do this er we can't complain if there is injustice it seems to me
now today i'm going to break away from the notes a little bit cos i think there's so many things you could bring we could bring in and i think some of the points made in the notes will naturally come out in our discussion
er today and every day almost a question of the police at the moment there is this business going on er in london at stoke UNK over the fact that the charges against the police for UNK being involved with all sorts of things that they shouldn't er and we are living through a time where the police is having to fight a battle for it's own respect
the police were originally formed from the community to represent the community er and to protect the community
that that's how it started that's why they weren't part of the force is police were part of a co community and therefore to have respect for the police seems to me quite vital if we are to have a real sense of justice and fairness
i wonder what your views are or wh what can be done or whether anything can be done er to rebuild the respect for the police
well that would begin i think er in the home
teaching young children the right from wrong and why the police are there and accepting them as friends like we did when i lived in the village
the policeman knew everybody and he was a very nice man very firm and he would deal with minor youth troubles you know when we got the UNK of trouble every now and then
give you clip on ear
he knew where they were and he used to jolly well
that's right
er give them a good UNK and also
yeah
see the fathers and mothers and tell them you see we we've had enough of this lot were not having any more
we never had any serious trouble at all
cos it was UNK in the UNK
the local policeman took it in hand and nobody UNK if he gave them a good UNK
no well how many of us know our local policeman
we did he used to come into our
yes but how many of us now know our lo local policeman
yes
yeah
yes how many of us now yes
most days
have you got the local police
we don't know
yes
i've never seen one
we don't know
nobody ever tells us
no i sometimes see them go right down our street in twos
there is one isn't there
nearly always looking at the cars
there's a police car comes up here at twelve o'clock every night
it tu it comes up very quietly
it turns at the top and goes straight
well that's much use from the point of view of getting to know him is it
no
no
erm there's a local policeman er in the area around our church he's come to speak finish in a little while
but er talk about his work
but it's i think it's the exception
erm
you never see a policeman at all
if you were if you
and they all say what a very nice man he is too
you know i wonder what would happen if you went along to the norfolk street police station and said will you please give us the name of our local policeman
i wonder if they would tell you of give you any
i'm sure they would yes i'm sure
you think they would
i mean we have er com what they call the community constable
yeah
mm
erm and he's name's keith something
mm
er and if ever an incident happens in our part of leicester and there's a police statement about it it's usually quoting him
you know he's been involved dealing with the case and he's told the press something about what's going on
mm
wh
er i mean we have met him once or twice but that's as much as i can say and it's been er su such a span of time that i don't even know now whether i would recognise him walking along the street
even though i have met him a couple of times
what would happen if we were to invite a policeman to come and address this group
i think he'd come
i think he'd be pleased to do it
yes
yes they would
well that's a practical thing they can do isn't it
mm
mm
well we did a few years ago
mm
didn't he
did you mm
er they
they cut down at norfolk street
you know i mean it's not UNK nearly as often as it used to be
no they've cut us down and different hours
no there's the one
where we used to live but i mean
on the police there and i mean that's the problem
they've cut down
mm
instead of having more we've got less
yeah that's right
i think we've been talking about two different interpretations of the word respect
in much the same way as people talk about being god UNK
when you talk about UNK god you're not really talking about being frightened of him you're talking about paying attention and doing what he wants you to do
and in the same way interpretation of the word respect was that you paid attention to the local bobby
mm
because you knew he meant business and he would achieve his end
and living in the area with him
yes but there's
us
there's another meaning to the word respect which is what is shown up by the stoke UNK incident and other similar incidents in that you can only respect somebody if they actually live up to the standards that they actually hold out to the rest of you
and i mean it there is nothing worse for someone who is supposed to be UNK the law to be found not themselves
letting it down
i agree with that
and i mean that i think that's the sort of respect which is UNK away very quickly
mm
you know with every incident that gets UNK it UNK their position even more
yes that's the other side of the coin isn't it i mean we should teach our young people to respect the police at the same time the police should be ready to earn their respect
yes
quite
i think most of them are but it's
it's up it's up to them to clean their act up
it's the minority that
yeah
get in papers and we read all about i mean it
it's the same in every situation isn't it that the few
it is
it is
can spoil it for the many
oh yes
i think we might remind ourselves that justice begins in court not on the street
no i think if
we are not talking about the police we are talking about justice for all
if the police start trying to administer justice in the way of trying by planting drugs on innocent people for example
oh yeah
while they well we can say that the police are being UNK but the police have nothing to do with justice
the police are only concerned with catching the offender and delivering him or her to the law so that justice can be done
that's not strictly true because in our country the police are also involved in gathering evidence which is largely put to the service of the prosecution rather than the defence
so they an UNK position in this country that they are not only catching the suspect but they're also UNK against the suspect even before he's gone on trial
that's right
this i think was the point that was trying to point out about the scottish system and the french system that they have this independent investigating magistrates structure so that erm the police don't so much become involved in one side of the case
but whatever the police discover erm is made available to both sides more readily
yeah
and hopefully justice is done
and if we're gonna start talking about paying the police by results that's going to encourage them isn't it to er to press for conviction
well this is this is point isn't it
yes
that they're really they're to arrest first and foremost they're to arrest the suspect and bring that person before the er judging magistrate or the judge whatever the case may be and the and has made out that it is a disadvantage therefore if they are also expected to bring evidence as for the prosecution
that's right
mm
cos you get the situation now where they choose not to charge a person because it isn't worth it
because they know that by the time he gets to court he'll be thrown out and all the time will be wasted
mm
you know
so
is it the magistrate who issues the search warrant er and the police go in and search the house for drugs or anything
mm
is it the magistrate or
it used to be
yeah
i'm not sure wh g who grants the warrant do you
no
no
used to be the magistrate at one time yes
but i mean people see the police go in breaking somebody's door and going in
naturally they probably think the police are up to no good
they probably don't realise wh they've got er a warrant from the magistrate to go and do that
mm
or UNK someone
the police have to do that
can i jump from this they're all UNK over to question of magistrates one of the questions in the notes really it points out that there are about not quite but er about two third of magistrates are men and about a third women erm is there is that because of history and shall because they're are more women than men i mean UNK because there are more women than men in the community there should be more women magistrates than men shouldn't there on the on the basis of presentation i take it that i don't know the figures but i take it that er more and more women now are er being accepting the called of course to be magistrate you didn't have any choice once do you in a way
no
you can't volunteer you have to be you have to be chosen
to be chosen women
mm
quite a lot of women on the prosecution side
well look
representatives i've known three magistrates in my life
one was a business man the other was er trade union official and the other was a housewife which seemed to me to be badly representative
yes
of if you take that as a as a reasonable example
the variety doesn't make the point that it is the chancellor er who er the lord chancellor i should say who UNK magistrates but it isn't that make the point which i think is very important is how do the names get to the lord chancellor's office
yes i was i was going to ask that try and explain that
well it's bound to be some body but i mean what we movement could erm
that's right
UNK the lord chancellor that we think so and so
that's right
would be a jolly good magistrate
but would
you find often it's the erm political party i mean i know two and who were both erm names put forward by the labour party
yes
in UNK and in UNK you know
mm
that's a point i was going to make but as far as i can tell in en UNK the main the main nominated bodies have been of political parties
yes
they often have a very small percentage of the population anyway and er i'm glad we've brought this matter up because i think that is something which needs further investigation that the ordinary public and the many little or the millions of voluntary organisations ought to be encouraged to have a more output in forwarding names
yes quite i agree
we ought to be forwarding names
if there was anybody young enough for
i agree
i don't know what record the adult schools have of UNK
i don't i doubt whether we've ever nominated anybody
on leicestershire
nationally
i would think so
i would be very surprised if
it UNK surely of whether these many old boy networks that we're famous for in this country
mm
i mean if you don't tell anybody that their that they can submit names they're not going to submit names because they don't think they're eligible to do so
no i don't
and so the whole thing UNK itself
no i think a lot of the nominations are made by the existing bench
so in that sense it's that we're UNK
yeah yes it's the old boy network again in a way
yeah
er it's i maybe wrong about that i mean
can we ca will the chancellor accept er UNK an nomination from this group for instance
oh yes
oh yes
oh yes
or a street
oh yes
why shouldn't a street do it
would he
oh
oh yes
but
i didn't realise that no
i mean i don't we don't know what the process is of get you know the step by step until it gets to the cha lord chancellor do we
no
it's obviously civil servants deal with it
what's your view about
do you think there should be as many women as men as magistrates
no i don't think so
i mean put
i think it's
depends on personality and character
yeah
it's quite im it's quite important in the same way that it's quite important that we have so few women m ps
i mean i think it i think it says quite a lot about our society
i'm not suggesting that erm women magistrates would necessarily be any more just than men magistrates
but on the other hand if they are supposed to be representatives of our society then there's obviously something wrong when there are so few women compared with so few men
just as it's wrong that there should be so few women m ps
but can
because we are fifty per cent if not more so of the population
at the same time if we accept the principle of the equality of the sexes the UNK no longer matter
you can't have it both ways
if you're thinking of something like UNK justice
i'm thinking general
no i if you let me finish what i'm saying
there is everybody has to acknowledge that there is a difference in the interpretation of what UNK justice and one only has to see er the sorts of attitude that are put across by certain judges as to erm rape cases and abuse cases and how they the press would have us believe pat people over the head and tell them to go away and not do it again
i mean i think there is something there that needs pursuing i'm not UNK all judges of being UNK you know UNK or whatever but the number of cases that have come to light in the last few years whether it's because the press have just decided to home in on them
mm
or whether there is really a situation there which probably has been going on since time in memorial that we've only just started to hear about it
mm
well you you're you er have us believe er ra raises a very important issue i think
i mean what we know about what goes off in the courts i is entirely dependent on which particular reporter happens to be reporting
yes
er i mean if you take an average case which may last three or four days and there's a lot of evidence of one sort or another that's heard and weighed and considered and it boiled down to one paragraph in the newspaper and who chooses to its to report wh to report which the reporter
mm
you know if he's got a particular bias then he'll weight his report in the favour of that bias
irrespective of wh what's gone on over the whole period of the trial
so it's very UNK dangerous i think to take too much notice of what appears in the press
it's the only thing you have
it's the only thing you have but if you're
television
if you were in court and under trial you might come to an entirely different conclusion
and in any case it's most likely that it was a completely misleading headline in the press
yeah
yes
yes
can i
i would still find it very hard to believe that any evidence of UNK would justify a non UNK sentence to someone who has broken twenty three bones in their child's body
mm
mm
mm
a UNK in arms
what sort of UNK could justify that
nothing
well that's amazing and that's an that's an extreme case i think i don't
there is no UNK for things like that
they should be i think they should be finished
we ought not to have to keep them until they're about seventy in nearly the lap of luxury
just top 'em get rid of 'em
what happens to christian mercy then
mm
what happens to christian mercy then and hope that UNK
to do it
see them off
if i was er at the time of elizabeth she'd had their head off
i wouldn't have them hanging out and we've got to keep them
i don't believe in 'em
i believe in seeing them off
getting rid of 'em
i mean they are UNK after all people that do these dreadful things
well apparently then
they're not fit to be alive
apparently so but as er says
but as far as i'm concerned they not
they could have their reasons
we might have caused it to happen to them
when i say we i mean you know
mm
what they've experienced previously in society
in society
society yes
society
can i can i connect this with the notes because it does raise the point about er the judges whether they should have retired er earlier and it also involves another matter i think
they have come in for quite a bit of stick particularly when they've been dealing with rape cases
er of course it is the er it is a self UNK situation where the law lords are the highest er the highest level of justice in the land aren't they the law lords
mm
and the one very much questions er really their UNK for taking some decisions and i would like to know your views about where you've got rape cases wouldn't it make sense if there was a male judge and a female judge taking the case
now i've not seen this suggested but it seems to me a fair way of doing it
it should be i think it should be so
it should be more than one person deciding it
i think
mm
are we thinking of the court of appeal or are we thinking of a trial by jury
now there's a difference here
yes
soon as you start talking about more than one judge you getting into the appeal court area aren't you
i was thinking of it now as normally as a normal crown court case
mm
and having two where normally UNK over a judge i mean there aren't many women judges yet but there are qui er increasing numbers
oh yes
and i think in rape it does seem to me quite absurd that an old gentleman of seventy five should be judging it
mm
now erm
yeah
knowing the tremendous changes in our society
he can't really be in touch with the twenty years olds
do we do we think that generally speaking our judges are in touch with public opinion generally
no
or is it is it that they've become a sort of exclusive club arising al almost always through the ranks of the of the law and gradually got withdrawn from the way that ordinary people think and feel
i think that there is a peculiar problem here and that is that whilst i will fully agree with that judges should be kept or keep in touch with the UNK and habits of modern society and how it's changing
at the same time it is essentially if justice is to be done and this is what we're talking about that a judge should also be detached and how you can balance UNK with knowledge
mm
it's not easy
mm
it's not easy is it
no it's not easy by any means
but the de the
has arisen where a judge has passed a personal view about a woman hasn't he
this is what's caused the trouble
yeah
yes
he's not been given a legal decision he's passed an opinion saying oh this woman was you know encouraging the man and things like that and that's what gets people's backs up i think
one wonders how much
erm and to use a word that would be used in other areas UNK goes on amongst the UNK or do they just get to this UNK and then hold it against all UNK until they choose to retire i mean in any other er job where you have a peculiar expertise like that you would be expected to update yourself to keep up with the trends you would be sent away to conferences and UNK courses
i think that does happen
i mean i wonder how much does go on of that nature
well something goes on i i'm i do know th there was a reference to it recently
mhm
about a judges i think it's a one day just a one day seminar or something like that
mm
where they have UNK but it didn't amount to very much
i didn't think
but at the same time
disappointed for one thing because he is experienced
yeah
he's worked he's way up through various branches of the law he he's practically certain to being a q c and then a recorder you know
mm
worked up the ladder but what's required in a judge i would say put putting for the moment what we've just been discussing on the side that is any question of bias or sex bias a judge is there in court to perform an intellectual
he is there to listen to the evidence to present the evidence to the jury the jury then say whether the man in the dock or woman in the dock or whatever's in the dock is guilty or not guilty
the judge then bearing in mind all that he knows and all that he's been told about the guilty person proceeds to pass sentence
now i say that is an intellectual exercise as soon as it becomes an emotional exercise
that's the end of justice
that's right yeah
yeah
or it could be the beginning of justice and the end of UNK the law because how much of what goes on in court is actually UNK the law rather than determining natural justice
i mean you have had cases of people who have killed somebody
perhaps they've given an UNK of pain UNK or sleeping tablets to an UNK elderly relative
perhaps at that UNK perhaps at that relatives request
now in the eyes of the law they have committed a crime but if you put that situation before a jury and even though the judge may instruct the jury a crime has been committed you must find them guilty the UNK will probably be to say natural justice you that you done what was required of you that you don't deserve to be either convicted or sent to prison for it
yes right
so what there is a difference between UNK the letter of the law and the real justice of a particular situation being achieved
mm
mm
of course the essential thing in a case like that is that it's been established who UNK the tablets and why or whatever and why they ad why they UNK them isn't it
mhm
this is what this is what we're looking for we're not thinking now particularly about either what recommendation they the jury foreman makes or what sentence the judge passes the fact is that the truth or one would hope so has been established
then you can start to think about in what way can justice best be done in this particular case
i say it we're all the time we're mixing up justice and law and all kinds of things
mm
it's very difficult to separate them isn't it
oh yes
yeah
it is
oh yes
could i what is not touched on in the notes but is i think the other side of the coin is that if justice means treating people fairly this is on the basis of treating the accused fairly
but what about people who had the wrong UNK upon them isn't that equally a matter of justice
we only now seem to be getting round to recognising it
recognising that's true
that's right yes
it isn't brought up in these notes which i
i mean who funds them are they completely charitable or
no
no
some of it comes from the government and some from the local authorities but it's been cut back
yeah
done it with probation service paid money to them but now they can't do that they've got to give the money for the prisoners er not for the not for the victims of the crime
that's right
mm
which seems all wrong
i think there is some room for suggesting that erm in certain circumstances the actual UNK of the crime could make UNK to the victim
you know where it's been a case of vandalism or petty theft
yeah
but you also have to take into consideration the feelings of victims i mean it would have to be erm
only with their agreement
yes
i mean if somebody was UNK of setting eyes on the youth again then it wouldn't do them much good for him to be sent to make good what damage he's done to their house or
yes it wants very delicate handling i suppose
well the this friend of ours the er director of victims and crime er we have somebody at church who was UNK
she is an elderly person lives on her own and er he made a suggestion to her that she went with him to prison to face the man well i don't whether it was the actual man but men that had done burglaries you see
and she said she'd go in fact i had fellowship on because remember we started on that tuesday i said well you'll all be surprised to know that going to prison tomorrow
er but she went and she was she said that the men that she faced one out of those had never realised what he'd done the trauma he'd caused that
what he was getting because he'd never given a thought to the people he was erm UNK
and when said what it had meant to her UNK personal jewellery and things that was UNK value to you know the family that had died and they were the only things she'd got to remember them by and so on
he really was brought up in his tracks and said when he brought her home well if that only made one person think it's been worth it
mm
so
you know but he's very bitter er he's an ex policeman himself
and he's very bitter about the way the victims are treated
think about it and
the way the criminals are treated too
yes that's right
in fact he was telling me only the other week about the number of criminals that he knows they're serving their they're serving sentences and they're only one thing they're UNK and hoping for it is get out so they can knock another old lady down
mm
and go and get some money and sell it sell it in the car boot sale and get back to prison all over again
nothing to worry about no expenses everything's taken care of the only thing they haven't got is their freedom but they've got everything else
mm
they've got
more than the people have outside
yes
i think i think most criminals i mean there must be one or two who er too dangerous to be let loose on society
yeah
but i think most criminals would probably benefit more from being made to face er
yes
what they've done to society
i mean if somebody can't actually go back to the person they've UNK in a in a one to one situation there's no reason why they shouldn't be doing some other form of community service
that's right i agree
cos as you say if they do have to come to grips with their fellow man to be at least some of them who are going to be impressed by that
but how you can expect people to become more UNK by just being you know shut behind closed walls and not having to actually UNK for themselves and cope with life outside prison walls
it doesn't seem to make sense to me
i think there's also the type very often these people have left a family a wife and children behind
mm
and maybe they're not facing up to that responsibility
mm
it could be seen in some cases as maybe UNK we don't give enough thought to the wife and kids who've got dad er in court
no that that's very true
but i wonder having said that justice is a matter of treating people fairly not only UNK them presumably in a fair way deciding what is a fair way to treat UNK whether a person who's done something anti social is part of that fairness trying to get them to see the evil that they've done
but or is it just punishment full top
no you can't lock them up and throw away the key that's in a christian society that's not on you've got to do something to help them to UNK themselves
want to UNK for what they done
but how far that goes in prisons i don't know
but there are people that go into prisons aren't there to help them i mean there are councillors and er and people going into to give them interest in life i mean goes into teaching erm er park UNK doesn't he
but it's
again one of those things which appear to be under financial pressure i mean one of our most respected adult school members at national level was actually awarded the m b e for his work in UNK prison where he ran an adult school for thirty years
erm he finally had to shut the adult school not because the prisoners weren't interested in attending any more but because the prison officers and the governor weren't able to provide the man power to cover the existence of that class
mm
erm
there's a little bit more to it than that
yes there is
yes
yes
oh aye
it was cos the prison the UNK somebody going in and doing this for them
if anybody went into the prison they had to be paid
they weren't having any volunteers in
th this was putting it very simply
mm
mm
i mean if anyone saw that television programme a couple of weeks ago about those prisoners who put on guys and UNK
mm
where they were the prisoners were the UNK and they had a local UNK society made the
erm and they did remarkably well you know taking it over they were really very acceptable at the end but the whole programme had this sub plot of how UNK most of the prison officers were not all of them cos they obviously has some support to keep it going but a lot of them were UNK towards what was going on and not only that but just the prison system you know this chap got transferred from one prison to another when he was mid way through UNK you know i mean why shouldn't he have stayed there
mm
and completed this wonderful piece of UNK therapy which it was for him
mm
before they transferred him to another prison
i mean wh what was the common sense of that sort of bureaucracy UNK on people
well he must have been transferred for some reason or other
oh why
we
well that's something we don't know
there may have been other prisoners
i mean they wouldn't willy UNK would they
perhaps he was being treated badly
i mean in fact in fact
the implication was that there was no flexibility in the decision it could have been held back perhaps because he was involved in this if you like opportunity of a lifetime
mm
well not to so long er i was going to UNK to get bread and as i was going in and this fellow was coming out he hands with me
ooh
and then he got he got on the bus it was a midland red and it was going to erm er where it was going out of town anyway and he UNK hands with the driver because i couldn't help but you know notice what he was doing and when i got when i was in the shop and getting the bread the girls in there were telling me that he UNK hands with them because he had just got out of prison and he was a born again christian
ah
mm
and that's what had happened to him in the prison because someone said i wonder how long that will last
yeah
i'm afraid i'm a bit of a UNK
mm
but that's what he was saying
mm
can i touch on another thing which i think hasn't been mentioned in the notes but is very much in our minds
that is the long period where people are UNK
there has been some very unfortunate UNK
oh yes yeah
which is all our responsibility presumably that delay is because we aren't providing sufficient judges or sufficient services to er to try them in a much shorter term
that seems to me a very evil thing if people are kept in prison for months before they've been found guilty
for years sometimes
no they've not even been charged
no they're
i mean they're not they're not criminals
in the eyes of the law they're innocent until they're proved guilty
they're innocent until they're proven guilty
is it the fault is it the fault of the UNK system though or is it the fault of the lawyers
it's partly the fault of the lawyers it's partly the fault of the police who have lots and lots and lots of paperwork to do
mm
before these before these cases can be brought to the court
and an and very often
but in scotland they seem to manage to with them
they haven't got the man power to do all this paperwork
that is one reason for the delay
another reason is the lawyers
used to say that cases used to come before her court in UNK and it was an absolute disgrace that they ever came to court
and that the lawyers would spin them out
mm
yeah
for about three days when they could have been one day
cos they're being paid by the hour
yes
yeah
said it was an absolute disgrace
yeah
er this refers back to something said a little while ago talking about the fitness of judges having come up through the legal system
i mean having heard criticisms of how lawyers behave and having heard people say how can you defend someone when you know jolly well they're guilty and this kind of thing
how does that fit you to become a judge
if you've actually be UNK system on your way up which is what most of us seem to do at one time or another
oh they do they definitely could do
mm
i think regarding the number of people who are in prison whether on UNK or otherwise erm reminds me of something that i keep UNK either hear it on the radio or in the paper
but somebody has been sent to prison they are the sort of person who you would think of should never be sent to prison somebody who has UNK his firm out of a couple of thousand
that man is not a UNK to society and there are a great many other similar people who should never be in prison
i don't know i don't know how you could deal with them UNK
how any UNK could be made and talking about UNK this business over absent fathers er has just killed that idea of us getting more and more in that kind of way but i'm sure there are many people and i'm not thinking about those who have been committed an act of violence and said well they might do it again but say i'm pretty sure people who have been committed in effect of what you could call civil crimes that is putting their hand in the UNK should never be in prison
if anybody wants to employ them they should know before and then employ them at their own risk
and they can i mean they can even continue with original employer and work as you might say for nothing until they've paid back what they took
well that's could do
yes that's right
there's plenty of room for that sort of thing
mm
i mean that flies in the face of all the current pressures all of the current political about if you're a naughty boy into prison you go and for the longer the better
and now we have another er sub crop of people who have been discharged into community care from mental hospitals
mm
mm
who are not sufficiently in control of themselves to take their medication and then they become UNK or UNK and they erm commit social crimes again and so they're
part of the UNK too
mm
they're not criminals in the real sense of UNK but that's where they end up because that's the only dustbin they can send them to
mm
who was it that said the law's an UNK
mm
one thing times
no
it was the UNK in oliver twist
oh yes that's right
mr UNK
times running out but the local thing not the local that's the thing er appeared on er the news tonight er what happened announced by home secretary i think it was there i'm not quite sure where children under er children under sixteen if they er do not er UNK by the instruction of the juvenile court where they have conducted UNK
the parents can now be fined up to a thousand pounds for the children because they haven't carried out the instructions of the court
that seems to me to need a lot of thinking about because if you've got difficult children ra the last thing we want to do is think you've got a thousand pound fine or so
anyway if you can't pay it what do they do with them
yeah
i i'm this doesn't seem to me a very intelligent way i somehow or other you've got to get the parents win them to behave properly towards the children without the threat of a heavy fine on their head
i mean there's a i mean the consequence of a heavy fine the next thing is they'll be in prison cos they haven't paid a fine
where does it end
but the story goes that money speaks and some people some parents if they get hit in the pocket will probably take more notice of their child
yeah
than they've taken for months or years before
yes i think that's if you if your dog goes and UNK somebody an you're in trouble because you've let him get out of control and
yes
mm
but if your child goes and burns a school down he gets away with it
mm
that doesn't seem right to me
yeah
they shouldn't they shouldn't
parents should be held to some degree not necessarily to a tune of a thousand pound but they should be made in some way to be responsible for their
yeah but i agree it's just a question of the way you do it
it seems a very UNK way of just thinking of terms of financial
well it's what as has said it's
it's the best way to get people
pay up
they are some parents that do bringing out a book
oh aye well
will know and my daughter says if she's got children that are a real problem she'd want to know what their homes like and that usually gives an answer which you too
mm
erm we've got a friend that was erm a store detective in fact it's the wife of the er victim of crime support group
she was a store detective and she caught a child at shop lifting
the ruling is that if you catch a child you take her and keep her in the office and send for the parents
well she sent for her mother came and er when she came in explained to her why she'd sent for her and she UNK the child across the face and said there was no need to do that
she said that's for getting caught
oh
yeah
well now what now what chance does that child have of growing up
now those sort of parents need something to
i mean yes that's right
to catch them
i mean in a much more erm a le a less severe example but we're having a road safety week at school this week erm and it was my UNK turn yesterday afternoon so i was just there keeping a watching brief with my children while the road safety representative was talking to them and she put them us through the usual UNK of erm did any of them play on the UNK un UNK
had any of them crossed the road on their own
bearing in mind that they're only six and seven in my class er and then talking erm about how they travelled in cars and how many of them had UNK in the front seat er and most of them put their hands up and i mean the recommendation is that if you're under twelve years of age you should never ride in the front seat and so on and so forth
erm and i mean i was just UNK after that hearing all these minor horror stories coming out and then to cap it all one little girl put her hand up and said erm my UNK was stopped by the police once for not wearing his seat belt
presumably he was driving
mm
erm er and he got a ticket and he had to you know you have to take this ticket to the police station for not having worn his seat belt
erm so he always looks out for police cars now but he still won't wear his belt
oh
so i mean several of us as teachers have got together today and said it's not the children who need road safety instructions it's the parents
the adults
and in the same way if they're being given that example
mm
of how to UNK their way round things all the time rather than follow the rules
mm yes that's right
well they're going to be brought up UNK
it starts small and it gets big
yes it does yeah
well i
i mean we all bends the rules to our own advantage from time to time i mean nobody UNK they're UNK than white
but there are vary degrees in everything aren't there
yeah
well the concern is to er punish the children in a way that they will realise they're going to wrong way
but at the moment you feel as if they're getting UNK on the head and it's giving them a push down the wrong way
i feel very sorry for the parents of UNK
oh yes
i mean who can help but feel other than sorry for them but for them to burst out and say that those two little boys which is all that they are
mm
let's face it you know deserve to be locked up for the rest of their natural lives
that's not going to serve any purpose whatsoever
right no
on the other hand
unless they get help while they're locked up
mm
you know
they won't be any better
they won't be any better
that's the whole point isn't it
in any case even though they chose a minimum sentence they'll be twenty or twenty one yeah
it's as long as they've lived already practically yes
but it's perfectly natural isn't it
oh yes
oh absolutely
i mean it's perfectly natural for his parents to be like that
oh yeah oh yeah
i mean wouldn't we think
oh certainly would
i mean we would we would probably want to come out and you know
coming down to children er are doing UNK damage and er UNK and all this sort of thing
i do think when they're caught they are to me it seems as if they ought to be made to clear up some UNK and realise what they're doing because i don't think half the time they realise the upset they cause
no
we had some little boys at the end there throwing sticks up at a UNK tree or you know
oh yeah
and erm i went along look at all this mess
oh we're clear it up
i said erm what you doing throwing sticks up where the stick
oh it's up there it fell down and erm went along and picked it up so i took it off them and said how would you like it if i threw sticks at you anyway they said oh i'm sorry you know they sort of cleared everything up and went off
but i mean often when you go and approach children like that you find that you know all you get is a UNK of
yes that's true yes
i'm afraid you know that it's a shame because of i feel that if they are stopped like that to be talked to and quietly and point out you know what they
mm
doing wrong and that you know they'll go away but so often these days of course the parents all they all take no notice yeah silly old fool you know
mm
well i was going to say at last year at my friends house and they have all open front beautiful UNK nice big house they are and two UNK on UNK started riding down the across the front gardens instead of on the pavement or the road and she said to me oh i'll stop this i'm not having this
cos there was UNK and flower beds and everything you see and they was going over it
and her husband go and give them a UNK so she said no and she walked up to them and quietly said
mm
where do you live
they told her where they lived just up the road
well she said i think i'll get my bike out
yes
yes
and come and ride over your mother's front garden and see what she thinks
mm
and they said oh no
she said oh yes
this is where i live and you're running all over it like this and UNK it
i shall have to come and do it to your mother and see what she thinks
and they went away like UNK you know really they was shocked
their mother's front lawn could very well been a wilderness
that's true
couldn't spoil it if you tried
no that's true
oh
well i think
she said she had found when dealing with some of these of kids up where they live that erm a quiet talk there and then only talk
well yes
better than if you shout
better than if you shout
i think that depends on where you live
well there very posh houses in the road
yeah but i mean can you imagine paying for that some of the lot that live on
yeah
an estate you know
well i
well it's worth trying anyway i mean
i came out of church one day to do some visiting from the over sixties and there was a boy with a great chunk of rock in his hand and he was looking at the window
well we've had an awful lot of damage to the church
in fact on all the windows UNK up now and i walked up to him and i just said would you like to give to me son and he turned round and looked at me and to my great surprise he gave it to me
i didn't know what to do with it
so surprised
but i said well look i think i'd better put it in my bag don't you it won't do any harm there
and he looked at me and said i'm sorry
but then behind me came a lot of other lads
yeah
you great fool what did you do that for
and when they're all together that that's when the problem is
that's when the trouble starts
that's when the trouble is
mm
mm
but that's the same with any group whatever age isn't it
you're being encouraged from being
yeah
yeah
oh yes
but i mean i think it's true to say that ninety nine times out of a hundred if you do approach these so called UNK as if they're human beings they usually react like human beings
it pays to do it
it does yeah
i think so
it is not easy to approach them in a situation like that without being angry
no
no
the clue i i'm sure if i made a mistakes like that it's because it's you know maybe angry and i made the wrong approach
mm
i must tell you that when we lived in UNK in up in yorkshire we erm we were having trouble with some UNK coming up from leeds you know and we had there was an old sergeant in UNK you know for years and tall
well very well known i can't remember his name now but he had two methods of getting rid of them erm
one they were going into a pub and going into the toilets you know making a so he had a policeman waiting in and the toilets for them you see and the o one other UNK occasion he was seen chasing them down the main street in UNK he got his UNK on you see
he was boom UNK them with his UNK sort of chasing them out of town you know and i must say they never came back
it's like a UNK
yes
i know
yes
well
the subject was er justice for all fact or fiction
and we had a bit of both
would
we they guessed has anyone guessed
yeah well i might
you know then
yeah
would you like to hear the cutting
it's only fifty old years old
mm
but it's in my little green bag somewhere do you know where it is
put on floor here my little green plastic bag
you should read it it's f
and carry on just as if er we were proceeding immediately after the proposed excellent introduction and as if the intervening weeks just hadn't occurred
when this matter was discussed at housing committee i believe it's only last week but it seems a lot longer ago i spoke at some length about the errors and UNK in the report arguing against a case that officers have put forward pointing out mistakes and UNK conclusions that seem to have been drawn from some very UNK evidence
i promised members after that erm meeting that er i would bring forward different arguments tonight and that is exactly what i hope to do
i want to speak on only one angle and that is capital
now most large businesses actually need capital
they need it to finance new projects and which they ultimately hope those projects will bring in a profit on the capital employed
but once employed as capital that money stays there it's stuck and hopefully it UNK money but it's stuck there forever until the sale of that asset is a achieved
many companies when needing to finance new projects have to raise more capital
this is often done by obtaining money in the form of loans venture capital guarantees and that sort of effort
but if those forms of capital aren't available then the business has to raise capital by some other means and this is very often done by UNK assets that they currently hold and UNK the capital for the new project
so the use of capital is fluid right it it's in a state of dynamic equilibrium as a UNK would be prepared to call it
and it is not it is not fixed it is not fixed or in UNK terms UNK
we in this council operate
we in this council operate a housing business with an annual turnover in excess of twenty four million pounds
anyone who says we are not operating a business is UNK themselves
we have an acknowledged need to invest more capital to provide more housing for the most UNK in our population
the way it is at present we cannot we cannot get more UNK to put into the new project but the bank manager i e the chancellor of the exchequer reminded us a few months ago that the other way of funding our projects he encouraged us to look at our current assets and if possible UNK some of that asset and fund it or use it to fund our new schemes and this mr mayor is what we should be doing
we must sell some of our houses and use the money we gain from that to fund the provision of new housing in the city
to miss out on the opportunity afforded to us by the chancellor of the exchequer is to deny those in the greatest housing need the opportunity to get decent low cost housing
so my the in my mind the best way forward is for this council to promote the right to buy and i fully support this motion and i would urge members of this council to ignore the report that comes back from the housing committee
thank you mr mayor
thank you mr mayor erm a week is a quite a long time in housing but er
especially housing finance terms i mean the UNK probably gonna change again by you know by that sort of time
i think it's quite remarkable er that councillor can come along and UNK say well we've had a report back to housing committee housing committee's considered this matter and the vast majority of people found it fairly unacceptable but we'll ignore that we'll ignore that fine well i UNK if you want to ignore it that's fine but i think w we do face here a key issue and the issue of capital receipts as you rightly say is an important one
now question is whether or not there is a simple ability to realise a capital receipt and use it i think and if that were true if what you're saying is true and there was some net gain to be made very easily then i think we would have a hard time perhaps refusing what you're saying
but it isn't true
that's the whole point
it is not a simple case that we can run along sell a few houses get the capital receipts and suddenly we can go off and have a wonderful programme and replace the assets which we have sold and when we're talking about assets in this case i think there's one crucial difference between us and you and that is we recognise that isn't just an asset it is a person's home a person's home that's so important an a i'm just to talk about it as if it is something else y'know just some UNK lump of cattle UNK lump of stock money that was doing no good whatsoever is a nonsense and i think most of us would agree that it is a complete and utter nonsense
anyway why can't we easily use these capital receipts
well there are a number of reasons some of which are specific to the cambridge to the context of this authority
as you will be well aware as a member of housing committee we do actually have faced a substantial crisis in terms of the availability of land which we can make available for building that is one of the problems possibly a short term problem but nonetheless one of the problems key ones which we face here
so we can't just realise the asset dash out and build a house through a housing association because we have this crucial land problem
now if our assets if by promoting the right to buy by having capital receipts we seem to have a large balance building up there is the distinct risk given the sort of policies that this government has pursued over time of a we will be running a risk there we don't know what they're going to do you don't know what they're going to do
but let's face it i mean if a lot of local authorities are in similar sorts of positions and a lot of balances are building up well the money just might run away mightn't it it's happened before i think it might happen again
i mean i don't i don't believe that your government is stupid er it may be UNK on occasions it may be wrong but i don't believe it's necessarily stupid
they've had a long time to crack a lot of these problems pardon
what's the evidence
well admit i cannot actually bring an evidence at this point in time to support that er that er assertion
so if you were serious about promoting social housing over time what you would be working for is not a stop go economy in housing not a stopped go regime in terms of UNK housing finance but a stable a long term commitment towards er a financial regime that will actually bring that housing through and that is something you have not done
i mean the autumn statement UNK goes a hundred percent to a hundred percent use of capital receipts
it just as go back
now that's no way no way to run the railway i was gonna say but that's probably not the best choice of words in the present circumstances
but it isn't it isn't a way to actually run a decent social housing programme
we need stability over the medium term at the very least in order to produce the units that we need not this sort of one minute you're off one minute you're not and again if you were serious the resources were already there in terms of the capital receipts that people already had
you could've let us use some of that eight over eight million pounds that we have UNK away set aside to actually promote our social housing programme
so basically i don't think that it is a simple picture of being able to get a capital receipt and go out and use it
there will be occasions where indeed if people ar people in marginal circumstances are encouraged to buy then we will find as the local authorities that they will not be able to raise a mortgage in the private sector and we will actually have to supply the mortgage ourselves so where's the capital receipt gone
it's disappeared really hasn't it
because we we've had to provide mortgage
so time and time again when you actually look at it when you actually look at this position that we find ourselves in there isn't an easy receipt to be made that can be used that actually provided what the business is about
alright it you wanna call it a business the business is about provide social housing to answer housing need in this town
i don't actually really believe at the end of the day that is something you that is rightly called business
it is a service we are engaged in providing a housing service to answer housing need
what we plead with the government all the time is allow us a regime a financial regime that is reasonable and stable in order to do that
let us not be UNK by short UNK met by silly schemes that somehow promise an UNK which doesn't exist
thank you
erm
yes mr mayor
i am very UNK by councillor 's analogy with this UNK er count er housing services by this council being a business and the chancellor of the exchequer being some kind of bank manager
i mean how many bank managers b force their businesses to sell off their fixed assets at a UNK discount for heavens sake
i mean if this is the way bank managers operate up and down the country no wonder the UNK in a mess
businesses are going bust all the over place
actually erm although councillor is quite correct that we're providing a service erm in some ways it would be nice if the government did give us the freedom to operate our business as we choose to do so
we would therefore be able to provide a much better service
now it's perfectly now the cost er the benefits from sort of marketing right to buy is really very dubious erm the government has shown time and again that what it takes then gives with one hand it takes away with another and the costs are obvious we are UNK our housing stock we are putting it we are likely to end up with more and more with a higher proportion of poor properties and erm there's also the risk that if we do really have to be promoting right to buy we're going to have people who are probably not sure whether they can afford to buy their house or aren't sure whether they even want to buy their house
i think they should be treated as adults and allowed to make that decision for themselves
there's n i doubt if there are any tenants who aren't aware of their right to buy and there's there are in fact plenty of private mortgage UNK around ready to sort erm try and persuade tenants that they can go ahead and buy their homes
i really don't think there is any point to this motion
frankly i think from our colleagues in the conservative party shouldn't really be wasting our time here with these silly motions erm what's needed is if you're gonna improve the housing situation in the city and in the country as a whole we need to be allowed to use our capital receipts all the ones we've UNK up and we need to also inject money into the national economy to build new homes and incidentally to get the economy moving again and start bringing down the level of unemployment
so our colleagues shouldn't be wasting our time they should be using their own party's internal democracy there is if there is such a thing
to change the government's the policy if that's what one calls it seems to change from year to year
thank you
here
chair committee
thank you mr mayor
mr mayor er i don't want to be long in this debate because i'm sure we've probably all made up our minds exactly what we're going to vote on because long evenings it UNK and turns
would like to say er and that is though councillor UNK us to be more totally er which went on the housing committee i think it would be very wrong of us to do that leaving that er the vote at the end of that particular debate was UNK to and er these democracy that's er situation
erm i think it's worth saying that er us j just UNK on what councillor has just said and that is that i think most tenants are very well aware of the right to buy and er the motion being unnecessary but what happens with the motion is that it possibly attracts people who really in many ways cannot actually afford to buy er to take advantage of their rights but who might be persuaded by very persuasive tactics to do so
now er they are then in a situation perhaps often those people who are er less financially well off and sometimes in jobs which this particular might very well lose tomorrow erm their in a difficult situation as far as paying back mortgages is concerned
it's worth also noting at this point that if you are a tenant and UNK and you lose your job you are eligible for housing benefit erm if you if you were er buying your house although you do get some er you get the interest i believe on your mortgage paid there are lots of other things that do not get paid but the thing is that if you have a reduction in your income which might happen where one partner say lost a job er you s you're eligible for housing benefit but you get nothing as far as company paid mortgage is concerned
so on that ground i feel would be very worried by promoting the right to buy erm i've said everything i want to i didn't really want to UNK this er this debate and i think it's but i think i don't believe that councillor mentioned the er the
we were talking i think this is the thing about UNK er this year our erm receipts taken into account are two point three eight million as opposed to last year er this is taken into account we drew four hundred and seventy five thousand that's a huge jump erm the government by in telling us we can send this er this er what i call UNK erm this year er the capital receipts from november last year until december next year erm a anyone had undoubtedly for most of that back in the in the use er a grant and i think it as the government have actually kept extremely quiet on this subject that seemed to be the scenario that seems most likely to happen
i think our erm
all those in favour
a couple of points i'd like to respond to councillors
firstly i have never seen a more clearer er grant from the government to actually let you build houses this year this is whole point of th this should happen and if we don't take it up i believe that in future years to come we shall regret it very strongly indeed
as far as promotion is concerned yes i will not deny every tenant probably knows about the right to buy but then everybody knows there are mars bars and mars bars spend millions of pounds promoting their product
you have to y you have to promote the product to make people buy it
i'm following on from that
of course people must be advised carefully but it shows great lack of faith in human na in their abilities and a great UNK on our part mr mayor if we fail to market the ideas simply because we don't feel the UNK are competent to understand it
if we fail to take this opportunity mr mayor as i as i feel we are about to do i am a hundred percent convinced that in years to come people will look back at this year or however long it happens to be and say they missed out on a golden opportunity to make social to make more houses and to make social housing better in this city and across the country
i very much hope that you will in fact support the motion as originally intended
could i just point out that councillor that contrary to call my UNK and repetition are no grounds for allowing
all those in favour of the proposals please show and all those against
i now turn to the adoption minutes of city hall and now it is a process of in that city hall did not endorse a recommendation from the finance panel the budget that came from finance panel erm so we are in the slightly unusual position of having to debate the proposals of finance panel as we were recommended to do by city hall erm that means as i understand it that er the chair of city hall will now present the annual budget statement erm and since he is going to do that in a form of an amendment er that seven other unusual features about the way in which we would normally do it which would mean that there would be er a budget statement and where there would then be the formal proposals and amendments UNK erm so what i would propose is to try and make sure that everybody has maximum opportunity to have their say erm because no two amendments can be on the floor at one time er to take what the leader of the council said first of all erm then to allow the other two leaders to present their budget alternatives as it were without it be this is just not didn't take it at that point if they don't want to
but to present the full scenario and then vote er on the different items er so that voting is done on items on the amendment before we then proceed er if you want to we just have to go to amendments to that because of course no two amendments can be on the floor at the same time
er what i would prefer to do is to er listen to the amendment put forward by the as if that were an amendment to the adoption minute since there's nothing to be adopted at the moment erm i will then speak on that amendment well i would probably speak against it erm at that point er there could be a vote on that amendment line by line
when that vote is finished er there there's then the opportunity for further amendment
absolutely
a and that i if that's sort of what you're saying
that that's exactly what i was i was
mr mayor on a point of order mr mayor er standing order sixty two refers explicitly to community charge or the poll tax i think that before we move into this debate we should amend that so that it does refer to the council tax which is what we will be debating
to my left has anything to say on the subject
my only slight UNK is whether it's possible to have t to move an amendment to standing order
can we take that as being unanimous
yes
good
thank you very much
leader of the councils
we have known for a number of years that we with every other council in the land are facing the government that does not believe in local government
that believes that local councils should operate services should do it at the dictate of the department of the environment and indeed it's UNK that we are surrounded by some local authorities who feel that their world is precisely that
far be it for me to mention huntingdon district council but that is one which
immediately UNK to mind
the fact that their citizens UNK into the city to UNK themselves of our facilities is something that we might deal with in another sphere even on day residents were seen to attend the theatre in this town recently erm unfortunately this authority doesn't see fit to actually UNK the theatre
however it is that means that over the last few years every time we have actually debated about budget we recognised that the force had UNK and against the judgement of the majority of this council not necessarily er UNK by political affiliation we have to be getting down further and further towards the completely UNK expanded spending assessment that is assessed as necessary for the needs of this city by the department of the environment
now clearly this is a process that is going to continue this year
we had originally intended to freeze our budget at precisely the level that it has been at the last two years for a variety of reasons we have decided that it is sensible to actually bring it down yet further
there are two reasons for this
firstly the process of moving down towards our s a needs to be UNK because my own UNK is that the government faced with all sorts of financial UNK is going to take a harder and harder UNK attitude towards local government expenditure as it will unfortunately with an awful lot of the rest of what we have come to expect over the decades to be the responsibility of central government clearly the current expenditure review is going to have some nasty UNK in it for consumers of account services consumers of other assets of the welfare state but particularly i would suspect the local government
UNK however we need to make it clear that when we have looked at the figures and i would pay some to the opposition for bringing er some matters to our attention erm and looking at the way in which very careful on the part of this council has led to a better reserve position than we would previously have expected
there is a sense of which that good housekeeping with the inevitable consequences of government policy can be can be in terms if you like or benefits to the council tax payers who have after all in a under the complete disaster of the poll tax which nobody but nobody in this chamber i suspect knew more unless there is at least one UNK tory who will try to save it was really a wonderful experiment and it's a shame it didn't continue
on that basis we have an amendment to the budget as presented to the finance panel and as the mayor explained
if i can talk immediately to scope of that amendment before moving on to some points about the budget
with regard to the first lies my group has come to the conclusion that there is a way in which the employment development budget can be augmented to specifically reserve at least the part of the current UNK provision provided by the cooperative development erm we stand by our opinion that there are ways in which that service can be more efficiently UNK that this is a sensible way forward
with regard to the contingency is something which has often been a matter of debate within this council
it has been a matter of debate because there are those in the council who feel that if you put in a contingency provision it will be spent whether it's needed or not
there are many of us who feel that it is sheer UNK if one assumes that there will be no contingency in the course of the year that needs to be budget
this year might represent a compromise with regard to the those two opposition positions which again i would suggest are something that perhaps UNK more to than it does to actual political affiliation
the regard to the job evaluation budget suggests that our original figure of a hundred thousand pounds is not fully necessary and that can all be reduced to fifty percent to fifty percent or the equivalent say to fifty thousand pounds and the same goes for the judgement with regard to how you are going to have figure with regard to jobs vacancies
that will bring the UNK budget down a fine tune particularly with regard to er recommendations of the housing committee with regard er to the erm which clearly there will be some people
what we have done is to suggest that we actually need a lower budget than we had originally assessed
this is in line with the obvious policy not just of the ruling group but i suspect of the council as a whole that we know that sooner or later courtesy of this government whether we like it or not we are going to have to get down to our standard spending assessment
the policy of this council over the last couple of years has been to get down to that figure enforced upon us as UNK as possible with the least damage to our services and the least damage to the morale of our staff and our staff are after all the most important asset that a local authority UNK and that is what we're trying to consider
everybody will be aware of the fact that in the course of the last two budgetary years we have made savings in excess of what we had anticipated
those savings have been achieved by very careful housekeeping indeed
by a rigid look at vacancies by the constant search after efficiency savings
by looking hard at any way in which we can raise extra income for this authority
a classic example of good housekeeping which has made cambridge a authority in the region and beyond and one that even members of the conservative government have occasionally through UNK teeth they're not doing a bad job damn them and that means that the are going to think to have some of those if you like very good housekeeping back to the citizens who have been paying the bills over the years
for instance to this is an assumption that although we are going to have a shortfall on the collection fund again because of good housekeeping we believe that this action is what people want by the charge payers of the city and again that in this financial year it can be taken out of the
this seems to me to be a highly high responsible budget bringing us closer and closer to a position where we will eventually reach
we are spending now if this budget is accepted a mere eleven percent of the standard spending assessment levels which means that in time we are going to get down to where the government is going to demand that we
we may not want it but the government is going to demand it and we as UNK of the services on the part of the people of cambridge are going to have to do as sensibly and UNK as possible
there are some more points i've got to make about the budget in general
the first thing is that i think people need to recognise that the investigation of savings generated a figure of one point four million pounds
that is an extraordinary amount of money to find in terms of savings
it's not a figure that represents gross UNK gross over expenditure
what it represents i would suggest is the desperate attempt to trim off the margin to find every single last way in which we can follow the government UNK whilst preserving our full services
but i do think that we need to recognise this on council that there is a cost associated with that one point four million pounds worth of savings and those costs come in two different directions
one cost is that clearly some services are being cut in terms of how good they are
we need to recognise that some letters will take longer to answer that public UNK will not be as fully attended as they have been in the past
that some community events will not take place
that some voluntary organisations will not get the grants that they previously expected
all of these UNK at the margins which i would suggest UNK from the quality of life of people in this city something that we regret but something which can and has been enforced upon us
we're trying to the UNK of central government UNK are all closing upon this city
but there is a cost of that and it's a cost that people will recognise
they will recognise it too in terms of higher charges than perhaps ideally we would want to impose for certain services which the city operates whether it be sports pitches or whether to be UNK it's the cost of actually UNK the dead
perhaps those are things that in the best of all possible UNK we wouldn't want to but we are forced so to do
but there's another cost to the savings that have been UNK and that we are going to be forced to take with regard to this budget and that is something that anybody who uses the city council services and particularly i would suggest councillors are going to notice and that is the stress that we are putting on the people that we employ
it is all very well to say to any people organisation you shall become more and more efficient
in the end there has to be a limit there has to be a level beyond which you cannot go without people UNK under the strain without people saying i'm now doing the job that was done by two people two and half people a few years ago
it doesn't mean that you don't look for UNK but it does mean that we need to recognise that we are putting a burden on our staff which i think we will be UNK and stupid to UNK
i that in terms of many of the so called efficiency measures that we could take we are reaching the absolute limits in this authority
there are areas one or two of which i will go on to UNK to which i still think are actually going to make for the greatest savings in the coming financial year and thereafter
but in terms of saying there are easy savings to be found in terms of greater UNK in this authority i warn you we are reaching the level unless we actually want in putting a completely unacceptable level of stress on the people who we employ and who UNK serve this city very UNK and give such a very high level of service
i know that there are views among the opposition groups about what should be cut out of this budget
we have decided that the fundamental points as far as the is concerned is the presentation of services
wherever we have looked for savings we have looked to UNK away at the centre and preserving those services that are delivered to the citizens in a direct way
some of them and we make no bones about this are delivered undoubtedly to UNK they're delivered to small groups of people in the city to people who are in any care in the community need to be given special consideration
if we house them we need to look after all the people we make no apologies for the fact that this is a budget UNK towards equal opportunities and to an anti poverty strategy and that is something that we will fight to preserve and we would expect support from at least some quarters in order to achieve an UNK status in this city
the same is true of some of the bids we've allowed more bids this year than perhaps it was the case in the past
the bids that we have wording of support
we want to do something for the voluntary sector
fifty thousand pounds extra for the voluntary sector at a time when a recession when so called but completely un care in the community is putting a tremendous burden of responsibility both on the voluntary sector and on we know what a good job the voluntary sector do in this city thousand pounds is a small proportion of the money that they are actually requesting from us
it's in a place in the direction of the work that they do it is not enough we would like to provide more
but ill UNK anyone who says that is money that's not going to be
pollution the environment again that is something which is not just for concern we know it's of global concern as well
we have some responsibilities in that direction
yes we have to operate within our resources but if we're looking to er how recycling that seems to us a bid which is worthy of backing regardless of political affiliation
if you listen to any national politician they pay to the importance of environmental concerns and to actually say that that's a bid that can't be approved
putting more money into the taxi part scheme a scheme that is anything but everybody in the surrounding authorities how many of us have had letters from the residents of UNK or UNK or wherever else complaining that they want to be included in this scheme
something that provides a life line mobility for people who otherwise would find that they were being seriously disadvantaged that their lives would not be as full as
each and every one of the bids however they refer to particular minority groups whether they refer to the group are i think UNK
they're UNK because we're doing within very tight financial constraints
this is a very responsible budget indeed
it brings down our level of expenditure
it leaves no fortune with regard to what the department of the environment might throw at us next year unless they completely lose their marbles which after all is always possible
which i suspect the odd tory mp having a heart attack falling under a bus the loss of directions might actually mean that they might see a degree of sense in borough capping
it leaves few hostages to fortune with regard to the department of the environment
we after all bring our expenditure down we're down near two million pounds under new cap capping rules
that is not under any circumstances responsible judging
it is also the budget that has taken notice of what the opposition have actually said we listened to you we have not UNK with our original thinking we've talked to the officers we've listened to what you've said we may not have done it with the greatest grace possible but
comes very much as difficult to grace but erm and we have brought our expectations down
but the budget in general is one that we UNK
we think that it UNK services that it has UNK out the vast majority of UNK that we can find within this council and that it doesn't pass on to the poll tax council tax payers the fruits i mean it does pass on the poll tax or council tax payers the fruits of how we have achieved savings and UNK over the last couple of years
we've done well it's time that was actually passed on
there are further areas which in time year will allow that trend to continue i'm aware of the fact that there will probably be in the course of the evening that suggest that greater UNK can be found in a variety of areas whether it be in or wherever else
we have our own ideas about that
we have gone out with regard to our team through voluntary competitive tender
that is designed to save money for this authority
we are looking seriously at the costs of such in house items as car UNK
we've continued to keep a very hard view of the corn exchange and a number of other bodies which we fund but we're going to see what actually happens we're not going to make blind predictions about savings without actually going into the facts
if we make further savings in the course of the next financial year the benefit will be felt by the citizens of cambridge and it's no good UNK them things which we can't deliver
this is a budget that promises what it will deliver
that bears the fruits of past sound financial management preserved services and looks for as many UNK as possible
far be it for me to say that this is the sort of budget that conservatives ought to applaud because it is after all a budget that is guided by a feeling that councils should provide services and they should UNK their services to the least communities to be guided by equal opportunities and by UNK and that's what this group has always stood for this is the budget that we present tonight and i would hope that it would get a far better and far larger measure of support than perhaps of course been the case in the past
is there a second
yes
is there anybody else
thank you mr mayor erm well this may be a budget the conservative might applaud but i'm
yes one wonders how get actually
david owen might be buying membership soon
but seriously i'm against this budget because of what is what it doesn't contain rather than what it does contain
the policies that it represents still represents even as amendment
repeat this evening
that labour's budget doesn't do anything new to meet those challenges
education cuts
interesting the party supposedly in favour of education UNK when education is mentioned
interesting to speculate and i'll do this a little later on ask them why the labour party's so obsessed with opposing education
there's also pollution the environment the council mentioned those there's nothing new in this budget
nothing new about the lack of public transport in cambridge
and about the biggest problem today that of unemployment what we have is nine thousand pounds put back into the employment development fund
still leaving
what we have is nine thousand pounds put back into the employment development fund still leaving a cut
this is no time to cut anything from the employment development fund from the training budget even sixteen thousand pounds
so the fails to meet all these challenges
make no apologise UNK to starting with education the county council is cutting seven million pounds from education this year
a dozen or more teachers in city schools may lose their jobs maybe more
more than half the UNK schools are faced with real cuts in their budgets
county talks about putting a million pounds back in and it turns out that this million pound in fact is part of a two million pound cut that appears to have been made
it's all a mistake of calculation from when the government UNK further education
the city could act the city could do something about it but it won't
the ruling group the labour party UNK to do anything about this at all
i don't want to hear any more nonsense about doing the county council's job because the city already does lots of things for the county council UNK fares for the elderly for example
on the city board last week we had yet another example rather a good project UNK disability project very likely but it's social services budget
and a question you have to ask yourself is why the labour party is prepared to spend on all the aspects of county council responsibility except education
why is this
why does the labour party seem to education
the one thing it will not it will not spend money on
education is important to everyone it's not a m a minority group it's important to individuals for their own self fulfilment it's important for society for our economic future and our future as a democracy
so why the opposition and after all this time eighteen months of debate
and from the labour party reason after reason UNK reason after reason
after all this time reason and UNK been knocked down one after the other and what did we get last time
we got votes against our proposals with no reasons given at all you've now got down to the point of having no reasons at all for opposing what we want to do
so what is why is it that labour party oppose education spend
so i think we're getting rather strange signals out of tonight's budget on the one hand we have councillor the john smith UNK although at least put a bit of weight on
on the other hand
we seem to have a labour party that treats education as some kind of middle class hobby that thinks of education spending as something spent only on the UNK something to do with a university something not really important for ordinary people
if that's not the reason what is the reason
and one UNK it might be back in the days of the nineteen fifties nineteen sixties when the labour party opposed anything at local level of course but at local level that might tend towards helping people to be UNK mobile on the grounds that UNK mobile people stop voting labour
i don't want to go to the story as to why the labour party opposed the er th the entry to the city of marks and spencer but it's an interest
they didn't want working people to have decent clothes
i really do hope the labour party is stuck in some kind of thirties plan i'm afraid i've got my doubts
will you stop laughing
the circumstances i wonder how well this is to the current debate as opposed to amendments which i suspect will be moved later on
i'll give my reasons for voting against this budget
it's got no education spending
i think that councillor should be allowed to continue
because er he's just one person who remembers those years
ooh
there are other grounds remaining for opposing this budget
it still hasn't tackled all the waste there is in the council we'll get back to that when we amendment
it still hasn't done anything new has no new ideas about traffic and environmental problems
and of course it's a budget which is on an attitude towards the UNK pool problem which we disagree with therefore in no way do we support it
but there are many reasons as you will see when we put our amendment asking why are budget proposals are different from the ruling groups but the main reasons are simply the ruling group's refusal for whatever reason i just wanna hear the reasons
to do anything about the major problems facing the city
councillor
yes i would like also to speak against this amendment erm but for completely different reasons
i don't intend to give the council a to solving the world's problems and that's not the word to mind but problems
because i do recognise mr mayor er i have to say that this amendment is a step in the right direction
but i believe that the councillor er is somewhat cynical in the what that he has put this forward
tories producing rabbits out of hats is the big bad headline wasn't it
you know we're the ones accused of doing these things at the last moment
we're the ones who you know don't tell anybody what our strategy is going to be we suddenly spring it on the members right at the end of the process at the council meeting
we're not running the council the labour group are running the council er but they on this occasion mr mayor are the ones producing the rabbits out of the hats
and i'll congratulate the leader of the council on a wonderful UNK act with this amendment
i asked at the meeting of the city board and i asked on more than one occasion and didn't get a proper answer what the labour group intended to do with the three point two million pounds that will build up in reserve say for the next three years
i made it clear that our policy was to use that money to reduce the level of the council tax over that period of time
i couldn't get any clear commitment er from er you mr mayor or the leader of the council as to what would do with that three point two million pounds
i also pressed at the city board for something to be done about this problem of the er people disappearing off the poll tax register at an UNK rate i must add
and i was absolutely amazed and i think all of us on the opposition benches were absolutely amazed at the city board that you appeared to have no proposals whatsoever to do anything about that situation
i find found that absolutely incredible and i thought it was UNK to say the least the procedure we had to go through the other er evening erm with two hours of UNK debate er a break while you consulted er the officers before we got to some er sensible way forward which is now incorporated in this amendment er to spend a hundred thousand pounds on actually trying to trace
but spending that hundred thousand pounds as we were told at the time would only part solve the problem
the potential deficit on the poll tax collection fund er because of these people not UNK is well over million pounds and that by spending the hundred thousand proposed here would actually bring it down to seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds and that's where the UNK trick is er this er amendment because of course if you work out the increase in the balances that you are proposing to take in this amendment it works out exactly to seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds well it does on my calculations mr mayor
exactly seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds
so you're doing exactly what we were telling you to do a few weeks ago that you had to er take money out of reserves or you had to cut down on the level of services if you were to avoid putting that thirty four pounds on the council tax bills this year
and you very UNK very UNK and i this is where i congratulate you built this in to your proposals tonight
there are some things in this that obviously we can support the delete or reduction in the contingency UNK p provision to a hundred thousand pounds we're going to be moving later on to delete even that amount but it's surprising you were telling us you've been telling us for years you have to have two hundred thousand pounds in the contingency
all of a sudden in a matter of two weeks you can take a hundred thousand pounds out of it
we welcome the reduction in the job evaluation budget to fifty thousand pounds
the officers told us er some time ago that could be done quite easily
if the officers could tell us that why didn't they tell the controlling labour group i'm sure they did and then the question is why didn't you listen to them
why then did you put over a hundred thousand pounds in that budget in the first place
i welcome that particular proposal
you questioned mr mayor at the city board when i put forward the proposal to increase the er turnover figure from three percent to four percent
you said explain that councillor evans tell us how you're going to do it
well perhaps you or somebody on the other side might care to tell us how you're gonna take it from three to three and half cos i'll quite happily tell you then how we'll take it from three and half to four percent so we welcome that as a step in the right direction
obviously as i say we would support the additional bid of a hundred thousand for pursuing the poll tax er non registers
and obviously we would want to take money out of reserves our original amendment took one point three million pounds out of reserves and it's interesting to see now that you're suggesting almost that figure again and yet for years you've been telling us you can't take this money out of the reserves er you know we had to keep it for a UNK day
do we take it that the UNK day has finally arrived
i think it has
but this does not go far enough for us and er shortly we will be moving another amendment which will take the council's budget down to the standard spending assessment and i will speak to that er when i come to move that amendment
no the standard UNK spending assessment
could i just before i sit down say one thing er why i disagree er with councillor
i think the liberal democrats are gonna find themselves rather UNK isolated here this evening proposing the highest budget
ah well we will wait and see erm they're trying to solve everybody's problems but ours er with all this talk about spending money on education sorting out the traffic problems erm it's a pity they don't spend a bit more time in their budget calculations in dealing with the problems of this council and not those of the county council
so mr mayor for completely different reasons than the council have er i will be urging my group to vote against this amendment and to support a subsequent amendment which will take the budget down even further
thank you
councillor wishes to speak
thank you mr mayor i just wanted t to come in with two fairly quick points er as to why i will not be able to support this amendment but the first is that the leader of the council has indicated that the efficiency savings erm has got as far as it can go and that you know we have been UNK at the margins and there is no more margin left and that leads you to believe that perhaps one should be looking at somewhat more er root and branch type of UNK in the spending that the labour group want to actually erm deal with er and the second point i would like to make and er i thank councillor for giving us a new word tonight UNK because that describes exactly what i think the labour group are trying to do by bringing this figure down it UNK the embarrassment they would have from having to add on a substantial sum of money f due to the failure to collect the cou er the community charge in previous years and i think that they are trying by this amendment with some very quick foot work to try and UNK the people of this city
mr mayor councillor says that the labour group is running the council that's UNK not the case
the conservative group is running the council
and the conservative group is running the council in the sense that labour has UNK obviously over the last few days to reduce its tax level to something closer to the tories and i'm going to stand with my fellow liberal democrats tonight and vote for a higher figure because not only because i think that there's sort of things we want to do in our budget are b are b are better and would be better done than not done but because i think there's a fundamental political ethical issue here and it's one which has been UNK this country for a great many years and which is going to be crucial in the next election
the question is do the people of britain believe in paying higher taxes for good services delivered by central and local government
i thought that UNK political UNK in this country were prepared to stand by public services and believe in them sufficiently to say this will cost you and we are prepared to put the bill to you because we believe you will pay the bill
what we have tonight is a labour group that says they no longer believe in that philosophy
what they believe in is that everybody out there is out to grab as much as they can for their own private interest and they're prepared to meet them halfway on that
there's no question who's running the council here it's this lot
reference to i think that last comment is of course a very interesting one
i thought the liberal democrats failed UNK at that the last election
can you say
mr UNK may have all the qualities of leadership except
and i suspect that the next election that will still UNK
but clearly the liberal democrats have not learnt the lesson of spending what you have and running prudent budgets
even president clinton is learning that even as a democrat he had a reputation of UNK responsibility as a government but i must admit i welcomed his present er proposals in that regard
but that doesn't follow for the liberal democrats in this particular council
i don't think their proposals in that regard will be worthy of support
er but councillor other remark about the labour party moving towards the conservatives is of course a very fair one but then surely nothing UNK us at the moment about the labour party
at long last they've come out in favour of wealth isn't that extraordinary reported in today's paper
they're also mr mayor interestingly coming out in favour of the individual but i must admit i applaud that and at long last in some admittedly very modest way er they are moving i won't say to UNK responsibility but at least they're learning the lessons of the UNK of the past of their policies
but what we have to bear in mind of course er the f financial UNK of this council would in a sense have been very easy over the years if the labour party previously had UNK its budget according to what we could all afford
that they did not do and now the leader of the council said well they're trying to get down to the standard spending assessment at last he could have done that a long time ago you have had nothing but excess expenditure proposals on behalf of this city for many years
if we are above government guidelines it is the labour party's fault and if indeed we are UNK in the future it is the labour party's fault none other and to the extent that you run the risk now by having this excess eleven percent budget over the er standing expenditure assessment er will once again unfortunately find you guilty in that regard
what i did find very UNK in his remarks er were basically in respect of some of the savings
again i must say it seems extraordinary doesn't it that er he UNK the savings when really one is entitled to ask the question well why weren't they made before
i really can't think that you can claim those as savings
they're a pulling back of your excess expenditure
they are if you like a UNK of UNK
it can't be anything else formal savings is not on and i think when you small items i was rather UNK by some of them
i think we're going to go as a council in the direction of not answering letters on time
in business that cost is one of the first items you do in efficiency terms
if you delay the answering of letters of course that creates more letters chasing up the first ones and that is again where you are getting your priorities wrong admittedly on a very small items
for the leader of the council to use the excuse in terms of savings about the cost of the burning of the dead
i think most of us have due respect and regard for proper procedure in that regard
one of the most emotional times for anyone
for you to UNK that and say well i'm sorry now we're doing all this we can't guarantee that it's disgraceful absolutely disgraceful
what i actually said was that the price that we would have to charge for UNK the dead had to go up in order to ensure that in of the circumstances our standards could remain UNK
that i regard as unfortunate
i'm very glad you clarified that mr because certainly i not as i heard it er and i'm very pleased that was clarified and i think others would have felt likewise
let me come on let me come on then to a more disgraceful excuse er that er the leader of the council talked about
he talked about the stress on the people we employ
most of us who've been on this council some years will have seen the stress that the labour party brought on a number of senior officers who felt obliged to leave in what i would call UNK circumstances
that was the pressure of the labour party policy and if there is any stress on staff in this council then it is at your responsibility
you are running this council and it up to you to ensure that you do not create employ because if that is what you're UNK to you're
councillor you've had over your time
thank you very much well i've been very pleased to make those points relating to the leader of the council
since there are no further hands rushing up into the air i'll say a few words myself
asking
i think the proposals the labour group's
it's important that we look at the pattern of our spending as a local authority over the past five or six years
but that in some of the comments that have gone before
in those days the government assessed local authority needs according to a very in the grant related expenditure assessment g r e a UNK and this is much more complex and sensitive measure of how much it costs to run a city and in those days what the government thought we should be spending and what we thought we should be spending seemed in fact to be very close indeed
in nineteen eighty seven eighty eight we spent ninety nine point eight percent of what the government thought
in nineteen eighty eight and eighty nine we spent ninety eight point two nine percent and in eighty nine ninety seven point one four percent of what the government thought we need we actually UNK in their terms
this was still a labour council they were still a conservative government but there was a wonderful consensus about the spending needs of local authorities and how local authorities should be funded
that was what one might call a pre poll tax consensus
in nineteen ninety one the s a was introduced as the measure for assessing local authority needs and in that year our spending instead of being one or two percent below what the government thought it shot up to forty nine point nine five percent above the s a figures
what had happened
had labour suddenly become a local authority or did the s a simply fail as an accurate way of assessing our spending needs
the answer i think lies in the fact that the government next year gave this authority an increase in its s a of some thirty two point one percent one of the largest increases in the country
not quite enough perhaps but still enough to be an admission that they got it seriously wrong in the year before
since that point though what has been the pattern of our budgets
have we kicked against the and ignored the determination of central government to UNK their own problems with the p s b i by reducing local authority spending
no from that figure of forty nine point nine five percent above s a in nineteen ninety one we proposed a UNK that had brought reductions year on year in that UNK of view
each and every year there have been reductions
in nineteen ninety one the gap UNK to thirty one percent from almost fifty nine
in ninety two three it UNK further to twenty two percent and this year we're proposing a budget that is only ten point eight percent adverse to the government's figures
we don't believe that the government is correct in their view of what the city needs
but we've not UNK put at risk services or jobs by UNK capping by going in the opposite direction
equally we've tried not to UNK the public or our staff by cutting back to the governments preferred level all at once
our view is that the people of this city value the services the council provides and don't want them withdrawn
ours has been a process of careful UNK year on year
it's not been without pain and i pay tribute to our UNK willingness to UNK the changes that we've had to make
in particular i think it should be recognised that the role of the unions UNK and g m d in helping that process of change has been quite fundamental and for that reason because we appreciate and value the essential way in which the unions have contributed to the process of changing the organisation i consider that the they much UNK proposals from the opposition groups to cut or in the other case to reduce the UNK office are quite UNK
i want to return however to the question of the pattern of taxation in the authority under labour control
it's of course only to be expected that people should UNK about the tax they've got to pay and people always complain that it seems to go up every year
well let me say quite clearly now that is not true
both as a percentage of budget and in real terms accounting for inflation people are being asked to pay less today than they were in nineteen eighty eight
in eighty eight eighty nine the rates business and domestic UNK to eighty one point seven percent of all the council's spending
the government contributed just eighteen point two percent so the bulk of our expenditure was born by local people directly
today we're asking local people to pay only fifty seven percent instead of eight two
but politicians always speak in terms of percentages and real terms so let's look at the total tax which was demanded from people in the city in the past few years
in nineteen ninety one we asked for six point four seven four million in poll tax
in ninety one ninety two five point four
in ninety two three by point six seven and in the budget we propose tonight we've asked for four point five million
no allowing for UNK no underlying trends under the labour proposals people in cambridge will be paying less hard cash now than they did eight years ago
the council is spending UNK and efficiently and it's spending as little hard cash as is compatible with meeting the essential needs of the people who live in the city
i'm told i've got to wind up
i have the discretion to give myself up
but you'll be relieved to know i'm not going
in that case councillor has
can we move to the vote then please on the amendment before us i proposed to take it
as point of order i believe as this is a proposal of an amendment of the city board city board is the city board UNK right of reply
do you wish to exercise your right to reply
very briefly indeed erm i would stand by what i said in my overall speech
i do think that the
erm it doesn't matter what i propose whether it actually makes out things that they've been talking about or whether it's completely found something to criticise about it
that's politics
what we've actually got here is a UNK budget proposal which yes has changed over the last fortnight i make no apologies for that
it also has to UNK to recognition of what the needs of the people of the city are and i actually cast out wipe out services and the needs of central administration which is essential to any council and i would hope that not only my own back this amendment
thank you
can i ask us to move the amendment erm in one a those in favour of that part of the amendment please show one a
what are we voting on

and those against
in three alter the amounts calculated to read as follows i hope that we can take that block in three as one since it all follows from what's gone before
yes we have erm those in favour thank you and those against okay thank you
are there further amendments
thank you councillor
okay councillor can you proceed
does everyone have a copy of this one good er mr mayor erm all budgets are a balance between er spending on database services and spending on capital projects and on keeping taxes down
all three elements have to come in to any budget decision and nobody can ignore all three indeed if you look around three groups of the council you'll see that all the budget proposed tonight will take into account all three areas
conservative budget for example even though its main press is always on keeping the tax level down er will often include capital projects
for example they support the market square project and at the end of the day even with the total budget down to s a the vast bulk of the money being spent by conservative UNK been spent on people salaries but it's still being spent on services and the labour party this year has lost the three elements keeping the tax down and that's quite a good thing to see
though i should say that what councillor said that my group were prepared to set a higher tax level if that were necessary
that's what we said at the general election
by my judgement as the amendment reflects is that it isn't necessary but if it were i would have no hesitation s whatsoever in increasing the level of taxation to pay for what needs to be paid for
it needs to be understood that what UNK the parties isn't so much that one party believes in capital projects on party in revenue spending and one party in keeping the taxation levels down
what UNK them is solely of judgements on the UNK between those three elements
i should say that for us revenue services ordinary database services do come first keeping the tax level does come second and the prestige projects even rather good ones like the market square project definitely come third
it's not to say that we are against capital projects we are not
we have included in our proposal this year twenty thousand revenue effects of a hundred thousand pounds capital bid on traffic calming and other similar measures something which is very popular around the city as long as you ask people what they want first and which in previous years we put forward as a revenue bid
we decided the best way to deal with that question is through a capital bid and that's what we've done
and also of course there is the question of UNK pool although UNK members of the council will notice that UNK pool isn't mentioned in our amendment
that is because fortunately i suppose our UNK scheme we are reliable informed by officers would have no revenue effects in ninety three ninety four
it would have revenue effect of course in ninety four ninety five and our future budget will have to reflect that
but in this year the first year of the project because it will be towards the end of the year anyway it has no revenue net revenue effect
the basic day to day problems that we want to concentrate on and on the challenges it faces
education fund is in there we've not raised the price but that is our top priority and we believe it's societies top priority also in our amendment is our idea for extending UNK bus fares for journeys within the city to those of school age who do not quality for the statutory schemes run by the county
the idea there is to try to get some reduction some reduction in the level of traffic at peak hours and to help public transport
and of course in a scheme like that many details have to be worked out especially in negotiations with the bus company for the figure we have put in is i think a realistic figure for the first year of the scheme
we also want to bring about improvements in some well appreciated services
services the council provides which we think could benefit from extra resources
the example of this of course is the night time call out service which all parties support which comes every year as a problem of funding do we want a full week service
and we do the question is can we afford it and we think we can
these services of course have to be paid for and we do aim to keep the level of taxation as low as possible but of course we can't aim to bring it down as far as conservatives would want because we need we in the city need to spend money on things like the education fund without which it becomes a city less worth living in
but we are looking f for savings to make greater UNK and we think we've found some
i'm gonna start with the support for trade unions small item twenty six thousand pounds to the UNK project there's a g m b budget but that's all nearly all paid for out of direct services we don't want to touch that
this county pays for a full time union official this is UNK one full timer for five hundred members that is way over the top let me tell you
i'll give you one example the union of communication workers for the post office has one full time worker one full time officer for two to three thousand
so we propose to cut that support by half in this year and to keep it under review for future years as well
because we want to see a review of the whole system of union representation within the council to see whether it's an appropriate sort of representation for an organisation of this size
we are not against unions we are for unions can be very useful not only for their members but also for the management we recognise that
the amount of money put in by the public
i would say to you you've already spent seven minutes of your time erm now
allow you seven minutes in initially also and so
it's the UNK gate group
the tape recorder is now running i hope that it's going to be recording but let us not erm be inhibited as a result of that
erm programmes erm haven't got a programme
no
erm i haven't got a programme
thank you
you haven't got a programme the very last one
wh what how very carefully calculated that was
erm we are today going to do the black sheep of the family erm because erm doesn't feel that he he's up to doing the one that he thought he would do this week
that will be UNK probably for a fortnight
can i remind you erm looking at that programme that erm healthy eating now appears on i think it's the sixteenth of march and sadly i shall be here on the sixteenth of march
i shall be in leicester at any rate and i may very well come and join you to talk with you about healthy eating
i was hoping to miss that one because you might be trying to persuade me that i should erm UNK rather more of UNK food than of the UNK food that i do eat
er it is
yes it is it is a project study and therefore it would be as well if we were all thinking about it in advance
it is in tha the hand book
er it's on page a hundred and thirteen
and the idea is that as we've done with previous erm discussions if each one could come along armed with some information to do with healthy eating erm there's a list on page a hundred and seventeen that might start you off thinking
erm UNK low fat dairy products incidents of heart disease for those who have an UNK oil rich diet
i don't UNK oil that's the trouble
no
UNK acid can be helpful to pregnant women
well that certainly doesn't apply to me
no
no
twenty two UNK full of sugar every day
well considering i have none somebody's having an awful lot
er and eating will be always one of and so on there's a few items there that you might like to concentrate on and perhaps as much as anything if you have your minds open in the intervening number of weeks
if you see an article a UNK er a comment from a newspaper from a magazine
cut it out and bring it along and i think it will all add to our discussion of healthy eating
i will try and remind you about that er on other occasions so that it doesn't er slip into the UNK
er and the other thing just to comment on the programme
i hope that we shall have the deputy lord mayor er bob on the last wednesday of our session
the reason the UNK taken so long was to find a time when he's available
that wednesday is in the school holiday although we shall be continuing
it means that he can slip out of school er in the afternoon when normally in nor on a normal school day he would not be able to do that
erm so i'm hoping that will work it's down in the diary for him to do that and i've given a little note about what the adult school is all about
and i'll write to him to confirm and er if i do bump into him i shall UNK memory of that one
erm with the change of programme then the black sheep of the of the family
er which i have already found
it is on page a hundred and thirty nine for those of you who wish to er follow
it starts off with
UNK black sheep have you any wool
how does the black sheep of the nursery UNK appear to children
other sheep they see are unlikely to be black so a black sheep is different
they soon learn that anyone referred to as a black sheep is not only different but is regarded as being in disgrace
this is all politically incorrect
yes it is indeed
i was thinking about that
isn't it nowadays
wh wha what shall we do if they were saying a black sheep
erm
a green one
erm a green
yes
i don't think you can even say non white can you nowadays
yes
a UNK
a UNK sheep
a UNK
a UNK sheep
yeah
well per yes that's er yes
a UNK sheep
so i do i don't know
is a UNK sheep is black is it
yeah it's black
you know
mm
no they're dark brown
a UNK a UNK yes a da a dark co a dark coloured
like chocolate
yes dark coloured
mm
mm
can't fit the notes in for that
he hear we go again and ev even things we can't say sheep
well i mean isn't it got it's sexist UNK or it is
erm you mean to say sheep as opposed to UNK or
oh come off it
someone was saying on television
one said one of those er petrol weekend things about all the black things and they were saying you know the black a black mood
somebody's in a black mood they ob were UNK to that
yes yeah
life's a bit short for all that isn't it
isn't it about time this silly nonsense was laughed out of court and have done with it
yes
yes quite
i think we should forget these
yes
i think it's absolutely right
so erm instead of black and we shall we shall continue to say
yes
black sheep they are and black they are so they are black sheep
in this dictionary of phrase and UNK
UNK black sheep with bet UNK the UNK in the flock a disgrace something UNK
sheep used to be of great importance to the british economy
black sheep was often UNK by UNK and their wool was less valuable
nevertheless even black sheep were used for export
okay that's the bit of erm sheep background
the nursery UNK then comes from tommy UNK pretty song book from around seventeen forty four and the division of bags one for the master one for the UNK one for the little boy who where wherever he is lives down the lane is said to refer to the export tax on wool which was imposed as far back as twelve seventy five making even the UNK sheep of value
so black sheep are different
the term is used UNK but the black sheep of the family maybe an attractive person someone with a UNK with a courage to be different with a courage to UNK the norm
everyone is says can think of black sheep of their UNK
every can you think of a black sheep of your UNK do you do you
no i don't whether i can
not UNK
perhaps i've perhaps i've perhaps i've mixed in a very sheltered society
perhaps family history perhaps but not the very
yes
no
i don't think er and of course er again perhaps the idea of a black sheep has changed over the years
erm circumstances which made someone perhaps fifty years ago considered to be the black sheep of the family wouldn't necessarily be the same now
no
mm
erm UNK
i don't think i had anybody in my family who was a UNK
but there was somebody in the street where i lived who was a UNK and he was considered to be the black sheep of the family didn't quite fit in when everybody else did
yeah
yeah
nowadays you know erm don't know whether that sort of thing
enterprise culture
en enterprise culture yes indeed
yes
er i mean in the UNK days they used they usually the sent to the UNK or sent into the army or into religion weren't they
mm
mm
mm
also we are a much more UNK society generally
yeah
yeah
we can UNK people who are a bit different nowadays which they couldn't
yeah
couldn't in those days
yes
yes
yeah
i think they use the phrase now do their own thing
that yeah
mm
mm
mm
yes yeah
so we now have erm reference to the bible and the erm UNK son
the UNK son was a black sheep to his father and to his older brother
but how different were the reactions of the two
his UNK started off quite normally as i'm sure you'll remember from the erm from the parable
every child must break away from the parental fold and establish his own personal identity
things began to go wrong when he got into bad company
he had then asked for his share of his inheritance
he wanted it then and there not later
with money in his possession was he a pray to the unscrupulous
i'm sure he was
he had UNK into a far country
that showed initiative
but did it cut him off from the guidance he needed
the story relates that he spent all
he was not prudent enough to have saved so he began to be in want
having came to the he was hungry so he was glad to be h hired by a local farmer as a UNK
even the UNK he was giving to the pigs he would have liked to have eaten himself
he decided to go home and offer to be a servant instead of a son
but his father was UNK to see him and at once threw a party
his elder brother coming home from the fields and hearing dancing UNK what was going on
when he heard the explanation and that even the best calf had been killed the UNK calf had been killed to help the party he was UNK
and that is understandable
at this point we are then asked to consider does the elder brother become the family black sheep is there a sort of change of position
i don't know what
i wouldn't think so
no
a brother
the story makes its point to the finish
mm
mm
so th they yo you couldn't see a situation where the person who er was previously in disgrace was no longer in disgrace and the one the brother then showing UNK was himself in disgrace
sounds like fiction
sounds like fiction
no it's just the father's attitude that changed not the way that
mm
mm
well he was UNK he was only UNK because he was hungry
yes yeah
can you stop being a black sheep then did he stop being a black sheep when he came back
was that the end of the story as trevor was saying
well he certainly gave the father the opportunity to say i told you so
mm
mm
done yeah
mm
or he could say i was one
i was one of the black sheep but i'm no longer
i'm no longer yes
the next the next question is UNK another powerful UNK of family black sheep
i'm not quite sure what that means
is UNK another power UNK of family black sheep
it is UNK that pushes people into being black sheep into er doing something which is not acceptable
yes i think it can part of it
mm
mm
you know one sees rightly or wrongly that the other one is having UNK treatment
yeah
and getting attention seeking
it could well have been the UNK of the older brother what caused him to be thought of as a black sheep
black sheep yes yeah so UNK is quite powerful could be the driving force between sons yes
sons
in those days when there's land expected
yeah
this by the way erm it is applied with this study and that is during the thirties particularly on the well it actually carried on into the forties but the there was a almost a character in many plays where one character was in effect the family black sheep
erm there was in UNK end erm there was another character in erm there was a further one in
oh yes
yeah
now all these were black sheep they were the UNK of the lot and there was no they were the ones you turned to if you wanted to discuss your troubles
not the other respectable brigade and indeed in UNK end the whole play turns on the UNK of the sister who remained at home
mm
the family black sheep the other sister went er left home to go on the stage
but of course when she came back all sorts of things began to happen that's by the way
one other little point in UNK there's a character who never appears she's always spoken about and UNK and that is the man who UNK and she says talking to UNK julie was no better than she should have been
you know she says in every catholic family er there is always a UNK person and it's usually the UNK
UNK
mm
so even UNK told this story
yes
yes yeah
so a again the idea of perception comes into it doesn't it
it's the way
yes
erm the person is perceived and the perception may not be accurate
it that it may be influences er at work there
erm the suggestion was then that the two young men and the parable of the UNK of son started off as UNK but in turn they became UNK in some way
erm and the final short paragraph of that section refers to the parable of the lost sheep er not necessarily of black in colour but UNK in behaviour UNK a black sheep
i'll leave you to look up that one and erm and read if you want to do
a section then on branwell bronte
a short life you erm you perhaps will be able to contribute from your knowledge of erm bronte particularly of branwell bronte
branwell patrick bronte dates eighteen seventeen to eighteen forty eight
was the only son in a family of six
from mrs UNK life of charlotte bronte and from barbara and UNK lloyd evans UNK to the UNK
it seems clear that branwell had so much potential he might have been as successful as his sisters
what went wrong then
his sisters also had to bear tragedy
branwell was only four when his mother died
before he was nine two of his sisters elizabeth and UNK had also died
how difficult for an UNK and a sensitive child
he was loved and looked up to by his sisters and aunt and his father UNK spent time energy and money on him
eventually his sisters especially charlotte lost patience with him
but when he died the family was UNK by his loss and his UNK talent
he painted he wrote poetry and stores but he UNK discipline and become an UNK
charlotte letters showed how bored she was by her limited home environment
was UNK part of UNK trouble too
it was branwell who suggested that the UNK should publish its own magazine but after the third issue it was charlotte who took over the leadership from him
in the short period when charlotte was away at school that's january eighteen thirty one to may eighteen thirty two he was writing well
essentially a creative person he was UNK and became self destructive
as an artist branwell went to london to seek admission to the royal UNK schools but he lost heart as soon as he arrived and never even began
he became more and more depressed and sought UNK in the local pub where he was soon well known as a UNK character
encouraged by his father and several friends branwell acquired an UNK studio in bradford where at first he made an effort and UNK influential friends
but sad to say talking and drinking got the better of him and his work deteriorated
twice he became a tutor but he UNK his work
in one case he had an affair with the UNK of the house which led to his dismissal
he had a period as a railway clerk at bridge but was dismissed because of a deficit of eleven pounds
as barbara and UNK lloyd evans say it's impossible to know how the money disappeared
UNK
did branwell grow up
he promised to much
he was his own worst enemy
like the UNK son he wasted his substance in UNK living
er it's a bit of back background then about branwell
you know anything about branwell
isn't it
mhm
erm that his father didn't make him go to school
mm
er there's a suggestion that he had mild UNK and they tried to keep it quite and his father UNK him at home
so he didn't have a normal life a boy of his circumstances in those days
would have yes
it was more lonely there weren't other boys around him
mm
mm
there weren't other people around him except his family
yeah so
didn't help an UNK character
that may have contributed yes
yeah
any other
plus the rather powerful father figure
mm
mm
yes
which tend to
yes i think in cer in most cases that would happen wouldn't it if the child starts off with a feeling of UNK with possible instability
mm
then a powerful father is going to make the situation worse
because him being the only son
mm
he was probably spoilt by his sisters and got more or less what he wanted as a child and
as a child
carried on you know what i want i get
mm
in UNK
what is this thirty how old was he thirty one when he died
thirty one
oh yes
thirty one very young age for someone apparently so UNK to die
think there were drugs as well as the drink
oh well that
yes yeah
not mentioned there but UNK
that is that is true
okay the next thing erm accurate or not trevor and i have already sa erm talked about this erm many an adult school members will remember the enthusiasm and UNK that surrounded the future edward the eighth when he was prince of wales
prince of wales it is suggested erm was a black sheep of the family
here it was thought was a man who understood the people and for them
someone with a genuine concern for the wounded of world war one the miners of south wales the unemployed for and homeless in general
in slightly less than a year citizens high expectations had been UNK and it was all over
as john UNK put it in the king of UNK he had it all wealth UNK good looks and he threw it all away on an american UNK who even his closest UNK considered an UNK
on the UNK of his UNK connections
on the UNK of his get rich quick schemes which involved him with UNK
why
this much travelled man with all of his promise was at best a controversial figure and at worst a family black sheep
he could have said with UNK the time is out of joint and UNK that ever i was born to set it right
edward known as david to his family did not want the role of UNK but then neither did his brother UNK
many would say that as george the sixth he succeeded where edward had failed
george had discipline
a sense of duty a loyal wife and children
affection bringing with it devoted support brought success from a role undertaken UNK
edward said he could not fulfil the role without the support of the woman he loved
some family black sheep are making a bid for affection
edward had the attention of the whole world but without adequate personal affection it was of no UNK
on december the eighth nineteen thirty six time of the ab UNK the times published a UNK quotation from a hopeless UNK king UNK to men below to god's above a sad example of the UNK of life
what is your view of the way edward was treated after his UNK
and none of us UNK to being alive when all this happened we that goes without saying
absolutely
i did see him as a six year old child
so yes as a
visited our town our town
he was a six year old child
erm i was a six year
yes yeah
so wh what do you think of the attitude that was displayed towards him after the UNK
he was very UNK treated
far too UNK
i mean he could five hundred thousand pound on a christmas present to his bride
my god
mm
he was more or less paid to go away and keep his head down wasn't he
yeah
no matter what the cost
most of the UNK
now it's all over attitude push it all away
yeah
all the here a lot of the UNK jewellery never got found
no
no
after he had gone
it was the er either they er
yes i think they off
say something
mm
so he was he was paid off in er in a way
yeah
yeah
allowed to
yeah they had to
go away and keep quiet and
yeah yes
it all
of course the erm the interesting thing is that he wasn't the black sheep of the family
no
no
without going into the question of the character whose characters have always been brothers
mm
at all he was the one in the family who was locked up chuck
i know
even when the UNK al almost the night before he er he went abroad
erm his UNK said this is the man we're going to loose
he's the best of the lot i mean it may not be saying a lot
mm
but he was the best of the bunch
mm
you know from purely from er that point of view
but the suggestion is that he was the black sheep because he gave up the UNK for a woman
and that changes him almost overnight from being the UNK of the masses to being the black sheep of the family
just to just to
at all no sense of dedication because the job which he knew was going to be his before he met the this UNK
mm
mm
mm
must have guessed what a burden it was
he was a complete wasn't he
yeah
yeah
a burden to his brother
yes
he must have been aware of that
but she was under his er he was under her influence she was a UNK woman and erm she was a stronger character than he was and she thought she could erm get away with it and she didn't
she thought she thought she be queen UNK
yeah
yeah
that's right
yeah
the best that could be said
queen mary she stood no chance
the best that could be for the UNK woman is that at least when they had married she stuck to him right to his death
yeah
mm
yeah i think she made him very happy
well you wouldn't think so to look at the photographs would you
well i know i know
they went around the world UNK on friends
yes
i don't now how ever long it was
and i think i mean you know he'd enormous UNK the famous photograph with the welsh miners something must be done
well in fact what did he do
i mean he the next prince of wales the present one whatever one thinks of him and perhaps whatever one thinks of his alleged UNK and so on and so forth he's done a terrific lot of achievement in interest in the arts
yeah
managing er erm his estates
he has done a lot
mm
mm
performance
whether or not he makes a good king we shall have wait and see
well at least his backed up his ideas with practical solutions
he has he has
yeah
yeah
i think he would make a good king
i think he would make a most splendid king but i mean that's not what we're here really discussing
but he has to be careful not to be the black sheep of the family
mm
mm
mm
yes
i'm a bit
i got i got i got a number to choose from certainly yes
oh well this has always been the case hasn't it
i mean it's only because the press and the media generally know all about it
there's so much
in the past that's been given just about every one of them i mean
mm
i think in that position would be very easy to stray from the straight and narrow
yes
mm
i can imagine it would be because perhaps erm the higher you are not only is it more easy to fall but it's more easy to be tempted
UNK are there
mm
yeah
mm
well in these days but i mean years and years ago i mean you people didn't know what half of that's going on because there wasn't the media coverage any way
mm
did the what
in what sense
in any sense i mean we'd may not know the true but we know something goes on don't we
well i mean it it's nothing to the stories that were circulating in the late victorian period about the duke of
mm
oh yeah
who physically the present prince of wales UNK
but it didn't sort of the world wide coverage that er
th yes there is there is an UNK about
yes
erm press coverage today that there wasn't years ago
yes all over the world
yes oh yes
so if he UNK his nose in australia we know about it today
yes
whereas years ago it would have taken some time for that come by which time it was no longer news and people UNK their shoulders and say well
but that surely is a very interesting thought about this and until the er bishop of bradford UNK his famous sermon and all the thing blew up people in this country had never heard of er mrs UNK
mrs UNK
no
they'd been abroad i believe hadn't they
how on earth did the press even them though when people were coming
i know
i mean my mother of often said she the first she'd saw about it was when almost on the UNK
mm
yeah
yeah
th the bill board said
they kept it very quiet
the mrs UNK she thought who was mrs UNK
how on earth did they keep
keep it quiet
they might have UNK the press
well they had the press weren't like they are today
so wh what yo you think barbara that it was because the press were more UNK
yeah
that the press th the members of the press
yeah
gentlemen themselves
authority
yeah
i th i think that you didn't have them photo
well
it's like everybody else
you know that
so th there was there was there was a certain amount there was a certain amount of self interest that the erm
the people of the press thought there could be something in it for them if they if they kept quiet
what about fear
was there more fear wa was it more likely that the press would fear UNK on them in some way if they were to break UNK
yes we don't what
yeah
yeah
i thought that could be it
yes
perhaps it would blow over
you know nine day wonder
mm
mm
well i think they were hoping UNK they
no i think they thought it would be a nine day wonder it would just go away
i think the archbishop of canterbury was hoping it would
well let's face it i mean he had several other ladies didn't he
he jumped from lady UNK bed to straight into UNK didn't he
yeah
because i remember reading her book
lady UNK
mm
erm and sh she was at the party when he and she was going away that was it and she said to UNK will you look after david for me
yeah
yeah
which she did
very well
and
yeah her eye on david
well it's
could i just say that er
what right that's a point from UNK please
er at this time i used to keep scrap books of the royal family for years i did
still have them
erm you have i haven't and erm there was a photograph that i cut out of the paper sometime before he UNK over the prince of wales at the races with mrs UNK
mm
mm
now nothing was said about it
nothing was said
wh how long how before was that
oh it was it you know a while before i mean you
mm
twice i think that's what people couldn't swallow i mean
when she was
mm
yes
yes
that was the main thing
but there was no there was no question of who is this woman that
no
no
but then i mean it was quite common that the prince of wales had got several ladies
oh loads
yeah
i mean the first prince of wales is round
right
no well there's some little village near erm
yeah ain't there
where there's a hunting lodge
oh they had one in the in the
yeah he used he used to visit that a lot
yeah
well he met he her didn't he
sorry
lady
so that the
oh possibly
yeah
er trevor
er there is this curious erm not quite sure what the right word is for it
but people both like the royal family do be er UNK of UNK and at the same time setting the highest standards
mm
er that they've either got to well they've preferably got to be bought rather than just
yeah yes it
oh well oh they always have plenty of women or but his private life
now what you know his private life was above UNK and somehow or other people can accept both and happy to do it's about any public figure
it is yes i was i was going to raise that point it is not it's not it's not just the UNK
no oh no
erm it is people in public life
yes
erm who are who UNK er a very difficult tight rope because they fall one way and it's acceptable they fall the same way the next day and it's not acceptable
i believe it's true but when there was UNK about mr UNK er contact with was it the UNK
UNK
he's UNK went up no end
yes
but
normal
yes he yes
erm
and at that time the only paper scandal was research was the news of the world
mm
yes
you always news of the world
if you want to make the naked truth UNK ask tomorrow for the news of the world
what
naked i suppose
yes yeah
yeah
so do
sorry go on yeah
before we go on to something else
what happened to his offspring
any tell me anybody what h happened to
i mean were they looked after or
yes
i don't know
does he have any
did he have any
knowing what you just say
UNK
he just he might have done in his younger days
UNK for the for the benefit of the tape it's not very good one at a time please
yeah
it used to be said there are a lot of very UNK very UNK farmers round in UNK
mm
mm
well she
none of their farmers have a
erm er generally people in that position and it was a weakness of UNK
or rather UNK weakness was for married women
mhm
and you look at the recent king's UNK edward the eighth and er sorry edward the seventh
seventh yeah
but they were all and it was on the safe side whatever happened
but this was a this was a priority he wouldn't have they wouldn't bothered anyone unless they got a husband in the background somewhere
this was for safety
but mind you according to some people it was virtually impossible for him to UNK any UNK but still
yeah
this also be circulated
could be could be
mm
mm
so there we
yeah whe whether or not we consider him to have been a black sheep then we certainly have erm rather gone into his character
who this ch
who this ch
yes erm had er thing to say about his character without really being erm UNK about his brothers
which was suggestion er or about later members of the royal family the present prince of wales
do think this is probably why wh he went to the front in the first world war what was it the prime minister shouted out don't mind you being killed but i don't want you being taken prisoner he co he couldn't you know hadn't got enough courage to hold out
mm i don't know
no
i i've always assumed that meant that it would be such a tremendous lever for the enemy to hold someone like that
yeah
yeah i mean wh what would you do
i mean
erm we have the king erm
yes
we have i don't know
er i've got your point
mm
and what we could do anything we like to him unless you give up
up the wall
up the wall
i've always assumed that was it that erm i don't know
yes i would have
no thought that was it yeah
we have erm one more paragraph and a few questions to discuss and time what is it it's about ten past now is it according to your
yeah
more correct watches yes
one minute to three according to mine
getting later and later all the time
the socially under privileged
erm i don't know whether you claim to belong to the socially under privileged
yeah
the observer in nineteen ninety three referring to UNK leeds made the point that improved housing is no compensation for the destruction of a community without which UNK are created
UNK car thefts burglary UNK many of them done by children and young people have apparently become common place in UNK
complaints bring UNK crude UNK from the UNK
are some of the UNK children who've been excluded from school
what a dilemma for teachers with children who are out of parental control and UNK in school
in school they will UNK students and staff UNK
out of school they will be UNK and UNK finds work for idle hands
can individuals and the community serve without spiritual values what about that as a starter before we look at the other questions then
can individuals and the community survive i said serve my apologies
can individuals in the community survive without spiritual values
i would say no
mhm
so would i
i would say
well it's harder without values when
well yeah
you need the element of UNK there i don't know
well no
right okay so
UNK perhaps
yeah so we
yes the there have to there have to be values
yeah
human values
human values
yeah
there have to be values they have to be human values
erm spiritual you think erm that th they have to be spiritual values
well spiritual values or human values
mm
mm
i see that as much the same
much the same yes yeah
an ethical framework
yeah
yes
so there has there has to be an ethical framework
an ethical framework
but it's all very well saying there has to be a framework there have to be values
how do you get people to accept those values and to live within that framework
i'm afraid they've got to be
mm
but if they're completely UNK
mm
mm
they won't accept the value because they'll reject
mm
i think that people have got to turn in the other direction and really want to be because i see in schools there are
mm
and really it starts with the family and the family
yes
that's right it does
what and then you start with the women
well not just women men as well but mothers are the first teachers of the young
mm
mm
so UNK so family values are terribly important and they begin in the home where they best taught in the first place by the mother but obviously by the family
yes
and the school has a part to play
yes
mm yeah
oh yes i'm m as i say i can understand all this but i am not sure how you can persuade people who don't somehow share your opinion with values ethical values human values er to live within that society and to obey the rules that you would like to set when they really don't observe those rules
there is a certain UNK
yes
among people nowadays
you can't
germany from nineteen thirty three to nineteen forty five
what happened in germany wh wha
people did as they were told
people did as they were told
if they want to create that sort of society
yes
mm
if they're not being desirable one by our standards but a society can be made to work if there's enough pressure put on it
mm
they're not erm conscious i suspect
people won't do anything they're told if you get them like this secret police and a few other little UNK
it worked in russia
and UNK
when they're not
UNK you know
this is an awkward question
mm
yes
suggesting that spiritual values are the only solution
mm
mm
they are not
no i don't no
there are moral pressures that can be er applied because nothing much to do with our sort of morality
but then you th the end is er a society in which we could all live erm on reasonable terms with each other at peace with each other
er the means to that end are justified by the end even so
so if you
well you won't
yes
but it's okay it is possible for these moral values to be UNK in people by the exercise of force by fear er or it is possible by an understanding an acceptance of spiritual moral ethical values
er are those the only two ways in which it could be achieved
have we got to choose one or the other
i think time will come when we will have to
mm
because the erm situation will become so bad and i think people might turn the other way when it comes to a state where they have to be
mm
perhaps
surviving in a moral sense rather than a physical sense
well i suppose a physical sense as well because if they can't see how it can continue
mm
because the situation is getting worse every day
i mean you can look back like just over a few years
mm
and see the er UNK has set in more and more and more
it's growing in a mental
and in order to put a stop to it there has got to be a UNK of a belief in values whatever those values may be
back to basics
i think yeah
back to basics
i think people have got to start
mm
well it's more respect for other people in this world i mean at the moment there's nothing
yeah that's right yes
mm
i think probably the two alternatives that and have both put forward
yeah
you know either one way or the other
something's got to happen
they're all
either through fear or through
i think something can happen that i mean really terrible that could put the fear into people and then maybe that would sort of turn people in view of it
some mm
gonna take a long time though isn't it
i mean they're so UNK these days
well if you think something like aids it comes in you know where a lot of people die disease you could always important
doesn't seem to have stopped them does it
no it didn't
no never stop them
i don't know why
but cer
any rate UNK as well isn't it
cer certainly aids is the is the sort of erm fear th that the UNK that creates the fear that might be sufficient to stop peoples
that's right yeah
i mean it might be something else
mm
might not be aids but erm
yes i think of UNK in the first century
yes i was thinking
yes
yeah
going to be a very small going to be a very small part
yes
i don't that's got a lot to do really
i mean aids is a very small part of the death toll
yeah
take cancer
it is it is yes is it is at the present time but it is it is growing
yeah
yeah
it is growing
that's the with aids
