takes over blackburn push it wide at last has found some space but comes across to try and close him down support just behind from it's a UNK cross from and it's easily cleared by shrewsbury town right up to the centre circle where it's taken on the chest of UNK
squares the ball to his left and alan the left back just pushes it out wide to that far side but he loses out competing successfully he's got going forward if he can find him and gets it and lays it off to and can now run at UNK once more
he's wide on the right holding it up looking for support two in the middle looks for goes for it can't quite get the contact he would have wanted and it runs back to in what must be a very UNK blackburn penalty area at the moment
great run again by UNK did ever so well came inside knocked a good ball into unfortunately he just couldn't get hold of it and the goalkeeper came out and collected it
a good move again by shrewsbury
now blackburn pushing forward sets away inside the penalty area but who's been so convincing in the shrewsbury goal tonight and made some important contributions makes another one there so alert racing off the line to get there before could get a UNK
shrewsbury have got to make sure as much as possible when they do win the ball in the they don't just smash long balls up because as l as soon as they do that and as long as they keep doing that blackburn just pick up the ball again and keep coming at them they've got to try like they did just a few minutes ago try and play themselves out of defence with nice low passes
UNK action and drama here at
shrewsbury three blackburn two
they've had some important and UNK cup UNK here in their time have shrewsbury town but none can have been as dramatic as this match whatever the final result turns out to be
at the moment they're leading by three goals to two as now plays it away to this right hand side to stewart makes a charge forward he's taking on chris he's getting to the right edge of the penalty area he crosses low with his right boot chance for in the area he turned quickly on it but he UNK the t the shot over the top of the bar
looked very dangerous there he got at his left full back er the sad thing from UNK point of view is that he keeps getting down that right wing and he keeps getting crosses in
they've got to try and stop that somehow or other
sixty four minutes of the match gone and goals from kevin a steve penalty and a header from tommy make it shrewsbury town two blackburn rovers three
and this after blackburn had taken the lead in the first half with a goal from mike who's since reduced the arrears to three two with a second goal from the penalty spot
but now it's at the left edge of the area
gets it across controls with his right foot strikes with his left and it UNK back off a defender and gets it away
headed back up by to hook ball looking for gets his head underneath and it's just over the top of the bar he got the full force of his head beneath that ball and it UNK up and over the top of er an anxious looking paul UNK
you wouldn't know what a great block that was by tommy
he that boy has got a heart as big as a mountain i'll tell ya in those situations he will sling himself at anything
he did that there and he blocked what looked like to me a certain goal
twenty eight years of age tommy made just a handful of UNK for UNK before coming here to shrewsbury town and he's made important contributions at both ends tonight because his could be the goal that takes shrewsbury past blackburn and to a UNK tie against tottenham
but what have we here as plays the ball across it comes back off and out to the left hand side where the urgency from the crowd is for to get rid of it
and he does so and he finds and squares the ball to his right alan made an advance for it but it's was there first put ball forward looking for and it's just beyond the fair UNK and races away to pick it up
what a shame just UNK again out on the right hand side dean made a great UNK run in behind the full back and the ball was just a little bit heavy otherwise there could've been real danger again for blackburn
now let's keep reminding you about the time situation sixty five minutes gone shrewsbury have another twenty five minutes in which to hang on here it's shrewsbury three blackburn rovers two it's gonna be a nervous evening here for the normally UNK shropshire folk at as that ball is headed forward by and here's again in field to UNK forward for mike here comes UNK towards the edge of the penalty area he's gotta try and get past the brick wall of and it's now who tries to release down the right hand side he's gotta get past he does so he gets the ball across and that one is cleared importantly by only as far as who tries to hook it back in and that the ball wouldn't reach him and it wouldn't reach either and it's gone out for a goal kick to shrewsbury
has become an increasingly dangerous on this right hand side i have said just now they must try and stop this coming in because he is getting some magnificent balls in to the penalty area and sooner or later they're gonna concede a goal
shrewsbury fans hoping that won't do what they hope he will do for england against UNK next week if he's picked of course
it's a throw in to david of blackburn down the right hand side that one's headed on by stewart the clearance from is picked up by david who UNK in there ahead of and now here's once more down the inside left channel pushing it up towards the edge of the penalty area where holds it up well they're working well at the moment down that left hand side as gets it across a UNK header comes in and it's pushed behind by chris for a corner kick and we're at the UNK point of the second half with shrewsbury leading three two alan will describe it for you
i couldn't find the microphone here
oh well with a corner for blackburn three two down played to the near post heads it on headed away and out of the penalty area UNK clear by mark towards the halfway line but shrewsbury had everyone defending so it's the red and black UNK shirts of rovers who have the ball again
down the right UNK the defender with takes him on the outside pulls the cross back but he under headed it's still frank with a cross over 's head still inside the danger area shoots and it's saved by
it's some game it really is
ah and it really is it looks like being a very long twenty odd minutes to for shrewsbury town they're really getting at 'em now blackburn they're having all the play and
over these erm past couple of weeks we've been looking at er some of the questions in the new testament we thought a couple of weeks back of the question that jesus asked his disciples do you think i'm able to do this and then last week we looked at a question that the disciples put to jesus that time when they came down from the mountain and they found the re three of them came down with jesus from the mountain of UNK and they found the other disciples with a man who and a whose son was UNK and er they had been unable to help him and the man or brings his son to jesus and jesus UNK him and afterwards the disciples who had been so UNK put the question to jesus why could we not cast out this UNK and this morning i'd like us to look at another question we've got another one today and one god willing next week er and the question is found in luke chapter thirteen let me just read a few verses because of course it's not just the questions it's the answers that are important as well in luke chapter thirteen gonna read from verse twenty two it says in jesus was passing through from one city and village to another teaching and proceeding on his way to jerusalem now that gives us a clue in that because jesus only ever went to jerusalem apart from when he was a boy he only ever went to jerusalem once and that after since that time and that was when he was crucified so jesus was now on his way to jerusalem it was the latter days the latter weeks of the life of jesus he was making his way now to jerusalem and someone said to him lord are there just a few who are being saved and jesus said to hi to them UNK to enter by the narrow door for many i tell you will seek to enter and will not be able once the head of the house gets up and UNK the door and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door saying lord open to us then he will answer and say to you i do not know where you are from then you will begin to say we ate and UNK in your presence and you taught in our streets and he will say i tell you i do not know where you are from depart from me all you evil UNK there will be UNK and UNK of teeth there when you see abraham and UNK and UNK and all the profits in the kingdom of god but yourselves being cast out and they will come from east and west and from north and south and will UNK at the table in the kingdom of god and behold some ar some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last so it's just that question then let's remind ourselves that is put to jesus lord are there just a few who are being saved
now this particular question this it's a very solemn and searching question it belongs to a group of three questions found in the new testament which have to do with a matter of salvation the first one is we won't look up the reference and that for time this morning the first one is the question that the disciples put to jesus who then can be saved that's in matthew chapter nineteen then there's this one in luke thirteen are there few that be saved and then that very personal question that was put not to jesus but to paul by the UNK in act sixteen what must i do to be saved three questions in the new UNK about salvation who then can be saved are there few that be saved what must i do to be saved you know as christians you possibly found yourself asking yourself the same question that these people put to jesus why are there so few christians look about our own town think of your own neighbourhood your own street think of the place where you work how few there are who are followers of jesus christ how few there are who have committed themselves to jesus christ to of receive him as their saviour who've have accepted him as saviour how few there are when you compare it er to all the others who are rejecting him and er who are living their life regardless how true it is that the great majority of people seem in this present day to have little time for god or for the things of god they've got time for all sorts of other things but god and his claim on their life is UNK out how many there are like that how few there are who have submitted to jesus christ and have received him as their saviour or so it seems
and our lord in the words that we've read gives a very solemn answer to that question in the in those words that we read a few moments ago and his immediate answer to the question you know are there few that be saved was to say many this was in the following verse many shall not be able to be saved now does that mean that only a few will be saved that there's only a few people who are gonna be in heaven that jesus christ came and died on the cross for about a handful of people a small percentage does that what it is that what it means well lets look and see what the bible has to say in matthew chapter seven in verse thirteen and verse fourteen this is what jesus says enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and many of those who enter by it for the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life but few of those who find it any way in the same book in matthew in chapter twenty two and in verse fourteen listen again to what it says there jesus is speaking he says for many a called but few are chosen
but when we've read those we've got to look up what else jesus said remember a few months ago the passage we read from luke thirteen and they will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south and will UNK at the table in the kingdom of god they will come he says from all directions we work and hold and these two UNK intention we've gotta compare one with the other then we'll read also john in that tremendous vision in the book of revelation he would he says what he saw there in chapter seven verse nine after these things i looked and behold a great multitude which no one could count from every nation and all UNK and peoples and tongues standing before the UNK and before the lamb UNK in white UNK and palm branches were in their hands and they cried out with a loud voice saying salvation to our god who sits on the UNK and to the lamb a handful of people tiny minority john says it was a great number a multitude which no one could count from every nation from every ethnic group from every UNK and race on the face of the earth there in god's heaven how grateful you and i should be if we are among that number it's god's grace it's not that we've deserved it it's not that we have been privileged by some genetic er process to have been born in a so called a UNK christian country it is all of god's grace it's not what we have done or what we are but we have been saved by his grace and just for a few moments this morning i'd like us to from this question that was put to jesus to follow on and if you like get five UNK from it sounds complicated but it's not
few there be are there few that be saved well what does the bible say about this first of all it teaches UNK clearly that all may be saved god is not partial god has no UNK he doesn't love you more than he loves any body else he doesn't love me more than he loves you or you more than me he doesn't love you more than he loves ah any other racial group or any other ethnic group he loves us all the same god so loved the world that he gave his only son jesus christ here in his love not that we love god says the apostle but that he loved us the old testament profit reminds us that he has loved us with an ever lasting love who this was one of the hang ups that the jewish nation had they thought that they were the cats UNK he chose them but he in fact didn't love them any more than he loved the UNK the UNK the UNK and all the other UNK he loved them all the same god is not partial in his love because he is love if there was any body that god did not love he would actually cease to be god because love is not something that god does you and i do it no matter how loving you are or how loving you think you are you are not love you choose to love somebody and you love them there are times when that love goes very thin sometimes perhaps because of events that have happened it can actually come to an end where that love dies you withdraw your love god can't do that god loves us as we've said with an eternal love a love that will go on throughout the endless ages of eternity
and it will not in that sense make any difference to god love make a lot of difference to you and to me but it will not make any difference to god's love whether we spend our eternity in heaven or in hell he will not love those in heaven any more than he loves those who are already who will be punished for ever in hell because god's love is eternal it didn't start at bethlehem it didn't start at UNK and it doesn't end when you and i die as love is eternal so god has provided salvation for every body and he offers salvation to all who will come to him in UNK and UNK fe and except his salvation you see when the lord jesus christ died upon UNK cross he died to make salvation available for who for every body you see he didn't just lay your sins on jesus listen to what the old testament profit isaiah says there in that tremendous fifty third chapter and in what it's in verse six all of us says the profit like sheep have gone UNK each of us has turn to his own way but the lord has caused the UNK of us all to fall on him whether you and i reject jesus christ or accept him does not alter the fact that our sin was laid on jesus the sins are the most awful person you can think of were laid on jesus christ jesus christ paid the sins for men like hitler he paid theirs the price for their sins as much as he paid the price for the sins of somebody like st UNK of UNK so god is not partial it's clear from scripture that all maybe saved he made salvation available to all in that same book of isaiah in chapter forty five verse twenty two it says look unto me all the ends of the earth are being saved said the lord in romans one sixteen paul says i am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of god onto salvation to all who will believe and the verse we've already quoted john three sixty for god so loved the world that he gave his only UNK son that who so ever believe in him should not UNK but have ever lasting life and paul when writing to timothy says he gives his own personal testimony he says this is a good and a faithful saying it's worthy of every body accepting that god UNK all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth so it's quite clear that all maybe saved
the bible closes there in revelation chapter twenty two with that invitation an invitation to a select you know an invitation to all there almost in the in the last few verses verse seventeen the spirit and the bride say what come and let the one who hears say come and let the one who is UNK come and let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost the invitation is to all so it's quite clear that all maybe saved but it's equally clear a second proposition that all will not be saved
and this is a UNK teaching of god's word the bible nowhere teaches the doctrine of UNK that everybody's gonna go to heaven it doesn't teach that it doesn't say and it does not teach that ultimately every body will be saved there are plenty of those around who'd teach that today but the bible doesn't teach that there are those who will tell us that the sinner and the saint the man who has no thought of god or no love for god and the christian that all be gathered together on the final day you all have another chance jesus never said that the bible doesn't teach that it's quite UNK
look what jesus says here in luke chapter thirteen in verse twenty four just let me pick a few phrases out verse twenty four it says shall not be able in verse twenty five there was their cry lord open to us and in verse twenty seven their response depart from me the result in verse twenty eight there was gonna be UNK it wasn't gonna be universal they were not all gonna be saved they were not all just gonna be swept in the last day and didn't really matter you're all UNK together now in heaven not at all this surely what jesus says here makes it very clear that all will not be saved if at first we've already mentioned in john er no sorry verse further on in john three this done verse thirty six he who believes in the son has eternal life but he who does not obey the son shall not see life but the UNK of god UNK upon him there's no suggestion there of being ultimately brought in to god's heaven and ultimately being saved no it is the UNK of god UNK upon that person
one could go on and pick many other UNK you know in the erm the new testament not only were there those three questions that we mentioned earlier on about salvation but there are three UNK questions in the new testament in mark chapter eight jesus asked that question of which there is no answer for what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and UNK his sole or what shall a man or a woman give in exchange for their soul jesus didn't try and answer there is no answer to that question then again in UNK chapter three er chapter two and verse three there is an UNK question how shall we escape if we neglect so greater salvation and finally one other the apostle peter he asked the question in chapter fo first apostle in chapter four and verse seven seventeen for it is time for judgment to begin with the household of god and if judgment begins with us first what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of god
again there is no answer to that question simply because the answer is so UNK it doesn't bear thinking about but thank god all maybe safe all will not be safe but all maybe safe god has provided a salvation that is available to all and if we are not safe it is because we choose to reject his s his offers of mercy so we thank god that all may be safe but the solemn fact remains is that all will not be saved well that leads us on to this third proposition not only that the bible teach that all maybe saved not only does it teach that all will not be saved but it is quite clear that some will be saved whom we did not expect to be saved we can be quite sure about that because judgment doesn't rest with us way back abraham says perhaps one of the most important statements in his life when he said there in genesis chapter eighteen and we actually sang the wo tho the quotation in the song we just sang a few moments ago where he says will not the judge of all the earth be right judgement is not yours and mine that's god's UNK and the other song that we've been the song that we've been singing that song by UNK there's a UNK in god's mercy lets be honest we are so narrow with our mercy our UNK our expressions of grace is so limited but there's a UNK in god's mercy and UNK says it's got the UNK of the sea there's a UNK in his justice which is more than liberty david knew all about that when he was given the option he said oh i'd rather fall into the hands of god than into the hands of men i'd rather that god dealt with me than that my fellow man dealt with me because with him there's mercy with him there's grace with him there is there is long suffering and there's UNK compassion and there's love and UNK goes on with the love of god is broader than the measure of man's mind and the heart of the eternal is most UNK kind now that's all very well for the song writer to say that in a hymn and it sounds nice and it's it sounds good but is there a UNK authority for this is it really true or is it just a nice song that we sing with it does us good because we feel it's a nice there nice thoughts well surely we have it in the passage we've been reading that there is there is a mercy with god there is a UNK with god in ver in verse thirty of that chapter behold some who are last will be first and some who are first will be last it's quite clear that some will be saved that we did not expect to be saved and you can find example after example of this it was a tremendous surprise to the UNK when a very sinful woman annoyed to the feed of jesus it was a tremendous surprise to the UNK who rejected god although he was such a good man to find that the er sorry to be rejected by god although he was a good honest UNK man and to find that the sinner was accepted by god it was a tremendous surprise to the people when UNK who named you to be a sinner an open twist there an evil man was saved by the lord jesus you could save salvation has come to this house it was a tremendous surprise when the law UNK who was dying on the cross beside the law jesus was saved and went to be with him with the lord in UNK it was a tremendous surprise to the disciples when jesus UNK the gospel and revealed himself to a UNK woman who was an UNK seven times over but he did and she was saved it was a tremendous surprise to UNK when the lord revealed himself to
on the road to UNK and saved him but he did it was a tremendous surprise to the apostle paul that the lord had saved him at all he never got over it he called himself the chief of sinners but god's grace god's mercy had been revealed to him you and i when we get to heaven are in for a few UNK the grace the mercy of god is far broader and wider than our imagination we'll meet a lot of folk there that we didn't expect to see that leads me to a fourth proposition not only will some be saved that we did not expect to be saved but it's clear that others will not be saved who expected to be saved there's a passage in luke thirteen verses twenty five let me read them again one the head of the house gets up and UNK the door you begin to stand outside and knock on the door saying lord open up to us and then he will answer and say to you i do not know where you're from then you'll begin to say we ate and UNK in your presence you taught in our streets we know you lord we rubbed shoulders with you we went to church we experience those things we knew the answers to the re to the questions but he will say i tell you i did not know where you are from depart from me all you evil UNK those words make it quite clear here there's words of jesus there's references to those who UNK to know the lord jesus christ but who do not in fact know him at all they know bits and pieces about him they've seen him you know it's in its immediate context they had seen him in the street they had heard his teaching there maybe those who had been fed by the by the UNK er multiplying of the UNK and the UNK they had seen the miracle some of them may have been UNK by jesus they knew lots about him but they did not know him and he says i do not know you how many folk there are like this they expect to be saved perhaps because they go to church perhaps because they've got christian parents perhaps because they read their bible perhaps because occasionally when they're in trouble they prayer they've been confirmed they've been baptized that they're good they're honest they're not UNK they wouldn't do a bad turn to somebody not deliberately they're nice people but they don't know the truth of what it says in god's word they don't know the truth of romans three and verse twenty because by the works of the lord no flesh will be justified in his sight for through the law comes the knowledge of sin doesn't come the forgiveness of it they don't know the truth of UNK chapter two verses eight and nine for by grace you've been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it's the gift of god not as a result of works that no one should UNK for we are his UNK created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared before hand that we should walk in them they don't know the truth of er of UNK chapter three and verse five where the apostle paul says there he saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness but according to his mercy how tragic it is to expect to be saved to think you're going to heaven and in the end to find that you're not saved and jesus says they'll be many like that in that day
on that final day there will be many like that little earlier on in the book of UNK in the first chapter paul says in verse sixteen they UNK to no god but by their deed they deny him
and all of this leads natural to the final fifth proposition not only does the bible teach that all may be saved not only does it teach that however that not all will be saved not only is it true and clear that some will be saved and we do not do not do not expect to be saved not only is it quite clear that others will not be saved who we expected to be saved but finally it is quite clear that no one will be saved except by god's way and god's way of salvation is very simply by UNK and faced
we have already read some words from isaiah let me just turn you back to isaiah again this time to chapter fifty five verses six and seven
seek the lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near let the wicked UNK his way and the UNK man is thoughts and let them return to the lord for what's gonna happen for he will of compassion on him and to our god for he will UNK pardon those words were very quoted from acts chapter sixteen when that UNK said lord what must i do sir what must i do to be saved and there paul UNK believe on the lord jesus christ and thou UNK be saved this is god's way by UNK in faith that's presented in jesus he is the only saviour not your works not my works not our good deeds not our religious UNK he is the only saviour did he not say himself i am the way the truth and the life nobody comes to the father but by me
not only is jesus the only saviour but he's also a presence saviour not for the future or the passed but he is there now and he says now paul to the UNK now is the acceptable time now is the day of salvation not to be put off not to wait until you're older until this is settled and till that's done and you've had this experience or that experience now is the accepted time he is the presence saviour he is not a saviour for you tomorrow you don't know what tomorrow will bring but he is a saviour for the present for now also he is a complete saviour in UNK seven twenty five he is able to save forever those who draw near to god since he always lives to make UNK for them and finally not only is he a complete saviour but he will actually save you not the person beside you don't worry about that he will actually save you there in romans chapter ten thirteen for whoever for whoever will call upon the name of the lord will be saved and so the UNK to you and it's to me it's to us as individuals are there a few that's gonna be saved
in a sense that's not the real question that's not the important question the really important question as far as i'm concerned is will i be served and as far as your concerned will you or are you saved well it's up to you it's up to me because he will save you forever who will call upon the name of the lord will be saved
let's close shall we with a song of commitment really it's number four hundred in the er songs of fellowship and were gonna sing it to the first tune oh call for us i believe but let's look at it again
we know also the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are
even in his son jesus christ he is the true god and eternal life
right that's it fine
let me just give you a little illustration that might help you know in thinking of the erm the UNK of the UNK the divine nature and the human nature erm is it clarke kent is that the guys name on television you know the character you know the guy that walks around you know he's the boy next door type figure with glasses and all the rest of it he's no macho figure that and then in a transformation take place and UNK goes flying through the air doesn't he what is he he's UNK isn't he
UNK
UNK is i don't know erm well same difference any way but you see this is it he's not you know in that story in that in that sort of nonsense thing he is not the same character at both times he hasn't got when he's walking along the street as clarke kent he hasn't got the ability to UNK through the air as UNK he's clarke kent not so jesus he wasn't jesus divine one moment jesus human the other but they were perfectly married at all time from his from the time he was he's conception took place so he wasn't one thing one moment you know and one thing the next but there it was a perfect marriage if you like the two i was gonna say becoming one so that they were invisible you couldn't say of that's it that's the human nature of jesus that's his UNK it ju because the two were perfectly married they were UNK together so they really they became one
a couple more re verses er in two UNK five fifteen and one john chapter two and verse two
and as you die broad that they wish
right so you know there are those who would teach that jesus he would die for our sins and he's forgiven us sins but only those who come to him jesus died for the sin of the whole world for every man woman boy and girl that has ever lived or ever will live he died for the sin of the whole world not just for those even who lived after his death that's why it talks about in the old testament people like abraham looking for that day and so jesus who in when he died because he's eternal so we've got the problems with time god hasn't got problems with time he's eternal and so his sacrifice the sacrifice of him on the cross was effective for abraham as it is for you it was as effective for david as it was for paul otherwise abraham would never of had his sins forgiven because what happened with all the sacrifice with all the little UNK that were killed and all the UNK and all the rest they only acted as a covering for sin didn't take them away it covered them what for until the moment when jesus would come and would take those sins away and so when you think of david's sin his UNK and his murder how does he get forgiven for that because jesus died from the cross and he takes upon himself david's sin and he takes upon him UNK sin and UNK sin and UNK sin just as much as your sin and the person who will be born in ten years time their sin also all our sins er as UNK just read there from one john to two they were all of him he has died for every one well that's his UNK hurry along quickly now his UNK the period from UNK resurrection UNK is referred to as to the as the state of UNK now what does that term mean well as jesus according to his divine nature has always been he was always every where now in his human nature before be sorry it's not it's not on that one but before he came to earth he was every where he was god he was he was UNK present that means he was every where at the same time but he takes upon himself he's su he's human nature and he takes upon himself the limitations and when jesus is walking down second avenue in jerusalem he's not in UNK that's why there were times when people came to er to came rushing out because they heard that jesus was passing by see he wasn't there resident with them he passed by now he's gone back to heaven and where is he he's in heaven he er whereabouts where do you think jesus is now that UNK body that was UNK that has gone back to heaven where do you think it is
gone back to the lord ain't he
well let's read UNK one nineteen to twenty three somebody's got that let's read that bit
right so he is there as er jean er has read to us seated at the at the father's right hand he's there on the UNK but paul also says talks about erm in the last verse there which is his body the UNK of the UNK of him through jesus who feels all in all by the holy spirit although the UNK body of jesus is on the UNK by the holy spirit he is everywhere that's why he's with you and he's with me and he's with a folk in UNK and in UNK he is every where by the holy spirit so now thinking of his UNK again as the god man jesus now fully and always makes use of the divine powers and UNK that are his all power belongs to him and it's because that he says to his disciples you're to go into all the world and i am with you because all power is mine all power all authority is given onto me therefore says jesus because of that you can go because you're going in my strength and in my authority
has somebody got matthew twenty eight verses nineteen and twenty
go there all people every where and make them
and teach them to obey every thing that i've UNK you and i will be with you always to the end of
right i've just got a two or three minutes i've just wanna get something quickly done before we close and i'm not gonna look up all the references because your get them for next week any way in the house group but now in a sense it's difficult to understand to take all this in after all his god and were people how do we understand jesus it's difficult however knowing something about them does help us to understand something important it helps us to understand what happened when jesus UNK when he went back to heaven you see when jesus arose from the earth the disciples who watch him it says there in acts chapter one they saw him go up in to the heaven up into you know in a cloud have you ever thought what that really means what on earth was it they saw him go up in a cloud can you image a sort of great clouds coming and dropping down over the mountain top there and was suddenly UNK jesus up and then watching jesus going up in this cloud into the sky i don't really think it was quite like that have you ever wonder why it was that jesus went up in a cloud you see what was he doing he wasn't beginning a journey to some far off place in the universe some distant corner where god the father was he wasn't doing that at all what do you think a cloud can you give any suggestions of what a cloud might represent because very often a lot of some of the language in the bible is picture language and it speaks as something else what do what do you think a cloud does any body have suggestions of what a cloud might speak to us about or speak to us of sorry power yeah any thing else
no hang on that no yeah what is it just the thing of the moment about cloud what does it what does a cloud represent ben suggested power any thing else
UNK rain any thing else
aha
yeah well let me just read you two or three verses from UNK chapter forty this is what it says then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the lord filled the UNK and moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of the lord filled the UNK and throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the UNK the sons of israel would set out but if the cloud was not taken up then they did not set out until the day that it was taken up for throughout all their journeys the cloud of the lord was on the UNK by day and there was fire in it by night in the sight of all the house in israel and if you were to turn over to kings you've got a you've got a similar thing there with the dedication of the temple and as be ben was saying the power really it's the it's the presence of god the UNK the glory that cloud of and so what catches the lord jesus up is really the glory of god here he is the UNK the UNK christ being called up into heaven in the in the glory what he's been UNK so he UNK his physical presence from one place here on earth to present there on the UNK and yet by the holy spirit to be every where now jesus then he didn't cease to be truly man at either his resurrection or at his UNK he stays man god the god man all the way through and it's still true today he is the god man today and that's important for you and me think of the very worse experience that you have ever had in your life think of the very worse experience that could happen to you with the exception of you know that of say total failure of some awful sin the worse thing maybe a loss of someone dear to you someone very close to you er a UNK the most awful experience you have had well he has gone through he has known that experience he has tempted in all points like as we are he knows our frame he remembers were dust and he has been there and it is a man who has experienced those same experiences that you and i experience day by day year after year it is a man who has gone that who has walked that path who is in heaven UNK and praying for us we'll stop there cos time has gone erm we'll stop there we won't go on otherwise i'll get into trouble during this past month some of the questions in the new testament the first one we looked at you remember was that question that jesus asked of his disciples do you believe that i am able to do this then we looked at a question which the disciples asked of jesus why could we not cast it out last week we looked at another question are only a few people going to be saved and this morning i'd like us it's the final one of these questions not that there aren't other questions in the new testament and scores of others but were just looking at four er throughout this month i'd like us to look this morning for one at for a few minutes at one that jesus asked of a man who confronted him i'd like to read a few verses from luke chapter eighteen luke chapter eighteen i'm gonna read from verse thirty five it's the well known account of blind UNK luke chapter eighteen and verse thirty five and he came about that as jesus was approaching UNK a certain blind man was sitting by the road begging now hearing a multitude going by he began to UNK
yeah
over these next few weeks i'd like us to be looking at some of the interviews that jesus had with various characters sometimes with an individual sometimes with a small group of people and just to see some of the things that we can learn from them
because although jesus was speaking to the people there his words were not just for them but they're for us as well and these are conversations that we can well UNK on and learn something i'm sure for our benefit
sometimes it will be perhaps i trust new things that we'll be learning or increasing our knowledge and our understanding of the lord sometimes UNK and UNK er our faith in him
and so we must start off this morning with his perhaps most famous of all interviews that jesus had the interview with nicodemus there in john er chapter three part of which elaine read for us earlier
this the background i'm sure we're all very familiar with
this man this religious leader this UNK who came to jesus by night and as he comes to jesus he is full of questions but jesus doesn't let him get too many of them out because the questions that nicodemus has to ask are not the real issues
and you know so often you and i we have questions that we want to bring to the lord if only was here in person if only we could sit him down in the front room how many things we would have to ask of him
how many questions we would pose him with
i don't think that he would get us too far in those questions
i think he would treat us a little bit o the way he treated nicodemus and come in pretty quickly and deal with the real issues
because so often the questions that we ask are not the real issues they're not the really important things
sometimes it's just because we want our UNK satisfied and that was obviously the case with nicodemus
he says we know that you're a great teacher you've come from god otherwise you couldn't do these things and er he was undoubtedly gonna go and ask and start asking some questions from then but jesus comes straight in and he really deals with the issue the real problem in UNK life
he says you've gotta be born again
don't bother with the questions let's deal with the real heart issue nicodemus you have got to be born again
and you know for most of our questions the answers lie within ourselves and when we deal with certain basic issues most of those questions become or answered or they become irrelevant
it must have been about the turn of the century the er times newspaper ran a competition and it wa the competition was a very simple one difficult to answer but it was very simply put it was asking for people to write in letters and essays and features and articles on what was wrong with the world
now you and i could sit down as many people could then eighty ninety years ago and write a whole lot of things with the world but it took the irish writer and whip g k UNK to really put his finger on it
he wrote what must have been the one of the shortest letters of all time and he wrote back to the editor of the times and he said dear sir in answer to your question what is wrong with the world
i am yours UNK g k UNK
and that was what was wrong with the world
it wasn't the things it was people
and UNK says i am what is wrong not with the whole wide world but i am what is wrong with my world
and what is wrong in your world
and what is wrong in my world
as individuals
it's not other people it's not the problems that UNK us it's not the people that we have to work with or the conditions in work it's not the next door neighbours terrible though they may be the real answer for you and for me lies within ourselves
and that was what jesus was showing to nicodemus
nicodemus you have got to be born again
now we don't know how long the interview went on it's quite likely we have only a UNK of the conversation
but however long or short it was nicodemus certainly must have learned a tremendous amount as he listened to jesus
and let's just as i say UNK and pick up some of the things that nicodemus learned and things that we can learn
the first thing that he obviously ma was made aware of was that the lord jesus is always ready to meet the need of a seeking soul
jesus did not grant nicodemus an interview because he was the leader or a UNK because he was a leader amongst the jews
that wasn't the reason why he had a UNK why he'd a an interview with jesus
turn over a page or two and you've got the account of the woman of UNK
they're a long interview as well
you couldn't have got two people more different
one so righteous and religious
so self righteous and religious
an observer of them all
another a woman who was living and had been living for many years in continuous UNK
jesus receives both
he receives all
he is always ready to meet the need of a seeking soul
and nicodemus comes to him in hi UNK
he doesn't UNK across the lord it's not a chance encounter he seeks out deliberately to meet with jesus
he makes he UNK his life
it was no early night for him that night
because by night he comes to jesus the UNK and the UNK of that doesn't really matter
folk make great issue perhaps he was frightened of what others may think
that doesn't really make any difference
the how we come to jesus the why's we come to him are not the important thing the real issue is that we come to him
and so nicodemus he comes to jesus
and he comes with his needs
and the tremendous thing is that nicodemus may not really have been too sure of what his needs were
he may have come as a very self satisfied person after all socially he had made it
UNK he had made it
he was one of the top dogs of the people
but jesus sees right into him and he sees perhaps needs that nicodemus himself is not even aware of
that's why he hits him right where it hurts
and that's the thing that jesus does
he hits us where it hurts
he doesn't come and UNK sweet UNK in our ears
he doesn't come with a lot UNK and UNK words to make us feel better
but he comes a and really hits us hard
says nicodemus you have got to be born again
but me
now first of all nicodemus doesn't even understand what jesus is talking about but even when he does how he must of hurt his pride but i'm religious
i'm a good man
now if you had said that to some of those folk outside jesus i could have gone along with that
they need a new start
they're a terrible bunch some of them
oh
i could tell you about some of their sins
i've heard about it
nicodemus you must be born again
you have got to have a new start
jesus is always available and ready to meet the needs of those who seek him
he says if you seek me you shall find me
let me just read you a verse in UNK a hundred and seven
it's in verse nine he says for he UNK the UNK soul
and the hungry soul he filled with what is good
and isaiah takes up the same theme in the fifty fifth chapter
and he says there ho
everyone who's UNK come to the water
and you who have no money come buy eat and come buy and eat
come buy wine and milk without money and without cost
and it goes on later on he says seek ye the lord while he may be found
call upon him while he is near
let the wicked UNK his way and the UNK man his thoughts and let him return to the lord and he will have compassion on him
and to our god for he will UNK pardon
god the lord jesus is always ready to se to receive folk who come to him and to meet their needs
then again nicodemus would have learned and discovered that the lord jesus is UNK more than a great teacher
nicodemus comes with those words we know UNK teacher master we know that you are a UNK that you have come from god as a teacher
well you're right as far you go nicodemus but you haven't gone very far
yes i have come as a teacher
i've come to declare the father to you
i've come to make him known to you
i've come to tell you about him
i have come to declare the kingdom of god that's it among you
i have come as a teacher
you are right as far as you go
and the people recognize jesus the teacher
it says the common folk they heard him UNK they listened to what he said because he taught as one having authority
but oh nicodemus if you only see him as a teacher you only see the minute part of me
you're not seeing the real me
i am not just a teacher i'm so much more than that
and nicodemus wasn't long with jesus before he realized and recognized and discovered
that the person he was talking with was not just a teacher there was something else about him
i always thank god that jesus is a teacher
and he UNK us in the way of life
he UNK in the ways of god
and the most tremendous teaching of this of the whole world have come from the UNK of jesus
far greater than the teaching of any professor
far greater than the teaching of any great religious leader
far greater teaching than the teaching of all the other teachers put together
the UNK that come from jesus
if we study his teaching
study the code of UNK and the philosophy of his life
read the sermon amount
you'll find that his teach is in is in UNK above all other teaching
his teaching of UNK i it's standard it's authority
but throughout it all we see jesus as not just a teacher he must be more than that
he is first of all a saviour
he did not come he didn't say i have come to teach you
he says i have come to seek and to save that which is lost
you see our primary need the most important thing that you and i need in our life is not a teacher
we need to be taught but that's not the first thing that's not the most important thing
the first thing we need is someone to save us from our sins
you see we can we can know all about god and still be sinners
all we are is intelligent sinners that doesn't make any difference to us
it might increase our intellect er our i q might go up but we're still sinners
and jesus came first and foremost as he is as nicodemus UNK here to seek and to save that which was lost
se we need someone first of all to save us from our sin
because no matter what we learn we cannot be educated into the kingdom
even christian teaching will not educate us into the kingdom of god
we can go through sunday school and bible school we can sit in church year after year after year and take it all in and learn great UNK of the bible by heart and be able to explain this and that does not make us a christian
we cannot be educated into christianity
we only become a christian by the radical work of grace in our heart the bible calls it salvation conversion being born again
then again nicodemus discovered perhaps a strange thing in a way but he discovered that which is born of the flesh is flesh to use the words of jesus
and jesus in saying that he is showing to us and teaching us that flesh can never be changed into anything else
we cannot alter the nature with which we are born
we can't make ourselves any different
we can try and improve we can try and better ourselves but at the end of the day we are still what we are
and david says it for all of us i was born in sin and UNK in UNK
the apostle paul he says i know that in me that is in my flesh UNK no good thing
he says i am a sinner
that which is born of the flesh is flesh
that which is sinful by nature is sinful right the way through it's existence unless something radical happens to it
it's not gonna change itself
it's not gonna UNK into something better
and by becoming religious and UNK religious er practices does not make us a better person
we're still flesh
we were born in sin as david said and shape in UNK
and there's been this moral UNK that we're all part of
the result of the sin of adam and eve there in the garden of UNK
now we can dress it up we can UNK it we can make it look pretty we can make it look respectable but it we're still sinful flesh at the end of the day
but jesus doesn't just say that which is born of the flesh is flesh but he also says and that is which is born of the spirit is spirit
and he's saying that flesh can have something that human nature can UNK a miracle
it's not an evolved process but it is a dramatic radical miracle
and be born of the spirit
and become a new creation
a new person
are we only born of the flesh or are we born of the spirit
that was what nicodemus was learning in his conversation with jesus
then again nicodemus discovered that god's way of salvation is not UNK or religion but it's regeneration
jesus described it as a spiritual UNK
he says this over and over again in verse three unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
in verse five truly i say unto you unless one is born of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
in the following verse that which is born of the flesh is flesh
that which is born of the spirit is spirit
and in verse seven do not mar what i say to you
you must be born again
you see it's not simply an outward change
it's not simply making certain er UNK and external decisions
i'll go to church more often or i'll read my bible more regularly or i'll really make an issue about praying it's not it's not that at all
it's not an outward change UNK it's a new birth within
it's a new nature within
it's the old dying and the new taking it's place that's what jesus is talking about with his new birth
it's an UNK a receiving of new life
his life
the UNK of the life of god within me
within you
not just UNK up the old broken down life and saying something like this from now onwards i'm gonna go to church i'm gonna read my bi i'm gonna be a christian
that's not what it's all about
it's coming to re god for UNK and allowing his life to come in and be our life
you see all those other things are outward
they're things that you do they're things that i do
i can decide that i'm gonna go to church twice on a sunday and once during the week or however many times and i'm gonna spend an hour doing this and an hour doing that i'm gonna go round and do good deeds and help people and help and all the rest
i de i decide that
and to a large extent i've got the power of choice and the will to do it
my UNK may not may not strong enough for me to do it for long but i've actually i've got that choice to choose to do it it's something i do
and jesus saying this salvation is not something that you do it's something that is done within you
from the moment of it's birth in fact UNK er even before it's actual birth not long after it's conception now that UNK has a will of it's own and it will exercise it and will use it
the first way it uses of course is before it's birth when it starts kicking around and changing it's position
and from the moment it is comes out into the world it's will is expressed again and again and again
the one thing it's will had no decision in had no part in didn't produce was it's actual birth
and you see the miracle of the birth of the new birth is something which we do not do
god does it within us by his spirit
i decide i choose i will come i will receive it but the actual giving of that life UNK the same as the giving of the life to that UNK it was no choice of it was no didn't i wasn't determined by it's own will
so that new life which i receive is from god
all i do is to receive it
and so nicodemus learned that it wasn't by UNK trying to make himself better or by being religious but he need regeneration that's what regeneration means
a new birth
a new and he didn't understand how it could happen
and he just sees the physical aspect of it
he said well how on earth can a full grown man enter into his mother's womb again
he said but this is ridiculous
i don't understand it
it was way beyond him
and jesus says hang on you're supposed to be a religious person you're a teacher a ruler of israel and you don't understand things
listen
he says i'm not talking about physical things
i'm talking about something spiritual
you've gotta let new birth within you allow god to bring you to life to new life
what a shock it was for nicodemus to learn this truth
all his outward experiences
all his outward religious UNK
jesus saying it hasn't done a thing
they might have been very good but they haven't given you this new life this new birth john er nicodemus you've got to be born again
you see god's way of salvation begins within a person not the outside but within
right at the very core the very centre of our being the very heart of our personality god UNK that seed of a new life
and we're born se again UNK from above as jesus says in this chapter
just as twenty thirty or forty years however old i er
how old he was nicodemus was born physically just the same as you and i were born physically
the nature of our parents
so in the new birth we are born with a nature of our of our father our UNK father the god himself
then again nicodemus discovered that this new birth was absolutely UNK
there was no there was no choice there was no option there was no alternative
we've already read them you must be born again
except you are born again you can't get into heaven he says
you can't kno you know nothing about the kingdom of god
we're left in no doubt about the matter
we simply have to be born again if we're gonna be saved
and are gonna go to heaven and dwell with god there forever
i'll touch on that just er in a few moments
another thing that nicodemus learned was that no one is too old to be born again
in verse four how can a man be born when he's old
he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born can he
to this question jesus answers yes nicodemus you can be born again
you're a full grown man doesn't matter how old you are you might be an aged man a teacher in israel he certainly wasn't a UNK you can nicodemus be born again
you see it's not er a natural thing but it's a spiritual thing
and so it doesn't matter how young we are how old we are it doesn't matter what our background is it doesn't matter what our cultural experiences are it doesn't matter anything of the of the outward about ourselves every single one of us can be and must be born again
and then just one final thing that nicodemus discovered he discovered that there is only one way to be born again
in verse fourteen and fifteen jesus uses an illustration that nicodemus would have been very familiar with it was back in th in the ancient history of the nation of israel when they were wandering through the wilderness and he says just as moses a way back there on that occasion lifted up the UNK in the wilderness there had been this UNK if you have UNK of UNK there had been this UNK of UNK and they'd UNK the people and they were dying like flies and moses comes to god he says what are you gonna do
your people are dying
they're suffering
and god tells him he says you make a UNK of brass and put it on a pole in the middle of the camp so that everybody can see it they look to that UNK of brass they will be UNK
now the UNK of brass didn't heal them
what was to heal them was the act of UNK to what god had said and faith in what he had said
and so nicodemus would have been familiar with this story and jesus says as moses lifted up the UNK in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up but whoever believes in him may have eternal life
he says i'm gonna be lifted up on the cross
i'm gonna be raised up on a cross just as that brass UNK was put on a pole in the camp of in the middle of israel of the of the camp there in the er there in the wilderness
and just as everybody who looked to that UNK on the pole was UNK so i am gonna be lifted up on a cross and everybody who looks in faith to me and in UNK receives my gift of forgiveness they will be saved
there's no other way said jesus
it's only through me
jesus said i haven't got any other alternative to give to you nicodemus
you've come with your questions you come with all the reasoning and your great intellect all your religious arguments
nicodemus the important thing for you is you have got to be born again
i've got nothing else to offer you
i've got nothing else to say to you
you've got your questions and of course i could answer them nicodemus i could tell the why's and the UNK of this and of that i could give you all the details and all the things that you want to know but they're not really important the real issue for you nicodemus is that you have got to be born again
there's nothing else that i've got to tell you
because there's nothing else that's important for you to know
and the only way you can be born again is by looking to me cos i'm gonna be raised up on a cross for your salvation
your religious life is not enough
keeping the law is not enough
doing all the right things is not enough
your background your UNK yes you you've been brought up in a possibly your fa your parents they've taught you the right way they are UNK pieces or they were if they ma they may well have been de dead by that time but they were UNK to pieces when you as a UNK became a teacher and a ruler a leader amongst your people
but nicodemus the important thing is not that
that doesn't stand you in good UNK
that has not got you into the kingdom of god
you must be born again
we sang a little earlier on a song of er UNK and back those two hundred and twenty two hundred and thirty years ago when wesley was preaching in this country and in america there was another preacher every bit as famous then perhaps not quite so famous today preacher by the name of george UNK and george UNK he went around and he was preaching and he UNK on this text john er i in john three you must be born again
he UNK them again and again and again
and there was a lady in the in his congregation he UNK to masses to thousands and thousands of people and she came to him she was she was annoyed she was a rather er well to do lady and she was offended at this preaching that she had to be born again and that people had to have this new birth experience
and she came to UNK and she said mr UNK why is it that you keep on preaching on this and you keep on using this text and keep on saying you must be born again
and UNK said madam
simply because you must be born again
as far as god is concerned there is no other alternative
we can change the terminology we can give it different words we can talk about making a commitment to christ we can talk about salvation we can talk about conversion the word they're not the important thing it's this act of a new birth of receiving god in christ for ourselves believing that he died for us and are receiving this new life
and that was the lesson that nicodemus learnt
what no matter who he was for all his background nicodemus you me we have to be born again
not something we do but something god does within us
not on the outside of our lives but right in the very centre of our being the very heart the core of our personality this new life this new birth to the only way that we can know god and receive his forgiveness
so simple and so wonderful
so glorious and yet so very real that if we by faith and if we have by faith looked to jesus christ dying on the cross for us and received him now not there of course but risen and UNK and UNK is UNK that we ha will pass or we have passed from death unto life
that's what it sa what being born again is all about is new life from death to life
we're gonna come around the lord's table now and celebrate what made it possible for us and we're gonna sing that little song it's in the front of your erm songs of fellowship it's number five
reminds us that the way that god has reached out to us is through his love
in that verse the closing verse that elaine read for us that god so loved the world
he so loved you and me that he gave his son for us
and this song number five in the front section of the songs of fellowship reminds us that there on the cross as jesus dies for his dad great demonstration of his love for us
oh i'm sorry
in your one it's in that red folder erm number thirty one sorry
here is love vast as the ocean
loving UNK is the flood
when the prince of life our UNK shed for us his precious blood
who his love will not remember
who can cease to sing his praise
he can never be forgotten throughout UNK eternal days
but shall we've been thinking we started last week and we're gonna be thinking over the next few weeks er some of the people that jesus met some of those who confronted him who's lives came into contact with jesus christ and what difference it made to them
why he ever bothered with them
and this incident that we have we've had read for us by er the two UNK earlier on in from john chapter four it's a it's a very beautiful account of our lord's dealings with this particular lady this UNK woman
and it's not a text but perhaps a verse that we could use as a as a UNK is verse twenty seven and it says at this point his disciples came and they UNK that he had been speaking with a woman
yet no one said what do you seek
or why do you speak with her
it's interesting that although these are the thoughts going through the UNK minds none of them actually put them into words and asked jesus what it was all about
as we said earlier on he had been they had been travelling through and jesus had se settled down there for a while and sent his disciples into a th a nearby town across the UNK er to get some food and some provisions er to last them for the remainder of their journey and jesus is just sitting there by this well he's tired he's UNK and hungry just waiting there and then this lady comes to draw water from the well
this and jesus starts speaking to her and when they come back that UNK these disciples
but for several reasons
first of all according to the jewish law no UNK or teacher should ever hold conversation with a woman alone
that was taboo
the second thing to compound it was that the lord jesus obviously being a man and should not have se been speaking with a woman about serious and important issues
and a strange woman at that
you didn't talk about th you might have talked about the weather but you never have talked about things like religion or politics with a woman
it was again one of the UNK of things for a jewish man to do
and of course the third thing was this racial difference
the lord was a UNK and this woman was a UNK a woman of UNK
and all of that made the conversation th the fact that jesus was talking with this woman a very UNK thing nineteen hundred years ago
but let's notice that first of all the lord really did speak to this woman
and what he said he said with such authority because of whom he is
and what he said to this woman resulted in the transformation of her life
now those three facts were true as far this particular woman is concerned but they are also true in relation to you and to me today
the lord is waiting to speak to us he's waiting to speak to you he's waiting to me through his word
and what he says with authority
it's not just oh well yeah well that's alright in the bible it is his word er which has authority greater authority than any of the so called experts greater authority than any of the deliberations of men whether they be church leaders or anything of tha er or anything else
he speaks with authority
that was one of the reasons why the people listened to him
it says the common folk the crowds the UNK they heard him UNK because he spoke as one having authority
he wasn't just UNK he wasn't just starting out things he thought about he and ideas that had come into his head he spoke as one who had authority and because of that they heard him
and he speaks to us today through his word with that same authority
his word has got to have that place of authority in our lives
and what he says to us can result in the complete transformation of our lives
you see he doesn't just speak to us for small talk he doesn't just speak to while away the time with conversation
you know that is a good test of your relationship with a person if there is a sense in which you are embarrassed to be with them and there's long periods of silence it's a pretty good test that it's not a deep relationship you have with them
if you have a deep relationship with a person you can spend long periods of silence being together and not be embarrassed not be wondering what shall i say now
or what can i say
what can i introduce into the conversation
and jesus doesn't just chat to us for the sake of chatting to us he when he speaks to us his words have authority they have input they are vital and we must pay attention to them
so let's ask UNK these questions not just for this woman of UNK but for us why did our lord seek the interview with this woman
why does he talk to her
why does he seek to talk with us
why does he want to share with us
and for a little while this morning i'd like us to look briefly at four very simple answers to that question
they were true for this woman but more important than that they're true for you and they're true for me today
the first reason why jesus talked with this woman was very simply because he liked her
jesus did not see people he does see people just as people
he doesn't see us as a part of a crowd he doesn't see us as a number on a computer he doesn't see us as numbers on a bank account or in some other UNK er computer set up or whatever it is he doesn't just see us as that he sees us as individuals
you look at a crowd of people er last a week a week yesterday at UNK at the billy graham mission there er we were sitting in one place and i was looking for some other folk and i knew approximately where they were and there i was stand they were all you could really see was this mass of people very difficult to pick out individuals within them but god doesn't see it as a mass like that
if you like it's the close up the UNK lens is on each one of us all the time and that's how he sees us
he doesn't see us a mass of seventy odd thousand people in harlow today he sees you as an individual and he loves us in that same way
john three sixteen what it says that god so loved the world
it doesn't just mean that he loved a mass of UNK he does that but he doesn't love the mass as a mass he loves the mass as individuals one by one god loves you
just the same as he loved this woman of UNK and because he loved her he wanted to communicate with her he wanted to share with her he had something for her
you know that word love it's become so UNK hasn't it
it's er it's not it's just one of the most UNK words in the english language we use it for everything but in this context we've gotta see it UNK wi with dignity and all the glory that it deserves god loved her
and god loves you
not for what he gets out of you
you know it's possible and we use that word love it's not really love so we'll love somebody else for what they can get out of them course do that's an UNK of the word love it's a it's a it's making the word totally UNK
god does not love you for what he gets out of you
he loves you first of all he because he is love
it's his nature
god can no more stop loving you than he can stop being
his nature
it's for us it's something that we do for god it's something that he is
you know water is wet and even when you change it into and you freeze it you know you hold the ice it still is wet when you heat it up and it's steam it's still wet
by nature it is wet and that's just a feature of water
god is love
it's his nature
he doesn't stop loving us when we do wrong he doesn't stop loving us when we turn our back on him he doesn't stop loving us when we ignore him he doesn't stop loving us when we when we UNK every everything that he does is when we UNK it under foot and we are in total UNK to him he still doesn't stop loving us because he is love
the minute god is a hi hypothetical thing which is totally ridiculous the minute god stops loving he stops being because he is love
that's what john tells us
god is love
and th jesus he se he seeks out this woman to speak with her because he loves her
UNK already mentioned er that god so loved the world that he gave his only UNK son
and the apostle paul in two UNK in chapter eight and nine he says for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your UNK he became poor
that's the evidence of his love
he doesn't love in word only he loves in deed
he who UNK all things laid it all aside he who was rich became poor
because he loves you and he wants to share his UNK with you and with me
and over in UNK in chapter four and in verse four but when the UNK of time came god sent forth his son
god so loved the world that he gave his son and here paul said that at the right time at the right moment in that se in that very day in history which was god UNK god sent his son into this world
born of a woman born under the law
in order that he might redeem those who are under the law that he might bring us into his family
and just one more scripture on this in UNK chapter five a and verse twenty five i paul there he's saying the husbands love your wives and he tells them how and why
just as christ also loved the church and he gave himself up for it
god loves you
jesus loves you
and he loved this woman and he wanted to communicate with her
who was she
a poor peasant woman engaged in UNK tasks
her life had been an absolute failure
what a mess she had made of it by her own confession
an UNK in her society
yet jesus seeks her out because he wants to demonstrate to her that he loves her
just as she was
but the terrible mess she had made of her life
with all the UNK of sin that she had around her he loved her
and you and i can look at her and look at others and say well we're not like that we're exactly the same as that
because we have all UNK and come short of god's standard
god doesn't UNK sin
he doesn't UNK in good bad and not so bad it is all sin to him and as sinners he loves us
we were saying earlier he didn't wait until we were cleaned up before he loved us but he loved us in our sin whilst we were yet sinners the apostle says christ died for us
and so jesus he draws near to this woman and he comes to you and he comes to me to cleanse and forgive we'll just turn from our sin and meet him in confession
the wise man back in UNK in chapter twenty eight and verse thirteen he says he who UNK his UNK will not UNK but he who UNK and UNK them will find compassion
and no matter how true that is in the natural sense it is a it is UNK true as far as god is concerned
if we confess then he UNK
and the prophet UNK he'll remind us of the compassion of god
says i have loved you with an UNK love
that's how god loves you
not a love that changes not a love that starts when you become nice not a love that you know that well if you if you've got if you've got it it's got it's good days and it's bad days i have loved you with an UNK love says god
therefore i have drawn you with love and UNK
and that's the sort of love that he has for you and for me
and so jesus seeks this woman out because he loves her and he seeks to communicate with you and with me because he loves us
but he ta also he talked with her because he sought her salvation
you see it wasn't just a case of loving her and that was all there was to it that might be very nice to know that god loves me but i there's a sense in i want to know what that love produces
i want to know what it means to me
and he has talked with her he sought her out not just because he loved her but because in his love he wanted to save her
he wanted to rescue her
this woman was lost and she knew it
nobody needed to tell her she was a sinner she UNK it openly
she knew her situation she knew her condition
now there are many folk who don't realize they're sinners they don't realize they're lost this woman did
but whether we're aware of it or not doesn't alter the fact that if we're outside of god outside of jesus christ then we are lost
we don't become lost we are already lost
jesus said i have come to seek and to save that which is lost
and we don't become lost at the end of lives we don't become lost at some date in history we are lost now if he hasn't found us
and this woman she realized it others don't always realize it but that doesn't alter the fact of the UNK
so why was she lost
was it because she'd broken the seventh UNK
no that wasn't why she was lost
she broke it because she was lost
that didn't make her lost
she was already lost
she was lost because she had never been saved
she had never been found
and you know there's a you and i whatever stage we are in our UNK in our journey in life we don't become lost because of what we do
we don't become sinners because we commit sin
that is our nature just as god's nature is love so our nature is we are sinners by nature
and it's not a case of we become sinners because we sin but rather the bible teaches us we sin because we are sinners
it's the natural thing that we do
it's our nature
and of course the gospel is the great thing and this is a message of the gospel that jesus has come to change our nature and give us a new nature put in put within us his nature
but that's further on
so this woman she was lost not because of what she'd done but because simply she had never ever been found and jesus had come to find her he had come to rescue her he had come to save her
paul when he's writing to timothy in the first letter and in chapter one and in verse fifteen the great apostle paul
he says it's a UNK statement UNK full acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners among whom i am foremost of all
the great apostle paul says i am the chief of sinners
but christ came into the world to save sinners
the reason that jesus talked with this woman was that he wanted to save her
that is to say he wanted to reveal to her sinful condition and need and this he did when he speaks to her about her sinful life
he doesn't beat about the bush
he doesn't come soft with it
he doesn't you know talk about all the UNK she's had and it's been very difficult for all tho he is absolutely straight but he still deals with her in love and compassion
he doesn't come with a UNK way
he says i haven't come to judge the world i haven't come to condemn you you're already under UNK
he says i've come to rescue you to save you
and so he comes and to reveal to her sinful condition and need but also to forgive her sin
and that's a tremendous thing when we come to god in christ the first thing he does for us is to forgive us our sins
but you say i haven't done anything against god
oh we have
cos it's all sin
whether er if i sin i'm UNK and i've UNK you
you say well it's against me
no it's against god first of all because all sin is UNK against god
that's why david could say against thee only have i UNK after he's committed UNK after he's committed murder after he's involved other people in his UNK deeds he can still say i've committed sin against god
i've UNK others
i've done terrible harm to them
but my sin is against god
and he's the only one who can forgive that sin
UNK forgive me for the wrong doing and for the harm i do to them but it's only god who can forgive my sin
oh the UNK the UNK were quite right on o on several occasions when jesus UNK people they said ha
who does this man think he is UNK people sin
only god can forgive sin
and they're quite right only god could forgive sin
that's who jesus is god in flesh and he came to forgive sin and he wanted to forgive this woman her sin
and not only to forgive her sin he also wanted to cleanse her
let me read you those tremendous ver words from john first john in chapter one says if we walk in the light as he is in the light he or your fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son UNK us from all sins
see cleansing is not forgiveness
cleansing if you like is the next stage it's taking away all trace of the sin it's taking away the mark the residue of the sin it UNK us from all sin
if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all UNK
and that's not repetition it's two different things
he UNK us ours sin and he UNK us from all our sin
and then the fourth thing there that jesus wants to show to this woman as well was that he wanted to break the power of sin in her life
telling her what was wrong with her which she already knew
even UNK her and cleansing her was not enough because UNK another day UNK got it's UNK and wonderful though forgiveness is i need more than just being forgiven
that deals with the past
might deal with this present moment but i need something for tomorrow and the next day and week next week and next year
jesus came not just to forgive and to cleanse but to break the power of sin
in her life
tells us that the son makes you free
you shall be free indeed
now all these things are not just for this woman they were for you and they're for me
then again he talked with her because he UNK to satisfy to meet her needs as a human being she'd UNK she'd hope she'd UNK and as she looked back on her life some of them may have been fulfilled some of her plans may have been realized but there must have been an awful UNK and awful UNK about so much
she had tried so many times she had tried so many things
and if we're honest that is so often our story
we want satisfaction we want UNK in life and so we try this and it gives it for a moment but when it's finished we've gotta try something else
last year's holiday was great last year and i might get a bit of enjoyment out of looking at the photographs but i'm still paying for one again this year
because you see i want some there's this continual requirement of o that we need satisfaction we need fulfilment
and jesus UNK to meet this woman on that her deep need of fulfilment
and he uses a picture he says look you're gonna come and you're drawing this water and you're gonna come back tomorrow and get some more and the next day you'll come with your UNK and have some more water and that's the story of your life coming back again and again and again but the water that i will give you that won't be an external source outside of you that's gonna be within you
a well of water UNK up into UNK life
he says that satisfaction you're seeking you're not finding it outside
he said like coming to this well for your jug of water every day it's alright while i the jug there's some in the jug but when you've drunk it all the UNK empty and it doesn't do a thing for you
he said but why do that
why not have the well within you
why not have the light within you so you don't have to go and get it outside but it's there dwelling within you day by day moment by moment
and he UNK to meet this woman's need
and we can try all sorts of things
and there's things are not necessarily wrong there's the legitimate things erm wi within our work th there's a there's job satisfaction but there's more to that than in life than just job satisfaction
there's the satisfaction in our home and our family in having a good home and a nice home and a and the material benefits that we are able to er to achieve
there's nothing wrong with them as such but he says the real satisfaction isn't to be found in them it's within you
it's not in an external thing
because after all what happens that last year's model it UNK y you're a bit fed up with it
and a new model comes out and you want that
and you get a bit fed up of it i mean after all unless you're into sort of
UNK cars who wants to who wants to drive around in an old ford UNK of twenty five thirty years ago
nobody
because what is produced today is so much better
but the thing is what's gonna be produced next year will be better still
and the year after that will be still better
and so we're constantly wa seeking for something else and god says hang on
the real source of enjoyment should be within you and that's what i will give to you
and then finally he talked with this woman and he wants to talk with us because he wants to use us he wanted to use her
and this how li this is how god UNK the gospel this is how he UNK his message through his people through using his pe using in the very best sense of the word he doesn't make use of us he involves us in his work and so he saves us he UNK us and then he sends us forth and he does that with this woman
he says you go and tell go and tell your family and she's embarrassed said well erm and if i did don't worry he said i know you i know your family situation i know your background you don't have to tell me it i know it all
i know that you've been through husbands until now th y the UNK you're living with your seventh husband is not e you're e actually married to him
i know all about you
he said and i want to use you
go and tell them
go and tell the folk back in the village go and tell those who are related to you what you have heard today
tell them what i've said to you the message that i have given to you
that i love you
that i want to save you
that i can satisfy you go and tell them
and so this woman she didn't UNK a sermon but she does give her a testament she goes back and she gets the folk in the village and she says come see someone meet someone let me introduce you to someone who has told me everything that i have ever done
isn't this the christ
isn't this the messiah
i'm quite sure she said more than just that
i'm quite sure that when she said that come see a man that told me everything i did she didn't just leave it there but she'd have put such words as and he didn't condemn me he didn't UNK me he didn't point a UNK finger at me but he loved me
he saved me
he UNK me
he's UNK me
he's made me a new person
isn't this the christ
come and see him for yourself
and they do just that
they go off to see just what she's on about because she's told them he'll do the same for you what he's done for me he can do for you as well
he wants to lo he wants to show his love to you
he wants to forgive you
he wants to cleanse you
he wants to satisfy you too
and so she's becomes an instrument in sharing this good news a vital witness and she's got this joy of seeing others coming and meeting with jesus through her simple testimony
what is it that god wants to say to you and to me
well from this incident he wants to remind you and me wherever we are i love you
i love you
he says
i want to save you
i want to forgive you
i want to cleanse you
i want to break the power of sin in your life
because that's what my salvation is all about
it's a complete salvation
i want to satisfy you
i want to meet those needs those UNK those aspirations you've got
i want to put within you my fountain of life UNK up within you
not external but there right in the centre of your life
and i want to use you
i want you to become a co UNK together with me
i want you to get involved in sharing what i'm doing for you with other folk
that's what he wants to say to her i believe
as we read that account oh yes we can read as a historical account of UNK encounter with this woman but it's more than that it's the sort of encounter he wants to have with you and he wants to have with me
the sort of encounter that he wants us to have with him
meeting us where we are meeting as in our needs there and then changing us and sending us out as his followers with his message sharing that's all this woman did simply sharing what god in christ had done for her
come and see what he's done for me
and their testament at the end was yes
we believe it now
not just because of what you've said that UNK our UNK that UNK us that UNK our UNK but we believe it because we have seen and heard for ourselves and we've recognized his authority
we're gonna sing now
arnold would you do me a favour please
could you slip out and retrieve our UNK
thank you
songs in the songs of fellowship it's number one sixty one hundred and sixty one
takes this song takes up that theme that jesus introduces to his disciples about a harvest being ready
the interesting thing just in passing that particular time of the year was not actually harvest time and as jesus looked over the harvest field it wasn't the harvest field that was UNK corn it was actually full of green shoots and it is the harvest now is ripe it's UNK because he wasn't talking about that he was talking about men and women
one sixty one in that
and chris takes that theme up here the fields they're ready for harvest they're all what is needed is UNK
whilst we're singing this can we take up our morning offering
here i am
holy available
let's pause there and pray shall we
and we have to confess lord that words are very easy to say and to sing
and we can sing them and feel that we're doing the right thing and go our way but lord we pray that the words we sing might be the words that we means and the words that we say might be the things and the way we mean to conduct our lives
we thank you that you sought us out and you demonstrated your great love for us and you reached out and rescued us saved us
you UNK us our sins you UNK us from all UNK
and you have given your holy spirit to dwell within us
and you have given power over sin
not UNK lord we have to confess that we still fail you again and again but we thank you that you provide power for us to live lives that are UNK to you
we thank you lord that you've done all this for us and we find our satisfaction in you
we find our reason for life in you
we find in you our well of UNK up there within us as you dwell in us
dear lord we want to be of use to you we want to be of service to you we want to be salt and light in our communities we want to be your labourers working together with you
and as we've been singing we just want those words to be true in our experience
here we are available to you
not to do our thing but to do your thing
not to go at our charge but to go at your charge
not to be individuals doing our own thing and walking our own path but working together with you in harmony with you and your body in our community in our situation where we are
lord as we look around we see a tremendous harvest and we just pray that we might be honourable and faithful in the task that you give to us
the responsibility that you lay upon us in being involved in your harvest at this time
as we ask it in your name for your glory
we realize lord that we can't do it UNK we are totally dependent upon you and yet we thank you for this
oh lord we as offer ourselves to you we think of those who have been unable to be with us today for whatever reason some on holiday and we just pray for your blessing to be with each one and to be with all of as we ask it in your name for your praise and glory
amen
yes
surely
ah that's it we're lit up
so i'll now go all shy
erm most of the i involvement i've ever had in any kind of job has been by accident
er i've had plans
when i was younger at school i had plans to go into various different things and er th i failed UNK which is something i started doing and seemed to continue to do to some extent
and so it was quite UNK that i started the club
it was something i wanted to do but i didn't know that until it started to happen and then with the removal business too it's more or less the same kind of thing
and essentially in nineteen sixty eight sixty nine legislation changed in this country and up to that time what you had to do if you had a removals firm you had actually a licence
er it was called an a licence which allowed you to take furniture all over the country to wherever you needed to go to remove people
but if you didn't have an a licence most firms that had got their own vehicles could get a c licence which allowed them to keep th take their own goods in er that they used for their own practices to wherever they were going to but didn't y allow you to take anybody else's
there was a thing called a b licence which allowed you to go within about twenty five miles with somebody else's goods
so unless you'd got an a licence you couldn't be a removal man
so if you wanted to be a removal man you had to find the work to justify you having an a licence but of course you couldn't because you hadn't got an a licence to do it with
so that's how things stood in those year in the days before nineteen sixty nine and i in fact did learn about removals in the late sixties
i'll be telling most some of the UNK about that time and then the other UNK will be about what happened to me in sixty nine when i started up because the changing legislation s more or less said that if you had a vehicle of thirty UNK or less you could move an er wh whoever's furniture you liked anywhere you wanted to
so it was a UNK and i noticed this change in sixty eight and realized that it would be possible to do small scale removals
oh that's nice isn't it
there you are a little bit of atmosphere to er
oh we now know there's a concert starting next door
er and
er and i noticed that there was this change
but what i had also noticed was that certain firms for example that w were er th then UNK er they in fact would s er say have a three piece moved and you'd have a huge van would go to pick up a three piece suite
er it would be a van that would take a four bedroomed house with ease
three men would go along pick up this poor little three piece suite put it on the van deliver it perhaps two hundred yards up the road
and i mean in nineteen sixty five such a job would cost te about eleven to fifteen pounds which was an UNK amount of money in those days simply because the man who had the firm had an a licence or four or five of them and he was in a UNK a UNK position you see
well it was ludicrous
it was all right for big removals but not certainly for three piece UNK and the like
so that's why i started up in business
i had the club already going was dealing with mainly young people and as you will know young people's taste tends to vary quite considerably and very quickly so i might well be very successful for so long and then if suddenly taste changed and i hadn't got the ability to change with the times i realized that it would be rather UNK so i needed a second string to my bow
so that's in fact how the removals basically started
i learnt with someone else did two years and then er that was an accident if you like that i got involved cos somebody wanted me to be involved and it seemed the right thing at the time
and then i went on and started on my own with light removals
and in the in fact in the early days o f o one of the things that had happened f early on was that i would do jobs on my own and you it's amazing how many number of one man jobs there are
somebody wants a single bed moving somebody might want a chest of UNK moving somebody wants some packages so there were there's quite a lot of work of that nature wanted
but i had a problem in that very often people wanted a double wardrobe moving and of course it then needed two men
and in fact in the early stages i got one man working for me and er i went back into teaching again for a short time to help out at a school where the teacher was ill and i was teaching in the morning and then doing two man jobs in the afternoon and he was doing one man jobs in the morning
it's quite funny really because er i used to go off i had an agreement with the headmaster at that particular time and he'd h i'd been a full time teacher with him and he needed somebody desperately that was the only reason obviously he wanted me back and er i said well look i can come back but i can't get back in order to go to the assembly at first
he says well you never managed it when you were full time anyway
so we had this agreement i would al arrive in a removal van just as assembly finished to start the lessons in the morning and then my removal man would come back and pick me up again at twelve o'clock so that i could then do the two man jobs
so i had a er i got him set up for the morning jobs and then i did the afternoon jobs with him
so it started in that kind of fashion really
but because you don't know i mean i er y you can't imagine really somebody saying oh i'm going to be a removal man i think it sounds like a fascinating idea and you wouldn't think it was
and you'd think well what could be worse than lifting and carrying and what could be more boring than doing that all day
but it hasn't been
it's been amazing for the very fact that everything is so different every job is different
you aren't stuck with the same job
you may think you are but from one house to the next that you deal with it's always different
but of course some of the jobs we do are quite strange really and er just as an example there were er th there was the job er when we were er moving stuff from the old school system
you remember they did the UNK five or six years ago now and the schools were mi er were getting mix er they were mixed sexes and they were archbishop UNK was going to be two sexes and so was queen UNK
and at the swap over they had to swap equipment around for the reorganization
so we on the small scale for just bits and pieces got m several jobs and one of them was moving stuff from the biology UNK and the physics UNK from UNK to take it all the way across town to go to queen UNK school
and i just have to go to or i just have to sort of explain that when you pack a van you don't pack it like the advert for UNK
you've seen the advert for UNK haven't you where they have a little break sitting in the back of the van and the UNK on the floor and the UNK on the floor and there's a lamp in there and there's a piece of UNK to one side
obviously if you pack your furniture in like that if you pack your furniture in that way what you'd end up with when the van stopped all the f all the furniture would move down to one end and be UNK
so what you do is you pack it like a three UNK
you start at the front with the luton over the top and you put your boxes
you often put things like ar er like er dining chairs which have got awkward shaped backs up there cover them with UNK and place them there
and then when you get to the er van proper you take things like a wardrobe and you put it UNK on int th in against the side of the van you'd then put a UNK over and then you'd put something soft like a UNK facing it because obviously that's a shiny side and if you can put something soft into it it's not going to get UNK
you then face it with another wardrobe or if not a wardrobe you'll face it with something like a chest of UNK and the and put a c er a UNK over that and then upside down on top of that th there would be a dressing table and they would face in
and you build it across the van like that
so it's rather like a sandwich
that's one of the reasons why a removal man when he comes into the place doesn't start with one room upstairs shall we say and f empty that room then empty another because he's looking for sizes and shapes that will fit
th er s drop leaf tables are marvellous cos you get to the end of the side of your packing you see and you might have a gap just about the right size so in you put the UNK you put the table in and you might have a little gap like left so you get the this the you get the er ironing board and put that in there
steps things like that
so that the whole thing doesn't move
a good removal man very often can fill a van without ever using a tie once
you have ties obviously to hold certain things in and if you've only got a van with a third full you'll have to use the ties because there's space left over
but a good removal man can very often pack and not actually use ties because of the way he fits stuff in
and that's the secret
where do you think the UNK would go
i'm going to test you now you see
floor
no
i thought that once when i did my first removal because the boss was away and i went to a house wh and they had more UNK in that house than i s ever seen since and because i was only learning and i hadn't been taught i put all the other furniture in and worried about the UNK and worried about the UNK and worried about the UNK till at the end there was so much furniture in there wasn't room to put the UNK on the floor and i had to come back a second time to actually do that because i didn't dare put them anywhere else
but i did learn later
and where w UNK any other ideas
in the wardrobe
the UNK
well done yes ooh there she'll make a very good er in a wardrobe you see
ideal
open the door of the wardrobe put a UNK over the big one put it in the back then sandwich another one a picture in perhaps if you've run out of things like that till you get to the front close the door and you've got it all packed away neat out of the way
and it's always a good tip for a removal man to get rid of those things first
cos if he gets rid of them first then he doesn't have to worry about those things until er later which sometimes does happen
but all this is done so that it won't shift it won't move
or if suddenly you have to halt then the whole lot doesn't come forward and squash into the next piece in front into the ne that's why it's edge on UNK down so that the wardrobe is that way UNK on you see so that if you suddenly stop the weight of something there won't squash the wardrobe
and you build it up
obviously if you've got a load that'll take a whole van load you build it up as high as you can
if you go to a house and you realize that it's only a very small house and it's a very big van you'll only pack it up that way because you're packing faster by doing it that way
anyway i explain all this to give you a basic idea of the principle
but when we went to arch the school at UNK the two lads that went they had to pack all these various different acid UNK
they were alright big glass things which you could UNK and pack in tea UNK with bits and pieces and equipment in
and they were b doing quite happily and quite UNK with all the bits and pieces they had to pack until they came to something they'd never packed before
a skeleton
full length UNK you see
so they UNK their heads and wondered now what on earth are we going how are we going to pack this
if you put it in a tea chest and bend its limbs then it's likely to get broken and it wouldn't quite fit in you see d'you see it and yes she she's jumping ahead already you see
and if you hang it up then it will swing about and could still be damaged
you can't put it anywhere cos something else would squash it
so w er we did what we've just been suggested from the front here you see
we sat it in the front seat
now m now my oh of course
my van has the UNK seat and two passenger seats
it was a UNK day wound the window down put the skeleton in with his elbow sticking out over the you see
and then the second man he set he sat next to it with his arm over his shoulders just to make sure he was comfortable with the with as you say the seat belt on as well you see to secure him and off the lads set all the way across hull road right the way t across to queen UNK
and at time that time er th it was before UNK street was closed so they went through UNK street
well you can imagine can't you
people on hull road just standing waiting for the bus sort of UNK away yes aye you know UNK away and th
am i seeing did you did you just did you see what i saw
and you can imagine the UNK down UNK street where there were all these people and there was the skeleton sitting there quite UNK right the way through town
and when we got to the other end one of the lads actually walked in and did a UNK into the school with it which the kids thought was great
but there again you see it's how you hold how would you hold a skeleton you see
it's probably the best way like that you see and walk it in er you see
well there p you see you that's one thank you yes
just on UNK th there michael
i always show this one to prove in fact that this is the case you see cos people sometimes don't believe my stories
he didn't
s he didn't remain in the parking in the driving seat er and in fact that that's because one of the lads was er a keen photographer and er so that's actually how it did go
now that is the size of vans that i use now for light removals
er another er rather another er on that tack of course talking about er well in this case a skeleton i had a job to do just shortly before they closed UNK street off fully and e it was UNK i was on my own and i had t to pick up some UNK from er a UNK shop a dress shop
and you know many of them now are rather abstract things aren't they
well these weren't
they were very realistic were these and there were fifty to be moved
and i had to walk about fifty yards to get to the van because it was it was in an area that had been partly UNK
now you can imagine possibly the view can't you
i go in there they they're not covered with anything and i've got a naked lady in my arms
so i carried it carefully like this arm round the waist you see and off i went up the road for about forty fifty yards and put one in
then you go back and you think well i can't do this fifty times over
anything else you'd get as many boxes as you possibly could and carry them out in order to do the job efficiently
so the second time i went UNK them round the waist two you see
and you got the odd look but it wasn't too severe because at least though they had no clothes on at least you were holding them by the waist
but once you got well into the business of the removal y one UNK you see and you forget exactly what you're carrying or what it appears to be that you're carrying
and at one stage i think i was carrying about three
one was UNK over my shoulder one had got sort of between two limbs i suspect holding it round the back like that and another one was over a UNK that just seemed handy to hold the lot and as i walked down the street of course suddenly everybody was UNK at me and i realized what i appeared to be doing
and i went very red as well as you can imagine
you don't realize and then you thi you've got these three bodies all wrapped round me and me er sort of walking round UNK down the road with them
so you see you do get some strange loads
er
the bodies speak while you were walking along
i'm afraid not
i but it would have made me jump
i would've probably UNK been here if one had started to speak
another strange job one of the younger lads did he d he was about eighteen and er we went he went north to er north of UNK to what do they call the UNK area there
UNK
UNK forest that's it to the UNK forest
and the job there was to pick up tray after tray of tiny little UNK about that high in little tiny paper cardboard boxes
and they in turn were in what were rather like UNK
and these were put on and then one after the other would put onto the van and they would come right up to this height
not a lot of weight as you imagine because they're all little tiny UNK this high and obviously what they are going to do they were being taken to south wales where they going to start off a new little forest presumably
and we had tray after tray of these
he went there to UNK forest one day in the afternoon loaded them all up and set off for wales
it was a two day job basically because of the time taken to get there and then come back through york again
and on the second day in the morning he was happily going down this nice sunny day on the coast road er to south wales driving away quite happily and then suddenly and a police car came across him came in front stopped him
so poor ben thought what on earth have i done
he couldn't think of any it was a quiet road he'd done nothing wrong he hadn't been UNK and it was a lovely morning and i can't do the accent i won't try to because it was a UNK obviously but er he came what do you think you're doing lad
ben said well i'm just driving as normal wh what have i done wrong
you've been breaking the law for the last ha mile and a half
at least
well what have i been doing
he said well it's a UNK road it's got double white lines
didn't you notice
he'd obviously had a bad night had this poor bloke you know
so ben said oh i'm terribly sorry he said there was nobody else on the road and i must admit i didn't notice whether i had
i'm very sorry
that's not good enough
it's not good enough isn't that being sorry
you were breaking the law
er double white lines
so he tried to UNK this man and he wasn't going to be UNK
and as the conversation f went on a little further eventually the man said the policeman said for no accountable reason and what's your load anyway
now you've seen the picture of the van haven't you
and how small it is a th UNK er thirty UNK van
ben gave the right answer literally speaking because it said it on the sheet of paper
but when he was asked what are you carrying anyway he said thirteen thousand fir trees
now you can imagine with a little van that size the policeman thought he was taking the UNK
and it was quite true cos there were thirteen thousand of these little t er he didn't explain the size he just said thirteen thousand fir trees
so of course the poor UNK with not having a sense of humour booked him and poor ben came back with a twenty pound fine
oh we're alright then
so he er he was most upset was poor ben so i did explain to him that what he had to do with policemen if they weren't feeling too good was to try and avoid saying things er quite as UNK as that
we got another job we often get erm er we used to g often get jobs from the yorkshire museum
but then they got their own van and they did most of them er but then again they a called on us and said can you come and do a little job for us
and we thought it was a bit suspicious because they have their ow they had their own van by then you see
so we went to the yorkshire museum there in the g in the gardens willy went along and er one er and they wanted two men instead of one
they normally wanted one man to go and er and that was it
but two men had to go
and when we got there we found out why
well it was what we had to carry you see
it was a glass case with a UNK in it
it was also another glass case
i just have to look at the list of this cos i always tend to forget this
oh yes that's right with an UNK
a live UNK about this high apparently
then there was another glass case with UNK in live UNK
and of course the blokes at the yorkshire museum said oh you're alright don't worry they're quite safe they're all sealed up
and as willy said at the time he says well it's alright you saying that but there's no doubt why we got the job
but that wasn't the end of it either
there was a UNK
i mean it was only six or seven foot long but it was a UNK nevertheless in a glass case
course you can imagine how careful he was carrying it with that in it
and all they wanted it to do was to go around the corner to UNK for the winter and then we s got the same in the spring to bring it back but by that time the UNK was a lot bigger
we moved it once and apparently it had to go a UNK after that cos when we moved it back it was about twelve foot long and then of course it g grew even larger than that
so those are the kind of odd little things that help to make our job interesting and a little bit more exciting
but then of course the kind of stories i give and the ones that most people like generally speaking are the accidents i have
that's what you've come for most of you see
now of course i'm not supposed to admit to these things being a professional bo b before i do admit it them as i am going to i have to say that er on an average year er year we do about one thousand five hundred jobs and in that time there will probably be about three or four UNK accidents that we'll have
last year's been better than that actually i think we've had about one or two
that is accidents where we genuinely do unfortunately damage something
we're covered then the insurance pays for whatever the cover is er and er that's how it works
now that is w er in fact it was a pretty good it's point nought three per cent i think of our jobs er that we carry out that you can have you're allowed to have an accident which i think is a fairly good rate
i mean anybody can have an accident
i had one chap who worked for me for over two years without one accident didn't scratch anything did everything right he was a wonderful UNK man and then one day he was carrying a big box containing some expensive UNK and he UNK on the top step of the stairs and the lot went down the whole box went right to the bottom
and it demolished about i think about a third of what was in it
now of course what happened is that we claimed we w went to the insurance and then they took they got a list of what was damaged and we replaced it for what he'd lost er exactly
so the man was happy enough and even at the time he realized that er it wasn't this UNK ch er mm fault entirely because the reason he UNK was cos the carpet was loose on top of the stairs
having said that a good removal man should have noticed that before he started
but as i say he was the most UNK removal man and after two years when he came in he was so upset
er had such a record i mean if he'd smashed just er a UNK or something like that it wouldn't have been so bad but to actually get rid of a third of all the UNK in one fell UNK was er well it was fairly excessive
but i am going to having said that i will tell you of the few accidents that have occurred over the years and one of them was mine in the early days when i was learning th the full size removal job
and this is the one people seem to like best i think
er it says something about human nature does this
erm you know the ring er the r er roundabout as you go down UNK er one of the l the roads goes off to UNK road and the other one is UNK green and then the other road goes off now to sainsburys
now at one time that road as it started off there were terraced houses there erm little tiny terraced houses and they were due to be demolished
yes
it's a long ti it's a car park now for that pub on the end there
and er we went to move this lady we got there about i suppose quarter past eight time a UNK day nice day it was
a huge orange and black van with the full the name of the owner on it of course because if you want to advertise something a removal van is one of the best things in the world for putting an advert on if you want people to see it that is
and when we got there we started to pack the small things on the front the l the luton as we call it over the cab
and then we got to the stage where we needed to get the UNK out
now these houses were of the kind that when you walk in through the door at the front you go into a l sitting room through the next door is what can be a kitchen UNK living room and the staircase isn't immediately obvious but what it is it's a door that looks like a cupboard
and you open this cupboard door you can tell there's a step at the bottom
you open what appears to be a cupboard door and in fact the stairs go around the corner and back up on themselves
now of course with UNK that are three foot wide it's an UNK to get them up the stairs
funnily enough a sing a double wardrobe which is four foot wide and eighteen inches deep if you split it in half as the old ones could be you end up with two pieces two feet and they actually can go up the stairs cos you can just get them underneath
but with a th a single wardrobe ironically you can't get them up the stairs because soon as you reach that step you've got another step so if you were to lift it up to the next step it'll hit the top of the d UNK so it won't go any further
even if you got it further it's wider than the UNK which is only two foot six and the r UNK three foot
so there's no way can you get them up the stairs
so it's a window job
now window jobs are easy believe it or not
they look spectacular but they're very easy to do if you know what you're doing
and i'll show you basically the theory is that you go inside in fact i can show you with this kind of window here
er don't very often have this you see when i go to talks that
but here you have a piece of UNK
you take that out
you do the same to that piece there
now once the UNK free you can pull this UNK out this window frame will come forward
it's on UNK
this isn't because it's set to but normally it's on UNK which go up to there up to that UNK wheel round and there's a big heavy weight inside which carries the window
it's an equivalent weight to that window frame there
so of course having pulled it out the cord is attached with two very thick nails and you can pull those nails out and then get you leave go of the cord
er y you don't actually leave go of the cord straight away
if you do you need a joiner
cos if you leave d go the cord straight away the cord just goes shooting up there the weight inside comes down here and you lose the cord and you have to take the whole lot p t apart in order to get the thing to work again
but what you do as a removal man is you get hold of the cord that you've pulled away from the side of the frame put a knot in it a loose knot then leave go gently because again if you don't leave go gently if it's an old cord when it gets to the reaches the knot it'll snap and you'll still lose the weight inside
so you let go gently then you do the same on the other side and then of course you've got this piece free
sometimes if the piece of furniture is very large you have to do the same with the top one where there's another lap there that one another piece of UNK there and this will come out as well
it means you'll lose a bit of UNK when you do the job but very u most often you can get it all back together with a few UNK of paint missing
more often than not you only need the bottom window out because most UNK go out that way you see
so that's what you've got you've got a situation like that
then you bring your ladder that you've brought with you for the job and you put it up leaning on this UNK so that essentially if that's the UNK the end of that table there it's up to here you see with the top of the ladder just above the UNK
you put a UNK over the top and then off you go
this is a two man job
you get your wardrobe its feet are that way on you get each side of it you put it on there and its bottom of the wardrobe UNK on top of the ladder
one man who's going to stay upstairs has the head of the wardrobe you go UNK i go UNK downstairs you see and then i climb up the ladder and the ladder remember is over the edge of the UNK
so about four UNK down from the top i stop
i'm quite well out from the ladder because it s at an angle and there in front of me is the wardrobe
all i have to do is push down the man inside pushes up and the wardrobe slowly comes up like that
i go down one or two UNK and the wardrobe follows me
it UNK at an angle it UNK on the er UNK of course because they are UNK er the UNK are at an angle like that so part of the UNK taken by the actual UNK
and down you go
you UNK down like this
the man at the top leaves go once you've got it well resting on the ladder and he runs down the stairs to meet you at the bottom by which time you've got to the bottom rung he comes takes one side of the wardrobe you take the other and that's all there is to it
done it i suppose i've done it eighty a hundred times by now but this was the first time you see
and th it was about quarter to nine
and that roundabout in those days and probably nowadays at that time gets UNK up with traffic all going to work
we didn't help with a huge van on the UNK on the UNK bank there
that was holding up traffic too
so everybody was watching this
all sit there UNK waiting to be able to move on
and i was going up this ladder
but there was a problem
the ladder wasn't long enough
it didn't go onto the UNK
it was about that short
about three four f foot short of the UNK
now i knew of no better and alan should've known better because he'd done a lot more removals than i had and he said oh you're alright UNK don't worry
just climb i'll pass it to you you'll get don't worry about that UNK
i said are you sure
he said yes d so i did
i UNK up the ladder
i was too naive not to do you see
anyway i got to virtually the UNK rung and of course i was smack up against the wall
i wasn't two or three foot back like this as i should have been i was up here
the wardrobe wasn't in front of me there it was there you see
so he started to push
the lady who was having operation done and wanted to see a UNK er a wardrobe come out through a window was standing down there just on the edge of the road to watch this UNK
and he started to push did alan and i started to go like that
i then started to put my foot to get the next rung down
and as i moved my foot about like this trying to find the next rung i began to realize things weren't quite right
the ladder began to move around below me
alan was still pushing quite happily
i was UNK like a UNK backwards like this by this time
and i was going like this doing a little dance on the ladder trying to find the next rung and the ladder was doing a little dance on the wall
and i suddenly realized at this stage that there was going to be something rather unexpected happening
well it probably was to be expected really under the circumstances
and i was very worried because the lady that was going to be paying for the job was just down there and if we weren't careful we were going to kill her with the wardrobe
and fortunately i suddenly had UNK just at the last possible moment
it very rarely happens to me
but i realized that i had to do something pretty dramatic to avoid too serious an accident
so just at the last moment as the ladder began to sweep that way i just pushed as er hard as i could in the air and the wardrobe flew up into the air in that direction the ladder flew off in that direction i flew off in this direction
and it was a bit like a fountain going in different directions you know how the water comes up and goes over
and we all landed on the pavement and road together
all in one fell bang
the wardrobe when it landed didn't it hit a corner but it didn't just UNK up it UNK
it just went crash and shot off into fifteen different pieces
honestly cos i counted them when i was putting it together
we missed the lady fortunately cos it had you see that last push it just flew right over her head and past her
and i mean one had to be grateful because she was much more concerned about whether i'd hurt myself falling off the ladder than her wardrobe
she wasn't worried about her wardrobe in comparison to me having landed on the on the road which i thought was extremely good considering that she i'd just demolished a nice piece of her f er a piece of her furniture
and of course being as it was with everybody watching we got applause for this
you can imagine they're all waiting there anything t to UNK you if you're waiting in a queue and there was this man throwing himself off UNK everywhere and we got very good
can you do it again
i didn't see it properly that time you know
some bright UNK said by god i know what firm i'll write i know what firm to get anyway in future
no i funnily enough i just landed er i didn't hurt myself at all
i think er i don't know why but i must have just landed and done a s
UNK and landed on my feet
and i was i d i said i was very sorry about the wardrobe and i'd replace it for her and see what i could do and she said oh don't worry love as long you're alright that's all i'm worried about really
which was extremely good
and in fact what i did do was erm went and bought her a UNK wardrobe took it to her and she was really pleased because apparently she thought it was a better one than the first one
and it was bigger and it was UNK and er so she was happy a fortnight later anyway
but er there was one bit that didn't bust
it was it was o it was a utility er now it depends on your age now you're going to have to admit something here you see
do you remember these utility UNK
yes
the only solid bit was at the front
the only er solid part of the wardrobe was in fact the front part which was made of sorry about that
which was made of wood and the rest is UNK at the side and back
you know the kind that if you lived in a house which had got an UNK floor when you opened the door the wardrobe falls over towards you
the only time it won't fall over you is when it's full of clothes but the problem is opening the door and getting the clothes in before it falls on you
it's one of those UNK you know the kind
and it has a mirror on the back and that was the bit that didn't break
good grief
as it fell it hit on the corner and the door opened and the corner of the door was stressed literally you could see stress marks on the wood but the mirror at the back was in one piece
now that UNK the one that you look into when you go in the UNK toilets
oh
in the club here
it's just the right UNK size and shape
i don't like wasting things you see
it is that is the sa it's the same mirror in fact that came from there
we got rid of all the rubbish put it in and started packing and erm about five minutes later the man from next door came out
and he said er ee he says they're terrible houses these you know
i'm going to have to move soon
i said aye they're awkward aren't they
he says aye terribly
he says you know when i came to this house i had to have split all my furniture into little bits so i could get it up the stairs
he says does your firm split furniture
i says you should have been here five minutes ago we did a marvellous job
we didn't get the job incidentally
i think somebody must have told him
another accident we had with an a wardrobe two of my lads had which was a funny one in UNK but i some when you carry a wardrobe funnily enough the easiest way often if you've got a tight corner you know as you go round a corner in a staircase you'll come from a landing and often turn right or turn left to go down if you put it at an angle like that then you won't get it round the corner without catching the UNK
so very often it's better to hold the wardrobe vertical and the man at the bottom end if you like holds it vertical and you go down holding it flat like that
and when you get to er to the landing you turn it round through forty five degrees and then down a little bit further and eventually you tip it over to go down the stairs
but very often you'll see wa men will wa go horizontal then it'll go vertical round the corner then nearly horizontal or at forty five down the stairs
and that's how you do it
but if y some of the finishes on some of the UNK are particularly slippery and if they're particularly slippery then i it's difficult often
and in this particular instance two of the lads were doing this very thing coming down the stairs
the back of the wardrobe you always have facing the UNK of course so that the shiny UNK on the outside so it's less likely to catch anything
er if you catch the corner of the UNK just as you're going by usually have a UNK over anyway but i it isn't going to damage
and he'd got round the corner ready to go down to the rest of the stairs which went down and then at the bottom turned round the corner again
and the man at the bottom missed his foot
he missed a step so he went down two instead of one
but he'd still got hold of it
but the man at the front hadn't been told this of course naturally enough and he couldn't see that so suddenly with a UNK the wardrobe left him two UNK worth instead of one at a time
so he shot forward and what you are trained to do as a good removal man is you drop if you're dropping anything you drop it on your toe or on your hand
it doesn't matter if you UNK yourself as long as you don't UNK the customer's furniture
so his foot went down two steps and sure enough down came the wardrobe onto his toe and didn't do any damage and then just UNK to the next step down
but having h done that and having gone off his toe he the wardrobe wasn't in front of him so much as it was down there by now and he'd still got hold of it you see so because of the momentum of going that way down two steps and one further one he shot forward and went right over the edge of the wardrobe
now of course the man at the top was depending on the man er the man at the bottom er was depending on the man at the top to be holding it to stop the weight fall on him
well there was nothing to stop him by now there were two weights there was the wardrobe sliding down the stairs and the man on top of it
so he suddenly came to a halt at the bottom of this stairs as it turned the corner with the bottom of the wardrobe UNK into his chest UNK him to the wall
the other man nose first was sliding down towards him and ended up nose to nose with the other man
with his feet up in the air at th the bottom end of the wardrobe or what was now the top end
so there they were facing each other the man a that being squeezed er his lungs being squeezed the man on the wardrobe n unable to move because he was upside down virtually facing him head to head
the man who owned the house was laughing at all this of course cos it did look very funny apparently
but the problem wasn't even helped there because you see he couldn't get up the stairs easily because the wardrobe was in the way
so what he had to do the customer in fact is end up by climbing up the UNK to get to the top so that he could get hold of the lad that was at the top get hold of him by the feet and pull him upwards and over and er finally free the man at the bottom
so you see it's a dangerous job as well
it's exciting and it's you can have all sorts
again f fortunately in this instance with that accident no damage was caused to his wardrobe and he was very happy with the removal and highly UNK by it i gather as well
so those are the kind of accidents you have
and then of course you've got the er the business of er places you're going to
er problems that you can have UNK when you go to some places
we had a job which was involved in loading up the day before this is in a big van in the previous job i had er a large van fu filling it full of a UNK of furniture in the afternoon sp spending two or three hours taking it out of store and we were asked to deliver it to an address in new brighton
anybody know where new brighton is
it's near UNK
UNK is it
UNK
on the UNK on the UNK
near liverpool
that's right yes
so off we went you see
we went there we took it with us all this load and what it was it was a forces couple and they were coming back to this country from germany or somewhere like that so we hadn't seen them
they'd had the stuff for a couple of years in the store and we were going to meet them there at number twenty five UNK avenue new brighton
we got there for about half past twelve in the afternoon
UNK on the door it was the last it was a UNK de UNK we found UNK avenue number twenty five it was the last one i the c in the UNK de UNK as it happened number twenty five
there weren't any more if it had been twenty seven it would have been impossible
knocked on the door nobody there
thought that's a bit funny
still you see if they're coming from somewhere like southampton or wherever they might have come maybe they were delayed on the journey and er so we went and had our half hour lunch
i rang up the boss and said we've got the right number haven't we UNK avenue
he says yes twenty five so we were happy with that
we went back and no still nobody there
i looked through the window and in fact there was furniture in the place
but then with services houses very often like the ones in york in manor drive they're in two halves
they don't look like that but they are UNK their er their back door goes into an upstairs converted flat
so with forces families very often in those days you might be delivering to the first floor
s still wondered about it and thought this is a little funny
then the man came out from number twenty three
what are you doing then
well we've come to deliver this furniture for mr so and so at number twenty five
oh no he said there's er there won't be any furniture moving from there or to there
i s well how do you mean
oh they're not moving
ah
i said well they must be we've got furniture
no he says we get a lot of this kind of thing you know
i said how do you mean
he says well he says i'm always getting mail here for twenty three UNK avenue new brighton
get loads of it
it's not for me
i said well it must be if it's to twenty three
oh he says no he says there's er and this was the bit that hurt
he says no th it's not here there's another new brighton
i said another new brighton
i didn't like to ask him
where
i'd spent all day going there hadn't i half a day going there
spent three hours the previous day packing it
the people needed to be living in the house that night
i mean with removals you can't say well i'm going to be two days late
cos the UNK got to be living there
so i said where's the where's the other new brighton
i've already done a hundred miles where's the other ne well he said well actually it's in wales and i thought oh no
and i had UNK of it s on the south corner of wales
anyway it wasn't that bad
it was in an area called UNK just beyond UNK about thirty forty miles on
so we UNK into the van and off we went
and believe you me we found this little village of new brighton
it's got a main street and i think it'd got two other streets and that's about all and sure enough one of them was UNK avenue
we got there for four
they said we are pleased to see you
i said not half as pleased as we are to see you
wouldn't have happened with a postcode would it
oh no without a postcode it wouldn't
and of course it wouldn't if we'd been more accurately given the address but
the trouble was in many ways is the man that booked it had thirty five years' experience of removals he knew all the country you see
now i've told this tale before and some bright UNK said aye but th do you know there are five in the british isles
and so i when i got back from the talk i had a look and sure enough there are throughout the british isles there are five new UNK
there's one in leeds
so you see you you'd have gone the wrong place wouldn't you if you'd followed what
i just said you see
shows you never to er
no well er i was learning you see quickly from these things learning fairly quickly
we went to another one on a saturday job
it was one of these jobs we were hoping it wasn't too big a load but it was a UNK we were hoping to get mi finished for the mid afternoon about three o'clock in the afternoon or four perhaps
and erm so we set off and i can't remember which village it was but it was towards the UNK estuary somewhere and it was what i call a UNK de UNK village
that is it UNK out and that was the end of the road you see
you went off a main road went down another road and the village was at the end of a road and that was the end of it
you didn't you couldn't come out any other way just the one way in and that was the finish of it
so we d weren't worried about that a nice big van we'd got it was a big one so we'd got plenty of room thirteen foot high it was nice size van for the job and we filled it up and plenty of space left over off we went
when we got to within quarter of an hour q sorry quarter of a mile of the actual village itself and remember it's quarter of a mile i'm talking about not ten yards fifteen yards away we saw a railway UNK in front of us
well obviously there'd be a you know er a way underneath a tunnel underneath
there was but it said on it twelve foot six
and our van said UNK we was thirteen foot you see
well you always know that you know when they say twelve foot six it isn't quite right they give or take a few inches
so we UNK forward and in the middle of the archway and there was about that much and it wouldn't go
cos the back end you know is slightly higher than the front end and we'd just got it in and the front was about that so it wasn't gonna oh well can you imagine the UNK there would be
walking a household of furniture quarter of a mile up the road
i couldn't imagine we could be there till sunday moving it you know
so you let the tyres down
ooh there we are we've got some bright UNK here
now i didn't think of that because again i was fairly new but the lad that was doing the job said oh don't worry UNK we'll sort this out
so sure enough we let the tyres down sufficiently for it to be UNK and not to destroy the tyres on the way there but soft enough just so that it would go down and we UNK it through and roy got it through the middle and off we went
got to the other end and i think we were UNK in about an hour and a half or so
two hours something like that
turned it round on the way back driving UNK towards the arch very happily past the pub on the left and the playing fields where they were about to play rugby i suspect
went past the pub you see just about to reach the archway and i said roy
for UNK sake stop
now when you have a house full of furniture it UNK about five tons usually
and five tons on the back of a van causes the back of a van to go down
so there was we'd already taken the air out to get us through
we'd now no weight on the back of the van you see
so
yes
she's jumping ahead is this
she's UNK me stories isn't she
yes
i was sweating you could imagine thinking god we're going to have to take the wheels off and drag it through with a tractor or something like that on UNK cos we needed the van for monday and there wasn't going to be a lot of t but then suddenly yes a again i suddenly th
i remembered the noise i remembered the noise as we went past the pub so i went back to the pub and sure enough there were fifty sorry thirty UNK men
it was er u er rugby union obviously
there were at least thirty big men
i said excuse me lads just before you start playing can you give us a hand
what is it
you know
i says well i've got a van and it's too light at the back
can you pa oh they thought this was r great
and they all jumped on the back and under we went
so we did we got our van back home again you see
had they not done it before
i would have thought it was a regular UNK
well no we'd never had that UNK
i mean you very rarely get things that close you see
mm
er but when you think about of it i it is it's logical
must have cost you quite a lot to buy them each a drink
oh no they were too good UNK they were all UNK john
not like you
they were
UNK fellows in the van i'd have come straight back home with them
oh dear
ah but that's another story
that's another story
you're lucky it wasn't a UNK club
yeah
so that was another problem you see
so everything happens
there are always different things occurring
one of them of course is estimates
now today if you rang me up to do removals we don't work the same way
one of the reasons by being s a small removal firm doing light removals i'll send one two three men out
but if you wanted a single bed moving then the cheapest way would be just to have one man he comes we charge you for the time we take with a minimum of an hour's charge
so we charge for the time we go to the first address pick the thing up go to the second UNK and get back to depot
if it's done within the hour we charge the hour
if it takes an hour and five minutes we charge an hour and a quarter to get for the time to get back
and of course if you book over the phone then it can be done that way
but if we were doing as we do a lot of jobs like that and i had to go round and estimate every one it would cost me more to go round and estimate than it would to do the jobs
you see adverts in the press that say free estimates well of course they aren't
if you get a firm that's doing big removals inside the cost of that is the cost of an UNK to go around and look at half the jobs he's not going to get
he's going to give a price and somebody else is going to give a price in competition and half the time if he's lucky he'll get the jobs
but i did learn that when i was doing full scale removals
as i say nowadays i get the information from you over the phone and then when we've got somebody who said oh no it's only a small flat i've got this and this and that's the big pieces of furniture er if it's somebody that's done it on spec i say well look give me a ring back in an hour if er when you've come off the phone you er there's something you've forgotten
or sometimes if they're not sure i'll say well before we book it can you just have a run round the house and then ring me back tell me actually what there is to go
and then i can give them an idea of price and we can work out what it's going to cost
if it's s something like that and they tell me the amount of furniture and if two thirds of the van will be filled with big stuff and then they tell me there'll be half a dozen boxes i assume there'll be at least four times that number of boxes and if it's still going to go on we'll do it
we had a job this week that was booked in
er UNK i was on wasn't i
that's right yes
and erm so er if people do that and er this UNK this week he rang and he was sending messages via the secretary instead of getting on the phone to me and me finding out what there was he finally he s he said there'll be about an hour's work
tell him there's about an hour's work
oh i think there'll be an hour's work she said
now i know the man
so i said there's no way that what you've just told me will go in an hour i said it'll take at least a couple of hours and what about all the small stuff he'll have in the house
so she UNK that and i heard it well what about the small stuff
oh we haven't got much
we'll take that in the car
came back again
so i said well no i said two hours it's got to be otherwise you'll never cover for that
d i didn't want to give him a false impression
so er it was decided that he it would be one man because he would give a hand
so he only wanted o one man and it w if i allowed two hours
i've got to make allowances you see cos i've got to fill the day f with jobs for the other lads so if i allow two hours i've got to fill the other six
so i need to know beforehand within half an hour or so
now we got off the phone and knowing the man i allowed three
his wife rang up the following day
could we move the piano as well at the same time
i said not with one man we can't no
i said
we always use at least three for a piano because although two men can lift them very often if you're going round awkward corners it helps to have a third person s to steady them
so i says what we can do is i'll do an hour for you we'll move the piano and other bits bicycles in this case that he had we'll shift them to the house close by drop two men off and one UNK come and do the remainder of the work
does that sound re
yes she was happy with that
i said we've got one man booked anyway for the re oh she says don't want one he's hopeless is my husband he'll never manage you'd better put two men on the second half as well you see
so i just said in passing i said well your husband's allowed up to two hours he thinks it's only gonna t ooh she's says it won't take that no
good lord no it'll take more
g allow another hour will you
well i already had you see
so there we were one hour plus three
we did the job this week
seven hours it took
seven hours
i told them that at one we'd be going away on another job cos we'd got another job booked in but in fact i UNK everything so that in fact we could do it for them
but that's the kind of problem you meet
he was quite right it didn't take an hour
it didn't take an hour you're right
i'll tell him that when i see him yes
when he's paid the bill
but that's the kind of thing that can happen cos y people aren't aware
when i moved from my own place er in UNK to here i still UNK how much furniture i'd got
and it is very difficult to assess
so with the big firms when you're doing a full house and you aren't just going to have a few bits like you would for a light removal off you go and you estimate
i remember going on one of the first ones with the boss
it was in UNK
end of a UNK de UNK
and we went in the house three bedroomed semi detached house
walked in the lady said oh right you can have a look round and showed us the rooms
the two main bedrooms a small back room living room er drawing th front room and the kitchen
we saw all the furniture and my boss didn't list everything
i do
i was learning a lot over the period of making mistakes as you can imagine
so i was learning from my own mistakes and others at the time er things like getting the right county where the new brighton happen to be and things like that i was learning
and er so he didn't list it
he'd had thirty five years' experience he was looking at th and in his UNK eye putting the UNK into the van as it were to work out how much space it would take
he said right yes and he looked at that and is that everything
have you anything outside in the garage
well my husband's got the key
well there's nothing much there's a bench there's a couple of tea UNK there's an old cooker and i think probably five or six bo is that all
yes that's all there is
oh fair enough if you're sure yes you see
so we left and the boss told me that how he would work it out and how it would take probably something in the order of two thirds of that particular van that w we were going to use if it was packed about six foot high
brilliant you see he's done it for so many years can work out the space and everything
sent an estimate
now estimates are actually that
you estimate that
but if you send an estimate you more or less have to say what you're moving as well because if there's more than that and you don't put down what you're moving then you're p stuck with the estimate really and in p practice that's what usually happens you give an estimate and then you do it for that price
so he sent the estimate and we got the job
it was to near leeds
i went with the boss to do it so that we could follow up the practice of the theory you see
the husband was there then
we took his four poster bed down that he wanted taking down that he UNK for some peculiar reason and then we moved all the other bits of furniture and as we w were sort of getting most of the furniture out of the first bedroom he said don't forget the loft will you
so we said what loft
oh didn't my wife tell you about the loft
no she didn't tell us about the loft
oh well would you like to go and have a look
so we went and had and there was a little space you know normal bit bigger than average and a little UNK thing and it opened up and down came some steps and we went up with UNK i must say
there was as much in the loft as there was on the whole first floor
my the boss said a few things under his breath came down the steps and we went back into the van
cos we had to UNK it you see because it was going to take a it was going to take probably not it was going to go right to the end with this lot on
so up it went higher
not the six foot he'd thought seven or eight foot we went up and started to pack away again
a little bit UNK my boss said er to the owners there's nothing else that we haven't seen is there
well have you seen the UNK
well your wife said there w oh well you'd better come and have a look you see
so we went and had a look at the garage
did it have a car in it
no there wasn't a car
it was a two it was a two car garage
full to the UNK
full
to the UNK
oh rubbish all UNK
boxes
there was er there was the cooker er there was a cooker there was two UNK there was a UNK ba er washing machine there was a and it all needed to go apparently
so of course inevitably what happened is we got the house lot in just took it to this place in leeds got finished with that load and back for four which is what the estimate had covered us for and then we had to start all over again with what was in the garage
even then we were in for a surprise you see because at the end of the you know how most houses have a UNK plot within which the house is put
but the ones at the back aren't
on the corner of the UNK de UNK they go off at an angle don't they
and depending whether it's a UNK plot or whether it isn't or not or if it's slightly at an angle then some of the corner houses have a fairly long gardens
well we'd seen to the back of the garden anyway cos we could see the hedge going across like that at forty five degrees
but he said to us you won't forget the stuff in the hut will you
cos we'd had a UNK by then and had a look round and you see
well we said what hut
well apparently that wasn't the end of the garden you see cos that came across like this and when you went through a gap in the hedge about another twenty yards further on in the far distance it seemed there was the hut
and when i opened the door everything fell out
so we'd got about forty yards to march to the er the van before we even got that on board
we finished that job about ten thirty that night
and of course my boss because he hadn't listed what we'd seen
was UNK with the estimate
was UNK with the estimate
and that's what he had to pay
for twice the amount of work
for twice the amount of work yeah
so i again it's something i learned from that
it was funny actually it was on that one i think he was a little bit erm sexually orientated more than average this gentleman cos he'd got the four poster bed
this was before they became a popular thing you know
this was an original he was very proud of this and he kept telling us about this
his wife kept a distance she said nowt but he was quite proud about this
but you don't get this very often now but you it's funny how sometimes you get gifts when you're on removals and this was this particular instance
because not only had all this lot to be moved but halfway through the removal he suddenly remembered there was something else needed moving shot to the stairs with a white face opened the door in under the stairs and out came all the bits and pieces from there
oh don't forget these lads but he said i've got a present for you lads
UNK of tone
that th w UNK
of UNK magazines
here you are lads get rid of them quick won't you
we used to have a stock of them
they don't now with liberated women they don't allow it now you know
the men are no longer liberated and can have them so they just y it's quite funny but you don't get them now
it's funny how er th trends change but that was a was quite a common UNK was that men feeling ashamed of what they'd got but trying er in terms of these magazines giving them as if they were doing you a favour
and of course for some of the lads it was
they weren't there in the they weren't in this office for very long before they disappeared elsewhere
and er but it's funny how that should happen
the UNK to that sad case actually was when after we'd moved them we got another phone call six months lad er later from this very lady who was leaving the house and moving out
she'd had enough of him obviously
magazines four poster bed the lot
yes that was that was sufficient for her
and we moved her back so we did get something else out of the job as well
do you think a four UNK more UNK than a UNK
not me personally no i
yes
ye no i yes i f would have thought it could be quite UNK in certain circumstances
but i wouldn't know of course
yes maybe i don't know
yeah
yeah
i've not had that ye that problem with that
yeah no i'd er
so there you ar now then we get another kind of job
this one i'm going to tell you about are we alright for time
are you not in
yes
you're alright so far
erm er this o this one is not one single job as it happens but it is the kind of thing that we have come up against before and i've put them the things together in one so that we don't identify people really under the circumstances
but
in the early stages we were we you know used to take phone calls and take them at face value and we got a phone call like this
erm lady's voice
er i wonder er what time do you start in the morning
so he said well we start at mm half past eight o'clock time usually
could you start a job at about half past nine in the morning
yes madam no problem there
how long would it take you to get the furniture out
would you be out by midday
i can see what's coming
so i said well it depends how much there is you know we are only a light removal firm we don't have oh no well there's no problem there it's only half a UNK
now the advice a few years er be from the s solicitor was not in quite the th precisely these words but if somebody was leaving i mean if the wife was leaving the husband the instructions were basically love get your furniture out hide it somewhere and argue about who owns what afterwards
and that was the kind of advice some years ago was being given by solicitors
so what we were doing of course is we were moving in taking her half of the stuff and moving it out
now on one occasion as i say this is a UNK this is of several things put together but one happened rather like this
we got there round about the half past nine
UNK had gone of course
er it was a UNK de UNK job
and we started s to put the stuff in at the front and whatnot you see
and then we started to get to the big stuff
it always happens with the big stuff really
we've got well under way with the job she's very white sh you can imagine why she's feeling very you know she's very sort of UNK as you move things out and she's deciding what to move
now on that particular day because the husband is unaware of these things you see
but that particular day she didn't know beforehand this was planned a few weeks in advance as you can imagine
but he's off to see his area manager in leeds
it's an unusual day cos he's got to have create a good impression with the boss you see the area manager there might be something in it for him
so he's rushing around and flapping this morning before he goes off just before nine
and off he shoots in his car his splendid company car
up he goes off he goes
we arrive a few minutes later you see to plan and we're putting the stuff in
he UNK something and comes back
he's just UNK his outfit as he's in the car driving up the tadcaster road and he looks with horror
he's forgotten to put his tie on
so what does he do he turns round and comes back
and it's UNK law you know because nearly always these things happen
mm
when we've got the worst bit
it's either a six foot high with sharp edges f fridge UNK or a cooker which all the UNK got UNK on and is sliding out of our hands as we carry it
and sure enough down the street this man drives
can you imagine you're in his position
a happily married man you think coming down the road and suddenly there are some UNK actually with a van parked outside your house moving what you recognize as your fridge UNK out through the door
now y i mean you've got no UNK th y idea that this is going to ha happen at all
so you leap
and he UNK out of the vehicle what the bloody hell do you think you're doing with this lot
so i look a bit UNK cos we've he's just come from nowhere UNK to a halt
moving this fur
bloody UNK or something
it's the wrong bloody house
i'm not moving
i say well i'm very sorry sir but the lady inside says y the what
but the lady inside she said to er take it back in
and the lo the that bloody lot
i want it back inside
but i we've been to i don't give a damn what you've and er of UNK naturally enough you see
it's a job you get shouted at is removals very often
so you go to the door and you open the door and you walk backwards
it's like one of these films in reverse you know
and this time you're coming backwards and
this way on
and the lady's going what on earth happened
i want that out i want that there's a man behind us and he says if we don't bring it in he's going to kill us
oh good god no
well and then there's y er y he can't get in the house cos you're in the way and he's trying to push past and y we don't know where the hell to go
you know we don't know what to do with the bloody bit
get the bloody thing back in the k
oh you know i don't want it in the kitchen oh
so then there's a s set to inside the UNK
now of course the difficulty you can't i it's a personal thing and you don't like standing watching all this operation going on for too long
at the same time you've got to try when there's a break in the in the shouting to explain that the longer they shout the c more it's gonna cost if you actually do the removal
and even if you don't it's gonna c you know and er you get a few choice words and then eventually you say well look we'll go outside and sit outside for a few minutes and d and wait till you've decided what and don't forget i time you kn you kn
yeah
and you know
and so you wait outside
it's fifty
the result that is
fifty usually
you know you th either come back and they're UNK each other and UNK and there're a few tears and everything and er everything's UNK and you start UNK back in with all the bloody stuff you've just brought out from beforehand you see
the other fifty percent of the time of course is i it's split again because they're arguing like and he comes charging out take the bloody lot i don't care
and oh well i'm not telling you see
cos as i say it's a mixture of a few you see
but actually in between i'd forgotten the in between bit of course is while all this UNK going on the neighbourhood didn't realize she was moving or perhaps one or two did
but you know it's a strange thing you don't realize how UNK english people are
how often they come out and clean their windows
UNK their UNK
paint the door
tell you this time they were out all in full force you know
like a cup of tea
whilst you're waiting
what's going on in there
you know it's
and it's not professional to say anything
it's professional to take the tea of course but you don't say anything after you've got it
but of course he comes up take the bloody l
and so i er you er you start to take it back out again
and then of
just back like a UNK backwards and forwards
and so it goes on
and eventually you either do and he drives off and nearly runs into UNK into a UNK or something like that on his way when he's finally given up or else sometimes as i say they get together and er everything's UNK
but of course the problem then is after all that whichever way whether you move them or you don't you've taken time
you've probably taken two hours getting the stuff out and then putting it back in again and if you move it you've taken a lot longer
nobody wants to pay
the bloke certainly doesn't want to pay he didn't book you
the woman doesn't want to p play because she doesn't think it's her fault
and if they get together neither wants to pay because they haven't done anything we've only taken the stuff out and put it back in again
so the usual thing eventually after five months waiting for payment is to find out the bloody solicitor that told them this you see and inform the solicitors that er his client has not yet paid us and we it ought to be done and eventually that's how we get the money
well it was her fault really for not checking he'd got his tie on
yes that's right
so as you see it's not a boring job
one time no a long time ago which it might actually might you might have been at the meeting i don't know
but this club as you know opens at eight o'clock in the evening
now i've done removals before then not so much now but i at one time used to be out on the road doing removals myself very often and i would get in for about seven o'clock in the evening get a quick grab something to eat rush round this place put the fires on and get it ready
now today there are two people working one or two there's somebody on the door somebody o on the bar because we get fifty people into the club often now
but in those days in the early days we used to be lucky to get twenty or thirty didn't we
and we'd maybe just have two meetings on
so one couldn't justify having two people on board doing the job when in fact what was involved was bringing you in signing you in and then serving you
so i used to do both jobs sign you in then rush to the bar
it was like UNK towers i'd be to the bar
it's alright for you UNK who know what it's like but imagine somebody new coming to the club
you wander in you pay your ninety p and i say if you just go through that door please and the next minute i'm out at the bar as well saying what would you like to drink
but that's how it had got to be in the early days otherwise it would have cost more to run than i took
and it was one of those such nights that at half past seven i'd just got most of the fires set and ready to er just on and going and i'd half an hour to get everything UNK and ready for eight o'clock opening and the door at the back went which was where the office used to be
and it's another shouting job again
open the door want me bloody furniture back
that's all he said
i said sorry
sorry sir
you've taken my furniture
i says i beg your pardon
it's gone
i said i'm sorry can you tell what's the name
so he told me his name i think it's something like mr
i said sorry we haven't moved a to you moved my bloody furniture today
it's gone i tell you
i go out to work this morning at nine o'clock i come back i open the kitchen door four o'clock this afternoon walk into my kitchen empty
it's all gone
i couldn't believe it
i went into the living room
all my bloody UNK gone from the living i went upstairs the lot's gone
and you've got it
i said i'm sorry mr but we haven't got er come with me into the office i'll show you we've nothing till for a mr
i said where's it from
he said UNK
oh
i said UNK
i said just a minute but we've had a mrs
mrs cooper rang us up
we've taken her yes we've moved her stuff to th to the store i said
that's her
my UNK
she's only been with me six weeks
i said serious he said i want i want my stuff back now
i says i er no messing around i want it back
well i says i'm very sorry but i says it's six miles away in a store we don't attend stores in the evening i've nobody to come d i've got where the hell do you think i'm going to sleep tonight
i says well i must admit it is yes i you know i he said i'm going to get a policeman if you're not careful
he says i want a UNK i want my bloody b furniture back tonight otherwise i'm going to get a policeman
well by this time it was ten to eight and i'd got all these members were going to be outside i was going to have to let them in and serve them and i was getting a bit UNK you see
i said well look you go and get the policeman i'll ring my solicitor up and then we'll sort it out from there
so off he went in high UNK as you can imagine you know red faced excited
well you would be wouldn't you if you'd nowhere to sleep on the night
imagine going home tonight opening the back and there's nothing there
it's not funny is it
you know
so i rang my solicitor and he wasn't there
so i then rushed to the front of the building i said look will you come in please
go up to your rooms and i'll take your money off you later
i'm sorry i can't serve you now but i'll get back to the bar as soon as i can
so these poor people came in and i s it was actually it was an UNK club night
that's why you might have been on it you see
and er or yourself maybe
do you remember that
no
it was many years ago but it's it definitely i this is what happened
i mean probably the members didn't realize what was going on
and er so i shot back to the phone tried a second partner finally the third partner in the solicitors firm that i deal with was there
so i explained what had happened
he says well you're quite right n y i cos i didn't think we you know i'd said to the man already it's quite possible i wouldn't be able to really take the stuff out of store for him
he'd have to t cos you see there was no proof of ownership
mrs was the person that had contacted me
so he said you're quite right
mrs made a verbal contract with her
when you arrived at the house she was in residence
so you'd made a verbal contract over the phone with a lady who you found living on the premises so you had every right to believe that she owned the furniture
if that man wants his furniture back and it is his because it might not be he'll have to get a court order
so i told him that when he came back with the policeman
i know
well the policeman was there anyway wasn't he
you know
and the policeman just well of course this is a civil matter he UNK he wanted to get his tea no doubt you know and he wanted to be off
so he r he disappeared from view and the UNK down a bit
i said look i'm i really am very sorry
i said i wish i could provide you with a bed i can't
i said i wish i could because i am sorry for your situation
but i cannot take it out of store because i would be breaking the law effectively if i did
i said all you can do basically is go to a solicitor get a court order unless i can persuade the lady herself to let you have the furniture
now i'd also in this time rung up the er forwarding address in manchester rung up the telephone number i'd been given of the forwarding address
because she'd paid the bill for the removal
and i had to have an address to send the bill for the storage which i would send to her on account every three months
and she'd gone you see
she'd so i thought well i'd i well he'd i didn't say what he'd done i didn't ask about that i mean i had i had enough trouble without asking questions like that you see
and erm i rang the lady it turned out it was mother that was on the phone at manchester
and she said oh yes i says well i'll tell you what's happened oh she says my daughter's a UNK
she UNK s i you know i've always had trouble with my oh she i can understand the poor man she said i do feel sorry
i said well er don't worry about that i said er you know but can you give me your daughter's phone number or address so i can contact her and get this sorted out
i wish i could love but she says i can't help you
she said she's just went on she go she a after your removal today she got on a boat at southampton and she's on her way to australia
and she was
and what was the outcome of this
well within about ten days i got a phone call from a solicitor er in leeds telling me to let me ha let the bloke have the stuff
i said well i'm sorry you'd better refer to my solicitor who's told me that you need a court order
and the trail went dead for about another fortnight i didn't hear any more so i thought well maybe it isn't you see maybe it isn't this UNK furniture after all
a fortnight later from bradford another set of solicitors rang up explained that they understood the circumstances said look c could i hold the stuff there and what was i going to charge for the storage etcetera er and they would be going to have to get an UNK from this lady in australia at some stage in order to give er him the chance to have the stuff back
they'd need an UNK to say this is not mine it belongs to mr er whatever his name was i've forgotten it now
and er
mr thank you
and er so that's what he had do you know how long it took all that lot
a year
what the hell did he do meanwhile
carried away anyway
well you see i didn't know what had taken place
he said it was my UNK you see
now i i'm only a UNK in these matters
yes y yes that's right y
UNK
y that's right yes
and obviously i think it was a revenge job by the sound of it
and it took a year for him to get it back
in fact then he by that time he was living in leeds so he had to pay for the cost of removal from my store to leeds
i charged him only half the normal price
so i didn't make a loss but i didn't make a profit on the bit of space that i need that i was using for storage cos i thought it was only fair to the poor bloke
and in fact it shows a lot for human nature because he was UNK away at the end of it all and he even gave the lads who did the job a tip
so it's er but it's a funny world isn't it eh
and er so not only is it fun and exciting but quite risky
you know you
so that gives you an idea of what goes on with doing removals
there are all sorts of other UNK but i think by now i've yes i've just about er had e had enough time i think now haven't i
bef er i'll start boring you soon with other bits and pieces
any questions at all
have you ever been threatened with anything
not quite but these split jobs where you have a split between couples it can get a little bit heavy at times
but my instructions for the lads have always been that if you go to a job for a lady particularly and then a man comes along and starts to get UNK you'll have to explain to the lady you may have to leave it temporarily and go back
but we've never quite had to do that
erm but it's been near
i remember one the chap called dave in york who er has a removal firm
yes well i was on a r a radio programme with him at one time and er and he was telling about some of his UNK stories and there was one where he was doing a similar job from a UNK and he picked the furniture up and had to drive down this long drive to get onto the road and the farmer who presumably was the man who felt er an injustice to him was being done as it were he was on his tractor saw the van moving down the UNK took a UNK to the road edge and fired a shotgun at his van
and he said as he drove off down the road it went UNK and there were these hole little holes in the side of his van
so we've never come as er as quite as close as that
his brother UNK er who has another removal firm in york erm he had a funny experience too that i've not UNK had
we move UNK on ground floor
we're light removals but we will move a piano with three men
i have moved UNK upstairs in certain cases where it's a very open staircase and a straight one but we won't normally do that cos er we need the equipment to do it the proper UNK and everything and we haven't got those things because we wouldn't be asked upon to do it often enough
and er but he did one did UNK and he was UNK up the stairs with three men pushing you see two at the bottom one at the top UNK it and the top of the piano started to disappear into the staircase
because it was an old house that they were UNK and it had got so much rot in it and UNK and he said he said he said th there they were walking up one minute and the next minute the piano was just going down through the stairs
and he said eventually with ropes and various other tackle it took seven of them to lift the piano back up again out of the gap that it had produced in the stairs and get it up the stairs
so y tell you it's amazing the kind of remarkable things
one other one if i may just that i've just remembered that a lady who had a again this is when i was big removals
she lived in a one bedroom flat in st george's place as you may know those council flats
very small very compact very nice little places
and he booked it over the phone said is it a standard flat which was a silly thing to ask cos to everybody who lives in a house they've a standard amount of furniture
nobody believes they are excessive
oh i've got an average amount they say and everybody's average is different of course
living on her own so he assumed it take three and a half hours did the boss
she mentioned that she kept had some UNK furniture
you know the kind that lovely UNK dark brown furniture
we arrived on this job first floor and we went and opened the door
she said i must mention i've had a few more deliveries from UNK so we walked into the living room
you know how people collect stamps
and if you've got a c country's stamps they collect the whole lot you know they don't just collect they collect the whole range all in one f and she'd done this with her furniture
she lived on her own i think she was an ex nurse if i remember rightly
and she said the extra bits she'd got completed the collection
they were wall units
you know six foot high one of them was six foot wide
the other one was only four foot wide because of course she needed to collect the whole lot you see and then the next one was three foot wide
all three of those had just arrived the day before
plus a drop leaf table
she'd got about six little normal dining chairs and then there were the UNK chairs she'd got about six of those
she'd got all the UNK of occasional tables they then did
she'd got the sort of UNK
she'd got a bureau
everything in the bloody catalogue at UNK she'd got
the only problem was that there was no space to walk
and in this last day she must have been camping about i don't know how but somehow she was UNK i she probably didn't she was using the living room as a store i could only think that she couldn't possibly live in it
and we had to shift this lot
but added to that when you went into the bedroom there was the normal wardrobe and the dressing table and the chest of UNK
behind the wardrobe were there all sorts of things
on top of the wardrobe w there were big plastic bags
full
UNK a block
under the bed
there wasn't any dust under the bed really because there was no room for the dust because it was jam packed
full of bags
sh don't forget she said there's a coal house outside
i said i'm sorry love we don't move coal
oh she's says it's not coal no i don't use it for coal she sa i've got gas central heating we don't need no it's just that er well there are a few things in there
we i mean you know with coal houses they they're about this wide about that high of course you don't put the coal that high do you cos it's forty five degrees job
and it goes back about six or seven foot doesn't it usually
and you open just like a little shelter
same thing as i mentioned before
it all fell out
bags
yes certainly
she'd got all the clothes she'd ever had
you know those little party dresses what are they called UNK dresses
mm
that five year olds have to go for parties
she'd still got one of those in a plastic bag
everything that she must have had in clothes she'd kept
all the shoes from little tiny ones right up to the current
oh
she'd got a bag full of light UNK
not new light UNK the ones that she'd taken out and put into the plastic bag
there w honestly they were all she wasn't going to chuck anything away at all
i forget what UNK this is there's a word for it isn't there
recycling
is it
well recycling yes but not the UNK
yeah
UNK yeah
no she didn't
i mean i don't know whether she thought she could put them in the garden when she got to the new place and they'd grow but
there were five dozen UNK literally five dozen UNK of jam
and as you can imagine they weren't all fresh
forty UNK of UNK
she could use the sugar she'd got for building bricks for a new shed i reckon the amount she'd got there
and all solid you know
it was all over the place
under the sink behind the cupboards every single where you could imagine was UNK a block
that job took nine and a half hours
it was estimated for three and a half
because we started in the afternoon that day should have finished about half past four five went on till seven and then UNK went ne next morning to get the next lot
but the UNK thing of all was that the flat she was going in the floor area was less than the one she'd left
the only gain she'd got was it was about another two or three foot up to the ceiling
and that li literally was what we did
i mean she was UNK
she thought it was great marvellous you know she was very pleased with us
i bet she was at that price
and she was a marvellous woman you know wonderful
but all i mean the shoes and the lot and everything
nothing went at all
so y you see there's another s strange funny thing that can happen you see
and this is ordinary days
have you ever sorry UNK
have you ever gone to remove someone and they've been still been in bed or been having their breakfast or something you know
or something like that yes
or making a meal of it y making a meal it you mean
yes
oh yes i mean very often i mean er you often go you very often
i mean if somebody rings you up and says how much will it cost if it's er a sort of full removal you're doing you say well are you packing or aren't you
because if you're packing then we'll dr bring er the forty boxes out fore beforehand
we don't use tea UNK incidentally we use we wine boxes that we get from wine merchants empty ones
because people will put books into tea UNK then you can't lift them
you have to do a chinese walk like this with them with a man on the other side holding the box like this because there isn't the distance
so we use cardboard boxes and even if you're moving UNK you put half or a third of what you'd put in a tea chest goes into er a cardboard box
you carry it out and as long as the lid as long as you pack stuff so that the top doesn't come above the le level of the lid you won't get any damage done and it's much easier
and again a man a removal man you see can leave cardboard boxes you don't need to have them by we'll collect them if you want
but on the other hand as is often the case there's so much that you've got you don't need that when you finish your removal you want a whole lot of boxes in the corner out the way until you've sorted er everything else out
so th that can happen
but if people don't pack as was the example of this job to this last week that took till erm the time it was it was four o'clock as i said when they finished
erm that would have been much quicker if they'd bothered and organized them but they hadn't organized anything
they were just there
and the i suppose they expected to UNK round like that and all go into the er the boxes
and that's why it took a long time
we don't mind doing it
but basically if people plan and pack beforehand these for example erm the black plastic bag your dustbin bags marvellous things
if you've got clothes your coats and dresses and fold them over once and then put them into a bag like that and we put them gently on top of the load they come to no harm at all
and big things like your er cooking UNK your pans they are best put into black plastic bags tied at the top
cos then they take any shape up you see
when you put them on board they just will change shape so they'll fit in and they're marvellous for packing in
and they're a way of getting a lot a lot of things in a in a in a space
er but that kind of thing can make such a difference but people sometimes are as you say they're not prepared
i mean i once had a job it was booked er now what do they call the road
i always forget the name of the road
you know marble arch what's the long road that goes off marble arch
UNK road
UNK road thank you yes
we had a b i got a booking one night
i should have known better but i got a booking about half past nine in the evening
can you pick up for us please perhaps a part load price for a bedroom suite from number seven UNK road when you're going
and as it happened we were likely to be able to go
what you do is i er erm at one time when business was UNK you may have as many as twelve enquiries over one month for the london area
so you'd try and parcel together er say four
and if you got four together you may be two down or three down and one back you could make it pay and share the cost out between everyone
and i was able to do this so that half the fee was being paid for a three piece suite going some boxes to another address and then this bedroom suite was taking the other half of the charge back
and i arranged it on that day at the time
they went down in one day UNK the two separate loads got round to number seven UNK road the next day
it was a shop
and when we think about it UNK road number seven it is pretty early on i ought to have realized but i didn't know london well enough then
so we went into the shop said sorry to bother you but mr so and so er number seven is there a flat upstairs
no it's our UNK upstairs
it was only a two storey building
er well we're after oh there's nobody li nobody lives here at number seven UNK road
somebody would've been drunk that night you see half past nine at night thought it was a good trick
oh
so i'd gone all the way down there and come back for half price basically and lost on it
so you learn
and we never heard from it again
if it had been genuine they'd have been on the phone quick enough if we'd not arrived
but there was no nobody lived there at all
and it was just and of course what else can you do in many ways
as i say i ought to have had UNK enough UNK road the first part of it is purely commercial as you know er erm but i hadn't realized that at the time
so that's you know the kind of thing
when you say that people have been bad packing things
yes
i always understood that if you packed things you weren't insured
no well y there is some truth in that yes
in th i in the old days when a firm would come along and pack everything then they said that and that was quite true that they would pack everything and then they would be responsible if damage was done
there's still always the argument with certain firms as to whether it was done before or after
but from a practical point of view as time has gone on most people now are aware that they want to save money
and as packing can take half the time of the total removal and even more in certain circumstances most people opt for that
and a what i would say is that if you pack carefully and i advise people as to how to pack UNK you don't put plates th s big plates on the bottom and then build up because that puts a tremendous weight on the middle of the big plates at the bottom
you put them UNK up and you put newspaper in between
and we usually say anything that you think is too UNK let us pack
and when we get there there's probably four or five boxes to pack but the rest is done like books and UNK and things like th normal UNK
it can save immense time
and we've not had i must say that over the years i might have had two cases perhaps when there's been a query with regard to that in terms of packing
we've not had that problem
but some firms do and then they won't f they won't pay obviously because they don't think it's their problem
nineteen sixty one
yeah
but that was the practice
but because labour related to cost of the total has gone up so much er i most people now prepared to pack would prefer to do
there is a s distinct advantage of course is when you get to the other end if you've labelled it all or you know y what you've put into which box you know what you want out immediately like the kettle
as we all look er c hopefully you know
like the kettle you see
or else you er you know well i won't need that it can all go in the corner
i mean when i moved i had stuff in here before the upstairs was used i had it for about a year or so before i opened it up
do you do you pr er erm supply boxes in advance
yes oh yes
yeah i mean if it's somebody wanting to move a three piece suite and just a few books no we'd do it at the time
but if it's a proper removal job we're doing then yes we would
we'd go beforehand for no charge drop the stuff off
as long as you're not living in newcastle
then that
er
would be a different matter you see
UNK
yes
how do you suggest pack glasses then
erm well when you're getting to glasses erm there is a way
if you take erm depends on the shape of them but very often if you put a piece of newspaper round and then face the corner of one into the into you could put one into the bottom of the next and do it in a square
so one goes into there and the next UNK go at forty five de like that
so the who th one goes into there if it's a cup shall we say a cup goes in the opening of that cup goes into the corner of that
oh i see yeah
and do it round you see in a circle
now if they're long narrow ones you can't
so the best thing is to put the piece of paper in a UNK and then come out on the outside and pack it UNK and put them next to each other like that
the main thing is to get a piece of paper between each piece of UNK so that if it does move and if you j you just pack a piece of paper in er fold it over a little er and push it in i so you stop movement
but even then in boxes if they're in boxes very rare rarely do you get damage
very rarely
what about emergency stops
you know you've got that big thing over the cab say you put chairs and things
what happens if you haven't quite put the other goods quite up to that level
oh so that you're UNK
well y yes but no but you see if you do an emergency stop it all runs to the front anyway
yeah
it's only if you do an emergency start and shoot off the road at high speed which vans aren't capable of
they can't drive like
we can't drive our vans like you do your car out the car park you know
yeah
get forty miles an hour down
yes yeah
i remember one thing talking about things falling out and one of we had to go and pick up erm er there was a great business you know about these er what are they called these games
not UNK what is it now
the american
no er
er
pool
pool
pool tables
we used to deliver them to various different places where they were rented out
and then of course they the fashion died out and the owner had to get his pool tables back
and very often the people wouldn't pay the rent for them you see so they weren't very happy weren't the people u losing the pool table but the owner was saying sorry you're not paying your rent enough we're not getting enough out of the machine i want it back
and the he sent one of my lads we used to do a lot in the area for him and obviously he can't afford to spend too much so h we sent one man in the little van to get this pool table from a working man's club in new in er nottingham
got all the way there he'd been told that they'd help er him out cos they're big heavy things you need at least two to three people to get them out
got there and what you normally do as well is you have a key to undo the take the balls out and all the various bits to make it lighter
but this bloke didn't want to lose his pool table
so when willy said well could do you mind UNK he told him to sod off you see
he said no you c get it you you're come to collect it you bloody take it yourself
so poor willy was left in a situation where there was nobody to help him out with the f a full pool table for which he couldn't get the key
the money was in the balls were in everything was inside so he couldn't
he went outside used his initiative and found some poor chap who'd give him a hand with it you see
so they w they came out of this working man's club on top of this hill pulled out the whole thing and all the balls rolled out
and how many are there in a pool table
god knows fifteen or something like that i don't know something like that
and they all rolled down the street
and down the road and they were all rolling down
and fortunately again you often find that people because it's a novel situation it's amazing how the public are c often so helpful
and all these people into the road
UNK their lives and coming back with the whole lot that he collected and brought back again
and we got it back alright
one of the funny things that did er talking about the kettle though is that er the number of times on full removals where you know with my re little removals you've only got ten foot front to back but some of these vans are huge there's twenty to thirty foot of van virtually to front
and one of the psychological advantages of working on light removals is that whenever you're doing it you can see the front of the van you know
you can pack it up but you can still see the front so you know how near you're getting to the end of your job
but when you've moved a five bedroomed house which has got a grand piano in it as well and you're about twenty to thirty foot at the back and all you can see is furniture you can imagine as you go on you're thinking god will we ever get to this
and er d you n really ne you need you need a bottle of UNK by the side of you when you reach the stage when suddenly you can see the front of the van
we've had situations like that where you've packed right to the back and then the lady can't find her keys
they're in her UNK of course
and her UNK was in a box in the kitchen in the first box that you put in the van
and it's it i seriously it has happened a few i in my experience over the years i can remember it happening to me at least half a dozen times
and so you've got to be like a bloody monkey and you've got to climb up the side of the van and climb along the side of the van without damaging any of the furniture right to the front to find the box to bring it back again
and of course it th it's more often done that with the kettle of course so that it's it by the time you get to the end of the job you don't want a cup of tea anyway
so at that stage i shall finish
and then you could go on all night
no certainly you couldn't i'm sure you couldn't
hello doctor

we've been thinking over past weeks of the little account that we have in the old testament of the life of ruth
we've seen how she comes into the family first of all gets er into contact with god's people
strange way almost a UNK in some senses
see in the even out of failure out of sin god works out his purposes
which is a good thing because that's what he's done in our lives
that's what he's done in the life of the human race
out of failure he's worked out his purpose
adam sins
seems the whole thing is gone what is god gonna do
destroy the lot
cast it away from him
but god doesn't do that he brings about a programme of redemption and restoration
and one hymn writer puts it he says UNK painful memories tell of blessings lost UNK there that fell the UNK crown i wore but UNK glorious victory a UNK crown has won for me
and this is what god has done
he hasn't UNK and restored back to what we were but he's gone way beyond that in making us his children and bringing us into a very special relationship with himself
and so we've seen how ruth becomes involved with god's people
and she makes way back with her mother in law naomi to bethlehem
we've seen how god provides for her and brings again brings her into contact with boaz
we're coming this morning to the UNK of th of this whole little UNK that we have there in that book of ruth
the harvest has been gathered in
there's much UNK in bethlehem
it's been a UNK harvest
and among all the workers there's gonna be that sense of a job well done
everything is safe and secure now
there's enough food and to spare for the coming year
a satisfaction that as a community they've worked together to bring this about
you see it wasn't everybody doing their own thing
but there they were working together as a community there in the great UNK fields where everybody had their own plot but working together
and ruth and naomi who have returned
they're able to share in the UNK they consider the great things that's happened to them
and on the night of the final UNK there's a great harvest supper after which the men would stay guard around the great UNK of grain which were ready to UNK early the following morning
and for ruth it's gonna be a UNK night
it's gonna be the night it's gonna be yet another turning point in her life
she's because she's gonna meet personally come into contact in a far greater wa sense with a man who is going to redeem her
you see under the old law when a married man without a family his brother was to take on the widow and raise up a family in the name and in the memory of his brother
and that was the responsibility of the first born
you remember er that incident in the life of jesus when they came to try and catch jesus out and they use this very illustration they said somebody's died
and he's got no family and his brother he married his sister in law and he died no children
and then somebody else married her
and so it went on down till all the brothers in the family had married this lady and there was still no children and then the er they were UNK the trick question to jesus well what's gonna happen in the resurrection
so you see it was it was something the then as a nation it wasn't just a UNK law that had been given and wasn't used it was something that was carried out on a fa on a regular basis
and this brother who married his late brother's wife he would also take over all that belonged to her because you know all that it was his dead brother's he would take it all over it would become his the land the business the property the mortgage the debts they would all become the brother who now UNK the th the widow
and his aim in doing that would be to be res fully restore all that had been his brother's for his brother's family
it was called the right to redeem
now if it was impossible for any reason for the next of UNK the oldest brother to do it then it would go down to the second or on down the line whoever was the nearest to become the kinsman UNK
we saw was it last week at our harvest UNK we looked at the harvest time there how god had led ruth into contact and into the field of boaz a man of great wealth
a man who also honoured god but more important than that he was a near kinsman of ruth or ra or rather naomi rather and there also of ruth because of UNK late husband
and whilst we don't get the sense in i as we read it in our english version if you were reading it evidently in a UNK version the ch second chapter you would find that there are four different words used in the UNK language to describe the relationship that boaz had with ruth
there was first of all in verse one it's just talks i say in our bi in our english bible depending which translation you've got it most likely uses the word kinsman throughout
but in verse one the word used there simply means a relative
boaz was a relative of her husband a man of great wealth
now there's the introduction
he is just a relative
but as you go on into verse three and it talks about this relationship again er it says he she came to a field belonging to boaz who was of the er family of UNK
it means he was one of the family
so you've got relatives that are there are there are distant relative they're still related to you wouldn't call them one of your family because th the relationship is so distant
but boaz was not just a relation by marriage but he was erm one of UNK family
further on down towards the end of the chapter in verse twenty
it says there that this man is our relative he is one of our closest relatives
and the word used there means a very near kinsman
see the progression
a relative one of the family a very near kinsman
and also in that we in that verse the first use of the word relative is that very near kinsman and the second use right at the end one of our closest relatives it's the word that is used there that means the one who has the right to redeem
so ruth she's been led to one who was able to restore to her all that UNK had lost when he left bethlehem
everything that had been lost he was able to restore it to ruth
the thing was though that claim could only be made by her
she would get nothing until she registers her claim
now ruth of course she's a she's a UNK she's not a UNK
she doesn't know all the jewish laws and she knows nothing about this when she comes to bethlehem
but she's UNK and advised by her mother in law naomi
and naomi tells her what to do and the procedure to follow
she was a good jewish mother was naomi
and you can imagine her can't you telling ruth just what to do and how to go about doing it
the inheritance her son's and her husband's inheritance it's gone
it's lost
and here she's telling ruth now what you've gotta do she's got him she's got her introduced to boaz and she tells him it's a strange custom one that's perhaps even stranger in our eyes today but there er after the party the great harvest supper she's the they lie down in the barn together they all just they're tired it's the party's gone on into the wee hours of the morning and there they just they don't bother going home they lie down there in the barn together all of them and she says to ruth what you must do according to the custom is you go and you lie at the feet of boaz and wait just wait and wait for him to respond to you
and there she lies down UNK at his feet se not knowing what's gonna happen
and in the middle of the night boaz wakes up and he turns and he UNK to find this woman lying at his feet and he says who are you
and ruth she'd been UNK well what to say she doesn't say a lot but she says the right things
she says i am ruth your very near relative
but what on earth is boaz gonna do
so what
that could have been his response
what is his response gonna be
and so she UNK to hear is she gonna be UNK or is she gonna be accepted
her whole future depends on the next few moments
but then boaz who it said he was honourable man he replies very positively he says may you be blessed by the lord
i know you're a good woman so don't be afraid and i will do for you and i will do all for you that you ask
said i'll redeem you
you see that's what she goes you're a near relative you're a kinsman you're a kinsman UNK you can bring
the restoration of our property
and he says i'll do it for you but there's a problem
but leave it with me
and the problem was very simple there was a nearer kinsman
there was somebody else higher up the line than boaz and he must first be given the opportunity to redeem ruth
but if he's not gonna be willing then boaz it's his responsibility
and UNK along on this account that we have here ruth the next morning she's given a gift by boaz a gift of er to seal what has been said
a UNK that he would certainly not rest until he had fulfilled his responsibility
and ruth then quietly returns to naomi there at first light UNK telling her of all that has been happening
and the next morning when they get up ruth makes his way into the town and he goes to where all the men sit and they talk the city gate and there he UNK out the nearer relative of UNK
and he gives him the option he offers to him the right to redeem
he said it's yours and he spells out what it is
you know on the surface it's not necessarily a good bargain
it's not necessarily a good deal
he's gonna be involved in a lot of expenses
redemption was not a cheap process
it wasn't just something you did lightly you had to weigh it all up and consider the cost of it
and so whilst ruth and naomi are resting and waiting back home boaz is acting and he sought out this man he's determined now to see that ruth and naomi receive all that is there's by right
and so quickly he makes his way to the gate of the city as we've said and he gets this man he sits down with the te with the te with the ten UNK who would be witnesses and the kinsman arrives
and it says in th in as you read through the record as soon as he saw him he shouted with a shout that must have surprised the UNK by because he UNK out to him he called out UNK to him
and so this near kinsman comes and he UNK quietly to what boaz has to say
ruth a daughter of UNK a daughter in law of naomi the wife of UNK has returned
her husband UNK dead and the daughter's husband is dead
naomi has no men in her family her son's are all dead
there is the right to redeem her land the property the possessions that is hers and you as the nearest kinsman have that right to do so
will you take it up
will you redeem
and you can imagine the man as he UNK and he hears what is to put it UNK on offer
there's advantages to be se to be had certainly and at first he seems willing the extra land would be an advantage
well it will increase my land
it'll be easier to work it's always easier to work more land than it is just a small plot of land
it will make me a man of greater standing in the community i'll be more respected folk will have more UNK towards me i'll be a bigger land owner
but you know there's always two sides to every bargain isn't there
and the whilst the one side was good there was the other side and when he heard that the inheritance required that he marry ruth oh dear
it ceased to be such a good bargain
but no ruth no land
it was as simple as that
and he says well i i'm sorry after considering it carefully i cannot go through with this transaction i UNK my right to redeem UNK i UNK my own inheritance
that's the only reason he gives
now it could possibly be that he was already married and would want the children from that marriage to receive all the land that he had rather than it being spread out with more children that ruth was gonna have
it may well be that he considered that it was not the right thing for him to do after all he was a good UNK and why should he marry a UNK
it wasn't the right thing to do
he may simply not have had enough money to take on the extra land and the work as required for it
whatever the reason he has neither the spiritual character nor the material resources to redeem ruth
