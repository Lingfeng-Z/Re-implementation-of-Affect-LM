and it seems that in this whole area of redemption there are three qualifications necessary for UNK
first the right to redeem on the ground of relationship a stranger couldn't do it had to be a near kinsman
second condition was the willingness to redeem even to the point of sacrifice
and the third the resources had to be there to redeem there was a price to be paid
and we see in this little story something far greater than the redemption of UNK for ruth and naomi we see here a picture of your redemption and of my redemption and those three qualifications how they are met
the right to redeem on the ground of relationship
i am his because he created me
i belong to him by the right of creation
he has the right to redeem me because he made me
he's got the right to redeem you because he has created you he knew you before you were formed
then the willingness to redeem even to the point of sacrifice
and oh sacrifice he paid
as we're gonna be UNK and celebrating in a few moments the sacrifice to the very point of giving his own life
we are UNK not with silver and gold but with the precious blood of christ
that's the price of redemption
that's the price our kinsman UNK jesus christ had to pay
the price of his own blood given himself that is the price
and then the UNK resources to redeem
there was a price to be paid as we've seen it was the price of himself
he gave himself
couldn't buy our redemption
there would nobody else willing to redeem us but he was willing to redeem us by giving himself
that was the price he paid for your redemption for my redemption
what a cost it was to him
and how jesus christ has fulfilled that price that redemption cost
according to the law going back to the UNK the story of ruth and boaz according to the law the widow she would remove the shoe of the kinsman who refused to redeem her and she would UNK in his face because he had rejected he had failed to fulfil his duty his responsibility
in this story however there's no such shame because ruth has not been rejected
the oldest the first born if you like the nearer one may have UNK may not have accepted the right to redeem her but ruth is not has not been rejected because there is another kinsman waiting
and you could almost imagine boaz hoping against hope that the other kinsman would turn down the offer and so he delighted when that happened
the shoe is removed however as a testimony to the UNK and witnesses that the near kinsman has refused his right to possess all that was UNK
and boaz is now free to fulfil all the conditions and to take ruth as his wife
all his inheritance is gonna be restored
and in front of all the gathered company at the gate of the city he makes his declaration he says i have bought all that belonged to UNK
i have UNK bought all that belonged to UNK
i have belonged i have bought all that belonged to UNK
i have bought ruth to be my wife
he completely fulfilled all that was required of him
the law was satisfied to it's UNK mis most minute detail
and in your redemption and in my redemption jesus christ has satisfied the UNK demand
there on the cross he could say i've done it all
it is finished
i have UNK you
i have bought you back
i have paid the price
you are mine
and god the father is satisfied
as he looks down and he sees it all everything has been done
there is no area there is no tiny minute detail of the law that has failed to be met with
god has been the father's righteousness is totally satisfied
john the UNK when he saw jesus at the beginning of the UNK ministry of jesus he says behold the lamb of god who UNK away the sin of the world and on him was laid all of our sin all of our debt
you could argue we weren't a good bargain
we were nothing
we were just UNK
sinners in UNK against god
but he UNK his responsibility in the right to redeem us
and he takes us bad bargain that we are poor and miserable that we were with nothing UNK positive to offer he takes us bag and UNK he takes us with all our sin with all our failure with all our mistakes he takes us with all that is th the UNK of our lives he says you're mine now
i have UNK you
i have bought you
you are my possession
i paid the price
my father's righteousness is satisfied
you belong to me
you are mine
and then you going just one step further
in the marriage relationship it's not just that he says i have taken you and all that you have now is mine i take your debt and i discharge it fully your debt of UNK to god your debt of righteousness to god he says i take it and i pay that price in full
i discharge you are now free from it
it's not just a case of him taking us with all of what we had and were and us belonging to him but he says i in taking you to myself he says i give myself to you
you are mine and i am yours
all that i have is yours
i've taken all that you've and to be honest there's not there's not a it's not worth a it's not worth a light it's you i'm be getting rid of that straight away
we're clearing that out
i take all that you have and it's place and in it's place i give you all that i have and all that i am
that's the relationship
that's what ruth the relationship that ruth enters into with boaz and that's the relationship that you and i have entered into with jesus christ he is our kinsman UNK and he's rescued us he's taken us
like ruth we were strangers we were UNK we were outside we had nothing to say well i've got some right we had no right at all but he came and he took us and he brought us in and he has made us who were nothing something
he has taken the off UNK of this world the apostle paul said those that were nothing and he has made them into something
so what are this morning
ruth was a UNK a UNK a UNK
the off UNK
nobody would want anything to do with her
but oh what a difference when she's UNK boaz what a difference then
because she enters into all that boaz has and all that he is
you and i were nothing
we're nothing of ourselves we might have thought we had but it was of no value whatsoever but he took us he says now you're something because you belong to me
now you're precious
now you're of value
now you're of consequence
because you belong to me
all that i have and all that i am is now yours i invest it in you it is yours
take it
use it
be part of it enjoy it
because i give it to you freely because you're mine you belong to me i've UNK you i've purchased you
what a transformation
and the name of boaz becomes her name
she is no longer ruth the UNK she's ruth the wife of boaz
he has given to us a new name we've take his name we belong to him
the country of boaz becomes her country she is no longer a UNK here now she has a right to stay because of boaz and we are citizens of a new country of a new kingdom
the possessions of boaz would be hers
and jesus says all that i have is yours
the servants of boaz would be hers
the relationships of boaz they're now hers
and so for us the relationships
that he has then become our relationships
his children become our brothers and sisters
we're part of his family
and so ruth the one who has gone out as a poor UNK and walking behind the UNK hoping they would treat her kindly
she is now joint UNK with the owner of the fields
something she could never have UNK of
and you and i in our journey in life looking for what we could get hoping to make it we've now been made joint UNK with jesus christ entering into his inheritance
let's come round the lord's table now and remember who we are
he has paid the price and we belong to him
perhaps you could sing that little song it's in this songs of fellowship it's number seventy three
cover me
that was something that boaz did there when ruth was lying at his feet
the UNK he showed his acceptance of her by lifting his blanket and so covering her a blanket at his feet he covered her with and in this little song was cover me extend the border
and that's what he's done isn't it
he's extended the border of his garment and he's covered us
thank you
that was the way we became his followers the way we got saved it's the way we continue it's the way and it's the only re the only method by which we will ever stand before him and he will UNK us into his presence to stand eternity with him through his grace and as we see others not in a sense of UNK not in a sense of self righteousness or pointing the finger as we see others we can say with that man of old who as he watched the man being dragged to the to the UNK there but for the grace of god goes i goes me and there but for god's grace think of that most that worse condition that you know think of that person who has UNK their life up more than any body else and er who has made a total UNK of it there but for the grace of god is you and there's me oh thank god for his grace
i like us to think for a little while this morning just what it means to be a christian we've been hearing and seeing and been challenged and accepting christ as our saviour and over the week in harlow a number made that response and not only in harlow and in UNK court but right across the country and into europe and into africa as well through the through the life link men and women who have been challenged into accepting jesus christ as their saviour and i'd like us to think for a little while this morning just what it means to be a christian now obviously as we perhaps know er and god work clearly shows to us that it is not in being religion somebody well said that religion is man's attempt to find god but the gospel is god's method of seeking out and finding men and so just as the same as you've seen that bridge of life illustration and we try with our UNK to get across to god we can't make it
the UNK is too great though the gulf between god and man is far too wide and we try our various UNK our UNK of being good of doing nice things UNK of being religious of being confirmed of being baptized of going to church of perhaps attending church perhaps even becoming a member of a church the plank of saying prayers i think you know and god doesn't even hear us the bible tells us if i regarded UNK in my heart god doesn't hear me he says i will not hear you the only prayer that god hears from the sinner is god be UNK to me a sinner and we've tried that plank and it doesn't work of course it doesn't because that's not what it means to be a christian the plank of bible reading we can read the bible we can UNK it doesn't make us a christian jesus said to some of the religious leaders of his days you search the UNK for you think that in them you have life but you will not come to me and so it's not being in religious er being religious or any thing else as we well know it's something far more fundamental than that those words that jesus said to nicodemus you must be born again that new birth that new start starting all over again and so what happens what's it all about what is it to what is it to be a christian
you know very often in fact usually the best way of working things out is to go right back to the beginning isn't it to start off at square one and the trouble is sometimes we want to start in the middle we want to pick it up where we think we can come in and it doesn't work that way we've got to go right back to the beginning and what is it at the beginning well we look to see how god what god's plan and his purpose for us is how god made us it tells us there in the book of genesis in the first chapter in verse twenty seven that god created us to be like himself and you've got to look in the mirror and i've got to look in the mirror not just the glass mirror on the wall but into the mirror of ourselves and realise we don't have to be UNK we don't have to be UNK but even the very UNK of UNK will show to us that were nothing like it if god made you and me to be in his image then something has gone wrong but that's how we started that is how he made us and in making us to be like himself that does something tremendous because it gives to men and women it gives to human kind a status and a responsibility in creation he did not make you and me like the animals no matter how wonderful their abilities are they've got tremendous UNK they've got tremendous UNK how that tiny bird weighing less than an ounce can fly thousands and thousands of miles for the first time and come back six nine months later to the very spot where it was UNK out of an nest now you can't do it i can't do it but for all wonders that god has put into the into his to his creative to his in his creation in animals in birds and in other creatures he has done something that marks you and i UNK out above and beyond all his others creation he has given to us a status and a responsibility
he never made any thing else in his image but he made you to be created in his image and with that there's that status were not just a more intelligent animal were not just something else that god made even but were that peak of his creative UNK the peak of it the very UNK of it not because of what we are but because of the image the pattern that he was using his own self created us in his image so that gave us status but it gives us responsibility
only see one way in which we are like god is in having moral and spiritual UNK no other UNK has moral and spiritual UNK they do not of the potential to worship they do not of a code er of moral laws they're not governed by that it's a case of the might makes right it's a case of the strongest the one that UNK and the UNK goes to the wall you've only got to look er at a litter of UNK and the last one is the one that's pushed to the back every time isn't it there's no moral law there those UNK and the and the UNK doesn't er work out that because that one is UNK it should be getting more UNK it should be cared for better it doesn't work like that in any thing else but god has placed within UNK a moral responsibility and his place within as a spiritual capacity were more than just animals were created in his image so god created us capable of knowing him and growing to be like him and in his original creation they're in need of the highlight of it was when he came down and UNK and talked with adam and eve there in the garden and shared his heart with them and there was this perfect UNK between god the UNK and man his creation he never did it to any animal he didn't go and talk to the trees and the plants perfect though they were he never looked on any of the other creatures that he had made wonderful though they may be beautiful in their colouring and go and talk with them but he talks with adam and he shares his heart with him his purpose is that adam should communicate with him and walk with him and has fellowship with him growing to be like him but you see even though god created us like that he didn't create us as UNK it wasn't god up in heaven pulling the UNK and adam did that and eve did this and that was how it were god is not a UNK and he made as capable of choosing good and evil he gave us moral choices because he made us his moral beings and so we could choose to do this and not to do that we could choose to do this and to leave the other UNK
let me just it's nothing special it's only a circle but if you were to take that for a as an example if you like as a picture of god's purposes for us you see the circle is UNK it's perfect there is nothing that is odd about it there is nothing er there's no difference about it is perfect and that was god's purpose and god's plan for you and for me that our that our time our being should be perfect in harmony with him you think of all the things in your life personally and then think of all the things in the in the life of your com of our community those things that mar it those things that spoil it those things that stop today be the perfect day for you that's not god's purpose for you they've all come as a product a direct result of sin it wasn't how god intended it wasn't how god made it his plan his purpose for you and for me was to live and to dwell together with him in perfect harmony for ever and there
representing that but you know and i know that it didn't stay like that i don't know how long but it didn't stay like it for very long because sin UNK in that circle was UNK it was twisted that UNK original fellowship with god was broken let me read you a verse there in genesis chapter three and verse eight it's adam and eve it says they heard the sound of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and the man and his wife UNK themselves from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden for the first time since adam had first been created they hide from god they hear him coming it's the time when god will come and they hear him that were walking through the garden using picture language and they go and hide they're ashamed to see him they don't want to look upon him something has happened that perfect circle has been UNK what it was like yesterday things are different now there's that UNK feeling there's that guilt complex we've done it wrong we've failed to keep what god's said we've broken the rules and when you break the rules it's not just the rules that are broken is it you know it and i know it in relationships it's not just the rules that get broken it's the relationship is UNK
so adam and eve they go and hide but it's not just adam and eve but it's every one of us they're just pictures they're representatives of you and of me they are the federal head of the human race and paul with his writing in romans three and verse twenty three reminds us and j b phillips in his translation he puts it like this he says every one has UNK every one falls short of the beauty of god's plan that plan that purpose that god had not just for creation not just for UNK in general but for you as an individual that purpose that god had that beautiful plan far better than you can could work out for yourself falling short of it we've UNK it we haven't come up to it if that circle represented just as a diagram as a picture god's plan god's beautiful plan for you and for me still a circle but UNK here UNK in there
twisted UNK it's in a sense it's exactly the same as the circle you know you draw the circle it's a line that starts there and goes perfectly round and comes back to the starting point it's exactly the same as that but it's been pushed out at the edges it's been UNK in here it's not UNK now as that same circle although it's what it is and you see what has happened is although we've UNK although we've come short of god's plan god hasn't destroyed the whole thing he could so easily just taken up the human life and UNK it up and thrown it on the heap said finished with them can't be bothered i'll start all over again with new people i'll have a new creation well he did have a new creation but he kept that same creation he said i'm gonna work on it i'm gonna do something with it i'm gonna restore it i'm gonna UNK it i'm gonna redeem it i'm gonna make it again not just like it was but i'm gonna make it even more wonderful and more beautiful
and so though we have all UNK and that circle that perfect purpose of god for you and for me has been UNK and distorted out of all recognition the potential that god had for you and for me it's been dis it seems to have been destroyed because of the UNK and because of the impact of sin
what's happened it's the world again to use j b phillips translation this time the romans twelve two that the world the precious around us has pushed us here and is as UNK at there and it squeezed us out of the mould the purpose the pattern that god had for us into its own mould a UNK mould a distorted picture that has what has happened
as i said god didn't leave it like that because god did in jesus christ what we could never do for ourselves you see you and i at times we felt that i want to be different from that and we and we pushed against one of these pressures and so that we pushed it out a wee bit but as we've pushed there it's come back in somewhere else and as we've stopped pushing and we've gone to another bit so that first that has become has come back as it was and we spend our lives perhaps running around trying to get the circle back again it's an impossible task we can't do it we spend our whole lives in the frustration things and we and we start blaming on things if only that situation was different if only those circumstances were different but it's far more fundamental than that and we've gotta come to the place where we say well i can't do any thing about it i've tried my hardest but i can't do it and that's where god comes and says hang on a minute i'll do it for you and that's what he did in jesus christ he did for us what we couldn't do for ourselves the bible tells us that christ is the perfect image of god it's in UNK one fifteen and just er full verses further on in verse nineteen it says in him all the UNK of god in jesus all the UNK of god was pleased to dwell and so in christ god's son god dealt with the problem of sin which had caused that UNK and that UNK and that UNK your life and in my life that which UNK his image in us he created us in his image but you've only got to look at people today you've only got to look at ourselves see where is the image of god is that what god is like UNK filled with anger UNK envy is that what god is like UNK thinking is that what god is like that's not his image but he created us in his image perfect and what jesus christ did on the cross is to restore that image that original image in you and me to UNK us in the image of god so in
christ god dealt with the problem which UNK his image in us and he has to do it because of fundamental thing he's gotta do it from the centre you know you can get an apple an ordinary apple and you can polish it up and you can have it so that it's bright and UNK and the red is almost you know it almost UNK you the shining on it it's got a real good polish on the skin but inside there's a grub and all the UNK in the world doesn't get rid of the grub and you see that's so often what we do we polish and polish away on the outside that's gonna make us better but it's only skin deep because inside the grub is having a field day he's having a party of all party's he's got an whole apple to himself and the grub of sin in your life and in my life is having has a field day and we polish the outside and we try and make it look good and we be we become UNK and there like the apple on the market stall it looks good it looks tremendous until you take a bite out of it and you see in the bit that you've UNK there's a there's a hole going through and you wonder where the grub is it in the bit that's left or in the bit that you've eaten and this is just like sin you see in our lives and so god in christ he didn't deal with the outside bit he didn't bother trying to make our conditions better he didn't bother trying to work on the outside that's the difference between the gospel and social work and there's nothing wrong with social work it's just that it's going it's coming from the wrong end it starts on the outside it will educate people if we give them better housing if we give them better circumstances if we give them better wages now all these things are right and that we should have them but that doesn't make any difference you see the person is a sinner all he becomes if you educate him is an educated sinner if you give him a huge pay rise all he becomes is a rich sinner if you put him in a palace all he becomes is er a sinner living in a palace it doesn't make any basic difference to the person
he didn't use it this time i remember a number of years ago here in
he used an illustration of the pig you know you can polish the pig up you can clean it you can scrub it you can oh de UNK it you can do all sorts of things with it you can tie a nice pink UNK around it and you can put it in a palace but it's still a pig and it lives like a pig and you can cl and no matter how clean you've made it it'll soon find some dirt to UNK in and the UNK might make it look nice in the show ground but it doesn't make any difference to its nature and so it is with us and so jesus didn't start on the outside but he starts at the inside he deals with the route of the problem in one UNK chapter fifteen and in verse three it says for i deliver to you as a first importance this is the basic thing he says to them this was the first thing that i said to you because it was the most important that christ died for our sins according to the scripture what ever else christ gives to us what ever else he does for us what ever else the gospel produces the basic the most important the fundamental thing is that christ died for our sins
one of the UNK used and UNK against er against christianity against the UNK message against things like the mission of graham and others is that it doesn't meet the needs the material needs of people but if you deal with the persons spiritual needs if their sins are forgiven those problems that are causing the material problem it's amazing how there are dealt with as well the best way to UNK up a person the best way to deal with a person who's an UNK the best way to deal with a person who is a drug UNK the best way to deal with a person who UNK is not by telling them the UNK of those things it's not by trying to do to you know to counsel them it's presenting the gospel allowing jesus christ to come into their lives and to forgive them that will make the person UNK quicker than all the counselling in the world and paul says i brought you the most important the fundamental thing that christ died for our sins paul again when he's writing to the romans in chapter five and verse eight he says but god demonstrates his own love towards us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us so god did in jesus christ what we couldn't do for ourselves so all of you have sin so all of my sin and he came and he died on the cross and as he was dying there was that UNK there for he wasn't dying for his own sin buy he was dying for your sin and for mine it was all UNK on him and so when we except what christ has done when we come to that place and yes i believe that you died for me
that my sin was laid on you now what happens is that our relationship with god is restored that UNK that gulf that we've been trying to get across with our good works with our church attendance with all these other things suddenly we are our land with a bridge across it there's no longer a barrier there there's no longer a great gulf there jesus christ has UNK it that broken relationship has restored and from this relationship the basis of that relationship we have the power to become as god made us
if you want in UNK chapter one in verse twenty seven it's given again very simply again can i use j b phillips he puts it like this he says the secret is simply this christ in you yes he says christ in you bringing with him the hope of all the glorious things to come so what god does he comes in to this situation that's UNK that's UNK that's twisted and he comes in by UNK jesus christ comes into it he becomes the central point the focal point and that circle it starts to get dealt with that UNK twisted like it doesn't happen being like that we knew creation straight away we don't have to work at that but he as we allow him to dwell in us and to work out his purpose he UNK that relationship with god and god starts to fashion us he starts to work on us and bring us back into how he originally created us
he re introduces us to his perfect plan and purpose for us
there's we we've been struggling and trying to do ourselves and all we have to do is to allow christ to come in to our lives because he died to take away the sin he dealt with the route cause of it christ in you the hope of glory
and so we've got to desire to have our broken relationship with god restored you see we need to receive what god offers in christ the fact that christ died for our sins does not mean a thing to us until we say yes i accept it for me i believe you died for me i receive it i'm linked into it you see your house can be let me give you a very simple illustration your house is linked up with er eastern electricity and there is so many er i dunno what the what it is but there is the power there the there are there are kilo watts of power on tap in your home but in the winter you're cold when it gets dark outside it's dark inside the cooker the electric cooker doesn't work the fridge is not operating the food is going rotten you can't watch a programme on television why because you haven't plugged into the source of the power it's as simple as that you can't blame the electricity board it's not eastern UNK fault it's your fault because all the plugs are out of the UNK and it doesn't matter what the electricity board does short of blowing up your house they can do nothing for you and it doesn't matter what god has done in christ until we as it were to also plug in it doesn't mean a thing to us but the moment we link in that's the change the lights come on there's heat there the stove works the radio the television the record player they're all operating the UNK working the situation has changed we needs to receive what god offers us in christ
and john one in verse twelve it says but as many have received him to them he gave the right the authority the power to become children of god even to those who believe on his name and this of course is what making our commitment to christ is it's receiving him for ourselves it's UNK in it's saying yes i haven't got that power myself i am not able to do it i need you to come and do it for me i accept that you have that power you have that authority you have dealt with my sin and i receive it for me we trust christ to save us from sin and commit ourselves to his UNK ruling our lives we are as the bible says then born again new UNK we are made alive in christ i give you one verse in UNK and in chapter three verse four it says when christ who is our life is UNK then you also no sorry verse three verse three sorry for you have died and your life is hidden with christ in god but you say that's all very well that brings me into the place of becoming a UNK of jesus yes i've accepted him but what about all this pressures here christ i i'm willing to receive them and to make the centre of my life i've received that he died for me but what about all those things that's UNK and UNK and UNK my life that's rubbing me my life can be more god wants it to be well that's the great thing when jesus comes he doesn't just come and sit down and that's all there is to it but he comes in by the holy spirit and as christ is the centre of our life so he as we submit to him and to his authority as we become UNK to his word doing what he tells us what he says for us then the power of his spirit in our life starts operating god the holy spirit cos that's how we become christians we are born again of god spirit and god christ was in us not the man who walked here on UNK he is a man in glory but he comes into your life and into my life by the holy spirit and he gives us new spiritual resources which help us to overcome those influences of evil that are pressing in on us and trying to UNK our lives and UNK it into its mould those things that have UNK our lives he gives us spiritual power and spiritual resources over them
the holy spirit gives us a new prospective on life and it UNK our relationship with god we don't have to try and make a success of our new christian life by ourselves you know it doesn't matter whether you've been a christian for a week for a day for twenty for fifty years if you try to do it one day by yourself you are guaranteed failure there is no way you can do it doesn't matter how long you've been a christian or how short a period you can not do it if the great apostle paul he could he said i can do nothing of myself he said i am not sufficient for all my learning for all the wonderful UNK i've had for the knowledge that god has given to me that i've been able to write these great UNK he says that i cannot do it myself i can't live this christian life myself and the tremendous thing that none of us no matter who we are we do not have to try to make a success of our christian life on our own it's a partnership and god is the senior partner in it he doesn't expect us to do it by ourselves listen to what the that the same apostle paul says when he's writing to the UNK christians in chapter two verse twenty listen to what he says there he says i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me and the life which i know live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and delivered himself for me he said i don't do it by myself why not very simply cos he can't he didn't know how to he didn't have the power to do it he says but the life i'm living i live by the power of christ who died for me who gave himself for me and who now lives in me now by the holy spirit
paul again when he's writing to the UNK in chapter four and verse thirteen he says i can do all things oh how arrogant of you paul how UNK you are oh no he didn't just finish there did he says i can do all things through christ who UNK me and writing to the romans in that tremendous eighth chapter of romans and verse thirty seven he says in all these things in all the problems of life in all the difficulties and all the UNK in all the pressures that we are called to go through he says in all of these things we UNK concur we are UNK he says how through him who loved us
so he has given god gives this power within power of the holy spirit the UNK christ in you and in me so i've got no advantage over you and you have no advantage over me and the person who's been a christian for fifty years hasn't got an advantage over the christian who's been a christian for one day because that same power that raised christ from the dead hear that the same power that god used to raise christ from the dead that is the same power that UNK in you and in me that's what the bible says
if that power was sufficient the holy spirit if that power was sufficient to raise christ from the dead you not think he's able to UNK that power in your life and in my life to make us live lives that are UNK to god of course it is so we don't do it ourselves just let me in closing mention one other thing this relationship we have needs to be maintained you know for any relationship to grow one needs to spend time with the other person i don't give a lot of UNK to the saying that absence makes the heart grow UNK it does with somebody else it's true it does not make it grow UNK of that person the person is you know who you heard this story so often like particularly like going back during the last war folk who were separated sometimes for not just for months but for several years there they were in concentration camps perhaps in prisoner of war camps separated for years they come back home they've got to get to know each other all over again you see that a relationship on a human level as well as in our relationship with god is dependent on association it's dependent on UNK it's dependent on spending time with the other person and in our relationship with christ this is achieved by prayer by knowing and understanding god's word by having fellowship with other christians and fellowship with other christians is not just meeting them and passing the time of day with them oh that's fellowship but it's far more than that is required there's the fellowship in worship we worship together of course i can worship god at home of course i can do it so can you do it and we should do it but there's that re there's that need that requirement as god's people we come together to worship him in a corporate act in the UNK in as we mentioned in earlier on in taking the bread and the wine and remembering the lords death there's a sense in which i can do it by myself
i don't believe it's god's purpose unless there's no other alternative but to do it together with god's people with god's family the fellowship of being together in our witness and in our service this is the whole purpose of the church family that we do things together that we are together and then UNK to god's will
let me just show you a little thing here just UNK just linking it up there it is it's a well known little picture it's a picture of a wheel where there in the centre the UNK is christ you see when the UNK has got to be the centre otherwise the wheel does not run true and there with christ is the UNK the centre of your life the centre of my life and you and i our lives our UNK there on the outside were the UNK and there's those UNK that hold it together and make it run true the spoke of the bible god's word allowing him to speak to us the spoke of prayer our communion with god our praying to him the spoke of UNK following him UNK him bringing our lives into line with what he says in his word he says if you love me you will keep my UNK that's why we've got to learn and get to know them from his word and then the spoke of fellowship somebody as UNK them to prayer being like air our breath the bible being like food giving us UNK and strength fellowship it's the family situation and in just as in a nature family there is that is the place for care it's the place for support it's the place of sharing it's the place of love where it should be so god's family and then the final one their UNK like exercise keeping fit it's the UNK it's keeping the muscles UNK what he tells us in his word well that's what it means to be a christian bringing ourselves into line with him and allowing him to re fashion us in his image and it's a process that's going on all the time wesley and his hymn talks about us being used and the scripture being changed from glory into glory till in heaven we take our place there like him john says when we see him we shall be like him but we shall see him as he is and that's god's purpose for you and for me to be like him and the moment we come to him and respond to him the process starts and it goes on day in day out night in night out week in week out over the years him changing and UNK us into the image of his son because that's how he created us originally he created to be like him and in this new creation we were singing we are a new creation it's to be like him
let's sing that little song we sang earlier let's sing it again in closing shall we that we are new UNK in christ what it it's number one seventy nine i am a new creation and whilst we sing it were gonna take up our morning offering one hundred and seventy nine then

i the defendant doctor david against a decision of the taxing master taxing master of right er given on the thirteenth of august nineteen ninety three whereby the taxing master disallowed interest on plaintiff's bill of the cost in the action for a period from the first of november nineteen ninety one to the twenty seventh of may nineteen ninety three the defendant in his notice of appeal claims that the taxing master should have disallowed interest for a longer period in addition to the period he actually al disallowed int namely there should be additional UNK for the period from the twenty forth of april nineteen ninety one to the thirty first of october nineteen ninety one or for such other periods as the court UNK just
the plaintiffs also UNK against the decision of taxing master right er and then UNK on the basis that er there should be no UNK for any interest at all
there is also a further appeal before the court in relation to an application by the plaintiff for UNK of interest upon the defendant's bill of costs and er it is claimed that if interest is to be disallowed on their bill interest should also be disallowed on the defendant's bill of costs
so the matter arises in this way the action that concerns a partnership dispute er between the plaintiffs on the one hand and the defendant on the other
all the plaintiffs and the defendant were doctors carrying on practice as general medical UNK at er
it's er unfortunately the case that relations between the partners broke down and this led in due course to proceedings being commenced by the plaintiffs against the defendant in relation to the UNK of the partners those proceedings were commenced in nineteen eighty nine er in the high court UNK division there were a number of issues raised in the litigation one of the matters was a preliminary issue er concerning the terms of the partnership and that came before er mr justice on the eighteenth of february nineteen ninety one whereby he found in favour effectively of the defendant on that preliminary issue er the plaintiffs it seems were then claiming that partnership the partnership at will but mr justice held that they were part of the terms of the particular er partnership deed so the defendants succeeded on that issue the trial of the action then followed on the twentieth of march nineteen ninety one and er mr justice made an order for UNK of the partnership he then give various directions for accountant enquiries concerning the partnership and he made orders for payments of costs now the orders for costs were this that effectively the defendant was entitled to some costs of the preliminary issue and that the plaintiffs were entitled to costs of the er ma if i may put it this way the main action and there was then the provision for set off for the defendant's costs against the costs ordered to be paid by the defendant perfectly normal form of order
now if the matter arises on taxation in this way it seems that a loan the trial judgment was given on the twentieth of march nineteen ninety one a minute of order was prepared and signed by counsel for both the plaintiff and for the defendants and that was UNK by the defendant's solicitors to the plaintiff's solicitors under cover of a letter dated the twenty third of april nineteen ninety one er mr who is the defendant's solicitor in the third paragraph had a letter wrote as follows i UNK a copy of the draft minute board approved by mr he of course was counsel for the defendant you are now you were presumably now attend a sealed order
it's er common ground that in fact er no sealed order was drawn up until very considerably later the sealed order is in fact dated the twenty fifth of may nineteen ninety three
now between during the period from the decision of mr justice in march nineteen ninety one and the issue of the sealed order in may nineteen ninety three it's clear from correspondence which has been put before me that there were er various negotiations and discussions between the solicitors for the plaintiff and the defendant dealing with the questions of costs and also with the question of a general settlement of the whole action er it would be appreciated of course that mr justice order does not have the effect of determining finally the rights of the parties erm other than the partnership has in fact dissolved because there were still outstanding issues in particular relating to the premises which were used as the surgery of the premises of the part of the UNK of the practice or perhaps i should say former practice
the position was that the plaintiffs effectively retained possession of the surgery premises and the defendant er moved out of the premises and er went and found other surgery premises and er the position as i understand it is that he is carrying on his own practice today from other premises the plaintiffs are such as now surviving are still continue to practice from the former part of the premises
in on the fourteenth of july of nineteen ninety three the defendant took out a UNK with a view to having all the outstanding matters resolved and er this UNK came before erm deputy master on the twelfth of august nineteen ninety three and he gave various directions including an enquiry in relation to how the surgery premises er ought to be dealt with as in court in the winding up of the partnership and that matter went before mr justice long in december and he decided those issues and gave directions in relation to and how the premises are to be sold the effect of the directions very vaguely is that the premises have to be offered to the partners if only one of the partners shows any interest then there is provision in the relevant deed for UNK the price and this is put to that partner at that price if more than one partner wishes to buy the premises then there is provision for a fixing of a minimum figure and then each of the partners has to put in sealed offers er and the premises will be sold to the partner the former partner who put in the last offer that broadly speaking i think is the substance of mr justice order
the position at the moment is that the defendant tells me he would like to acquire the premises because erm a low criticism has was made of the premises as being suitable for the carry on of the doctors surgery in partner a doctor's surgery in partnership because no doubt the space and other matters er the defendant tells me that erm they are perfectly suitable for as it were a sole UNK to carry on his practice from them and that is why he would like to acquire it
now the taxation of the plaintiff's bill of costs came before master er and er in his taxation it seems and i'm i think i'm right in saying it seems that erm there is no substantial dispute as to the particular items in the various bills of costs with which he was concerned it maybe that if there were a discrepancy he has he dealt with it and nothing has been said before me today er to suggest that the figures appearing in the bill of costs ought to be varied and accordingly i have not er have to consider the detail items in the bill of costs the only issue i didn't decide is whether master was correct in UNK interest for the period that he did er mr for the plaintiff says that he was wrong er that there was no good reason for UNK him any interest and that accordingly i on this appeal should erm discharge or reverse that part of taxing order as disallowed interest
er doctor says not only was the taxing officer right in what he did but he should of gone further and as i say he should of erm disallowed more interest the basis of which erm doctor puts forward that submission before me seems to be two fold first he points out that in fact the plaintiffs failed to perfect the order of mr justice er sorry mr justice erm until the twenty fifth of may nineteen ninety three and that was a i think he would say a UNK failure on part of the plaintiffs and their solicitors to do with what his solicitor had asked them to do in the letter of the twenty third of april nineteen ninety one
the other point which is made by the defendant is this he says that the plaintiffs have been guilty of UNK tactics er during the course of this litigation the result of which has been that er he has not been able to realize his interest in the partnership premises also he has not been able to acquire a partnership premises and he doctor mentioned to me that to the actual UNK of the partnership premises he's he tells me was only produced i think thirty and er that er it was only then that he realized there might be a chance that he could acquire the premises for himself but he says that er because of the general i think the case is because of the general conduct of the plaintiffs in UNK the trial of the action one way or another er the practical effect has been that the plaintiffs have had the benefit of use and occupation of the premises at which he erm a main view has a lot of that interest and that they are getting benefit of the kind from that occupation and he is not getting any money in res in respect of that at least nothing like any market rent because it maybe that there is a fairly small er payment being made but i'm not too entirely clear whether that is the case or not but the stock bond is suggesting that the plaintiffs have been obtaining benefit of the use of the premises at his expense and in those circumstances it is unfair er in or otherwise not appropriate that the plaintiffs should be entitled to obtain interest on their bill of costs in respect essentially of the period of delay and when i say period of delay included that the period during which the forward of mr justice remained erm UNK
when the matter came before the taxing master it appears to have proceeded on UNK that erm order twenty eighty rule four sorry i rule twenty eighty four sixty two er was the relevant er provision under which erm the taxing master disallowed interest
order UNK er rule twenty eight four provides that when a party is entitled to costs and that of course is the case of the plaintiffs a fails without good reason to commence or conduct proceedings for the taxation of those costs in accordance with this order or any direction or b delays lodging a bill of costs for taxation the taxing office may one UNK already part of the costs of taxation that he would otherwise would warn about the party and two after taking into account all the circumstances including any prejudice suffered by any other party as result of such failure or delay as the case maybe and any additional interest payable under section seventeen of the judgements act because of the failure or delay allow the party so entitled less than the amount he would otherwise have allowed on taxation of the bill are wholly disallowed the costs his provision for an appeal to allow to the judge and chambers and that is the way the matter is coming before
me
whether strictly order twenty eight er order sixty rule twenty eight for erm applies in this case is not amount entirely clear to me because the obligation to lodge a bill of taxation under rule twenty nine provides that he must begin proceedings for the taxation either within three months after the judgement direction or order of the UNK enter sides are otherwise UNK and that is presently on it's face which seemed to be UNK may of nineteen ninety three and er accordingly that is right it's not in fact been any failure to comply with order tw order sixty two rule twenty nine one and that hasn't been UNK it's not entirely clear to me that erm there is any matter come from paragraph sub paragraph a of rule twenty eight four it may already require still nevertheless erm fall within paragraph b of rule fo erm there has in fact been a delay in lodging the bill of costs for taxation the delay being really and truly the delay in having the order of mr justice UNK and it seems to me that although in chasing matters generally speaking it is the court will itself draw the order nevertheless where er it seems to be clearly in this case would UNK it that counsel would sign a minute erm that counsel do sign a minute and that minute has been signed having UNK by the defendants solicitors to the defendants solicitors seems to me it must be the case that erm the obligation to as it were forward that minute to the court it is an obligation which would lie upon the plaintiffs solicitors and it maybe said that erm there has been delay and erm on the best it should be lodged with the court sealed er shortly after it was received and that therefore on that UNK there has been delay lodging the bill of costs for UNK er mr doctor doesn't seemed to be take any point in relation to that er because it's not in his interest to do so it seems to be that he does have to say if it has been delayed with an order of twenty eight rule four that's a rule twenty eight er four if he is to have interest UNK and er mr er he'll apparently have the matter of read before the taxing master it seems that the taxing master did not UNK any sympathy with that er suggestion that er there was in fact no breach of the requirement rule twenty four mr he said very probably that erm look on text upon it he really is concerned to erm have this case dealt with as you put it on the merits it seems to me it's in the interest of all parties that erm i should deal with the case on merits have on the assumption erm that er that was lodged properly i think i ca i a matter of which found within rule twenty eight four and that the taxing officer give our interest under that rule
right it's clear UNK it under four rule twenty eight four it's not essential for the UNK of any cost or interest that er the taxing officer should be satisfied that erm the other party has been UNK in fact that is not a condition precedent to the exercise of his part and UNK interest in this here item er any prejudice there maybe is merely one factor to be taken into account in other matters and it does seem to me that the fact the court can properly and should properly take into account is that erm it is desirable that to litigation should erm comply with there obligations either UNK express or explicit under the rules of the court to comply with matter such as it should have orders part drawn up and served as appropriate as i say it seems to me that er the UNK can be criticized in not erm having UNK the order of mr justice er before they did so but er i have it seems to me to look at all the relevant pictures in the case er if it were the case that the plaintiff suffered any prejudice as the result of that claim clearly that would be a matter which i would have to take into account but i'm bound to say it doesn't seem to me that the UNK of the plaintiffs to perfect the order did in fact cause any prejudice to the plaintiff and indeed if they the plaintiffs had UNK the order it seems to me exactly the same course of events as in fact UNK in this case would actually have occurred and wouldn't make any difference at all so unless it's a matter of simply of er seeking to punish the plaintiff as a matter of discipline it seems to me there is a not really anything in the point that the order was not UNK er when it seems to me it should of been and i there stood to see the other er circumstances now it's quite clear to me having been referred to correspondence passing between the solicitors that erm although really from a very early stage er the plaintiffs solicitors referring to mr a letter of early nineteen ninety one indicating that erm the view was being taken that the likelihood was that erm the plaintiffs would have to get their costs out of the defendants share and interest in the premises and er that would be a matter which could only be dealt with when the enquiries director by mr justice had been dealt with
mr
was the defendants solicitors the parties during nineteen ninety one the two solicitors had dealt with the question of costs and er perfectly normal way the plaintiffs have their costs drafted by er cost UNK i understand that in house UNK and erm they produced to mr a bill for costs er mr looked at the bill and met counter proposals and he suggested other figures erm figures in the region of forty two thousand pounds forty seven and fifty thousand pounds for the plaintiffs costs the correspondence indicates that mr then now put forward what with respect seems to be entirely sensible suggestion that er really it would not be sensible to proceed with having the cost taxed he said he didn't UNK any real difficulty in getting them to agree the costs and that er the common sense thing in the interest of all parties was to see if they could reach an overall settlement er determining all the matters in dispute effectively this would be what was to be done in respect of the surgery premises there was i think there is reference in accounted to another sec another premises as well which apparently were lease er but are now formed part of the negotiations and er negotiations continued between the parties during nineteen ninety two by the end of nineteen ninety two the negotiations were beginning to run into difficulties the plaintiffs were beginning to put forward non UNK final offers and er the result unfortunately was that in apparently nineteen ninety three the er negotiations into that broke down
mr was well aware because he'd been told by the plaintiffs solicitors that the plaintiffs received terms for cover or to obtain interest on their costs the plaintiffs solicitors wrote specifically to mr UNK was his offer in the sum of forty two thousand pounds that's er the possible agreed settlement figure for costs er if it was inclusive or exclusive of interest erm there were some delay but er mr wrote back in due course making clear that interest wasn't included i should also say that in mr er proposed bill of costs he had disallowed interest for a fairly short period in respect of both the plaintiffs bill of costs and the defendants bill of costs and the plaintiffs solicitors don't appear to have erm taken any point on that but as i say it the point as to interest was specifically raised by the plaintiffs solicitors letter and er i'm quite satisfied on the correspondence that they when it came to the matter were seen were UNK of obtaining interest in respect of their costs
the letter from the plaintiffs solicitors in respect of question of interest one causes the letter of the twenty ninth of january of nineteen ninety two asking mr to confirm that in addition to the settlement figure of forty two thousand pounds in respect of costs he'd be paying interest until the date of payment and er there was never a mind that erm which find a reply to in thirtieth of march nineteen ninety two by mr there's no UNK agreement in figure of forty two thousand pounds i do not wish to appear UNK but your clients must recognise that there are effectively two issues to be resolved namely the payment of their costs and the division of the parts of other property surely in all parties interest that none of these are resolved so it is surely in all party interest that those are resolved contemporary and then the letter goes on to dealing with questions of valuation the bottom paragraph on page thirty two in the bundle says in answer to your letter therefore is that there is no agreement to pay interest if there is then my client must be UNK with interest on his costs and then it says surgery and finally if UNK if overall agreement cannot be reached then my client reserves his rights on the issue of costs and i feel that this could lead to an UNK and UNK taxation at the end of the day i suspect it would only be enforced the order for costs about taking a charge in my clients interest in the surgery premises does that improve your clients position at all as i say that was the position of the thirtieth of march nineteen ninety two and during the remainder of nineteen ninety two there were then further negotiations some of them appeared to have been carried out er personally between er doctor and er doctor which seems to of been the partner dealing with the plaintiffs position and er he says about his non UNK offer at page forty one in the bundle apparently attached to a letter of the twenty first of december nineteen ninety two and er that had a time limit on the twenty second of march there was a reminder on the twenty second of february and erm the plaintiffs solicitors wrote on the fourteenth of april nineteen ninety three raising the question of costs erm say that erm we have now received your clients instructions that they would be prepared to accept the sum of forty two thousand in respect of their standard basis costs which is inclusive of v a t and UNK you remember that our initial schedule of costs which i set part of my letter of the eighth of october total fifty thousand nine hundred and ninety eight pounds twenty six pence in addition to this our client would require interest from the which is as of UNK date at seven hundred and sixty days at seventeen pounds twenty six a day totalling thirteen thousand one hundred and seventeen pounds sixty in the circumstances i look forward to receiving your clients cheque for the sum of fifty five thousand one hundred and seventeen pounds and sixty pence within the next seven days and then it says i believe you were certainly agreeing have been very patient concerning your clients costs but now we wish these to be paid and that was responded to er mr on the twenty second of april er but why he quite has not been directly involved in the conversation for some time and there was not reasonable expected response for seven days from him er and then he goes on to say that although he UNK his firm is still on the record i shall seek instructions from my client but it maybe he would wish to give notice of acting in person and indeed that is in fact what happened what happened in this case
now it seems to me with erm with great respect from the view of the taxing officer that er it's quite clear that er both parties were holding UNK were holding their hands in relation to a question of taxation because negotiations were going on between the parties and indeed the defendants were being requested er not to proceed with taxation but to see if they could obtain an overall assessment and the point was met to the defendants barrister telling quite frankly there wouldn't be much advantage in the defendants pushing on with erm taxation because they'd only they would have to look to his interest in the property to get payment it seems to me in those circumstances that it cannot be said that erm the plaintiffs were in any way acting UNK and not seeking to have the costs taxed during the period while the negotiations were being carried on er because effectively and
mr replied that is what mr was asking the other to do that is to hold their hand and to enter into negotiations now i fully appreciate that erm doctor feels strongly that the defendants have not been negotiating in good faith and have been simply dragging matters out for his benefit now when i say that i'm simply saying what i understand to be doctor view i'm certainly not suggesting that i'm finding as a fact but that was the decision indeed i couldn't cos i've not heard all the evidence on this matter not as mr to address me on that one it seems to me with all respect to doctor missions on this matter that if there has been any dragging of feet or other UNK conduct of either the defendants in connection with er they remain on in the premises and not paying what doctor would consider to be a full and proper rent or if there has been problem about their not UNK documents when they should have done the position is that doctor has er by making an appropriate application to the court for maybe the appropriate relief arising out of the facts which he can establish but that is not in general a matter which erm the court should go into on the question of taxation it's not th this particular taxation of costs is a taxation as i understand it that are formally to the debt of the order of mr justice and there is thus no question of the court having to consider the question when the those tax those costs have been UNK or increased in any way by reason of spinning out negotiations whether to run up costs or otherwise that simply doesn't arising it seems to me in this case that maybe a matter which may arise possibly at some future date though i would hope it would not do so but er so far as the costs down to the end of the trial of the twentieth of march nineteen ninety one are concerned it seems to me the fact that the parties maybe negotiating subsequently to UNK to UNK to resolve the outstanding issue it's not a matter which really goes to the question of erm what is the proper amount to allow for taxation of costs which have already been incurred before these negotiations erm we don't the figure of the costs appears to have been effectively agreed between the solicitors at forty two thousand pounds the plaintiff solicitors made it quite clear that they were seeking interest this was clear in apparently of nineteen ninety two but this held their hand er it seems to me the reason they held their hand rather than indicate it was because the defendant through his solicitor was asking them to do so and it seems to me that mr was acting very sensibly in the defendants interest because if in fact they had gone ahead and taxed their costs there and then the position would simply be that there would of been an award for taxation in order there would be a taxation resulting in an order for payment of some cost probably in the region of forty two thousand pounds and er that order would itself carry interest under the judgements act it doesn't seem to me it can be sensibly said that erm any interest has to be in any way increased by reason of this delay and it seems to me that erm if one looks at order sixty two and twenty eight er certainly under paragraph b two erm there's a reference there to any additional interest payable under section seventeen because of the failure on the may erm it doesn't seem to me that the effect of what has in fact incurred in this case has been caused any additional interest to be paid and er it seems to me the only best that i can see in the evidence before me to which would enable the court to erm conclude that there should be a UNK of interest would be as i say because the plaintiffs appear not to have UNK the order for the payment of UNK two years just over two years erm it seems to me however that on balance probably it simply a matter of UNK and even if it had been UNK it wouldn't of made as i guess the least bit of difference to the way the negotiations er proceeded and accordingly i take the view that erm there are no grounds for UNK interest from either the plaintiffs bill of costs or the defendants bill of costs accordingly erm to allow the defendants appeal in preparation to the UNK of costs er interest and to dismiss the defendants appeal for application in relation to an additional period p sixty of course disallowed i also propose to dismiss the sum of the appeal by the plaintiffs from the refusal of taxing master to UNK the interest on the defendants bill of costs
well there was just it's not surprising it's a very long day when you initially said i allow the period of the plaintiff by mistake you said defendant just for the record
i allow that it is the
it's the substantial the plaintiff isn't it that's allowed
yes i allow the plaintiffs appeal and dismiss the defendants as it were cross appeal from the order in erm it's the august er taxing master right of the twelfth of august isn't it
but i only put that in case the
yes thank you that is thank you thank you very much
my lord all that follows now is that question costs in this my lord there is no doubt that er this is the painful experience for both the plaintiffs and of course for doctor who is UNK and therefore must inevitably feel rather isolated in this matter erm however in my there is no reason to er depart from the usual principal of the costs which should follow the event and of course we know as it the loss on the subsidiary appeal and so i don't press the point on that cos the reality as you've already probably anticipated is all the work has been done erm on this appeal the subsidiary appeal i ask i don't ask for costs on that in my submission it should be both sides bear their own costs on that the reason i say that is that there was no there was no cross appearing in respect on it in effect cos after all you were doing was er trying to get the same as the other side if we lost so no UNK of can of beans can be done by doctor i had one parallel in my whole skeleton on that er but we have substantially succeeded on the main issue and so i would ask that costs in favour of the plaintiffs on that and here and indeed below
what was the order of those costs made below equally
cost in both on both er UNK the costs were against my clients
so
but i accept that er
mr has got costs below yes erm
i accept that you can't i should of added that in respect of the decision of er september second decision
mm
you wouldn't be fair of me to ask you to change that
no i think i mean that's
i would think that's a chance we took and we lost it
yes
but i've not our costs
yes mr doctor
i'm sorry my lord for saying this erm i'm well i am really gonna ask for legal fees on this
well i'll deal with that after we've dealt with the question of costs what do you say on the question of costs doctor
erm feel like they're getting the benefit again and again you now make the costs of at every point they take another they've got more coming in erm in terms of cash and er at every point i seem to loose i loose the first case in ninety one and everything now seems to go against me it seems as though i don't stand a chance any more
i think i must make the ordinary orders to costs well what i will do is erm doctor must i think pay the costs of the appeal against the order of master erm both here and below on the other hand the defendant seems to be able to bear the costs of the appeal against the september order that's the order that's the order of is that mr er sorry when i say the doc doctor bears the costs must er in fact he must right it is the august that's the august decision both before erm the taxing officer and on this appeal and er the i dismiss the defendants appeal against the september board with costs
oh yes i'd object to the settlement
and again i'll direct that the costs will be set off seems to be the sensible course
well yes did
yes
for which one it shows i'm afraid my i ask for er if it's required certificate for counsel maybe required for taxation later on
erm well i think it's do erm i don't know whether you understand what's been asked doctor it cou it's a question of costs er normally where er matters erm are dealt with in chambers for in counsel appear then erm these counsel don't get paid for the other side erm unless there is certificate for counsel as i understand it were the were the counsel appeared before the judge erm they are entitled to their costs and this is er an appeal to the judge but er what i think mr is saying is in case he happens to be wrong in that he would like an order that er his fees should be proper fees of the UNK of the plaintiffs on this appeal and er such as you could say seems to me that er that is a that would be proper
yes i think it's been of an assistance to the court yes assistance to me that erm mr has been at least only to of explain the background which erm is not entirely not an easy matter so er if it's necessary i'll give a certificate
i'm grateful that's for today erm my lord it may sound slightly more erm contentious but i'd also ask for certificate for counsel for the thirteenth of august hearing may i say the reason for that it's a matter that hasn't come before you won't know about it's this reason because at that period it wasn't just the application under twenty eighty or twenty eight four for delay there was another application er which was unsuccessful which hasn't been proceed today but cost were also disallowed with more serious reason i submit that said showed er UNK or that UNK conduct there was a substantial attack mounted and i can use no other words fairly describe it on the professional conduct of and for that reason my lord er both cos the UNK of the allegations but of course also because of the potential conflict that they acted for themselves and it would of been in situation for us solicitor hence to turn up er they instructed counsel and my self and so for that double reason in my believe we should be entitled to at first stage UNK i wouldn't of had a very good run for argument but i it's my suspicion my clue recollection be backed up by those behind me and indeed by the documents that a substantial attack was mounted and it was in i have to say in full flight terms and much hence couldn't be said to be unreasonable to UNK if necessarily UNK to send counsel in front of a taxing master well i won't say any more on the point but that is my suspicion
what was the taxing off asked for certificate for counsel presumably he wasn't
well huh my lord having lost erm taxing master didn't
no i'm sure he didn't
well rather
didn't have to pay the costs it didn't really arise
no that's correct
yes that's right
is it right doctor that you made a an attack on professional confidence of other than in a relationship the erm UNK of the order
my lord it is since that erm because as you mention that er because of all the delay that i am quite sure that positively intended erm i lost large sums of paying my solicitors as well as a surveyor and therefore i attempted to er to UNK that
yes
i didn't er
yes i see i think er unfortunately doctor i in this particular case i ought to make an order for certificate for counsel erm in the current in respect of the costs incurred below on the thirteenth of august seems to me do er the proper kind of case in which to instruct counsel
erm i think so there's no dispute as to what the terms of the order are er mr it might be helpful if you could erm prepare a minute of order for lodging
certainly
of course er provide a copy of that to erm doctor before it is lodged and i'm sure it can be agreed
my lord do we agree to that now or by tomorrow morning
well i would think if it could lodged during the course of the next ten days or so
certainly it'll be done by tomorrow morning
i'm if there any question over it the reason why i said ten days i'm already sitting in london for until the end of next week and therefore if there were any question it's obvious that it came before me and that
it'll be done by tomorrow morning
yes
thank you
yes that can be prepared and erm a copy of that to doctor and
certainly
doctor if you don't agree with what it says erm you can obviously mention that to and er along UNK say in the course of this week the matter can be mentioned in formal to me erm one morning at ten o'clock next week i would of thought
in terms of i need to appeal this one
oh yes leave to appeal erm it doesn't seem to me that this is an appropriate case for leave or at least for me to grant leave doctor
all court rise
well now james what can we do for you
oh

cheerio now
it was harvest time in bethlehem and naomi was returning home
and ruth her daughter in law was coming with her
she had made that declaration and that commitment that she would go with her mother in law wherever she went that her god UNK god would be UNK god and that UNK people would be UNK people
and so they come back to the land of UNK and make their way to bethlehem
now i can imagine that when they started off the journey ruth a was full of excitement and wonder what was gonna happen what were these people who lived in bethlehem like
were they all like ruth
er like naomi
were they all like her husband who had recently died
what were they like
naomi would have been returning again i'm sure to start off with a sense of excitement she was going back home
been a long time since she had heard her language spoken freely
been a long time since she had UNK with god's people
and yet i'm quite sure that as they got nearer and nearer to bethlehem their feelings would have changed a little bit
the sense of excitement that ruth would have had might have changed a wee bit to almost a little bit of fear
will they receive me
i'm a stranger i'm a UNK
how will they welcome me
and i'm sure the same sort of thinking would have going through UNK mind
will they remember me
what will they say to me when i come back home
will they give me the cold shoulder
will they UNK me
what will it be like
i left when there was a time of UNK and i went into another country and now there's a time of plenty and i'm going back home what are they going to say to me
how are they gonna treat me
and it was had been a long UNK road for these two women as they travelled back to bethlehem with their own thoughts and their fears
what would their reception be like
naomi she was arriving back UNK she had a foreign daughter in law that in itself was proof enough that she had UNK from god's will
the fact she was taking back a UNK as her as a relation as her daughter in law was a would be a constant reminder i UNK god
i fell from what god from god's standard i failed god
what would they say
now ruth knew as well that the UNK hated the UNK
how would they receive her
would she be able to work
would she be treated as an UNK
as i say it was the time of harvest wi the time of barley harvest when they arrived at bethlehem
there as they come and look over the cities small city and they see the fields there around the city with the grain waving in the UNK ready and ripe just waiting to be UNK
it must have looked a beautiful sight
they would hear the happy UNK of the people in the harvest field because although it was hard work it was happy work
harvest is always a good time
all the year's work the UNK the preparing the hard work it's now been worthwhile
because there's a harvest to UNK there's plenty now
and so there'd be the happy UNK of people as they were working knowing there was gonna be enough and to spare
they would get through the winter without any problem
they wouldn't have to pull in their belts they wouldn't have to UNK it out and ration themselves because there wasn't enough it was an UNK harvest
god had been good to them
he had seen them through the lean years and here now was a good harvest
and seeing these two women coming down through the path towards the city the people of bethlehem yo you'll read it there in the opening of chapter two in the book of ruth the people of bethlehem they left their fields and came running to UNK them
they gave a to a beautiful UNK
in the th the end of chapter nineteen it says all the city was UNK up because of them
and the women said is this naomi
and she said do not call me naomi
cos you know th it was mentioned the other week that word that name it means UNK
she said call me UNK for the lord the almighty has dealt very UNK with me
she got it all wrong again
the lord hadn't dealt UNK with her she had gone out of god's will she had taken herself out of the covering of god's protection and blessing
the lord hadn't dealt UNK with her
in fact he was being very gracious to her in allowing her to return and to come back he had drawn her back
and you know for you and i so often imagine think back to the time when you did not know jesus christ how easy it was to blame god for this and for that if there's a god of love in heaven why doesn't he do something about it
why doesn't he do this
why does he allow this to happen
it's so easy to blame god isn't it
and we did our share of it i'm quite sure
and all the time god was reaching out to us in love drawing us to himself yet we didn't realize it
but anything goes wrong and it's god's fault
if it goes right well that's just great isn't it
tha that's wonderful
you know god doesn't get any credit for it doesn't get any thanks for it but anything adverse happen and god why did you allow this to happen
but you know the tragedy is that this doesn't just happen when we're non christian it ha can happen when we're christians as well
but oh it's it can never ever be god's fault because he always deals with us in love
we don't always like what he does to us but it UNK we must never ever it to make us bitter
and naomi makes the mistake do not call me pleasant call me bitter for the almighty has dealt very UNK with me
i went out full but the lord has brought me back empty
you see the great thing is not that she came back empty but the great thing is she came back
that was what god was wanting to do to bring her back
and even if it meant bringing her back empty he was still bringing her back
and the people receive her they welcome her
now the UNK had been taught to welcome strangers and to look after them and UNK fears must have been UNK as they receive her there's no cross examination there's no UNK she doesn't go through any third degree she is received back at face value
they've come back and now they could begin to experience the blessings that god had planned for them
while we're out of god's will we cannot expect to experience god's blessing
he would not be true to himself if he UNK us with blessings while we're outside of his will
but once we come back to that place and wherever we go from him we have got to come back to where we started where we left the road
when we come back to there then and only then can we expect er to experience god's blessing for us
and as they come as naomi comes back to the place where she went UNK so god starts to bless so much so that she doesn't know whether she's standing or sitting
she is overwhelmed by god's blessing
that's the great you know god doesn't keep an account of our UNK
he doesn't mark them and say right boy you went UNK then you're gonna pay for that
you're gonna go through it until i think it's time to start blessing
god doesn't deal with us like that
if the lord would mark UNK who of us stand
but the moment there's that response in our heart towards him there he is with arms open wide to receive us and to shower us with his blessing
now i'm not quite sure whether it's because we've known like naomi we've we know periods of UNK and UNK that his blessing seems so much more i don't know if that's what it is or whether it is just because his blessings are so UNK but she is overwhelmed by god's goodness and by god's blessing to her they could now experience god's blessing
but the tragedy is she could have known those blessings all through those years if she had never left if she had never gone down to UNK
the extent of those blessings then that god UNK on her there were far greater than anything that she could have imagined
you know you and i today are still UNK are UNK now the result the benefits of the blessings that god poured upon naomi
because out of her daughter in law and so on down the line comes david and then comes jesus christ
all god's ways are beyond our ways
and whilst it was never it could never have been god's will for naomi to UNK with UNK her husband and to go into UNK out of the mess that they make of their life out of the mistakes that they UNK again and again god somehow in his UNK in his mercy brings goodness from it
his ways are so far beyond our ways
only we'll let him have his way
and so we see the way of blessing
ruth and naomi they'd lost all their possessions and the most prominent member of the family was a man called boaz
by skill and UNK he had increased the family wealth and fortune and now he was a UNK man of wealth
and before ruth and naomi could know anything of god's provision there was two steps they had to take
and you know it doesn't change god still re makes a requirement of us
the first thing they had to do and oh this is a difficult one
they had to humble themselves
it would not be easy to acknowledge themselves as the poor relation
they were the ones in the family now who had nothing
she said i went out full th presumably she and UNK had a nice little nest egg they had a comfortable bank balance they had plenty we went out full but now she comes back empty
certainly they would not go and beg from wealthy relatives
but there was a way provided for them in god's word
so you see ee god doesn't leave things for chance he doesn't leave people on the scrap heap he reaches out to them all the time
and so er when th the UNK were gathering in the harvest they were not allowed to go right to the edge of the field they had to leave a border they were not to go right into the corners they were to leave those areas so that the poorer members so that those who did not have could come and could gather what was left behind
to go out and UNK then would be an acknowledgement for everybody to see that they had nothing
they had no land of their own they had nothing to harvest of their own they could only go and harvest and UNK what the UNK left behind
now such a UNK would not be easy for ruth and naomi but it was the only way for them
and they were willing to humble UNK
you know the first step in getting god's blessing is to humble ourselves
if we humble ourselves then he UNK and we UNK he then has to humble us and to be UNK by god is a fearful thing
the bible never tells us to pray to god to humble us that's a dangerous prayer
but it says humble yourself under the hand under the UNK hand of god then in that day he will lift you up he will UNK you
and so to get god's blessing there's gotta be a we've gotta humble UNK
and then the second thing was they had to be willing to work
UNK was hard work
now UNK is not easy that's a back breaking job
but when you've got a full field to harvest at least you're getting something but when you're just going around the edges and picking the bits that are left behind that is a hard job you're spending as long but you're not getting as much
they had to work hard
it was UNK
it was boring
it meant starting early in the morning and continuing till late in the evening
but ruth goes out and she UNK applies herself to it
so much so that the foreman he sees it and he UNK her to boaz his boss
as a good worker
he UNK at her diligence an and the way she continues there
and god's blessings came to ruth only as she was willing to get out and do something
you know as we sit back and just wait for god to bless us we'll wait an awful long time
he requires that we do something that we get on that we become involved
and as we are as we are active as we are active in his service and his work then he is able to bless us
it says it's the devil who finds work for idle hands
god doesn't give anything to the idle
but the devil gives them work to do
notice also we'll hurry along now the source of blessing
as a UNK ruth could have gone to any part of the field but she happened to come a fo part of the field that belonged to boaz
you know to the christian to the believer there is no such thing as luck things don't just happen
as soon as ruth acknowledged her poverty and her willingness to work god stepped in and guided her life in a way that would bring great blessing
she could have gone anywhere but god directed her
she'd committed herself to god's ways and to god's people and god UNK her and she comes to the field of boaz and there was none more able to meet her need
he was a UNK many of wealth
you know if you're gonna get help from anybody get it from a rich person
they can give you more for a start
and so he wa he was a good person to go to
he was one who was concerned for the welfare of his of his employee
he was obviously a good boss to work for
he was a kindly man
he was a man who UNK god
and perhaps i won't say most important but very importantly he was a near relative of UNK father in law and that would play a big part in UNK the property
we're not gonna go into that today don't worry
but it was a vital thing
of all the people of all the land owners there of all those who had fields or bits of a field to harvest god UNK ruth to boaz and you can see the UNK of the blessing there
seeing this stranger among the UNK boaz asks his foreman about ruth and she is as we've mentioned she he talks about her diligence about her UNK ways about her consideration for other and boaz offers to her three things he offers to her guidance he says don't go anywhere else you stay here
he offers protection he says nobody's gonna UNK you he says i'll look after you
UNK hurt you UNK harm you
he offers her provision far more than she ever expected
he offered an as yo as you read it there in the opening of chapter two he offered her drink at meal times she was to eat the food provided for boaz servants he gave to her the extra portion of UNK corn and also he provided extra UNK for her
and we see a beautiful picture here of god's provision for us as we come into his family
as our UNK boaz as the lord jesus christ as we come under his control
he offers guidance he says don't go to any other field where else can you go
he said to his disciples
when some started leaving he says will you go away
and they said who can we go
you've got the words of eternal life there's nowhere else to go
he offers protection no one will UNK you
he says i will never leave or UNK you
there is power in heaven in earth or hell that can touch you when you're under my protection when you're in my care
he said none shall UNK you from my hand
and he offers provision far more than we can ever expect
provision materials spiritual provision
able to satisfy us and meet our need day after day year after year as the decades even and go we still er find sufficient and ample provision at his table
david says doesn't he there in that beautiful twenty third UNK
he said you UNK my head with all my cup runs over
i've and he again he the UNK says i come into your UNK house and er so UNK rather and your and your banner over me as well there is sufficient provision for every one of us
and so what happens
ruth comes home with UNK
she hasn't been one of the UNK she's been but a UNK but god has provided for her
and that night ruth arrives home to tell naomi of all the wonderful things that has happened to her and she hands over the result of her day's labour
farm more than naomi could ever have expected
and you know as we come and submit ourselves to god and as we look back whether it's back on a day on a week on a month on year on a lifetime he has given to us far more than we could ever have asked or expected from him as the apostle said he is able to do UNK above all that we can ask or think
and this is it this was UNK experience and it can be yours and mine as we allow him to lead us and to direct us as we come become part of his harvest
can i just change the picture in closing thinking of harvest is not just the harvest that we UNK for ourselves the benefits that we get but jesus said also he said you look on the fields they're white all ready to harvest
the only thing was they weren't white to harvest they weren't even ready the crop had not fully grown and yet jesus says it's white all ready to harvest what is he speaking of
he's speaking of this time now and this age when it is now harvest time
and you don't have to wait we can't wait until the end he said but now is the harvest time get on with the job now
and he says pray the father the father pray the husband man that he will send labourers into his harvest field
see the harvest field you and i get the benefit from but jesus said you pray for labourers to go into the harvest field
if praying to god to humble ourselves is dangerous praying the father to send labourers into the harvest field is equally dangerous
because when you pray that he doesn't send the person beside you he doesn't send the other person he says right boy up and at it
he says it to you and he says it to me
you start answering your own prayer
you want labourers you pray for labourers well you're the first one
and he calls each one of us to be labourers together with him in his great harvest field
we're gonna sing a song now in closing that puts this challenge to us it's number one sixty one in the songs of fellowship it reminds us that we're the ones not the other person not the young person that shows so much promise that we think not somebody else who is so much more UNK than we are but here it says here i am available
i'm the one that can answer that prayer
you are the one that can answer that prayer
one sixty one then let's sing it through
not just as a not just a song that we're singing at the end of a sermon but as a prayer yes here i am lord
for this harvest time
thanking you for the great benefits of your goodness to me UNK in these natural provisions here
but lord as i see your harvest field i wanna be part of it
i wanna be involved in it
my pleasure
i'll introduce you to w p c heather who's the local crime prevention officer
i won't introduce the rest but th they're all linked and i gather that er you're gonna be replacing heather in her role in the near future
yes sir
thank you
and don't worry if you see a tape recorder going er it's actually being recorded but just forget that it's there
and we hope to be able to show you a video
we'll make that up as we go along
but with that over to you heather
right
okay
thanks very much
ted
those of you who UNK will get
okay
right
crime prevention covers a multitude of things er and we'll bring it back to what actually effects you
and i think that has to be in our homes
we all like to feel safe and secure in our homes and but do we actually think about security unless we become a victim
how do we go about securing up our homes
do we know the areas that we should be concentrating on
most of you come from er around this area and i would and i would probably refer to this erm as our local area because that is
for harlow and the UNK area that we actually concentrate on that takes in forty or at least no it doesn't
our crime rate erm for burglaries is about thirty two percent and that's home
burglaries
most people that are the victim of burglaries erm decide to do their security
but it's knowing the right things
you can see lots of different security products on the market and
it doesn't have to in actual fact
but you start or we like to start at the front door of what we call
now how many amongst you have just got that on your front door
a lock like that
yeah
nothing else
just that
that's it
okay
this in actual fact is called an automatic free UNK
you all know it by UNK whatever the company make is
it isn't actually a security lock
it never was designed to be one
it's an easy lock for you to come in and out of your houses with
this is only as good as the UNK holding it in place in your front door
a simple credit card slipped down there is sufficient UNK between the door frame and the actual lock itself can open one of these types of locks showing no signs of forced entry
you won't even know somebody's been into your houses
most houses are fitted with these but it's up to you as individuals to actually look and see er if that's sufficient
if that is all you've got even with a double lock UNK action it is very easy to open up
what we'd like you to do and to consider and i'll come on to replacement soon is to consider UNK it with one of these types of locks
many different makes
UNK is probably one of the most UNK
this is a UNK lock
a five lever UNK dead lock
this is a security lock
you would probably see them on front doors and perhaps some of you have already got them where about a third of the way up is a little brass plate and it's an integral lock that's fitted into the door
the reason that these are a security lock is there are security features built into it
the leverage on a lock depends on the type of combination
this one is a five lever which is probably the most standard
it is a made to a british standard which you can tell when you buy anything like that by the UNK mark on the side
this one has got five UNK and the UNK are these things here that you can see in the UNK
they're set into a set combination
there are up to a thousand UNK of keys bought with these types of locks
so every one in a thousand key might actually fit this type of lock but it's highly unlikely
it's got a steel bolt with two steel rollers in there so that if even somebody tried to UNK their way through that it will just slide along as soon as
they're very to open
they won't the burglar is more likely to seriously damage the frame than the actual lock
they cost about we reckon seventeen to twenty five pounds to buy and they have to be fitted to a door one and three quarter inches thick
if you're good at do it yourself then fine have a go if you're not this particularly applies to the gents swallow your pride and get somebody in to do it for you
please do not do er what a young man did the other day went to his house he was the victim of a burglary he very UNK announced that he'd fitted one of these locks to his front door when we saw how he'd fitted it he'd actually UNK out the majority of the side of his door in and filled it up with UNK
erm we did tell him that obviously he'd
that might help
yes
he also fitted it at the top end of the door
now if you've got nowhere else erm at the bottom end of the door to fit it that's fine but as a matter of a preference crime prevention like to see them fitted a third of the way up the door that is where our UNK put the boot in and UNK will work to pressure points to leverage points they come equipped or most of them don't come equipped because obviously if they're walking along the street and a police officer sees them you know pull them over and start to talk to them most of them will actually er use the tools from the back garden or things they find lying around to help themselves in
now that's all very well having one of those if you've got a nice solid wood door to fit it to but if you're looking at the new replacement p v c doors erm afterwards you can't fit that type of lock because the actual structure of the door won't take it
so how do you secure up one of those doors
any of you got that problem
yes
well actual fact unless it's done the UNK fitted at the time of manufacture you can actually serious damage the UNK
and i wouldn't suggest you UNK with it er because if you do damage the framework of it you've got no UNK from the company
some aluminium doors will take extra security device
but that is where you need to get a specialist UNK in to actually assess the UNK of the door
cos on the new p v c doors most of the security is down one side you've got what i call multi UNK surface
some of you might have seen them where you've got a number of bolts that shoot into the top from the side of the frame and the whole thing operates at the turn of a key
it's very good if that that's in place but you have to also make sure that the UNK on the UNK side are fitted correctly as well
cos i had an occasion where i had a replacement door it was my own house and they ripped off half the UNK
and if you think of a the main fabric of them they're quite UNK
and there have been occasions now where our local police certainly and that er UNK areas and just knock the back of the
so do choose very carefully if you're thinking of having replacement glazing and doors
every house has weak areas you can probably identify them yourselves and so can UNK
if i was gonna break into a into you know my house how would i do it
and there are obvious points to watch isn't there
the back and the sides for instance
UNK like to work UNK and UNK
they like the coverage of UNK to work at night
as i say they will use the things that are in your back garden
so security UNK not only from the home but onto the garden shed as well
if you've got a flat roof for instance if you've got sun UNK in the side well you just stack those up to the level of levels of your
and one of the most common UNK into houses is by a small fan light window
as soon as they can get their head and shoulders through they're in double glazing UNK is one of the best UNK
security is like a game of UNK and our UNK are sort of like one move ahead of us or vice versa as the case might be
the window locks which there are many different types to choose from are now not the deterrent they were
and if you have are sort of UNK on and they're put underneath erm until you sort of type locks cos anything else
but how do you be really how do you not scare yourselves from going out gonna return to your homes and that everything's going to be left as it was
it's a question of having to deal with the truth
making it as difficult as possible for them to come in by setting up barriers doing things perhaps a at night putting like some timer switches in the rooms that you're likely to be sitting in
you'd be surprised the number of people that will leave still just the one UNK light in the UNK
nobody sits in their for eight hours of an evening
so put it i put a light on in a room that you will actually be in
adjust the curtains
you cannot odds against the free newspapers coming through your doors they're a pain to all of us
but we as crime prevention officers regularly meet with erm the newspaper people to say can you make sure your staff push them through the letter boxes and they assure us that the er the next thing on their list to UNK but it doesn't happen
and you must have gone through in your own neighbourhood where you see papers sticking out of letter bo boxes milk left on the front door step
they are the tell tale signs that the someone is not in
an extension of that is good neighbourhood
are any of you involved in neighbourhood watch
mm
yes
offer that to you do you think they neighbourhood work watch works
er
before they set it up really
yes
you might get the o the odd one or two that are always looking out their windows and lo they would do that in any case
no i don't really se
that's a good idea
i don't necessarily think it does
i UNK
went out of the house to go to shut the door and realized i'd left my cars in the house
the only window open was at the back so i had to break into my own house through there i managed it
and full expecting at any time perhaps to hear the er UNK sort of police car but there wasn't any
no
erm alright perhaps somebody said you know what's going on there i wouldn't be surprised
cos you were
yeah
but i i'm i was rather disappointed that nothing had happened
unfortunately neighbourhood watch is only as good what people
yeah
doing about it
erm that is joint effort not only with yourselves but for the police as well
and when you've got a good neighbourhood watch this is so and you'll find that they are very efficient
we've had some good successes with them
it's also depending on how much information you get because it should be a two way er communication
most neighbourhood watches should supply regular news letters and information via local beat officers
and if that doesn't happen in your watches then that's something that needs to be addressed
er on an average here we sent out a newsletter once every month and we have things called a crime line which is an UNK service updated every week with all of our crimes on it
so people have rung in on this direct line to find out what's going on and things UNK that could be useful to them
and we found that it's starting to erm pay dividends
but it took us a long time to actually get to that stage because er the police are at fault the police launch these schemes and they go away and say get on with it and off we go
and no follow up
no follow up
and it's a fault that we recognized
so if i can just break it down
the best deterrent against house burglaries at the moment is an alarm system
but actually even with an alarm system you must have gone through where you've heard alarms ringing all day and nobody's been
er if it's at night time it UNK you cos if all ring your neighbours they're not gonna be so friendly if your UNK ringing forever and a day and you know it's disturbing your sleep
it's important if you consider having an alarm you UNK your neighbours
you don't have to tell them your business but what you do have to say is i've got an alarm system an UNK system so bells only if you hear it going off can you ring the home station
it might be a bit more than that and can actually scare off
if you don't tell anybody nobody's going to react to that until it starts to UNK them because most people think that everybody else is going to do something about it
it's like the car alarm isn't it
you hear them going off
the only time we really react to them is when perhaps it's on our car we don't them to disturb anybody and you're trying to UNK about with your keys and switch the thing off
if you've got an alarm which is faulty and repeatedly goes off then nine times out of ten you ought to switch the thing off in the first place
and i think there was a local radio article er a couple of days ago that said that car alarms do not work any more house alarms do providing you've got good neighbours to respond to it
the prices of alarms as well you'd be quite surprised they do not range from a thousand
it might cost you a thousand pounds if you live in a huge detached house and in the back of building you've got lots of rooms
but the average of UNK price for a house alarm ranging from about two hundred and seventy five pounds
now if you had to have all the locks changed in your house that probably come out on an even
a true UNK is quite expensive
but the responsibility for your own house is down to you
it's something that not a lot of people take notice of as i say until they become a victim of it
or it might be your neighbours have become victims of crime and you suddenly see it could happen to you
yeah sorry i was going to ah er do you find that er the criminals are not taking notice of alarms off now because they know that people will be
house alarms or car alarms
er house alarms
a the house alarms
i mean a
i think
thought initially that maybe alarms okay you can come and go but erm
yeah
most UNK are not in that league
they would rather go and UNK a house that isn't UNK erm because they don't know what type of alarm you've got there
mm
yes they can erm distinguish between what i call a do it yourself alarms and th the recognized companies
yeah
but at the end of the day they aren't in that league cos most UNK are UNK they UNK a common opportunity that is presented to them by or it could be they've actually just watched her go out and more of a chance
but if they set it off without UNK that you've gone like
they are
that's
likely to be they're not gonna go they're gonna say the people next door they're not gonna take any notice of it
no
most
not
most of the time
that's right
most of the time actually if they do set them off they UNK
they don't want to be around
erm they don't want to draw attention to themselves
there are many different ways that they operate
i mean one of the UNK things we have in this area is with the UNK officials who pretend to be something they're not
and none of us like to thing we've been UNK
it happens so easily
you know the water board er it's all the same ones that we hear on th on the television and it still happens
they still get away with it
now the classic example is from water boards they'll have two people and they'll say can we test your water pressure please
one will stay with you all the time watching what he's doing and the other one goes upstairs while he's left alone and in that short space of time they can actually
and
they UNK easily UNK items that they can push out through boot sales that type of thing where they can really make the money
so how can you what can you do to protect your
any ideas
well i think one of the greatest UNK that one can have is the copper on the beat
you never see
yes
one
no
i think we're talking about
we never see
our own homes
well
but we
it is a deterrent really
well i know but i'm talking about with break ins i mean people are a i think are getting on with it and there's no deterrent for the
a lone beat officer as you call it i think it has erm a UNK
effect to be honest with you
oh i think it does
erm people tend to relate back er and think that in theory it's a nice welfare thing and it's nice for the community and they do sterling work don't get me wrong because i think they are a vital part of a community but how much of a deterrent they are er we are we are unable to measure
and i it's not where you've got the case where beat officers before erm used to be able to clip erm people round the ear and things like that they're not allowed to do that now those days have long gone
but i think
and erm
there's a psychological as aspect in some so much that if they think that a policeman is gonna walk round the corner er they're not so keen on doing it
yeah
well
but i mean we we've got a situation where we are i mean our UNK quiet very quiet and you know you get the impression that you know they can do it without fear or favour you know th they know that no one 's going to disturb them it's very quiet there
mm
and we we've always thought that you know to have a beat officer that was going around that could perhaps turn up at any time would at least be some deterrent in so much that
yeah
the people think that they can do it UNK
okay
they do and that's what they i mean but they could also wait until he went round that corner and then go and UNK a house
right
that's the other thing they'd quite often would work to what we call
but i mean su surely that that's better than none at all
it is
unfortunately and it perhaps
it's the wrong choice of words but beat officers are in actual fact a luxury at the moment because if you call the police
yeah
you want a police to come as soon as possible and you want to deal with it because it's a priority to you
now police forces have to grade their to things we get the immediate response the nine calls and then so on
where beat officers come into play is where you've got the non urgent what we call the traffic the non urgent jobs erm where people can afford maybe a couple of hours it might be that they have to wait until the beat officer gets on duty could be a day or so's time and they do an awful lot of work and it's an ongoing thing
erm if you just UNK it i mean i was a beat officer here for eight years and the sorts of things that you'd come on duty erm to see are you may you might get the UNK woman who er you UNK and you have to go and see her and you ge erm but all the shift members can then pass that to the beat officer
it might be the domestic disputes
i take what yo you say because i i'm in favour of beat officers but
yeah
most people want a quick response so they would want then the police officers in the cars that can get there within half an hour at the latest to deal with their UNK particular problem
and as i say it's not measurable to find out how much of a deterrent they are
i mean they don't just sort of walk there they have school visits and things like that to do as well
so they are in touch with their community and they do for the most part know what's going on their beat
but i mean we have got nine beat officers for the whole of the harlow town area and just th this area this is the start of what we call our beat eight this is the boundary along southern way and that goes down as far are familiar with the area of UNK most of you
it's quite a distance
all this side of the road is one officer's area that they have to cover on foot
see we have an awful lot of problems i mean not only the question of breaking into one's home things like car parking or things of a very high accident risk whereas if we had a beat officer at least we could set up some sort of local liaison in so much that we could tell him about our sort of problems and perhaps between us resolve them
but we haven't yet
but have you found out have you got a beat officer
no
i've never seen one
but have you found out whether you've actually got one
they reckon there's supposed to be one allocated but no one 's ever seen him
why don't you ask to speak to him
we'll have to
mm
we'll have to
see it also takes members of the public to phone in
yeah
people are quite often scared and think they don't want to bother the police we are human beings we only bite on UNK we're regularly fed and UNK
erm but at the end of the day we
but there i there is a general consensus of opinion that if a policeman a happens to venture onto our estate the instant reaction is quick
get a camera
yeah
i mean
i'd be a very rich woman
and it's a general it's a general consensus
that's right
of opinion
it is
unfortunately nearly everybody says exactly the same
and we all believe each and every one of us that if there was a much er stronger police presence i if i mean a bobby
yeah
it would help a great deal
at least it would give us some sort of contact
we have got a ludicrous situation in our estate because it is very quiet
whereabouts do you live
up at UNK
right
where unfortunately ladies er won't go out of a night time because they're frightened whereas we're looking for a little bit of a reassurance
someone we can speak to you know
true i take your point i mean i perhaps i could dig a little bit deeper and find out what the UNK is going on you know
but we never ever
se we never ever see a policeman
but that also is the case i mean er a lot of time th the actual design of our houses doesn't lend itself for us to actually look even if you're permanently looking out the window
i mean i can have to say
it's true
our living quarters are on the back
at the back
yeah
that's right so you wouldn't see anyone
our UNK are on the front
you know
so neighbourhood watch really goes out the picture
the only thing that we do and we've always done it without neighbourhood watch we always make a point of telling one another when we're gonna be away for any period of time
that's just an extension from that although it is basically neighbourhood watch
oh yes
same sort of thing really
isn't it
same sort o but it is difficult when you're allied to a neighbourhood watch when the living quarters are on the rear of the accommodation
that's right
and it is and
we can't see what's going on there
because be being separate from all of you and to make sure that your you know because your problems are gonna be your neighbours problems
yeah
let's face it we're quite selfish in the fact that we want to ensure that the area that we live in is safe for us and not too concerned that three or four estates down the road unless it starts to affect us
we don't want the problems on our own doorstep cos when the chips are down we like to go home and we like to feel safe and if somebody's entered your premises as an UNK then all of a sudden your security been taken away
it takes an awful long time for you to regain that and to feel safe in your own homes
mm
so if you do nothing else today i'd like you to go home and assess the risk areas on your own individual houses
and have you actually
if you haven't then you ought to phone your local beat officer and get him to come along and give you a survey
i have phoned the police on numerous occasions and i must say there isn't a great deal of response
will oh it's all the response i get we're far too busy we haven't got the UNK you know er
well eventually they will have
a and this happens you know
and that's the time to tackle it
i mean i could come up
i've even i've even
with the same excuse as that
i even sat on the local erm committee wi with the police authority you know and er we've got all sorts of promises but nothing that has ever UNK
when we query it lack of UNK lack of resources lack of money
well we've got more police officers now than we've ever had before we're not gonna get any more because i mean essex police force is quite a rich one but i think sort of on recruitment they've UNK probably due to get about fifty extra officers but that's
which doesn't sound a lot from er such a rural county erm but i mean you know obviously erm that is quite a lot in terms because you are the people that are having to pay for it
yeah
do you think perhaps the problem is that through no fault of their own they spend far too much time in the police station doing other work perhaps than going out on the beat
they're trying to cut that down i mean we have now what is called station officer's assistants and most police forces have them where they're
civilian employees who do certain jobs to relieve the p c so that he can go back out onto the streets
yeah
UNK reports and goodness knows what else
unfortunately every thing you do in police force has got to be
gotta have
reported
yeah
and that it hasn't changed in a very long while
well i mean i'm er that wasn't meant as a criticism
no
that was meant as a bit sympathy if you like you know th
but erm yeah
sort of the things that they have to do apart from fighting crime
yes but then
then
i mean you know there are things that we need to address in house to make sure that we give you er an efficient service
and like you say if you're not
yeah
getting the response if you're getting that type of excuse that comes out then that's when you need to go back to them and say well hang on this is not good enough
i want a response
alright i'm prepared to wait depending you won't wait on a nine call if it is
mm
an urgent call because that's got to take priority erm but for other responses then follow it up don't just
yeah
accept it
well i as i say i did follow it up and in fact i even went to a committee where i sat and spoke to the er the police face to face and they made all sorts of promises but nothing UNK
oh well you'll have to stake it out again
now i did bring a film along for you see and i'm hoping that it's going to work
but it just highlights some of the points erm it is UNK so i hope that you enjoy it
and it just shows you how easy it is to leave signs for the thief to tell him that we're out
this is where the technical bit always goes wrong even when
now is that done that's UNK it right
yeah
try channel three
going to switch it off
it's normally eight
that's right
i don't think we should put them through
course it's a talking the only thing i can say what you're saying about your erm problem in your area that do you know if there's any crime actually committed on your estate
is there a lot of crime
oh no
no
we don't get a lot
no
really
i think we've being a target we've lived in which is since nineteen seventy three i think we've had about three break ins
so no
it's quite small really
which goes to show that maybe the officer er saying maybe i'm only throwing suggestions over there cos i don't know UNK
yeah
that well maybe the officer the local beat officer has got a problem estate that he has to UNK and has to be there or an area where the crime is being committed to try and deal with
he's probably up in our estate
that or prevent that whereas he knows that little estate round the corner i know they look after themselves
well why leave it totally
well i'm probably
you know
that's only a suggestion
the only trouble is
i'm only saying that but yes i take your point er as i say i'm currently er a neighbourhood beat officer i'm gonna become the crime prevention officer very shortly but i can go on estates like and they say i haven't seen you for ages
i said but there's been nothing around here
quite honestly
i monitor it
mm
by looking what the crime ra who's
but i i'd
around
i'd love someone like you to come around so i can come up to you and say this close is er hello geoff
you know
well yeah i
if you've got a problem we we're
i'm very human i do and that's how i
and some old dear old lady fell out off the edge of the UNK
that's right
because someone's parking right up the pavement
over a cu over a cup of tea i could get a lot of information from you by saying
but there is there is there is
what's happening and various things
but there is literally no one that we can talk to like that
yeah
i mean if we've got problems with house protection you know
yeah
but there's no one we can talk to you know
yeah
cos you must have a local of crime prevention officer
there must be one somewhere
well we have got one but i don't believe i've ever seen him
all you can say is could i make could i make an appointment to see you
and he says leave that to the local station and say can you leave a message with him to phone me back please
it doesn't it doesn't happen
i don't ever you see i'm erm
it doesn't happen like that
i've phoned on numerous occasions
i er i'll give you a classic example i erm and my wife was with me
aha
for many years and i UNK her around in a in a
yeah
chair for that five years and there were constantly people parking on the pavements which UNK you
that's right yeah
once or twice she were nearly no ne or the pair of us nearly got knocked down
anyway i phoned up the station and i said you know i've never seen anybody on the station is there anybody could come and have a look at this because i'm sure we're gonna have a UNK before long because in my case it's my wife it could be children who are playing there
oh sure
and they said well i'm sorry you know er take the numbers of the cars they want me to go round and take the numbers of the cars phone them back and we will see if we've got someone that we can send down there
well that's not the sort of liaison
well yeah
that i want
yeah
that's very poor management i would say i'd be asking that bloke spoke to
yeah
but this actually happened
yeah i dare say it did
ah UNK
well yes
that's how well he's talking to
i don't think it doesn't look like we've managed to sort to that out
so i'll move on
the other way i mean we can could actually try and help is to postcode your property i don't know if any of you have done that
but by simple erm use of an UNK pen using your postcode followed by the door number or an UNK of the house name er i that makes it UNK
the postcode is broken down into obviously figures and numbers c UNK sort of the chelmsford area or for whatever it might be in yo in your area then you'll come down to either twenty eighteen whatever that is
it actually comes down to then a more local area could be eighteen to twenty into harlow and then as you break down into the other figures that then comes into a road and a postcode will actually go down to about fifteen houses in total by putting your door number at the end of it makes it UNK to your premises
that is the recognized form of marking for property nationally
all police forces will be able to check erm if they sort of find your video in the boot of somebody's car they'll be able to check if it's marked
all you do is you mark it on an item if you're gonna do the television do not do the screens because every time you turn on up will come your postcode
nor do the back because that can be removed you put it on a surface the side or underneath that cannot be removed and on a UNK that's not regularly UNK and polished because eventually it will wear off
the other thing you cannot mark is compact UNK
yeah
because they UNK on UNK light and as one our p c's found out to his cost he ruined a hundred and fifty pounds worth of compact disc cos he got rather carried away with and of course it can't be cleaned off
we know that one as well
okay
so don't mark compact UNK
but it is an easy way of making your property UNK
and as you're doing that make an UNK of sort of items that have got serial numbers erm so that if you do lose anything you've got a quick reference there for your insurance company
most insurance companies now will specify if you've had a burglary the types of locks and they are now getting quite hot on it and they want good basic security of homes
so you've gotta go away think like UNK and think how easy is it would it be for me to break into my own home
and if it takes you a matter of seconds you really need to address your security
well the er the about that when you said mark pieces of property
yeah
ya it it's probably gonna be stolen anyway
the thief doesn't know whether it's been marked cos usually they take in practise what could the police be able to do
well what we do is if we if we know you've been UNK
aha
we then we regularly UNK sort of all of the market stalls the boot
oh
sales and we go over things
if we find property that we're not happy with then all we've got to do is get it under UNK because all police forces do that and up will come the post code
now most people can struggle to know their postcode but you know might know yours
mhm
i know your but er they ought to and therefore you know that is how we trace it
th the one mark that we can trace
some property you're not gonna get back
you see on programmes like crime watch u k where erm they've got these UNK on all these stolen items that can never be returned to their owners it's very difficult to sort of mark UNK and things like that without UNK it
UNK is one of the easiest ways
if it's jewellery it's harder it will show up erm if you're marking things like UNK rings then the best thing to do is actually take photographs of them with a ruler or some sort of erm comparison of the size of the item cos if you do like a ring on a photograph it's gonna it's gonna come out like a so if you got a ruler to say you know it's only sort of one and a half inches in width or whatever then we can actually get a clear picture of that
but with that i have to stress do not snap away UNK at all your UNK and then take your film into boots or UNK or whatever with all your details on it because you don't know who works there and who's going to pick up that and
and just
you'll either have to use a UNK camera and or go to a re a UNK photographer and make sure you get the negatives back
the sort of larger items the police have property marking UNK that they're quite willing to lend out to people or alternatively you can hire them out on your library card and you can UNK stamp those or UNK them
and if you're going to do thin metal objects or a sort of aluminium frame do not use the UNK stamps on those
and all that is a hammer and stamp and er and they have a habit of UNK because we regularly erm postcode cycles erm with the introduction of the mountain bike we found that on the UNK frames we were UNK them
and a mountain bike is quite expensive to replace
erm because they range from sort of anywhere from two hundred and fifty pounds erm in excess of a thousand so we now as a matter of course always UNK them
but it's exactly the same you just use the postcode
do you do you think the n p stickers that go on the doors or windows is a deterrent to UNK
n p do you think it UNK them
at one time it did UNK crime
i still think that neighbourhood watches does what we're doing is we're pushing it out to hertfordshire and the metropolitan area and they're trying to push it elsewhere and then you know we're just
yeah
pushing it away
but it won't UNK the real erm
thief
professional thief
but those are few and far between
most of them are UNK most of them come from the local area they'll know the housing estates and whatever happens
they've already chosen their set routes
they're familiar with the ground
and there are many contributing factors as to why er somebody turns to a life of crime er which is another argument which i'm not gonna get involved with
mm
erm but we are getting more and more UNK lately
you know only as i say it's made easy for them
it's like sort of thefts of motor vehicles we can reduce the theft of the actual vehicle because there are security devices now to do that to make it harder and you cannot odds somebody coming along the street throwing a brick through a window and UNK your UNK out
it takes a matter of seconds and by the time the police have actually received the call they're on route they've gone
most people are also scared to get involved now because of the UNK if they've actually reported some to er to a crime and you can a understand that
i can understand that they don't want to get to go through the UNK of court
but the o other thing is you know do you let these people get away with it
it's a matter for you as individuals isn't it if you witness something
but we haven't got a crystal ball we don't know what's going on unless you tell us cos we are relying on members of the public telling us things saying that they've witnessed things what you saw
and that's a very difficult thing again because most people's idea of description is different
we have a di a different picture and we make up erm pictures like you see o on these crime programmes the UNK of UNK you've all seen them where th you know got the lines between the nose and the mouth they are made up of the information that we've gained from witnesses
as i say but if there's i mean how tall do you think i am sir
i dunno about five foot seven eight
five foot eight
well that's very UNK
five foot five
five foot five
yeah
five foot three to five foot four five four
right
some of you might have taken into consideration the heel on my shoe
i'm actually five foot four
i can't see that
so you're all wrong
i said five foot four
erm
it's only a foot
yeah it's only a foot
that's right
that foot
and in when we look for UNK marks on people
yeah
hair colour changes size change and you know we'll say
well what did the person look like
well he had brown hair
well there's many different shades of brown you know
what was he wearing
jeans
you know
what was he wearing on his feet
trainers
white
can you imagine we have to try and make out a picture of that
yeah
oh could you
mm
but surely coming back to the a highly say i didn't do it
i knew a chap on the police force and pretty UNK and pure walking around the like each day trying to see if there's any
well they can
yeah
but individuals have a responsibility for crime as well because the ownership of crime problems is not just the police it's down to the community in which that the people live
and this is probably the hardest
well surely we're trying to do this in the way of neighbourhood watch
that's one of the ways certainly
couldn't you have a yo say
and with
you want more
they want it both sides of the coin don't they
you see the officer walking around in pairs continually not and if you're gonna be paid extra for it do it that way
if the police can't do it then somebody else has got to
i must be
right
said
to try somebody of a trainer er
yes it's still i tell you yo
that's right
i don't want my house broken into in the first place
i don't wanna be told that somebody and some remote things like which was mine and somebody would say well he saw it and he saw the policeman ah they would come they've never catch them
no
but this is well this is
you know i don't blame you for that
this is the starting point isn't it
rather than at all where would you be
i don't know
then
i don't know this UNK well it's a UNK to the
you have a UNK
mm
of your own premises don't you
and how to secure those up
yeah
because at the end of the day you don't want somebody coming into your home
no i don't
no
well tha that's really a fro market isn't it once everybody
that's it
takes reasonable precautions
and that's all i'm asking you to do
to the best of their ability but i mean i take our UNK point of view if they're marked i mean what's the chances of someone breaking into a home what's the chance of er them ever being er captured
quite a lot in actual fact
i would i would have thought that there's
yeah
there's many more get away with it than there is actually captured ones
there are
but sooner or later they they're going to start making mistakes bad mistakes and that's when they come on
come a UNK
line to be caught
yeah
and then we then we have to trace
i mean police stations regularly become full of stolen items and we've got nowhere to put it and we have to have these displays erm where we try and trace the owners it's a very difficult job it's a very time consuming job
yes
by marking your property at least it gives us a starting point especially if it's personal to you
i mean i what you're UNK quite valid i mean i if you've got a situation where you have been successful and you've got an UNK of stuff that's been recovered from UNK at least it gives you some method of returning it to it's previous
that's right
owners
but we're relying on you to put it on there
but it's not really a deterrent that's the point we're making isn't it
it's one way because they don't want
yeah
UNK property
mm
because it makes it harder for them to sell
oh it does
mm
who's gonna sleep at night
they won't but we will
just we just put our sign across it
yeah
that's the beauty of that
you can visible marker your goods but that's even less attractive but would you want an UNK mark across one of your prize possessions
well actually i think they're more suitable like that as though the insurance companies certainly don't
they will
rather than it's the UNK value a lot of things a lot of things
you normally client cooperation
i like that
you might the money back
that's handy but
is it okay
shall i ask
quite a lot of people don't want them back
yeah
they've done well out the insurance
they they'd rather have the money yeah
told though that the film is going to actually work now so
don't be silly
they'll take it now you know what i mean
yes
can you hear that
right
okay
something else i'd just like to i was actually i was erm aware that time is passing us by
who made the comment er about people walking themselves at night
would that be safe to say that most of
it's becoming sort of fairly UNK erm where there and it is more perhaps related to the fear of crime than the actual crime itself where people are afraid to go out for fear that they're going to be personally attacked whether it be you know answering the door at night in their own homes or actually you know going to their cars
none of us like to go in poorly lit areas it automatically raises our fear level doesn't it
or we feel unsafe
and we've all been in situations where we've walked into an area whether it be sort of a car park is poorly lit or you've gone down a lane that's perhaps been UNK by UNK and things like that we generally don't feel as confident
and it doesn't just apply to woman it can apply to men as well
it's not something i particularly thought an awful lot of until i came on crime prevention because before that i was in police uniform with marked cars with the radio although half the time in harlow the UNK don't work cos we're getting
but it didn't worry me and i liked to think i can go about my daily life and not be frightened and i am not gonna be frightened to go out at night
but on crime prevention i'm for most part in plain clothes i use my own car work and i'm not in a marked car i don't have a radio because my job as i said from the beginning is very varied and therefore it's not practical for me to have a radio
so i'm out and about and quite often i go and visit people in their own homes out of the back and beyond of nowhere cos i just called out as a result of that and i suddenly thought i i'm highly vulnerable to them i could be subject to attack like anybody else how will i protect myself
that was going to be erm well i thought well i really haven't got the answer to that
so i immediately started to look into these things which are personal attack alarms and it is a very basic er deterrent value
many different types on the market but when you actually start to look into them erm they reveal a few things you can see by this one it's a fairly old one but it is for UNK purposes only this is one by UNK it's battery operated in a plastic cases and it's handy because it's got a UNK but when you actually put the alarm on it goes my UNK not working really
oh
as you can see the battery runs out
so i don't think they're very good
erm as well as that if you drop that that's going to smash as one of my colleagues discovered
i thought well i don't favour that i'll go and have a look at cylinder type
this one is called a walk easy very effective particularly good for people with UNK hands because erm it doesn't take an awful lot to actually press down the top
but how effective is it
when you start to discover this one actually does travel through walls the sound of it does actually does travel through walls but as i say it's only a temporary measure to buy yourself a little bit of time she says
that's one on it's way out really so
but that sound would be continuously repeated
it does
yes
that one actually locks on
the one that i tend to use most of the time is this one not least because it only three pounds and it's quite affordable but a again it's got a loud sound to it and i found that if you carry one of these with you and somebody does approach you you've always got this in your pocket and you can actually aim it them cos they don't know what you've got in your hand
if you actually put that up to near where he is it could even
is it
incredible isn't it
i like the UNK type
i like this because you can actually
aha
clip it onto your clothes
it's an idea innit
yeah
yeah
it's handy to keep in your pocket if you're walking the dog at night
that's a nice one
so i thought well i'll carry one of these for when i'm going out in my car to which you know and if somebody does come up to me i can use it in a positive manner while in a split second time for me hopefully UNK cos of my range of work
mm
to get out of that situation
i'm not a black belt in UNK and i'm don't suppose most of you are
okay
there's a whole group on me then i'm not gonna stand about erm but if it's a one on one i might stand a chance
so i think that is certainly worth it if not least for the ladies to consider
it's an idea
but i want to bring something
mm
out which doesn't include the men
you've probably all been in situation where you seen people UNK across the road because they think they're being followed the ladies will do it because she thinks a bloke is following her and the men are probably thinking does she think i'm following her
and carry on down the road
it's a very difficult situation because nobody knows how to react
now some men think right i'll walk across the road others will think well i'll stay behind because it might be safer cos there might be somebody UNK in the corners none of us know quite how to react to that
and you'll find that the it's normally the woman that takes the initiative and crosses the road which she's unsure of
the idea is though that you don't put yourselves in risk situations in the first place
you don't go into areas that are poorly lit if you can help it you don't take a short cut through the dark woods because it'll save you five minutes on your journey stick in well lit we well lit areas
how many of the ladies here are drivers
right
on the back er table there there's a brochure called women at the wheel it's a UNK er application please do take a good copy very good application
who knows the break down el the procedure for break downs on motorways
what you should and shouldn't do
come on gents you should know as well
whether you stay with
your car or not
that's understandable
lock yourself in
stay in the car stay with the car and put these erm UNK lights on
stay in the car
mm
any advances on that
anybody think any different
have one of those things in the car and you speak to the r a c or the a
yeah
clearly
but if it's lady cos i couldn't afford one of those
yeah
i know
they are expensive
actually i think they're well advertised for what they are
no actually no don't sit in the car
the nearest phone
if you're on a motorway it's maybe it's before you every mile on a motorway there is an s o s phone box okay
when you pick up the UNK the hands it will actually take you through to the nearest police control room area now if it's on the m eleven then most of the calls will go into chelmsford our police headquarters once you cross over the borders and go into metropolitan area then that goes up to the scotland yard in their control rooms
every telephone box has a unique telephone number once you pick that up it actually UNK a little signal we can UNK exactly where you are
now they're not the easiest things to speak into because the noise volume of the traffic is quite horrendous so you have to shout
has anybody broken down here
anybody been through this experience before
yeah
yeah
it's a horrible experience because the through traffic goes so fast erm so anybody who actually doesn't know quite what you have to do
on the marker posts that you see the next time you travel past them at ninety miles an hour if you get time to see them there is actually a picture of the telephone UNK and a number under that UNK there will be an arrow pointing you in the direction of the nearest emergency telephone
if you get a post with two arrows it means you're exactly half way and you've gotta make the decision for yourselves
if you break down and you can drive to the nearest one then do so it i if it's something like a your wheel or your UNK gone down then drive
yes you're gonna damage your wheel but you'll be safer that way
if you've got no choice but to get out and walk then you are gonna have to do that and that's all very well being a day like today where it's not pouring down with rain er you're not walking in a pitch black area but if you do suddenly change that and you put it into those sort of well that sort of scenario you'll find it's very frightening
what we have to say is straight from essex police if that happens to you get out wherever possible on the UNK side of the vehicle and then go to your nearest box and then you pick up the receiver and get through the police control room and they will ask you a series of questions have you broken down
are you a member of a national breakdown
and are you a woman on your own
cos women on their own or with young children get priority
you know
that all erm came about as a result of the marie rivers case
mm
and so we do try and give priority to ladies on their own
given obviously the fact that you've broken and if you are a member of a breakdown organization they will call them out for you
if you are not and i have to stress this very carefully then they will call the nearest available garage and the garage will come there very quickly and they will tow you off into the nearest exit and there they will leave you and that can cost you probably in excess of ninety pounds
so it does pay you to be a member of r a c national breakdown a or whatever because at least most of them provide a service where they can take you to your destination and or arrange further transport for you
so bear that in mind cos it wi even if it's just sort of fifty yards up the motorway that's where they'll drop you then you're on your own
once you've made your call they might ask you to stay by the phone erm to contact you back it might be that they ask you did you want anybody contacted to tell them that you've broken down they will do that for you
you can ask them if it's urgent then they will do that
then we ask you return to the area of your car but do not get back in because you run the risk of being injured erm through cars ploughing into the back of you far more than you as much for a personal attack
so that is why being a good boy scouts and girl guides that you are you are gonna put things in the car so that you're you are prepared for wet weather or cold weather erm such as an old blanket or something to sit on er because we like you to sit upon a bank as far away from the traffic as possible
or determining standards and then setting targets for all of your staff
can you tell me how good a job you do
no
you can't why not
because we're not set any targets and we've never given any feedback from higher
we know who bad we do
you know how badly you do
you are
you're told at annual appraisal week
well there's not set
if you get an appraisal unless you get performance review
i got quite i was given to it last year i reckon
how did they do that UNK i mean what good who gave that to you
the boss
the branch manager
yes he gave us five targets to achieve by the one that we had this year
right
i achieved all of that and more
so erm was that when you joined the branch first of all
alright so how did you do that when you were getting interviewed some place in our area
yes he was totally good he sat us down
cos everybody else got the erm forms erm the appraisal and the one they had was supposed to be target setting for each department manager
well i wasn't there long enough to us an appraisal to he give us he still give us the targets
okay
and i was in last week both UNK before i came here and we went through we'd achieved all targets
alright so that's kind of an ideal scenario an interview UNK been very clearly set
perfect what about the rest of you
UNK do you know how you do
only because i've just had my appraisal
right so
only because of that and what they said in that totally shocked me because erm i he hadn't given me any feedback about how i was doing
on an ongoing basis
yes
do you think it's right then that an appraisal should come up with those UNK for you
no
why
because you should be told constantly throughout the year and there should be some kind of re assessment
right does anybody get that
no
anybody at all
the targets i was given last year in my appraisal weren't covered at all this year in my appraisal by the manager
yes
they were only brought up by me
yes was it was it a different manager
it was but he had the sheet in front of him which had my targets set on it
possibly a lack of planning there
anybody else i mean we've had the erm the formal target setting and we've mentioned appraisals
i mean whether it's good feedback or bad feedback do you get an other feedback on a less formal basis
mm
we get bad feedback
yes what do you get
criticisms you know
criticism what form does that take
what are you going to do about it on the shop floor it's not done properly
we get both
mm
the formal and the informal
i've never in all the time that i've been with the company i've never had any positive feedback at all
although i've had form nobody's ever told me anything that i should be doing people come round and say you haven't done that
erm why's that like that they don't tell you how to correct it so often you know you don't you don't know how to avoid making the same mistake next time
right
and you know you know what's the point of coming round and giving you a UNK if nobody's going to tell you why
i haven't i haven't had any positive feedback at all in all the time that i've been there
erm i'm in no man's land at the moment because i'm like between sort of like branches appraisals are coming up how can i have an appraisal i won't have anything
ray
well i think i've been rather more fortunate the two branch managers i've had er before i'd not had long enough er both have given albeit not regular but feedback both positive and negative er when you're doing a good job and when you're doing a bad job and er in all honesty it's probably the appraisal itself that's actually been unnecessary because of their feedback they're given me during the year because the appraisal is just a formal repetition of what's already been said
yes i think that's right i think a lot of people question the validity of appraisals because you shouldn't be learning anything new you know should there be an appraisal
you shouldn't be but that's not my experience
no
ah erm but do you think that sorry do you think the appraisal itself because it's an annual event er some branch managers will get to you with what turns out to be the performance review and therefore not doing it during the year because of the appraisal
it's a possibility that some may think that but i can't believe that with the management skills training that they've received up until up to that level that they can still honestly think that's correct
but undoubtedly
no i think in other cases they just can't be bothered to give you feedback
sorry that's a very negative thing to say but
but they don't see you as much as his secretary does either do they
they don't have as much to do with you i mean my branch manager doesn't know what division he's in
but your fresh deputy should be the one who's giving you the feedback i mean all the time i was on provisions in my last department and nobody ever told me how i was doing
besides you know it's too trivial there's too many important things like why haven't you got the special offer on display to even bother to tell why you're not why you're not performing or if anything isn't going right
and it's so UNK like you know how are supposed to get the best out of your staff if nobody can be bothered to tell you how you're doing
that's right yes
that's only like by they sounds of things down this way
up our way they all give you feedback like you know several branches in like the north every branch i've been into there's always been positive feedback and negative and positive
there's only one branch that i've been and that was bury
was that all in one district UNK or was it spread across districts
erm well the north east and all i found very good the two york stores harrogate and erm that's where i've been involved really and they've all been very good for that
yes then maybe that's the influence of around the place the other names
what about
you know my other two other branches were the same i'm doing a free appointment at i'm at the moment we're supposed to get a two weekly when you do a free appointment they're supposed to sit down with every two weeks and tell you how you're doing
erm it took it took a week and a half before the fresh foods secretary even spoke to me when i went in this place to do the free appointment nobody's told me how i'm doing so then what's the point of doing these things if nobody's going give you anything it's just a waste of time
you need to push for yourself sometimes though
i think a lot of people in a free appointment situation have been stuck like that but you've just got to UNK and shout out
mm push for your training push to be spoken to
oh yes but they're going on that's to sake of free at the moment so the last thing that they're interested in doing is talking to me about if i know what i'm doing
quite honestly
does steve the district manager know about this because he's dead against all this he won't have
no he knows no sorry he knows he knows all about it
he's had me there specifically so i'm just wasting my time
i think it depends on the branch
the last branch i was in was very small and i got a lot of feedback from them
my first department and i went in and i got a lot of feedback from my deputy and the branch manager to a certain extent and i did get it from the district manager as well
they do when they came in and they want the stall made like this and they would say you know well you know i'm paying you to finish that off you know how your next your next priority to do is this and they eventually told me what they wanted and you know you get on with it
they started to especially trainee managers spending periods of time in the smaller branch and they've got to get on with that concern but i think there are benefits since they've been doing that
turning that issue on its head
we're talking about what feedback or the lack of feedback you yourself have received how do you give feedback to your staff
how do you tell them how well or how badly they're doing
just tell them
if he's got a job there and he's done it well or he's done it badly tell him he's done it badly tell them where they've gone wrong and tell them what they should do to put it right
give us give an example of that then
because
i have i have one UNK in particular erm i'm the meat manager and he puts the ham away the mess every time he does it so i tell him and i show him how to do it but still he consistently does it wrong you know
right so when you're actually telling him what do you say
i show him i show him the way i do it and go through it with him
mhm
and show him this is the way you should do it
but
it's still wrong
what about the rest of you how do you give feedback
a daily meeting really
a daily meeting
how do they work
yes
the fresh foods manager will walk us round with the store manager in the morning and we have er whatever they say we have a meeting and i have UNK to start and i say what i'm happy with and what i'm not
i'm in the bakery so if UNK rubbish i tell them if it's good i tell them and then they say well fine if they have any problems we take it right or wrong
and how does that go down
yes fine because they can raise any issues
on a regular basis
what do the rest of you think about that
that perhaps it's easier to do in a smaller department i mean i've got UNK and the majority of my staff are part time and i've only got three full UNK so it's quite often the case that at nine thirty one thirty five thirty eight thirty it's a case of coming in and then UNK somebody else straight away you don't necessarily have the time to spend with them
how do you do it how to do you cope with that
it's very difficult because you're again i mean we're saying that we don't get positive feedback how many of us UNK give positive feedback through to our staff
go on raise let's have a hands then how many give positive feedback to your staff do you think
half the time i would say
yes
you said that in our newsletter because our UNK manager said that she's found life extremely difficult with all the changes of shifts and that in her department they have lots of problems so she's got like a pro UNK news and she asks them for things that go into this that they you know that they want bringing up and specific things that they're having difficulty with
i mean she'll put it in the proper procedure and then she'll put like operator performance and things that have erm
we have erm we can't put operator performance any more on our district because we've just erm stopped that it doesn't you know they don't apply it to performance any more as far as that goes but erm i have got three representation three representatives which the UNK people nominated themselves and i have a monthly meeting with those to come up with any problems but it's still you know that's tackling one issue
you've still got the problem of addressing praise because quite often you've only if you've given somebody a specific task then it's easy to praise or not to praise in that situation but if they've just come in done their job and gone home you know just sat on a UNK for four hours right it's my time to leave then if they've done nothing out of the blue extraordinary so they don't do anything wrong or you know
they don't do anything better or worse
you know they just do their job don't they
yes it's easy to comment on their performance if you've stood by and watched their shift
what about those of you that say you don't give positive feedback alex i notice you were one
well i sometimes do when er if i have a tendency when it's when it's right to praise instantly when it's right and when it's wrong
you know when you go straight there and sometimes you get it it's not constructive you know but if i'm getting jumped on i tend to perhaps jump down on the people below me
yes
yes so sometimes it has a tendency to seem like you're blowing hot and cold
it's like a kick the cat syndrome isn't it
yes it's sort of like oh what's his facial expression oh right everybody's head down here he comes
yes
oh he's got a smile on his face oh we're alright
sometimes it's difficult
it all depends on the reaction that you get from your boss
your UNK particularly yes
they very erm can for volunteers please
it's very straightforward
and rachel you can say what you want you like hold that
ian okay could you all please just draw a house
rachel ian gary pete just those four of you if you just draw a house please
just a quick house it doesn't have to be a UNK
right all finished
yes there we go
yes very nice
all finished
finished right
that is the UNK house that i've ever seen
it's just a waste of time
now that that's brilliant
i just think that's brilliant
that's great thank you very much
let's have a look at this one
i think that's very good i particularly like the way you've got the path coming down from it
i think maybe you could do with a little more UNK particularly on the roof area but generally i think that's very good
thank you
right what happened there the four of you
how did you feel
how did you feel gary
well i'm quite honestly
that's all there is i can't quite work it out
no seriously you get so much shit at work if you took it all to heart you know you'd just crack up and the way i deal with stress like you know someone's made my day
water off a UNK back
do you think that's the case for all your staff
erm not really well so
sometimes i'd say
sometimes yes they'd say
it's water off th their back as well
sometimes yes and especially when they're UNK
yes UNK the accounts manager i think if everybody wants to get that reaction if that's the regular reaction that they get you know people dumping on them all the time it is water off a UNK back you take it more you take it more on board if it is an occasional thing
yes so they start to become immune to it
yes and this is the problem yes it's inconsistent things it's like regular it's just expected
it's like beating a dog isn't it
you do it all the time they're UNK to it in the end
do you think it's good that people can get to that stage
no because there's er it's only one step away from not carrying out the job at all when
no because you expect somebody to take pride in what they do means the job doesn't get as well then
i just think that even with what you're saying because with his with what with UNK own because they say especially with the students it's water off a UNK back but i don't think
i think the students take a real pride in what they're doing in our place
certain ones do
and they're not just doing it for the money because you know if you just sort of give them a UNK task like UNK for example they're UNK on the door you know when can i get off this when am i going to get some responsibility
i don't want it i'm not here just to go and collect UNK for four hours and the get really UNK off with it
so i'm UNK with what you're saying because you you're UNK them all with the same brush
i'd like to i know that's what i'm saying you can't UNK like that
what was saying completely
yes i agree
well maybe there's a difference between i mean are you all in like london then
no
ours don't seem to care about what they do
UNK do
yes but that's probably i mean i'm trying to UNK that it's got to be done right into them
i've had two students and the rest of the stores have had two alright that's why i'm desperate for somebody and i'll take them
i'll tell you what they're the best damn students i've ever had
you can't UNK students because some of our students are excellent
i'm quite happy with mine they do the business
there's one student in our branch and she runs the provisions department in bolton yes
who said anything management wise that had to be done and she's just a student
yes
and you do get them but i understand a lot of them a majority of them now er the university students or what have you they don't want to do the overtime because they've got to study right they come in they do the job and they just don't want any stress
but it's the working with them you know you've got to try and work with them he's got to go round may be every five minutes and make sure they've put it out otherwise he's going to stand there doing his university work
you know it's
i think in different areas it's true it's
i think it's completely over the top i did other work at least
we've got a lot of different opinions there i mean from my personal experience when i was a customer sales manager my students or particularly some of them well i would say the UNK kind of people in the branch and they had the most attention and it's very easy i think to write them off
yes they have er a temporary student and they asked him to leave us he's there's no work for him like
but i've got this other kid he's twenty eight and he's absolutely a waste of time he doesn't know anything about it
i can't do anything with him yet this other UNK absolutely brilliant and i think it's a shame that i've had to leave like let the temps
go so these UNK can stop here
there is a lot there is a lot of tension there isn't there
it'll have to be sorted out
yes there is a lot of tension somewhere
i think that's what it's like on customer services when i was a trainee
i think it's like that with other students as well
say that again
they're always be other students that will always go along you know be on the clock
mm how many of you have been students then
a lot of them have got have got some chance it's obvious you know you've got to tackle it right
i was
no i wasn't
i was working at UNK
how many have you been students
not for UNK
not for UNK but
well were you a UNK when you started
no it's just a but he was you know i was fairly slow and then i went on i followed erm i ended up slightly as well erm then i went to college up to the age of eighteen erm and as soon as i finished college he made me a department manager
you know i'd done the section manager part time i've done the UNK and UNK i've done the share the fair share of UNK the shit when i had to erm but i think you can get a lot of average UNK there is a lot of potential there for one to become a very valued member of staff
erm
the question is are you UNK that potential
yes if you can if you can recognise it or if you've got or if several members of erm several students we had when i was on grocery at UNK we had to i think it was twenty eight on saturday afternoon they might have been on UNK well i mean they're still scheduled to my i'm saying out of that about four of them er are still working at UNK full time
they were taken on full time they left college and they want to do whatever they want to do
erm one's er controller another one's er a senior UNK another one works out the back door er the other one's like gary he does bread all the time
he's solely responsible for the bread
yes
and it's the section manager like he does more than the section manager does because the section manager's a waste of space
i'll admit he does erm you do get exceptions but i think it can come down to your er the culture the student culture
i mean if you live in a posh area er the UNK going to take a pride in what he's done because you know you can give him it every day of his life and he wants to do something but he wants to do it himself
or you get
i don't agree
i don't agree with that it's a load of UNK
i think the UNK yours it's your you know you take somebody on as well
you know you can take it so many different ways
i mean i've worked with and i am familiar with them there is very little it's a real run down area isn't it in some respects and you get twenty UNK a day but my students are brilliant they take a lot of pride in what they do
i mean it doesn't affect the area i mean ours did do at branch our students were erm i mean they started work in the UNK and they all had you know big UNK it came from handling
and because they had the money they weren't interested a lot of them weren't interested yes
so that erm it does you good to have a job it looks good on a c v and they would do as little as possible and if you if you UNK them then one of them says oh well i'll leave me dad will give me the money anyway
the dad will just give them the cheque you know they've got thirty five pounds pocket money just for you know his dad's going to give him the other
yes just listen i can't imagine why you misunderstood what i was trying to say
what i'm trying to say is everyone joins for their own different reasons you can't UNK that
that was just one example like one scenario that might happen
you know i'm not saying that's the be all and end all but it's just one different scenario that may happen like that
i think students are
yes go on
it depends some students are good and some students aren't
what happens with a student is they're more likely to take the UNK
they're always the ones that are a bit more UNK whereas the older ones you have to physically carry on in the shop floor the students don't and that's what gives them a bad name
it's to do with their age as well you know what i mean
they're just growing up you know
people forget that they're still young people you know
we were there once
they're young and so they've got lots of energy
all the more reason to try and catch them i think
you can't put an old head on young shoulders yes
that's right
what about the other through the hat ian
how did you feel
well it was erm making me go back to something that goes on in branch all the time
to what i suppose would happen possibly about eighty percent of the time where you're working you've worked yourself off to do a superb drawing of a house all day and er the branch manager or whoever it may be is walking round passing quotes and walks off not really showing any general interest in this superb picture i've just spent all my time doing
but it's erm i mean that is something that happens a lot erm it just doesn't give you any motivation it's sort of you put your pen down you think well why the hell do i bother and you go off home thinking oh well the end of the day
that reminds me of the time at our branch they're doing a visit and they didn't come down my isle and they started to walk out so i said excuse me have you come to look at my department or not
he comes out and he went down there and looked out because we'd spent a lot of time on it getting it right and we were well UNK about it
erm and i asked him to stop and come down the isle
he said very nice as he walked down
but i think he just walked straight down and walked out like but it was just an accident
at least you made your point
yes we made a point that everybody should be seen
yes and then he'll probably remember you for that
he has a laugh when he comes in now
what about the others
rachel how did you feel
well it was good feedback i mean you told me what was good about it what was bad about it and you gave me constructive criticism as to how it could be better as well
mhm
you know perhaps if you UNK up on the side or made it a bit more symmetrical so that i know how to improve it next time
so there's something given that UNK feedback i was giving you then some people referred to it as this
the praise sandwich it's something to try and remember
when you're giving feedback to people yes there were going to bad things about what they've done yes there's going to be good things but if you can catch the bad things between two good things even if the good things are just saying thank you they're going to go away with a bigger smile on their face and probably feel more motivated for the next time they do that task
that's one skill thought about it isn't there there's another idea that doing that is actually has the opposite effect but the only you praise somebody when you're UNK you say well look you've well anyway
you're in danger of every time you're UNK that person they're going to be sitting back waiting for the straight away so you couldn't if you go up to somebody and they've generally done a superb job and you can't fault him and he knows he's done a really good job but he's just sitting back waiting for you to way what you've done wrong
whereas i mean if you sort of give the criticism first and say the wrong area is that and then finish it off with the praise they know where they stand and when you come up to them and say you've done a superb job they're not just sitting back thinking oh yes what's coming next
yes i mean you can alter it around
you could say well thank you for doing that erm there are a couple of things that i'm not happy with and then put the praise on the end
i think the important thing is not to let them go away thinking you know oh why did i bother there's obviously no point in carrying on with it
what about who's the other person
are you talking about me
UNK
UNK how did you how did that feel the feedback
it was alright but i didn't know why it was good or whether there was anything i should do better it was just alright then that's it i've done it
i think there's a danger that you can go over the top with praise in that you're anxious to give quality feedback the thing that you have to be careful with is that it's not just meaningless like that because that can be just as bad as giving negative feedback
you know they don't come with any idea of how they've done really
okay what i'm going to do now is i'm going to split you in into groups i want to split you into two groups we could have up to you and the dividing line will be you and then at the back there
this group i want you to think about a member of staff that you have who is an asset okay a good member of staff
this group the opposite somebody who's a liability you may have personal experience of this
erm what i'd like both groups to do is first of all think of words and phrases you'd use to describe that person's performance in a formal scenario i e in the appraisal in an interview situation
secondly what i'd like want both groups to do is to think how you would describe that person's performance in an informal situation when you're down the met down the pub with your mates or you're in the room speaking to that person
okay is everybody clear on that
right if this group would like to go UNK one and this group to UNK two and if you can be back by five to ten minutes
straight after
yes if you don't have do you want to chart it up or do you want to just feedback to the group
feedback
one of you put it down there no get him to write it up sorry
you obviously might just concur with doing some work or something
no
with wallpaper
it's my wallpaper
have you got a spare pen please
my pen doesn't work
have you got a bit more paper
yes
thank you very much
hi
hi
these are the sort of things we'd say to a good person in a formal situation erm you're reliable UNK you know we can rely on you to do a good job for us doing your job well and with enthusiasm when left in charge there's been no problems you're responsible and flexible you're UNK i can trust you for to do a good job and thank you for your contribution to the team
yes
and we also talked about maybe you could say erm you know if you continue to do a job maybe we'll look you know at developing you further but it's all sort of pretty similar sort of things you're going to say to him in that situation
and informal we came up with a great variety of things
erm great job thanks a lot UNK nice one topper you're a star champion thanks for doing that for me and this one was a bit UNK but we had top UNK at the end
alright thanks very much
i'm pleased
right what about the liability the liability
is this it
doesn't anyone else want to do this
no we'll leave to you
you go for that person
alright
erm hold on i'll give you some tape
this'll do darling
thank you it's little things that
sorry it's my problem
right that's the other one
right yes i'll just move this one out of the way a bit
one or two things up
right this is the liability
er words and phrases erm not an asset i'm just wondering what the title below that one er UNK flexible
i think it says UNK
oh right i that said i thought that was another d it couldn't be UNK erm you're too set in your ways lack of detail lack of commitment irresponsible is that yes lack of respect for your UNK erm UNK you know we er we were going to put down things like er mentally challenged and things like that but it didn't go down too well
right this is the easy one
i mean it's a lot easier to think of these things than it is for the other one er you would say that was actually lazy UNK but we didn't want to UNK anybody er useless UNK
er there was a great dispute about what this one could have been i mean this what the UNK wide but i think we'll settle for waste of space
erm taking the mick she's winding me up thick as shit UNK
i wished they'd er UNK off
leave the company
yes so erm if only they would resign er need a kick up the UNK
you're a pain in the UNK
yes but that's the year before okay
thank you very much thank you
okay let's have a closer look at these right just read a few of those words there why do you think have a ring around some of those words
what is it about them
specifically
are they in areas
they're key words in anyone's er response
right
they're descriptive of their erm
they're descriptive any other ideas why i might have rung them erm UNK them
you should set standards by them as well
okay yes
you can tell them in person what they are
right
it's what you judge them by if you set performance
okay any other ideas
okay if i say to somebody erm alex you're very responsible okay karen i think you're very flexible erm tony you're very erm very reliable i mean in is in isolation what do they do they mean anything
no
not really
no
so we think of them as being descriptive but in reality if you're going to say to somebody you're very responsible they're probably not going to know what you mean unless you come up with a few examples of what you're talking about of how they've demonstrated that type of behaviour
similar things like UNK okay let's take another look at some of these words it's not so much of this where they're an asset now i would imagine that some of these as well as being things possibly you'd say to your colleagues when you're down the pub talking about your staff
occasionally is anyone going to own up to ever having said that to somebody
yes
yes we've all actually said this to their face
and all the rest
and all the rest okay
now bearing in mind what we talked about yesterday why did those comments be potentially damaging apart from the fact that they're extremely UNK
because they're not UNK them are they
they're just UNK them
yes they're UNK
the they're resulting in a negative action reaction from the person that they are addressing
that's right
and yet when you've tried all the rest it comes down to this and it makes you feel better anyway but it's the last resort
it's a last resort
one thing yesterday we were talking about my wonderful stick man here he is basically made up of his personality a number of attitudes and outward behaviour
what did those comments get at
what did they refer to
the person his personality
yes they they're talking about that person's personality and their personality is not something they can change
no
so basically if you're going to se tell somebody they're a waste of space it's not very constructive it's personal and i wouldn't say it unless you can tell them why you think they're a waste of space at least
i can
this is er this is the same face as you yesterday i was on about we've tried everything it's getting down to that now
yes but it's not working either
it's just a shame that you've got to
yes
for the time being
you should only criticise when you're
well he turns round when he wants to be UNK at he's asked us to hit him
but you've decided why you you're just rising to the UNK then aren't you if these arguments are between you and you're coming out with all this it just makes you look stupid because you're into aren't you
i say carl i think he needs to see
so he was really good and now he's gone bad now and you're using things like this to say to him
he he's trying to make he he's making him you aggressive isn't he and i would say that he's just thinking it's low if i'm going and this guy because you know
yes i've said i've said this yes why
things like that are not constructive at all i mean i know you must get to the stage with some members of staff where you think oh what else can i do but
yes but there's no point you doing it that because it's like if they are a waste of space you're not going to be able to get rid of them because you've told them that they're a waste of space it needs to be something that's much more positive than just going round saying that
this is it i've tried this is why i've not talked to somebody else about it because nobody else is listening
and it explains to them why has come out screaming at them and screaming abuse at them
i think that there's something that needs to be addressed there
it does doesn't it
i think it needs more time round here that's
yes
sorry again
if you had more time round you'd use that sort of language with themselves
you know
yes i think that particularly that sounds particularly what you want then
that is those types of things are getting at somebody's personality and they're not constructive
if you're going to criticise somebody what i would say is talk about their behaviour because that's something that they can change talk about it in those terms
right
i'm going to show you a video now
erm how many of you went on the basic management skills course
yes most of you
do you remember the videos the UNK manager
the ones with the job
right well this is part three in that series and i would like you to do one of i'd like you two things while you're watching it
firstly make a note of all of the bully words and phrases that james UNK uses when he's talking about or talking to or talking about this man's management
okay bully things possibly in isolation don't mean very much put them over there
secondly i'd like you to identify the three members of management that he's dealing with are called barbara oh god what are they called barbara ted and UNK
that's to see if you can identify what the problems are with each of those three and why they're experiencing difficulties in their job
okay
i don't think i've ever the furniture
i think we might need the blinds down for this otherwise it's going to UNK on the screen
so
a problem
thank you for all the effort to put the blinds down very much
only trouble on it when it
yes the erm the UNK times colour supplement
yes
i don't talk to the press much i'm afraid
well if you could spare us a few moments we'd be most grateful your it's for a new series we're UNK a day in the UNK
i see
i tell you what i'll do sit down so erm you want to give people some idea of my UNK as gate keeper
exactly
yes well i'm a kind of UNK immigration officer really
you mean keeping all the UNK out
the UNK the UNK the UNK the bad hats exactly yes
it's my job to UNK out the black sheep really it's pretty straight forward
but you must get UNK cases from time to time
grey sheep as it were where you have to exercise your powers of discretion
very occasionally yes
we get the odd mis UNK there was a chap recently er should you know where the truth is he was a technical sinner not a real UNK so i decided to stretch a point and send him back down again to try and teach him where he went wrong
what was his name
UNK
really
no UNK no not UNK but like that
UNK
lewis richard lewis
god if ever there was an UNK manager there he is never sorted out his priorities couldn't delegate to save his life never had time for anything
tomorrow jimmy i can't do everything
in the end of course he UNK gave himself an early UNK
mr taylor erm mr taylor
so anyway i er i decided to give him a second chance so i explained UNK and with UNK patience
of course it is but we've got to plan it and take it to i mean
but what he'd got to do was to plan his time and work out his priorities by UNK between those tasks that are urgent and those tasks that are important
and then to organise his schedule accordingly by allowing time for both active and reactive tasks
you will get that won't you
urgent and important active and reactive
it took a little time but er eventually he got it and now i'm delighted to say he's one of the most organised managers on earth
see that a model manager
these pictures are live by satellite incidentally
there we are maggie the morning's correspondence
nine twenty five
ring philip and b t not that there's been any problems
ah mr richard lewis here UNK and UNK catering we spoke yesterday
it's amazing he's a different man
i'm rather proud of it yes i think you can take it from me richard lewis is one UNK executive we will be seeing up here
now er tea
coffee
UNK
UNK please very dry
that's fine then mr many thanks indeed bye
oh that all seems to be going UNK
now in a couple of minutes it'll be time for the district managers
martin bernard here
well how much are they asking
for an extra two UNK shift well i suppose we can just afford it can we
er okay then martin i imagine as long as we keep our heads above water then that'll be okay
a couple of
i don't think so barbara it's a bit difficult to tell isn't it
it's unfair bernard you've been in this job much longer than me what do you think about this new menu for the canteen at UNK
UNK t what's UNK
UNK with UNK and cheese UNK is full of iron you know
yes wouldn't UNK and UNK be a bit more
but bernard sausages are full of UNK pork takes longer to digest than any other meat and potatoes are ninety percent water
morning all
morning maggie
nice to see you you're working today are you
it's tuesday i thought tuesday was golf or is that just monday wednesday thursday and friday
no UNK is UNK about my profits
how are yours by the way
mm
erm i'm tired tony sorry
erm i was up half the night typing this stupid report
half the night
report what report
i did mine when i came in this morning
is that all
what are you talking about
the report on the projected sales for the next quarter he asked for it at the last meeting it's okay
but he didn't want that today surely
it's nine thirty mr lewis will see you now
right that's the end of that then so let's move on to the projected sales reports i asked for last time
there we are
there we are mr lewis
what the UNK this
my report
i meant a summary not war and peace
well you never said how long you
barbara really
i was up till one putting that together
i can well believe it it's a wonder your typewriter didn't get a hernia
i'm sorry barbara but time's a budget item with me these days i can't UNK through all this
just summarise it two pages is enough here look like UNK he knew what i wanted
lucky guess really
bernard i don't seem to have yours here
yes i'm afraid i haven't done it yet mr lewis
haven't done it but i told you i wanted it today
no you didn't you said you wanted it as soon as possible and so far i'm afraid it just hasn't been possible
oh dear oh dear oh dear
i'll try and get round to it first thing in the morning
well do will you this is putting my system right out of gear
now look everyone i'll come straight to the point a lot of things simply aren't good enough
i couldn't believe last month's figures when they came in
well look at them just look at them i think they speak for themselves don't they
and one of you i'm particularly disappointed in at the moment i don't want to name any names because i don't think it's right to UNK her in front of the others
but in general there's a lot of room for improvement all round all except tony it's good work
but for god's sake UNK your ideas up
now then that new UNK machine i told you about last time
here's the literature on it and i want a big autumn push on this one it's a high profit item for us
how many orders are you hoping for ideally
as many as you can get
ah i've got you when do you expect them in by
as soon as possible
b yes but
oh for goodness sake just use your common sense will you all of you
i think you expect me to spell everything out oh just hang on for a moment will you barbara fine
thank you tony
er now look barbara i know you haven't been in the job as long as the other two but er really you're going to have to do better than this i'm afraid
i think you know what i'm talking about don't you
er yes of course mr lewis
people just aren't very happy with the type of food you're serving barbara
oh i see oh right mr lewis
these people want something satisfying so you will try and do something about it won't you
yes of course i understand mr lewis
right then off you go then it's my head that's on the UNK block so you pull your socks up eh
have you time to
UNK
richard lewis oh yes sir er yes sir i've just seen the figures i've been talking to them about it oh yes i've told them exactly what's wrong but they don't seem able to well yes sir i know it's not good enough but what can you do if you've got UNK working for yo what's that oh no sir i'm not asking you what hello
oh damn oh that's really great i get the blame for these UNK fat headed UNK well i'll tell them the next time i'll really tell them

urgent or important
what
oh but
well you'd better get in you can tell me on the way up
mm
well
i always get the blame i'll be back in intensive care again at this rate you mark my words you should see the UNK they make of everything i ask them to do
miss angel of here's mr richard lewis

thank you
and then come round and stand in the middle please
if you'd all like to come and stand in the middle yes
after all these erm can i come round there
right we're going to have an exercise in giving each other positive feedback
the way we're going to do this i'll kick it off i'll be standing in here and i'll do a little act okay
now this act can take any form you like i could go or i can go right then i'll go like this and i want you all give me a great big round of applause
okay
as enthusiastic as possible
then i will say ladies and gentlemen i would like to present to you and i'll choose somebody else and the next person comes out and does an act and then introduces the next person okay
and i want a lot of applause
i want really loud applause okay
right okay
yes alright don't get too carried away
ladies and gentlemen i would like to present to you the one the only anthony
tony
UNK
thank you
i'd like to present to you alex
claire
stephen
i didn't hear my name sorry
introducing the one the only UNK
what are we supposed to do
i mean there's lots of sets of playing cards alright you've just got to do an action
a little action yes
a UNK
and we'll give you a round of applause
oh you've got to complete it
anything
er
introducing the one and only michael
i give to you helen
john
i introduce to you
that's it
UNK
i feel UNK this is actually great
right so if you'd like to pull your tables back in and sit resume your seats please
okay then back to the video we were looking at before break
you erm very accurately UNK what the problems where with barbara who didn't know her job didn't know who her customers were etcetera bernard and tony
now i'm sure you can relate this to people that work with you or the situation that you yourself have come across how would you go about first of all with barbara how you can improve the situation
i thought that's all been you know
why
why not
why not say barbara what would you do with barbara
sit her down and tell her exactly what her job is set the targets and what you expect her to achieve
right
and explain to her that although she did a good job with the board of directors but erm the UNK people wanted something different
okay so it's the idea barbara sit her down and explain what the job is
how does UNK i mean what do we have that covers that action
the job description
the job description do you think that's a valid way of doing it
no
it's a bit formal isn't it
it's a bit formal right so let me see
no but possibly you could sit down together and go through it
your job description covers a multitude and the fact that it frames the needs of the business doesn't it
yes that's it
that's the UNK isn't it
so possibly go through the job description together
for the staff we've got those UNK haven't we
right how do they work
well it's like erm the store UNK are supposed have trained them on those specific things
yes
and they it basically says there's erm UNK or rotate stock and they sort of tick or sign to say that they've done it
right
but erm sometimes they haven't covered it completely or don't understand it they've just ticked it and signed it to say that they know what they're doing
okay so you go into that in a lot more in a lot more detail
right so first you'd sit her down and you go through the job description perhaps what about an on going basis
i think maybe at first she should have a morning meeting or a weekly meeting to discuss the menus for the following week
okay
and perhaps
meetings on a regular basis
try and encourage her excuse me try and encourage her to come and see you whenever she's got a problem
over a period of time it's the meetings to begin with but if you could then reach a stage where she could sort most problems out herself and only came to you when necessary
okay so that's offering support if you need a hand at the moment
alright then what about bernard
what would you do with him
he already knows his job to an extent
you've got to set him targets you know specific targets and UNK and things
right now do you mean targets or do you mean standards when you say targets
well i suppose it's standards
he's got to know the company targets
right
in order to do his job
okay so you would make sure he knew that
i mean i think there's basically a difference between standards and targets can anybody explain what that is
standards are the minimum acceptable and the UNK what you want to achieve
right so when you set a standard is that to one person or for everybody
everybody
okay does everybody agree with that or not
yes
yes and a target where does that come
if the UNK there where does the target come
above it
above it yes okay
so bernard really needs to be what the company has in mind
i mean they were talking on the video about profit margins but he didn't company he was supposed to achieve presumably there was a minimum for all three of them so what else would you do with bernard
i mean he's fairly lacking in confidence and whatever
tell him the bits that he does do right
right
there must be something
pardon
there must be something
so it's praise they're due
was that it for bernard or is there anything else
he needs time skills as well instead of just doing things as soon as possible because you get to the things that become more pressing take over
yes
and you're just fighting but he needs time skills in which to do things
mm okay what about tony then
has anybody got a tony
i did have
you did have what happened to him
or what was what was the scenario
it's er section manager at erm a couple of years but erm well for the job very well educated
erm all i can say from his view point erm totally bored nothing to educated
erm all he needs time skills UNK
mm
he was practically running the department while i was working on the store for him and he's ready for further things than that
i see
before he was very bored no challenges for him nothing to do erm this guy's been at director level er trouble shooting for large UNK going in and sorting problems out and picking them off the ground so he's had loads of challenges erm the company's just so slow for him
erm and now we're trying to side track into just pile everything on to him he loves it he thinks it's wonderful
yes anybody
and he's sort of picked himself up now and he's more where i'm getting involved
you've got your job
anybody else
yes i've got a price controller that she erm can do her job in eight nine hours and it's all she wants to do
if you give her anything else she can do that as well she tries not to get involved but i try to keep giving her more so she's not getting bored with the job
how's that working out
fine she always manages to do it she UNK at first that she's got too much to do but she always gets in done in time as well as her own work
which works out for both of you
what about any anybody else had anything like that
yes i've got a guy in well i've got a couple of people on the shift and er the more you give them to do they just love it but the thing about it is i think the mistake that i certainly make from time to time is the more you give them to do you've sort of erm taken something from somebody else and then it it's trying to keep that erm trying to keep that more level and fairness to everybody
oh yes i've got a supervisor at who talks she used to forty cases and now she does sixty seventy cases excellent
but UNK was just getting to the stage where she was just to same on the shift erm but yes you need like th the you get certain people that they just need the challenge but then you can find yourself erm getting into a situation where you're giving them those extra things to do but you're taking them away from somebody else so they're like just going into the background you know
how does it i mean has that have any of the other people on your shift had a bad reaction to that
no
they haven't
no they're not complaining because they're getting an easy time er i mean i've got a couple like that as well
and if er i mean one of these girls is worth maybe three others you know they're all erm they'll and still clear the UNK get them downstairs and sweep up for you in say four hours and one person does that while the rest
you know and he's just the you know you can you can really turn it around
but er the job's just what he sees they're just not bothered
they they'll do their part they see that part as their responsibility as er the rule UNK the UNK when i first went there now they'll do like more than one isle per night each and get away with when i first went there we used ten people a night
and now we get away with five or six
mm gosh
you know er and we're still achieving the same job at a lot higher standard
which is great
yes because you know erm we still save money on labour costs erm but there again when you get when people do go sick it's er it's quite detrimental so everyone's having to work even harder
you go on a management scheme it UNK back your UNK even more you know
if you show what you can do with less you er
yes you know y you get UNK for it
yes nasty
anybody else
have an experience with a high UNK
anybody been in our situation themselves
i once worked in the UNK in a factory putting cream on to cream cakes when i finished college and they took me out and put me in the lab even though i didn't have any science degree and i was in the UNK for three months
how did they how did they identify that then
well they knew that i was a graduate in erm they had two they had a lab manager and an assistant and they both went sick at the same time and er they asked me if i'd do it
they told me it was just like following UNK and it was so i did
it was more interesting that doing this stuff to all the cream cakes
it's probably a similar situation at er the last company i worked for used to have me lunch hour i used to go down the swimming baths and do two and half hours there
the job was still done in daylight hours but you took an hour and half out every day like but that's
but that was you weren't really being challenged there were you
no
no okay well i'll put on erm part four of the video now of this same UNK manager and you can see how richard lewis went about trying to solve the problems of his managers and see if you agree with them or not as the case may be
i'm afraid i'm going to put the blinds down again or do you think
i do apologise for this noise
start at the end
no it's too late for that now we'll have to start at the beginning
so er you can organise yourself but you can't organise other people right
yes but why can't they organise themselves
because it's your responsibility
i mean they're so useless why don't you bring them up here and UNK them too
we don't UNK up here they look after that in the basement as you'll probably soon discover unless of course you go to the lower basement
lower basement
yes the basement is for those who fail the lower basement is for those failures who blame their failure on their supporters
so let's take a look at your three district managers
three people each representing a particular failure of yours
first of all let's look at barbara who doesn't understand what she's supposed to be doing because you've failed to tell her clearly what her responsibilities are
then there's bernard who doesn't know how well he's supposed to be doing because you failed to give him standards of performance that he could measure his efforts by
and finally there's tony who's wasting a lot of his time because you haven't giving him enough targets to keep him interested and to develop his potential and to get the best out of him
three failures therefore right to clarify responsibilities to set standards and to agree targets
but it's not all my fault
yes could you say that just a little louder i'm not sure that they caught it down in the lower basement
now let's start with your first problem
well done he's right no you weren't i was just calling an order down to the lower basement
er no not barbara
erm failure to clarify UNK
the first thing you've got to do with your UNK is to tell them what their job is
they know that
oh really
well they're not UNK are they or tail UNK they're district managers in a catering company
look tony and bernard may have found out what their job is the hard way but barbara certainly know
but what does she think it is then
why don't we find out
you see i'm what's called a district manager
what's that involve
well i'm a sort of ideas woman and er advisor primarily to a series of UNK
my job is to use my knowledge and experience of catering to make sure that the meals are exciting varied enough and above all they're UNK balanced high protein low UNK plenty of UNK and the key UNK and minerals
it's quite a challenge really
well do you agree with her description of the job
i
well how is she supposed to find out from you what her job is UNK cards reading the leaves in your empty tea cups extra UNK perception
UNK take her away
how about telling her and when you do tell her start at the very beginning
remember this your purpose you UNK executive is to provide quality food at prices your clients can afford while UNK your profit margin am i correct
well if you put it like that yes that is the company's purpose
therefore it's yours
there that's always with you
simple isn't it
so what is barbara there for
about another twenty four hours if she doesn't UNK her ideas up
over done with tea UNK now have ever actually told her what her job is
a thousand times i told her half an hour ago
did you
well i think we should take another look at what you actually said this time with UNK for those poor people who aren't UNK
erm now barbara i know you haven't been in the job as long as the other two but er really you've got to do better than this i'm afraid
i think you know what i'm talking about don't you i mean it's not as if you're totally new to the business
no er ye yes of course
people just aren't happy with the type of food you're serving barbara
but oh i see oh right mr lewis
these people want something satisfying so you will try and do something about it won't you
yes of course i understand mr lewis
she didn't quite get my drift did she
not terribly no so you must define for her clearly what her responsibilities are
what are they
to see that each of her catering units operates to the highest standard possible while balancing our UNK requirements against profitability with due regard to company policy
good then you must make her responsibilities even clearer by defining key areas where she is to get a result
well that's not so easy
no i thought it might not be let's put it another way
what are the principle areas in which your district managers can cock things up
oh don't get me on to that one
UNK complaints from customers failure of public health inspection
alright that's three for a start
three what
three key areas where you can establish if you need decent results
budget control customer satisfaction and hygiene
now do those define the job fully
no
go on then
well there's profitability new business
two more to use on areas now would you like to tell some of this to barbara
yes
tomorrow morning nine thirty
okay
but i thought i was promoted because everyone was going on about my UNK
i thought you wanted the same approach
well that's my fault for not making your new job clearer
that was great when you were a unit manager for a directors' UNK but it's not right now for a work's canteen
oh
you see your canteen UNK have dropped by nearly twenty percent over the last two months
have they
well you should know that
should i
i thought that if people were unhappy
it's one of your principle responsibilities how many times have i told you
i er look erm what i should have done is clarify what you're doing here
now i wrote this out
oh
yes and i've broken it up into parts i'll be doing the same with bernard and tony incidentally
key areas
right they're the make or break areas which UNK your job
