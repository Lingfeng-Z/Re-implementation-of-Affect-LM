now i'd like to go through each of them with you now and then again in two weeks' time and hear any suggestions you may have
oh right
so the first lesson in organising your staff successfully is to define their responsibilities tell them what they're there for
then establish the key area in which the person doing that job must achieve results and review them regularly to make sure your employee always has the same view of the job as you do
well that'll help me with barbara but it doesn't solve UNK problem
he knows what his responsibilities are but he doesn't get decent results
well how do you expect bernard results if you don't tell him which results are decent
come again
alright we've dealt with responsibilities lesson two standards
ah ha i'm a UNK for standards
are you
oh yes every month i call him into the office and i say it still isn't good enough pull your socks up
how far
i'm sorry
how far do you tell bernard to pull his socks up an inch three inches a foot
i don't understand
well it's not good enough you're not doing your job properly
i know well
you've got to do better
but how
by UNK your ideas up by getting a grip on yourself above all by pulling your socks up
but how
exactly
all those phrases useless
UNK management of the worst kind
er a substitute for thought and no help to anyone
no look every employee needs to be set standards of achievement below which he must not fall
now these standards need to be visible common to everyone in the same job and fixed er like a UNK by which the employee can measure his activities for himself
if you don't give him a UNK you get this
we're talking about a complete UNK really
replace UNK new deep freeze units UNK all the UNK here you are you won't get it done any cheaper than that i can promise you
my god will it really cost this much
listen i'm doing you a favour
i've got to be so careful that's the trouble i never know when my boss is suddenly going to bite my head off
still i think we're making enough to cover it
you see the poor didn't know whether he could afford the contract or not
he's having to operate on UNK
UNK
yes erm do you remember that report your staff handed in this morning
there you are mr lewis
thanks what the UNK this
it's my report
i meant a summary not war and peace just two pages
here look like UNK he knew what i wanted
if you only wanted two pages you should have said so you could have said something like i only want two pages
it's not difficult
oh erm bernard i don't seem to have yours here
i'm afraid i haven't done it yet mr lewis
haven't done it but i told you i wanted it in today
no you didn't you just said you wanted it as soon as possible and so far i'm afraid it just hasn't been possible
if you wanted the report handed in by a certain day why didn't you say so
i mean if you'd set precise standards in the first place you wouldn't have caused all that confusion
so what is a standard then
a standard is quite simply a measurement imposed by you on your staff that tells them exactly what's expected of them
it enables your staff to know themselves how well they're doing their job and if they're keeping up to the mark
it helps them
i've heard the theory but you can't actually set measurable standards in all the jobs can you
if you think about it you'll find you can
well we may not have enough time for that so erm let's imagine that you're a sales director and now this is more difficult
let's imagine that you're an effective one
now these are the minimum standards we expect from our salesmen
no fewer than ten cold calls each month all cold call reports must be filed within seven working days of a visit and a minimum of eighty calls to be made per month to existing customers
mm
oh i see i am laying down precise UNK so my staff can see at once if things aren't up to scratch
right
ah but sales is easy
alright you're a production manager
right so we've agreed on a maximum of sixteen and three quarter percent paper UNK three hours setting up time and er four and half hours printing
well alright but sales and production are easily UNK you can't have measurable standards for everything
you can
you'll find everything is measurable in terms of one or more of these four factors
quality quantity time cost
everything
well my name's thomas UNK
i am seventy one years of age
i was born on christmas day nineteen twelve
unfortunately my father was killed in the first war nineteen seventeen january and my mother was left with four children to bring up
my mother worked all her life and she retired at eighty three which is not bad going
pretty good
as a family we couldn't get away from school quick enough to try and earn a bob or two for to help my mother
i left school at fifteen years of age
which schools did you go to
i went to school then secondary school
i started work with a UNK or a UNK rather r round the streets and when a woman cried over the window for fish i ran up the stairs and delivered it
from there
how much did you get paid for that
oh eleven shillings i think it was eleven shillings a week
and what kind of hours
and it was oh nine o'clock to two o'clock
er and i had three shillings change
two a half crown and a sixpence and a UNK and three pennies and sometimes he forgot to take it back but however i didn't remind him
after that i started in bakery as an apprentice baker
and i worked there until oh nineteen forty nine or nineteen fifty
when was it you started there
oh that would be what er that'd be about
nineteen twenty nine
aye more or less that that's right
and it was a five year apprenticeship was it
five year apprenticeship yes and er it was more or less UNK work you were just a boy and run and did messages and carried whatever the UNK bakers wanted
er you didn't really start thinking seriously about being a baker until about your last year of your apprenticeship
and of course made it part of the job that you had to attend night school classes for bread baking and UNK
where did you go for that
went to a night school in fountain bridge
and if you had a complete attendance you got your er you got your fee back again from the from
but you had to pay it initially
paid but if you had a complete attendance they gave you the money back for your self which was quite er a good thing in these days when a UNK was a UNK
i served er my apprenticeship as i said in
i was married in nineteen thirty seven prior to the war breaking out in nineteen thirty nine
i became very interested in the trade union movement and my first appointment was as a collector in collecting the union dues and taking them up to the union office
and the scope of that work i had UNK all the lady workers both on the UNK side and the UNK side and that made it what you would term as a closed shop
did you take er members complaints and things when you collected the dues or they had anything to pass on
yes if members had any complaints about their work i would report it up at the head office and up at the branch office in park
and er take their sick lines up and bring back their sick money and such things as that
er i even visit a number of homes and delivered their sick money
this was all part of the set up
and i carried on doing that for quite a number of years and i managed to be voted onto the edinburgh committee
and i progressed from there to vice chairman and local organizer full time local organizer
that was in nineteen fifty four
my job as local organizer was going the UNK collecting the dues where there was no collector and dealing with complaints
in nineteen sixty six i stood for election of the national organizer and was successful and joined the head office in glasgow in may nineteen sixty six
the area i covered as a national organizer was from UNK to UNK and everything in between
now as a national organizer all the branches in your area if they had any complaints or anything that they wanted attending to used to write to their national organizer and i used to visit and deal with their complaints
well er going back to when i started serving my time as an apprentice er i think i started with eleven shillings and i was there for about nine months when the manager come over and says to me he had been paying me short
about one and odds a week short
and i got a packet with a few quid in it that day which my mother er appreciated
anyway it was very kind of the manager to do that he could have said nothing
i think the wages went up round about a half a crown the first year or five bob the second year in er progressing like that
and when your time was out there was no question of you not getting a UNK wages you were you were paid that alright
and did they tend to keep their apprentices on at
yes
very little very few apprentices were sacked unless through UNK or anything but if you done your work you were there to as long as you liked
now in the bakery at that time it was one of the most progressive UNK in the city and it must have employed at least about a hundred bakers
maybe forty women and er so many van men UNK workers and van men
the thing that er sticks out is that at time there was no women organizing the union and er i had a go at organizing the women and i was very successful
because at the end of the day we had a hundred percent women in the union in that bakery
but i must say through help of the national agreement and that takes us back to nineteen forty seven
all local agreements up and down the country which it counted to eighty odds were all UNK and there was what you call a national agreement established to cover the whole of scotland which meant the man in the UNK part of scotland got the same wages and conditions as in as the man in edinburgh or glasgow or any big city
and that was a certainly a step forward for the little places
and they loved the national agreement
how long did it take to establish that did it take you a long time to
it must have took about three years any way
it i think forty five they started negotiating forty five forty to forty seven and er when we tried to alter the national agreement or change it in our minds for the better you always had the solid block of these wee fellows up and down the country sticking by the national agreement because they got such a good deal out of it brought their standards right up to the best that was going
and by no way were they going to let the national agreement down
anyway
to take you back a wee bit before that er when you were an apprentice was your UNK from your UNK quite good
oh going back to the apprenticeship you were more or less left as you stood because i thought that UNK were very what's the word very er they were only too willing to let you know what was going on and when you think about it you can see why
in these days they were UNK of their job
there was unemployment going about and the man that had a certain job at making certain things weren't to keen to show the apprentice what to do or give them the UNK
but however you UNK them some way and you eventually learnt your trade by half going to classes at night school and half of information from the bakers you had to put two and two together and you worked it out
was the night school classes were they quite beneficial
the night school classes were very er efficient because the teachers that taught in the night school were actually bakers
expert bakers in the trade and er they showed you it from a to z
although some of the things that you were taught you maybe never got a chance to do them in the bakery
you were only a sort of number in a bakery and er worked at a table along with the rest
you weren't doing anything individual it was more communion thing you were making the likes of if it was brown bread you're all standing rolling up and UNK brown bread and putting them in tins
then you went on to the next thing you all done the same thing over and over again
but there were some in individual jobs where you had their wee experts er doing UNK and er UNK cakes and all these individual jobs
the man that was the best at it got the job
but most of my work in the bakery was on the small side scones and UNK and UNK and er little cakes
that was er more or less the UNK that i worked in
they had other UNK where it was only bread and other UNK where it was just UNK
but er this is how they wanted the work done and it wasn't a question of one man had to learn the lot you just had to do work away where you were sent to work
now was one of the biggest UNK in edinburgh you told me it was er three stories and each story had a different function
yes
it was a it was a very big bakery it had three floors and on the bottom floor was that's where they done the bread and rolls
on the second floor it was all the scones and tea bread and UNK bread and on the top floor it was all UNK work and UNK making and what have you and pies
but er it was quite interesting and er more or less you got a chance of going through the departments when you were before your time was out
but er that was how they got you into the trade
if you were keen and that well it was up to yourself a lot how you how you picked up a lot of things because if you were keen you could pick up anything you wanted if you weren't well that was just too bad it's your own fault
now did you work er an eight hour day
yes it was an eight hour day
the apprentices er didn't start before six o'clock in the morning of course they couldn't start apprentice before six o'clock in the morning until he was maybe in his last year then it would be either one o'clock or two o'clock in the morning
and the hours er the early that's what they called the early men they went in at one o'clock
they were they UNK workers they called them
and they had everything ready for the squad coming in you know
well the main squad would come in about two o'clock or three o'clock and er was already for them to start working
now on a saturday when they come to a saturday the early start was eleven o'clock at night
and i think the last start was about one o'clock in the morning and you got extra payments for the extra hours
but you always needed early men in
UNK men in because if you took a body of men into a bakery half of them would be standing looking about doing nothing until something was prepared
so that was ideal having UNK workers
so you were working eight er eight hours six days a week
eight hours six days a work that's right
could you give me an example of how you went about making a bread UNK or a roll or what had to be done
well in our in our in our er UNK where it was scones and UNK and UNK and everything they had the they had the special man that done the dough in
then the dough was all cut out on to a table where you had men UNK them up
that's UNK them making them round
then you had a squad of men pulling them out and cutting them
putting them up in the wires and other men putting them on the hot plates to fire
that was a process there
oh and the bread again it you had your dough men on the bread who made the UNK
the UNK were come through the machine cut into sizes certain weights UNK and the men put them in tins
and er that was a constant process from start to finish
you were on the same thing all day all day long
a set plain bread
plain bread was a different matter
it comes through the comes through the machines and UNK
then it had to be loaded up what they call long thin boards
and the boards were carried onto the drop plate and knocked out
and you knocked the next one out until you got whole complete drop plate of bread
and that was put in the oven to fire it
it took about two and a half hours to fire that bread
cos pan bread was only about three quarters of an hour
so that's why they tried to UNK plain bread out the market altogether
takes to long to make and fire
but that's the bread with the two UNK
the top UNK and the bottom UNK
compared to the pan bread there's a UNK all round it
that was er that was the process of bread
well in these days your UNK had to be set in the afternoon for the men coming in the morning
but nowadays they have m machines high ratio machines which beat this dough up in three minutes
these UNK are made in three minutes now where it used to take six hours
or the process was six hours
so you'd be producing thousands of scones and lots of bread
yes
turning them out
that's right
there was er y you had er you had a certain amount to make every day
some days was more that others
especially at the weekends
there was more at the weekends than there was through the middle of the week
and it was all UNK scones UNK cream scones UNK scones UNK and all this
but er it you got enough to keep your day going anyway
and er as i say that was one of the UNK in edinburgh
during that period
mm
don't remember how many shops they had then do you
had a lot of shops
yes
they had over a hundred shops in edinburgh
i couldn't tell you the exact number but it was over a hundred shops in edinburgh
but i think they've closed a few since then
there's a lot of them been closed since then
now what were your conditions
what was it like to work in factory
well the conditions were top conditions
er comparing bakery with bakery were as good conditions as anybody
and they had also er showers for you wash up when you finished
wash hand UNK in the toilets and everything
it was er up to the standard of hygiene that you could get
the basic you get at that time
and er
was it very hot if you were working in the UNK there
yes
well these were the UNK place that you could work at the UNK of dough in the bread UNK
the sweat was running down your back all day and i've seen me taken off my white clothes and hang them up and they were still wet when you come in the next day
and er working at the hot plates of course that was a hot job as well
you were over the hot plate all the time
but there was no extra money for that
UNK er UNK men
but this has only happened since we got the national agreement
UNK men and dough men got extra money
but er the extra money they got was no worth taking the job
it wasn't worth the responsibility
but they tell me now that it's been increased UNK now what they get for being an oven man
because at the end of the day nobody would take the job
because of the responsibility they had a pound was no covering it as far as they were concerned
they so it could be five pound now for the responsibility i don't know
but it was a very responsible job because if you got an oven for your stuff and you burnt that boy there's a lot of waste
so they had to get a chap that knew his business and i think he was entitled to get extra money
and the dough man was just as in the same responsible position
because he could UNK up the doors just the same as anybody else
so i think he was quite right in handing out to get extra money
because he could UNK a dough as well as anybody else
what about er safety was it a fairly safe place to work
yes
er bakery was pretty safe
they had maintenance men of their own of course who they seen that all the machine was UNK and everything else
but you know you'll always get the chap that comes along and UNK the guard to get his hand in and he loses a finger and he UNK that he UNK the firm
but er no as a as a safety bakery it was as good as any
as good as any i would say
but very little accidents in
now er during the war baking was er a reserved occupation
can you tell me anything about that
yes
well du when the war broke out the all bakers up to the age of twenty seven was reserved
which meant that er you could try and get away if you liked but you as soon as you mentioned you were a baker and they looked at your age you were
so anybody that worked at the baking trade and was twenty seven was reserved
could not get into the army
anybody under that is they were taken away to the army no bother
and er of course during the war we didn't have the freedom for making the stock that we done prior to the war
a lot of all these lines were cut down you know
couldn't get supplies
that's where er we made some money potato scones
it was er potatoes were being used oh bags and bags of potatoes were used in i don't know
went into everything
pies scones and they made their own with the potatoes
they bought the potatoes and they put them into this machine to mix them up with a couple of UNK of water and then they UNK all the UNK off and left the milk that was left and used that for the baking
but er
were conditions any different during the war
well no not really
i would say conditions were a wee bit easier a wee bit you had a wee bit more freedom because they knew they could not replace anybody if they gave the sack
and if they did give you the sack you would be walked away to the army i expect
but every firm every private firm was took the advantage of the UNK
that the bakers would be reserved at twenty seven
the only bakery that i know that didn't do that was the
the didn't reserve anybody and quite a lot of their men at forty was taken away to the army
and how they got on er with losing these men i just don't know
but they never reserved anybody the
so if you were in the and you were forty years of age you weren't safe for going to the to go to the army
well er continuing on bakery the bottom floor which was a break making plan
now during the war when we had to have all the windows sealed and UNK out that place became very warm and very uncomfortable to work in
and eventually the bakers UNK it the UNK camp
now the squad that worked down there when anybody left there was nobody would take their place
because they didn't want to work under these conditions
and as i say they had to put all the UNK name in the hat and pick them out and put up a UNK and they had their turn of going down the bread week by week
but at least ten to fifteen bakers to my knowledge left rather than go down to what they called the UNK camp
and the firm was very annoyed at hearing this name getting UNK about because it was getting a bad name
but that is really truly what happened
it was that uncomfortable to work in
every window was black with paint and there was no air coming in at all and you walk in between very hot UNK and the sweat was UNK down your back
so they had every difficulty in getting bakers to work down there
now if we can go back to the period when the eighty odd agreements was developed into one national agreement it seemed to break up what we would term a big happy family
because all the local places that had agreements everybody knew each other you knew their families and whatever
and the interest in the trade UNK trade unionism was kept alive
but since we got the national agreement in nineteen forty seven the same interest wasn't in the trade union movement
although heaven knows we tried to keep it there
but the simple reason that the men the local men had nothing to do with making the agreement now so they lose they lost interest in the trade union movement
and er further to further that opinion when we got the dues taken off the UNK wages and delivered to the office that still didn't help the matter
it still helped the remote chance of getting people to come to the meetings
they had no interest in the trade union movement
the dues was deducted of their wages so therefore why should they go to meetings
they hadn't they had no er UNK right to make resolutions or ask for increase in wages that was all done at conference by their representatives
so i think bringing out the national agreement although it was a great development for the union and these UNK a lot of the work they had to beforehand had to do it certainly didn't help the relations and the entries in the trade union movement
more or less i think it went against the entries because the members just wouldn't turn up to the meetings
did you get the feeling when you moved about that the members felt this that the UNK of the union was a wee bit UNK
well that's a feeling you got moving around that er what the hell was the good of coming to a meeting you had no say in your conditions or wages or whatever
it was all taken up by the top brass you know
and this is what you got
but as you look at it nowadays you can see if they were going back to these days would we still have the same interest
would they still come to the meetings
because we had halls where the members couldn't get in it was packed
but nowadays you're lucky if you get a dozen
and it's only because they have no rights in what they're negotiating for
and negotiations are all done on their behalf
and they've gotta lump it or like it
you can't have much influence at all in these decisions
no well more or less the branches had the opportunity to send in resolutions to the national agreement which were dealt with at conference
but regarding wages and hours they were all taken by the executive council and debated at the national joint committee with the employers
but it was what the executive council thought the increase in wages should be not what the members thought
and i think this done away with a lot of entries and keeping people away from meetings
when did you actually go back to when did you worked there after the war for a while did you
yes
i worked in up there about nineteen fifty or fifty one when i had a dispute with the manager and i gave him a week's notice
you want to say anything about that
well it was on at that time i was dropping UNK and UNK and the manager come up one morning and said that there was running late
the despatch was complaining that the stuff was late
well you either left the line for me to try two or three UNK for custom purposes
which meant you had to try the mixing drop it onto the plate count how many you got out it clean out the machine and try another one and do the same again and the same again
i told him this and he says is that all it takes minutes
so i says well if it only take minutes you bloody well do it yourself
and at that moment i told him to take my week's notice
during the week he come back asking me if i forget about it and withdraw my notice but UNK as i was i refused
and i left in about nineteen fifty or fifty one and started in a little shop in road in
how were your er wages moving by this time
did the war make a big difference to the wages
er the wages weren't really moving at all in these UNK er times
er we had lost quite a bit during the war
prior to the war the bakers was at the top of the tree of UNK
three pound nineteen and six or four pound one shilling that was about the top wages in the land at that time for UNK
but during the period of the war the bakers sadly fell down to about the middle of the table through the old saying that you've got to be UNK and help the war effort
so the bakers lost out during the war
and it took us a long time to try and get back where we were
and we're still not there yet
although we're getting nearer and nearer
when you worked er before the war did you experience any wage cuts
prior to the war no
er prior to the war we did very the three pound nineteen and six and the four pound one that i'm talking about that was all done with local negotiations
locally we done that and it wasn't until we went nationally under national agreement we lost the UNK
and er we fell by the UNK in the wages right
and we never got back again
the
mm
are still very poorly paid
how about your hours
were your hours coming down at all
er we got the hours down to eventually we got the hours down to forty four
i think it was forty six forty seven forty er forty six forty five forty four
they come down that way
er and usually we maybe had to give them a holiday
we lose a holiday for to get an hour off the working week
but these were all the UNK in negotiations
now when you moved to was that a kind different kind of work obviously you were doing a wee bit more variety
there was only about three of you was there
yes it was different type of work altogether
er was on a smaller scale of course and more done with the hand than machine
you had your certain lot of wee machines that helped you to do things but more or less it was all done with the hand
even er the breaking of dough was done with a lot of UNK a little UNK thing you know
compared with these big electric rollers
but the however we got by and it was a very progressive wee bakery
but unfortunately the UNK of the ways had to come and i worked in another wee shop er down in albert street in leith
you want to say why you left
well it was through er up and i ended up doing bakers work
i complained and although it was stopped i still got my books later
so you moved down to albert street
so i mo
which is another small bakery
i moved down to albert street which is was in the borders of edinburgh and leith
and er during the time i was in albert street although i was still very interested in the union and on the committee i think i was president or vice president at the time there the job for a local organizer come up
but with me being in practically the borders of edinburgh leith branch was er they pulled me into leith branch
they say i should've been a member of leith branch
but our to avoid that situation i left and went to work with which kept me in the edinburgh branch and within three or four weeks i stood for the local organizer and had not been successful
and that was the end of my baking days
what was this full time union work
that was full time union work
er just before we go onto you union work what were you having was quite a good employer i believe
yes
they when i when i became a full time employer er a full time employee with the union it was all more or less small UNK
the only UNK er and the that was about the only three big UNK and they had plenty of collectors and shop stewards in these places to look after themselves
but i'd dealt more or less with the small firms even to the extent of collecting dues
and attending to their complaints
now that developed that developed from er nineteen fifty four to nineteen sixty six
that was twelve years
when er i stood for the election of the national UNK for the east of scotland and i was successful there and i left the edinburgh branch in may nineteen sixty six to start work with the head office in nine may nineteen sixty six
and i was there from may sixty er may nineteen sixty six to december seventy seven
which was about another twelve years
now how did you first get interested in the trade unions mr
well i got interested in the trade unions because at that time more or less eighty five of the workers went to the trade union meetings
so the men always made sure the apprentices went and er it was just a matter over the years going to the meetings that you get interested in the business of the trade unions
and er it developed from there that er i was appointed collector at collecting the money and er
would you tell me a wee bit about that
well when you collected the dues er it meant taking it up to the office every monday and when you got up to the office and got talking to the officials and such like the interest became greater and er it developed from there that er the workers of thought they should have er should have a representative on the committee
and er i was put up for the committee and was successful and sat on the committee for quite a number of years
what kind of things did you do there
well on the committee you dealt with com you met once a week on a wednesday
there was about ten on the committee and er the full time secretary
now we dealt with all complaints that had been lodged during the week and er would be attended
and also er letters that had been sent from head office
these were all dealt with on a wednesday night and the secretary would get his instructions how to deal with them or how or when to deal with them
and this was er more or less the trade union business
and between that er every year the conference was held and er we had four meetings a year local meetings
quarterly meetings which they call them that was held in er the odd fellows hall in forest road and i think it was the march january february march quarterly meeting that they er the ballot was taken for delegates for the conference
the conference was held in june
and all your big branches glasgow dundee aberdeen and edinburgh was allowed six delegates
the er secretary went because he was a full time official
so that was the er full secretary and six delegates attended and er put up the case for edinburgh branch
only resolutions that stood in the name of the edinburgh branch was dealt with by some of these delegates
and also any alterations or recommendations for the national agreement the case was put up for the delegates
and er you would have maybe a hundred and twenty delegates attending from all over scotland
the small branches only got one delegate and that would be the part time secretary branch secretary he would attend
and er but they had they said very little
er you got one or two bright er part time branch secretaries and some of the wee branches quite capable lads
and er they would put up any case that they had from their branch
but on the whole they had er what you call a standing orders committee
that was picked out of er the whole
the voting er you voted for them at the delegate meeting and i think it was the six top six highest in the vote became the standing orders
now they met on the friday prior to the delegate meeting and went all over the agenda
and anything that was to be ruled out of order or they did it
but prior to doing that they met with the branch that had put the resolution in
they met with the branch and discussed it with them and told them how it was out of order
and usually that was accepted
although it had to come to the before it was accepted
and er that was er that was er the main topics of the conference
the rest was the rest on the agenda was resolutions dealing with the broader feeling on the economy and what have you
the likes of UNK economy that was on nearly every trade union agenda at conferences
every year
but it never did it any good they never got to run their own economy
so that was that covered you delegate meeting
what kind of resolutions would you bring up there
well er protocol you know
er in fact there was very little resolutions dealing with their own business
more or less dealing with the labour party business of the government business
and any UNK what i call resolutions that were passed they were sent to the proper departments of government
and er whatever happened to them after that er
we usually got one back saying they'd been accepted and they'd deal with them at a certain time you know
but er that was practically your conference
now they set aside a day of the conference for er deal with the national agreement
and er all the branches had a cook at the national agreement how to try and alter it and make it better
but it was usually the big branches that was doing the cooking
and er when it come to a vote to try and get anything passed or changed the wee branches were solid voting for the national agreement
so you had very little chance to change any
unless it was changed at er a yearly in the negotiations
but er it certainly did a lot for the bakers but as i said it certainly took away the happy family union that we had before
because as soon as the national agreement come into being our of the meetings dropped down dropped down dropped down until there were very few attending
and i think the reason for that was because they didn't have a say in what was happening
now to take you back to when you were on the committee representing what kind of complaints did you have to get there
well one of the UNK complaints that we had to deal with was er when your time was up at twelve o'clock you they usually kept you working until about five or ten past twelve
that was a regular thing and er that was UNK of course
then of course you had to take that up to the office and report it to the branch secretary who would come down and deal with it with the management
but they just in these days they just looked at them and said alright
but it happened it kept going on happen
but one of the complaints that i was very bitter about was at that time i UNK to my work and they had paving stones in the bakery with the UNK in them for to keep UNK
and er i used to keep my bike in there
and this day when i come out the bike was gone
i went up to the union and reported it and asked them to do something about it
they said oh they couldn't do nothing about that but er didn't think they could do much about it
anyway i bought a little book that i saw in one of the shops and it was er the industrial lawyer
and in that little book it said if the firm provided space for bicycles or what have you they were responsible for them
and i took that little book up to the union and showed it to the branch secretary and still i never got my bike or any compensation for it
i was very bitter about that
then that i got that book back when i became a full time official it was still in the still in the office
so i took it away
but er i that's one of the complaints that i was very bitter about
i thought i should've got some er compensation anyway or something
but i don't think the branch secretary bothered himself much about it
and of course i was to blame for not keeping on his and making him do something about it
er the other complaints were just more or less er maybe arguments er workers getting into trouble over their arguing about UNK things you know
shouldn't have been doing that and shouldn't have been doing that
and er there was always two sides to these stories
but you report it anyway and let the let the branch official deal with it
but more or less er dirty UNK for drying your hands that's another common complaint
and as i say er seven people seven workers did when they all that trouble started the bread
these were all things that er you
i reported them when i went up but whether there was any success in the things i just don't know
one of the another thing that i remember when i was in er they come to the er delegate meeting in june
you've gotta ask to get away for three days
and i went into the management the bakery manager and asked him and he says to me this is not a cooperative bakery
i says i know i says it's not only cooperative UNK that's in the agreement
anyway i says well i've asked you and you've said told me no
i says well i'm gonna take it higher
so i went up to the general manager mr and he sa told me certainly i can go
so
however how however how the managers felt i don't know
but i certainly got to the delegate meeting
er
what about organizing the women
did you do that before you were full time
oh yes i was collector collected the money the dues and in er bakery at the time
but er the national agreement was established by then and er i just i just took it upon myself to try the women and that i was very successful
but then where it was a closed shop
we got every women that worked in the bakery into the union
now on the ground flat it was a despatch where they UNK the goods
that was all women as well
but we never touched them at that time
because we hadn't wages or conditions or anything like for them
relationship between trade and between members of state strictly competition and i said i'd be the one erm relative case just to demonstrate the course lord erm i've UNK used the time this morning to do a brief UNK am UNK of the point the relevant photographs and the just in case if i can just hand that out UNK enable me to speed through the admission my lord if i can just er take the through it and apart my lord paragraph five is UNK by an agreement which effects trade between members of states er in UNK the court considered an argument that the causes and the UNK agreement which had been struck down by the commission did not forward then article eighty five because they did not have that trade between members of states the court replied that argument must be rejected article eighty five does not require that each and individual cause in the agreement should be capable of affecting into community trade community law or competition applies to agreements between undertakings which may effect member of states only if the agreement as a whole is capable of UNK trade is it necessary to exam which other clauses of the agreement which UNK there object let's just say or effect the restriction of competition
the requirement effect on trade which member states of jurisdiction requirement it is UNK because it is the first task that the commissioner of the court should undertake when considering quote from wind UNK get in constant and the concept and agreement which may effect trade is intended to define in the law governing UNK the boundary between the areas respectively covered by community law and national law it is not necessary law for the competition UNK by the alleged restriction and the trade which is UNK between members of states to be the same an example in the defendants list of authorities it's in the principal and in that case the restriction of competition arose in relation to a product possible spirits which was itself used to manufacture other products namely UNK it was argued that the that since there was no trade between members of state and possible spirits there could be no effect upon trade between member of states and so twenty five could not apply the court accepted that factual premise there is no trade between member of state and import of spirits but rejected the legal conclusion they concluded that is was necessary for there to be an effect upon trade in the market where the restrictions occurred they was trading another product which was related to possible spirits and of course stated it must be observed in that respect that any agreement who's object to effect is to a strict competition by fixing minimum prices for an intermediate product is capable of UNK community trade even if there is no trading in that intermediate product between members of state that the product UNK the raw material of another project marketing elsewhere
yes
my lord another factual situation which i'll simply referred to is the er on going debate in european commission or cases relating to up stream fuel er where there's very little trade erm for technical reasons because of the isolation of the united kingdom however the commission has UNK jurisdiction over restricted competition in the market because the UNK have a direct impact upon product erm from production costs product down stream of which there is trade
mm
and er UNK principal applies in relation to article eighty six and to this article the effect upon trade must flow from the abuse however the definition of the market arises in relation to establishing UNK there are many cases which established the market in which an undertaking is dominant need not be the same market as where the abuse occurred accordingly to establish an article of eighty six case UNK may be proven in a market where there is no effect upon trade
in the vast majority of cases they will of course on the facts be a closed link between the nature of the trade effective between members of states and the competition that is restricted by the UNK clause this is because given that the restriction flows out in the agreement the later sets the context for former accordingly as a simply matter of fact restrictions of competition operating relating to the same market in which trade is affected between member of states a restriction must be UNK in the context of the market if the parties to the agreement or the high percent market share of the market then a relatively minor restriction assumes greatest significance on firstly if the parties hold a small share of the market then what appears UNK be a serious restriction may turn out upon an assessment of facts to be minor or relatively UNK contrary to the submission of the plaintiff the restriction of competition can be determined without a assessment of market the court of first instance have recently held that the UNK of the market has necessary pre UNK of any judgement concerning the allegedly and competitive behaviour and your lordship was taken to that paragraph page ninety two just UNK recently the and the present case the restrictions pleaded that paragraphs forty UNK and the two twenty UNK were for broadly to restrict the effects upon the insurance market however the defendants have gone one step further and also identified other markets and sub markets in which the restrictions take immediate impact this is logical for example in relation to the standard form agency agreement the restrictions have the most direct impact from the sub market to the provision of agencies services to names competition is UNK in this market since complete UNK of secondary terms and trades are merely the criteria available to names when choosing an agent however the standard form contract also effects the wine and insurance market the fact that the agent has UNK powers to write any insurance which he sees fit affects the categories of insurance written within this is of course is the matter about which defendant makes complaint
my lord i don't know if it's necessary to take your lordship to the cases where there's quotes all set out
no i think i understand what you're saying
my lord my lord erm my lord that really brings me to what are er my conclusions my lord erm can i just practice my conclusions with two erm comments first of all about the my learned friend seems to paint erm in relation to this of course mr made a point quite strongly that he agrees this is a relevant consideration and that er have exaggerated the situation and if they are willing to make a point a like this it would require evidence they did point to their accounts lord erm i don't see to put in evidence but the statutory statement of business served er filed by on the first of september this year with the d t i revealed that has a total of sixteen and a half billion in it's members premium trust funds which is up four billion from the end of the previous year erm set against that the claims now made against the names is relatively speaking er small erm my lord
yes
my lord i don't think there's much point in going through that we don't believe it's relevant we believe
well that's right but erm they may well be small certainly but er what are the other names premium trust funds there for
well of a net that to deal with claims er prospective claims the future claims of course all the existing policy holders have been paid and the premium trust funds are there to meet the future UNK without
yeah
leading into the
the bottom line is it not that erm er you're suggesting that your clients legal obligations to third party policy holders should be met by other names at i mean that's the bottom line isn't it
well no the
isn't it well who's gonna meet them then
my lord the first point is the extent of what we're claiming
well answer the question mr if your clients aren't gonna meet these claims who is
my lord well no doubt then the answer is that erm that would eventually have to meet them through funds which they will bring in to the market and which will go into the central fund
yes and how are they going to bring those funds in
from new trading
what demands on
future trade
demands on names
well my lord in the same way that they've erm repeated the fund in the past
yeah would you advance me that one thank you
my lord i it
the suspect counsel to is no they wouldn't and they would raise precisely the same points as er being raised in this defence er which are surely if there is anything in them equally available to every other name
my lord we se i don't think that's true because what we're saying and if and i believe it does UNK from our keepers that erm we have to prove we've got to prove that these restrictions would of lead to category of business from what the
yeah part of your argument mr is that the that the erm members and managing agents agreements are void now if that's not right er they're all void are they not
my lord erm what we're saying is that certain restrictions are void if i can if i can just work through one example if the erm
well er i'm sorry to interrupt you i'm sorry i do apologise perhaps it's my tooth it's making me even more UNK than usual erm i thought your case was that these agreements were void
my lord this is a problem which erm your lordship's had submissions from both parties and of course it goes to specialist UNK first of all one identifies one takes one and strikes out the defending clauses within the agreements that UNK article eighty five on then applies the test of UNK to see whether the residual agreements remain or stand but we certainly have not UNK that the entire arrangement avoid but we pleaded the restrictions are avoid my lord er and that's important because it could lead to consequence and we're pleading it that and if for example er power in the erm standard form agency agreement was UNK void because it was an unlawful restriction it doesn't mean to say that erm an agent er a name might not of instructed an agent to write business what we're saying is they may not have instructed him to write all of the business that he did in fact did er write for example l m x UNK and now if a particular defendant can say well have i been well you know proper position that i would of been and the restrictions not been in place i would of instructed the agent to do precisely what he did then of course he has no defence that's a UNK that's a point if he says well erm i the facts suggest and established that i would never ever have allowed the agents to UNK to write l m x UNK business and the only reason he was able to do that was because of the restrictions then he can escape liability for that part of the business UNK
yes
and we've alleged in the pleading that he made that he would have suffered erm either all or some part of loses would of been avoided but that depends upon the facts and we're
not claiming
yeah i see that i see that are you suggesting that those provisions in the members agents UNK agents agreements that the type of all those agents call upon your clients are void or valid
my lord if it was if that was based upon illegal business we would say it was UNK if it was based at the end of the day upon business that we would of erm permitted to have been written then we wouldn't have no our defence to it
what do you mean it might be illegal business
well business that wouldn't my lord that's perhaps the wrong description business that would not of been written had the restrictions not been in place
but erm i thought it was both yours and mr contention that through the UNK of UNK authority and by because of that UNK your clients are not UNK that any contracts of insurance or re insurance simply made on their behalf is UNK
my lord that that's with respect right erm certainly what he says that doesn't necessarily lead to that conclusion all it does is have void what maybe authority between
alright well then building on that i don't quite understand it if you're saying that those provisions that allow agents to pull for whatever funds are necessary are what void to what extent to the extent that the funds are or are said to be erm needed to satisfy claims on policies which had you known that which you say you ought to have known you would not have er authorised the agents to write type rather long that but i
my lord that i
i think that i thought er
the chain sir the chain of logic and of course had it not been with one inter UNK there had it not been for void restrictions it would not have written that's when they were written they were written only because of the restrictions that's what enabled them to be written
well could we perhaps have the agreements in front of us while we're looking at this point erm where would be the best place to find them
bundle four my lord
tab five of bundle four it's clause nine isn't it now is that struck down erm by your defence or any part of it
well at the moment our defence of course goes to case the defence by
yes well er i follow that but i'm sorry i put it rather badly mr forgive me part of your defence against the claim by er relates to erm these agreements you must say that these agreements erm because they are of the standard form are anti competitive and therefore they or part of them are void erm building on that presumably your defence says or UNK er that because erm you know there void i dunno perhaps you can tell me this erm all the er all parts of the void all the power of the agent the agreements with regard to premium trust funds and the like er are also UNK as between er the erm name and his er members agent erm and in consequence of that you say as i understand it er that is all that cause be lost which you can neither set up as a defence to claim under the central bi law or at least as a set up or counterclaim i just wanted to explore this aspect of it erm as to the consequences of your plea does it mean that clause nine is put on one side wholly or to an extent in the latter case to what extent
robert this presumably implies that the agent is UNK the name
erm well it doesn't necessary apply that the agent is UNK the name the question is whether what any right the agent has got er the fact of the matter is as i understand it and tell me if i'm wrong that your client has erm received a demand under clause nine er which he has failed to comply i think that must follow because er if he had UNK with it then that would never of got as far as the central fund
of yes i think it must be
yes
erm
but really the question is was he legally obliged to comply within
well look erm my lord the fact that i think the answer would go like this that if the agent had sued the name then the defence would of been similar to that which is raised here erm but it would probably it would of had additional elements because the name would have been UNK through a slightly a slightly different
mm
but similar change of UNK restrictions imposed by of which they are members and which they are party and we would say we had the same defence to the extent that they had written business which would not of been risen if the restrictions had not been made
mm
but putting cos they thought
well i mean the agent hasn't or hasn't yet sued but i wasn't really putting it like that i was asking you whether it is your case as in presently stand looking at the defence you've raised to whether or not you have failed to perform your legal obligations under clause nine
er my understanding to er about five minutes ago was that you were saying we have not failed to perform our legal obligations under clause nine because clause nine er is either wholly or to be extent that it relates to the UNK which we UNK partially UNK out of being part of the erm the anti competitive of erm the argument you're pursuing
well my lord i think that follows from my previous answer that
yeah
had they been UNK then that would of been met with a defence er counter claim settle and so on erm and that would of been the answer that you can't enforce the claim under clause nine because it's void we didn't we therefore can't there's no duty to keep the agent in funds sue it to clause nine it been a void clause
yes
i think the answer is that simply as it who were doing what the name would otherwise have done erm for the reasons your lordship has given and your lordship has seen of course that the analysis of the relationship between the name and the agent erm certainly as far as mr is concerned indeed we said it certainly it follows from what article eighty five does it doesn't effect the UNK authority point but and the
yeah no not that we come back to that in a moment or to i'm just trying to see where this leads us though mr erm as a matter of legal analysis erm y your complaint one particular one we're talking about is that erm these standard these are standard degrees which UNK the competition rules now if it if that's right would not the consequence by erm across the ball you're saying you only you only would UNK them UNK in so far as they happen to do any happened to have done any particular name of er that i can't think it didn't seem to be in any of the erm cases we've looked at where the competition rules were applied but that was a necessary condition if it's that if it's void if people have suffered a loss as a result of it they can recover a lost you don't have to show a loss do you in order to be declared void
there are there are cases in which the exercise well if i think we can start with a right the exercises were right erm if for example the cases who simply that i refer to in relation
mm
to bringing the claim if it is pursued the claim maybe good it maybe bad and it depends upon the circumstances of the underline agreement that's one example where something maybe good or it maybe bad it's like an intellectual property ride depending on how you exercise the right it maybe good or it maybe bad if you use it to block parallel UNK or for some anti competitive purpose then it may be bad erm it it's not necessarily the case that if you have a clause in the contract it is always in every circumstance bad where the clause itself allows the undertaking concerned to exercise it in a particular way now erm so that as a matter of principal not all clauses could be automatically said in a standard form contract to be good or bad and it may depend upon how they are to exercise in a particular way what we have said is the erm the provision in on the UNK authority er erm and powers of the agent erm is void it would depend upon the facts of each individual case whether or not every other restriction as your lordships seen again only through and the cases they side erm that other provisions in a standard form contract may on the facts be had it depends upon the significance of the particular clause in the circumstances my lord in answer to your lordships question i don't think it necessary follows that every clause is bad but we do say it depends upon the facts and we have pleaded that not all loss might be erm UNK against
so if erm so your principal complaint i maybe wrong it maybe not your principal look at page a hundred and twenty seven for your assistance erm standard form of agreements restricted competitions the service of the petitions or the agents provided so this is names and thereby restrict the competition as the agents them say erm then impose on that it was a regime etcetera erm that the competitive the anti competitive one is your sub paragraph one isn't it on page one two seven your saying look here is a of dictated through their bi laws a standard form that all agents must use you say erm er that UNK competition because it means that agents are free or as free as they ought to be erm to compete with each other or providing services to outside names i follow that i didn't say i except it but i follow that entirely erm but doesn't if you're right doesn't it follow that the agreements are void
my lord er can i there's a UNK qualified yes to that yes if on analysis all the clauses are important secondary aspects of competition and if so then all of those clauses are void
yes
and then one says applying the test of UNK er is there a is there a residual agreement to be enforced the answer maybe yes it maybe no
but doesn't that bring us back you see to clause nine erm is that a clause which erm which you're suggesting is anti competitive because er agents might compete with er each other as to what if any funds they might want to pull down or
my lord i suppose the answer to that is yes it could be on the facts it could be that if there was in a free market then they'd be all sorts of varieties of clause whereby the name and kept the agent funds erm maybe
yes
they'd be all sorts of ways in which they could of kept the UNK funds erm they could of been but it's hard to imagine that
mm
the laws of that could of been an important element of competition
so it follows that there is at least a risk that clause nine will be struck down on your defence
my lord i think the answer to that is yes there is
yes
that risk
so then if we go back to the beginning of this discussion mr it must follow must it not that there is a risk clause nine is UNK so as far as all names are
yes
well my lord the person behind me is saying yes i'm just trying to think with the consequence not quite
don't be don't necessary be influenced by those at
although no doubt they are doing the best they can for you mr erm but i mean that's why that's what i was putting to you at the beginning
my lord the answer must be yes
yes
i mean if it's then it's the end to the clause erm er
but then is does it not the next point then does not er what mr say have relevant cause because if there is this risk which in the purposes of the argument rule start if you like as a wheel and not a UNK risk the reasons yourself just put forward er then it must follow that there is a risk er that erm the members agents will not be able to call on names to provide the funds
oh well that maybe true and of course sir er that makes the question both of the UNK authority and the member state responsibility under article ten of the nineteen seventy
yeah
be directed
but if that er risk was a material risk what effect do you think it would have on the market
my lord i'm not really an insurance expert and i wouldn't like to speculate my lord it's entirely possible that erm the
but you're been described as a as a as likely in the ordinary course of things to have a UNK effect would it
well no but competition my lord the fact that the competition rule applies i don't think it's straight clauses my lord corporate capital is now flowing into the existing is being
and er it wouldn't be calculated to provide the erm those people who have er policies at with er particular confidence would it and it wouldn't be calculated to assist in questions of er UNK and the like er which on any of you are all er considerable importance to the er european community
my lord first it was always open to notify and UNK this problem entirely secondly there's the european court make clear the v d s these sorts of consideration however valid do not of any circumstances provide exemption from the competition which have different objectives and names
mm
now if have UNK the competition rules then the fact that the consequences maybe significant severe for them is irrelevant erm it was significant for the
but it's not it's not them it's not
belgium police officers
them so much that i'm worried about it's the policy holders which i mr
well my lord previous policy pass policy holders have been paid all have to do in relation to the future is very rapidly notify their arrangements if they get clearance they can then get exemption from the data UNK back dated and the problems for the future are resolved
and that of course sets aside the
mm
the sums in the premiums trust fund it's a very simple answer my lord to notify now in the same way the commission suggested that they should notify some ten years ago
of course that wouldn't help would it on the er great mass of er policies that have presently been written in respect of which claims are likely to be received over the next fifteen to twenty years be included so help
well my lord certain UNK well certainly that may give rise to problems erm and then one may have to resolve those on the basis of the UNK authority or even claims against the member of state under article ten of the directive but however erm on satisfactory or confusing to the market that might be
mm
it is not the UNK situation that suggest
have it within their power to resolve the matter very UNK by going to the commission and providing full UNK even if they have to negotiate with the commission over provisions which the submission was moved then they can get that exemption back dated and
back dated to the date
date of UNK
of UNK yes
i ask these questions because of course article five of the treaty of rome basis a burden on this court it doesn't er create rights in itself i think everyone agrees with this but it certainly er UNK a duty on this court erm to apply with er community laws purposes and UNK and i'm wondering whether erm that is why i'm looking at the possible consequences of this er the inter relationship between the for example the directive and article eighty five er and bearing in mind as i said to mr the other day the consequences erm of er these fees
what with respect article five UNK upon your lordship obligation to enforce the competition of the source
yes it also er UNK on me the obligation of course erm under g of article three doesn't it which i imagine but you can tell me if i'm wrong mr is the one is probably the one article erm part of the article under which such things is the insurance directive is er produced but i maybe wrong
my lord i think what the insurance directive is brought under erm
enforced proceeding one is it
c three c the abolition of course freedom for movement for services and that is implemented in article fifty
er yes you're probably
to establish them
you're probably right but the point remains of course and i have to have
my lord
i have to have in mind of course some not just f not also UNK now c
my lord er c is the freedom of services
mm
erm my lord let me deal with g first cos i as
well i think i'll take agree mr you know much more about these matters than i do i just my eye just lit upon that one i thought that would perhaps the one in which the insurance directive could be said to be attached but if you've told me it's c i'm perfectly happy to accept it as being c
my lord i think i think your lordship will find that it's erm the reference in the first paragraph of directive the first it's sort of the first part of number fifty four
yes
erm and that brings it into establishment
yes well er i be
of the greater
but er the point were made
my lord g is the e r n i mean it is central government UNK policy
yes alright well let's leave that one and let's see and i stand corrected but my point remains the same if er erm er my duty under article five is not to find to the anti competition laws is it
your duty under article five is to be guided by the european court and indeed yes the competition law takes UNK over consideration of UNK and protection of policy holders these are matters which can be UNK under article eighty five three not eighty five one
mm
and with respect your lordship doesn't have the er and i'm sure this will not be UNK your lordship doesn't have the erm jurisdiction to grant the exemption under article eighty five three only the commission in doing that
which i wasn't suggesting i could no
the have had er a long grade of time since the complaint was put to the commission to put a UNK in if they wanted to protect their position but still they could of done so on a UNK basis and without prejudice basis they have not done so a longer standing commissioner had invited them to do so ten years ago they could do so this week on without prejudice basis and that may erm lead to security in the future that they now seek
yes anyway we were talking about mr UNK erm were not
my lord huh my lord that let me point i was thinking
because i not i can't remember if actually using that phrase maybe used somewhere
not my phrase my lord but er a slight high in relation to what he was saying
mm
i think that our description of what he was in effect saying my lord we were simply pointing out
that the reference to the accounts could not be UNK accurately without viewing the statutory statement of business which filed only just a month or so back UNK a sixteen and a half billion surplus in the members premium trust fund up from twelve and a half billion at the end of proceeding year
my lord can i just turn to my
yes
my lord er to only just final conclusions my lord the first conclusion is that nothing in community law nothing in the directives in the insurance companies act can be pointed to by which grants powers to them to regulate the insurance markets
they have subject limited statutory duties in the insurance companies act but the fact they're subjected to duties in the same way that the UNK the UNK are subject to duties does not make them regulators but in any event even if we were wrong on that there is no exemption under article eighty five one for regulators and your lordship has seen a number of cases and i shan't go back to them is fully subject to the competition rules whether as a regulator or not
have held lengthy dialogue with the commission no formal clearance what so ever has even been given commission suggested and encouraged to notify but they did not they had the opportunity to do so they declined it one might say is a market of risk UNK this is a risk that they took
mm
that is quite true yeah point is clear erm point three activities when er activities er in the context of bringing action forward in article eighty five one
in principal as the numerous authorities up to my lordship to yesterday demonstrate and the reference are er an action which and there are four ways in which the cases described it an action which er is the object of an agreement or er the means of an agreement or
don't actually don't actually directly say that the central bi law is anti competitive do you or do you
my lord we have said in a number of places the claims are erm unlawful and we refer to the fact that the claims come out of the central fund bi law
er can you just stop me on that my lord
yes
if put sample in er at paragraph erm we said that it could be we referred to paragraph two three this is the third paragraph i've turn up on page a hundred and thirty six on claim sees to recover and then we say the premises the claim is unlawful as being in breach of article eighty five alternatively unlawful in seeking to enforce agreements
sorry i've lost er lost you
page a hundred and thirty six paragraph two three
er oh yeah
my lord this is er UNK and the claim of course being based upon the certain
yes
bi law
but the bi law itself i mean there there's nothing wrong there'll be nothing wrong in your saying with the erm what is article ten erm if erm but with this connection which you say exists between what they're calling for you to provide erm and erm er what oh sorry start again you're saying the claims unlawful because they're seeking by er the central fund bi law to recover sums that have been UNK by their UNK of the
my lord yes
community law other UNK
my lord yes
so per saying there's nothing wrong with central and fund bi laws
per say nothing wrong with central and fund bi laws as a mechanism and it's the exercise of that in these particular circumstances which is unlawful and we have pleaded just erm
yes
page a hundred and thirty two para two twenty eleven in broad er we we've put in UNK er sweeping up provision in our catalogue of restrictions erm which simply says all UNK and other regulations may be UNK to the acts and all agreements made UNK to the bi laws which reinforce or implement any of the above restrictions
yes
and that was really a UNK way but then we refer to the point of claims of course based upon the bi laws
yes
well so that's how it's pleaded and that's how we built it into the these cases which i was referring to where an agreement is the object or the means or the consequence of an agreement they enforce within five the action is unlawful and of course there's the final and fourth way in which it could be UNK this because it and again quoting the words from the cases tends to have restricted affect on the market i think your lordship you can see how we pleaded it in paragraph two three it's UNK the consequence of the unlawful underline previous
yes
well the fourth point in relation to er we say that the point has been fully pleaded UNK is a question of fact the er it's not an issue which we say arises on these preliminary issues and can raise it er under order eighteen rule nineteen if they so wish that is traditionally the places where it seems UNK points arise erm and they will put in er UNK we will put in the defendants will put in appropriate evidence at that point depending upon whether the strike out allows evidence and how they frame their strike out but the UNK point is fully pleaded we set out step by step and in relation to er restrictions how they were caused the loss my lord at that point at this point we believe that's all we have to do and certainly we believe that it be sufficient to get over a strike out
yes
my lord the fifth point in relation to question three c we've always understood this to be a UNK bond we've concentrated on the words capable in law in relation to section fourteen there are two ways of viewing this and your lordship will clearly have to take a view on whether er one or both of these is a proper issue under clause three c one first of all is section fourteen itself capable of restricting the competition is it in itself a restriction of competition well we took your lordship the c b r case the case of the commission in which an UNK clause was held to UNK article eighty five because of it's UNK with the other restrictions and so section fourteen is bad if the other restrictions are made out as a matter of competition law that we say is a question of fact and we therefore answer that part of three c by saying it's not capable in law
you yesterday you said you don't say that in the absence of restrictions the immunity is heard
no my lord we pin section fourteen to those restriction whenever a restriction arises
yes
erm and it could arise in many different circumstances erm one can imagine a situation which wrongly UNK erm a name from the market well whatever the motives that clearly UNK competition cos there's one rule one less competitor in the market erm it it's con it it's UNK that an article eighty five argument could arise and an UNK name could raise a point whether he UNK is another matter but at that point and in relation to that he may say well i can sue you because you've excluded me you've restricted competition or you've excluded a group of names
mm
erm and the market is being badly hit as a result of this now we've a specialist in a certain type of business that leaves the market free for another UNK and they've now picked up all the UNK business
yeah i understand that but when you use the phrase itself as a competition that erm that didn't seem quite square with what we were saying yesterday
what well my lord
when you said i do not say in the absence
yes
restriction of UNK varied
well my lord let me clarify and be quite clear
you're not saying that it is simply to be struck down without reference to any under lying
no my lord i'm not saying
restrictions no well i'd rather i did
if there are if there are other restrictions then i say section fourteen is automatically void in it's entirety because it UNK it has to be independent effect of UNK the other restrictions it stands behind them UNK them on
yes
and in that case it does have an independent effect it's an UNK effect upon the UNK and that makes it bad in itself
yes
and that's why
will it be completely void or void in so far as it be more to the point
no completely void because you can't severe the good from the bad in section fourteen your lordship couldn't take a blue pencil and find some words in section fourteen which say erm you know i can take out an article eighty five claim or i can allow an article eighty five claim but i can leave something else in
UNK couldn't you say that a matter of community law erm er simply a UNK of that kind of er just has no effect just as far as erm any brief community
lord er under article UNK
law or the treat is concerned
no my lord no not under article eighty five and article eighty five and sub paragraph two
mm
is automatically void and it is then a pure question of UNK as to whether or not
yes
one can leave UNK a valid clause or some
yes
part of that section is valid and we say and we pleaded that it's not so forth
yes er so if you're writing your arguments then er says no immunity in respect of any proceedings
it goes completely
of any nature
it goes completely
yes i see that
of course until they notify and get it UNK which is always opened to do it's always been opened of course to notify an answer when they get a bit of clearance should of been
yes
if we went to that who what which was the case which dealt with the erm one arm satisfactory appeal procedure or that
c b r
can you give me the case reference
yes my lord it's paragraph twenty eight of the commissions decision and
what you're just trying to UNK reference
my lord yes i'm just trying to find the my lord it's er tab thirty six of the defendants authority
the defendants
yeah defendants list of authority tab thirty six and i think it's paragraph twenty eight
yes
well then of course erm for your lordships notes that you ought to remember v e x where there was an immunity from national competition law which they were saying oh well we've got this immunity under national insurance law and national competition law
mm
and erm article eighty five can't interfere and the court said who of course they can
yes
but the second way in which section fourteen arises is this slightly more UNK way erm it's not really the question of competition law it's more a question of administrative law or constitutional law erm whether it arises on the question er your lordship will have to decide but if it does then we believe that our case is extremely strong because what one is saying here is section fourteen a block to an article eighty five action erm does it make it either virtually impossible or something lesser UNK difficult er and we say er that that's one aspect and two can we show it's UNK well we say first of all it is UNK because even on analysis of the bad faith argument they are putting in a UNK with an article eighty five case to an extraordinary length in order to make good his case he first of all has to super declaration presumably that he is entitled to damages but he can't get damages all he's entitled to is the declaration if then don't satisfy that claim by paying up and their not going to be ordered by the court to pay up because that's a claim for damages and you can't have that then you have to sue them again on the basis of breach of bad faith er no other provision in english law would go to that effect and that of course even that assumes whether rightly or wrongly and we say possibly wrongly that er the failure to comply with the judgment of the declaration would be bad faith within the meaning of the act but even assuming it's right it puts a plaintiff UNK for breach of article eighty five in the worst position possible
mm
certainly in a far worse position than any other english UNK erm any of the courses of action which are permitted as an exception to section fourteen
yes
and secondly we say that er we're setting aside the question of discrimination primary basis section fourteen is an absolute block on it and you can't have it more complete er UNK of article eighty five and again even if the bad faith point arises er simply makes it and we say quite clearly UNK difficult to enforce article eighty five
yeah
well that's section three c one
yeah
question issue three c two and three er we say that in relation to two as a matter of have UNK this as a question of law we say it probably categories a question of fact because if they're right in there analysis of law and article eighty directive all it means is that there is no market outside and that the restriction is UNK if that being so one would answer the question is not capable as a matter of pure law of UNK article eighty five but in the light of the discussion yesterday afternoon of course when my learned friend comes to apply for this strike out we may have difficulty in UNK that provision it's not er a major part of our case that we would have to re consider it and i did ask your lordship erm if your lordship would minded to find otherwise not to block out at least the possibility of application for leave to amend and of course we'd have to make have to consider whether we could make a proper case out of it on what we do
yes
well in relation to the standard form contract there are cases er based upon UNK er primarily article eighty five one a which says agreements fixing terms and conditions for with in article eighty five it's based upon the facts that the decisions of the commission and the court say that elements of secondary competition can be restricted and here we have a standard form contract which UNK all elements of secondary competition
yes
not price
er this is not of this is not of the point in fact it's on it it's a point which i asked you before and er it concerned i think it's the same case as the one we've just been mentioning the with the commission of UNK to erm appeal procedures on the grounds they are unfair is that that's the same one isn't it let me just perhaps look at it
my lord i don't think that was a i think that was the case or the case
no er it could be the yeah but it is the case yes which one is that
that i think is it's about tab thirty
is it exists
tab thirty nine my lord
thirty nine defendants bundle
yes that's quite that's the on that's the one it's the fourth page in i haven't got page numbers but it's the last paragraph on the page of the paragraph for the publication do you know the page
my lord yes
it's the paragraph above this is still rather UNK me erm the commission were concerned because there could be what one could describe as arbitrary and unfair UNK of application for membership is that your reading of it
well yes and therefore they wanted the appeal procedure erm to make it fair i'm not trying to put words in your mouth but that term to UNK the possibility that someone could be able to exclude it from the market UNK
you mean for no yeah
for no reason
for no reason yes
and whether one calls it fair and objective argument
now i did ask you this before and still UNK me where does this fit in to article eighty five
well erm there are very few cases in which the european commission or the court talk about fairness erm when but
no well let's use your language
erm
a non UNK well let's use their language objective criteria on which it's judge application to the membership erm and i'm only i'm only UNK this but i'm but as a matter of common sense one would of thought that one wouldn't like subjective or arbitrary and er indeed unknown criteria to apply erm as in my point of view as a matter of fairness but er my question is and it was before and i i'm not sure i UNK in your answer where does that fit in to article eighty five
i'm not saying it doesn't but where does it well it obviously does but where does it fit in
well here i think it fitted in i think it was this way it's a little bit difficult to see from the decision itself erm this do when these were notified there were provisions in it for example in relation to admission and UNK which the commission objected to and erm i think one can summarize that this must of happen the commission said to the marketing question if you don't remove this restriction or if you don't erm UNK what we see as the arbitrary element of
mm
we will not give you exemption
no i i'm pretty sure that that's what they were saying yes
and they said if we in turn as it stands we could never give you exemption and therefore the only thing is to UNK it completely UNK and then we can give you negative clearance because it will have no impact upon competition
i don't know what the opposite of UNK is
er UNK
let's assume it's UNK
it's UNK
er erm obviously the commission felt it was er it was funny unacceptable if you didn't have erm for example objective criteria by which to judge applications to membership now i can understand this a fairly proposition of fairness but where does it fit in to article eighty five
my lord my lord er unless i've miss understood your lordship it fits in the sense that if you think that UNK or even UNK someone from the market you're are excluding someone who would compete in the market you're taking someone out who may of had an impact on the market may of brought prices down offer better terms and conditions
yes but so you are
that's how it's UNK
if you exclude somebody on objective criteria
well then my lord ah my lord not all objective criteria and this i think is very important because you can have objective UNK as i as i submitted last week that would be erm in order to trade in this market you must have capital of twenty million pounds and ten years experience but that's uniform rule it doesn't discriminate it's objective but it would be anti competitive because here you are setting up the most important market er in this erm as they say in europe for the project UNK market and you're excluding people who could be in there trading and who could be UNK the market
and that would be because your twenty million pounds in it has really got no erm had got no independent justification on arbitrary limiting a number of people able to compete but what if you're able to satisfy everybody that you had to have some pay out capital twenty million is ridiculous
my lord yes
but er ten thousand pounds
yes
erm simply because erm the later in the market it was obviously important that erm people had some substance all be it very small er
the minimum necessary
the minimum necessary
my lord then all what then was not restricting competition because the people you have excluded are not people who would be in the market in any event you are already saying we've got the level of the hurdle the wall or the barrier to such a low level that anybody who's outside it is simply not a competitor we've got everybody in the market who could UNK deserve to be there but there's no restriction no you maybe excluding criminals or UNK for a until they've been re UNK er and you're excluding people who simply do not deserve to be there as competitors at all but no capability of right to compete and that's why there is no restriction everybody is in the UNK circle who wants to be there and is capable of competing and that's what the commission are trying to get the rules down to making sure that no one is outside of the wall who should be inside of the wall and that's why of course at the end of the day they can give their UNK there's no restriction
my lord i hope that you
the other way of looking at it is to say that there i mean there is a restriction and of course the membership is restricted people who can put up ten thousand pounds but erm that is an entirely fair and reasonable restriction in all the circumstances and therefore come in more clear
my lord i don't think that's different erm it's not the restriction one saying that the res the it's not restricting competition it's simply an entry condition but it doesn't have the effect of taking anybody outside of the market who should be there
mm
and er of course that the commission looked at this as er as a question to be looked at in the context of the market and of all facts but they said you if you want restrictions you can be sure that we won't give you any exemption for them so you'd better remove every single UNK objection UNK er restriction that we identify that's why at the end of the day they got er it was a very strict approach by the commission you can have nothing which is acceptable you can get negative clearance but you've got to be cleaner than clean UNK than white so remove every possible restriction
so you're saying you're saying it's a case where erm if the criteria are reasonable in the sense of being required for the what proper operation of market or something like that
that er we applied for test of UNK the minimum necessary my lord this is a your lordship's focus on admission rules which of course different to what we're concerned with here admission to the market erm and it is the minimum necessary to ensure that all those who should be in the market and are capable of competing are in the market
well you see a person without ten thousand pounds is such capable of er capable of competing
my lord i don't know if it was ten thousand pounds
no or whatever it is i mean erm
my lord there may not be er if you've got no money to do anything with or no money to operate in even if the UNK vaguely efficient way that you how can be said you'll capable of competing
mm it's a pity we don't know what the i suppose we can find out what the er what the UNK future market membership requirements are it doesn't help but there's nothing erm
my lord that all these decisions
the decision
are very brief and there commission have done almost pro UNK but er well of course i mean a erm
i just certain satisfy certain erm cattle requirements and carry on business in the sugar trade and of must done so for a period of time i'm looking at this the third page in top of the page erm trade in office in london established without purpose erm now those the
of course we don't know what as your lordship says we don't know as a matter of fact what the height of the
well it says
or what
the bracket is facts well no yeah but we i think we know what the new wall is facts eight paragraph above eight paragraph above it looks as though it the bottom of the second page er first page
mm
that seems to set out that seems to give the details of er
my lord that these of course are just for the
mm
the headings as to what the rules membership rules were they don't say the content of the rules erm
well the i think it tells you a bit doesn't it means
yeah er very little
mini there's a minimum capital requirement they've gotta of been carry on business as a former
yes
and they've gotta have a trade from an office in london
yes
erm so those are the three those are the three UNK
my lord i my lord i do recall about five years ago i remember advising one of the UNK markets and see come to the life of me remember what was in them
no
but they were enormous they were they were very substantial but erm well i think that the point here is that one can have a minimum requirement but depending upon the facts and the circumstances and the nature of the market so on and so forth well they have the commission said you can have no restrictions at all cos we're not going to give you exemption so you'd better make sure that they are the absolutely bear minimum that are necessary to ensure that every person capable of competing can get into the market
my lord erm er one can't of course draw conclusions from one market to the next they are all different certainly is a self regulatory market is different from a UNK market
mm
erm but it does come to a question of fact and of course we don't know what was in the UNK what information the er the market UNK supervisors er gave to the commission about the market and the market shares er very little is actually stated in the
mm i know
about the actual market
yes the commission doesn't seemed to of addressed itself to the only question it seemed to of addressed itself to are whether the criteria objective erm that there could be reasons when it takes decisions and erm there should be an appeal procedure
my lord i think it takes the view and probably not UNK that assuming good faith on the part of the disciplinary tribunal and assuming that there is er review by the courts you will have complete UNK and someone who has been excluded for a good reason maybe fraud or something of that nature should not be competing in the first place but he will not be excluded UNK and therefore if he was excluded UNK erm the fact of he's exclusion could be anti competitive because it takes out of the market a player
mm
and so provided that there's proper procedures i mean i don't suppose the commission wanted to actually act as a review body for every person excluded from the market in europe and so they said well one's got to have a certain faith in the national courts as being an independent review and such as that person is excluded from the market there must be a very good reason and he was an a competitor
yes
therefore no restriction of competition
erm what is this commission w is this a
my lord this is this is a proper commission decision unfortunately erm
but i mean what is it an exclude or a negative
it's a negative clearance
negative clearance yes
my lord that's why we say it was so strict the commission said you're not getting exemption you have to remove everything from the market
mm yes
every restriction out must go and then we'll give you clearance when it's entirely UNK or when the clauses
so there we have the still remain uncertain as to as to what part of er article eighty five they receive to apply
my lord i think it can only be
and you're doing your best to try i know
huh my lord
there are two there are two ways you could look at it either you could say you could say yes or in one sentence if you have any UNK on membership at all you are preventing competition but that would be er a highly UNK statement to make erm and what you're what you're saying is that if you look at it that way the prevention restriction or UNK of competition must be some er UNK or bad prevention restriction or UNK and er there's nothing bad about having objective criteria which would indeed erm prevent erm these people from competing cos they can't get into this into the sugar market er it will prevent them from competing in the sugar market but that's not the sort of prevention article eighty five is talking about
could er i don't think that can be right because had that been right had the commission been saying you've got restrictions but there not UNK then we'll be given you exemption they would of said you've got restrictions but you've justified them
mm
if they're saying there are no restrictions cos they cannot they simply cannot give there good clearance if there was something which is something of a restriction of competition they must give exemption they have no jurisdiction to do anything else if they look at a clause and say
well er i no that's not what i was saying i was saying article eighty five then concerned with what one could describe as a UNK or bad prevention restriction or UNK
my lord my lord i don't understand what's supposed to be meant by UNK or bad it's concerned with UNK and UNK and er something which has an UNK or a more UNK minimize impact upon the competition if it arise erm here perhaps because it is er a question of fairness but not normally
well er let me put it this way if there if there is good reason good objective reason for preventing a person competing in the sugar market then article eighty five doesn't follow
my lord no er if you have a good reason for preventing someone who is capable of being a competitor eighty five applies but you can only exempt if you've got a good reason for preventing someone who is incapable of being a competitor then eighty five one is UNK
you can't have a restriction of competition which falls outside of eighty five one it can be UNK
so you say it must be implicit in that decision that the commission was satisfied that the objective criteria er would separate the sheep from the UNK erm so that no one who would be excluded who was capable of competing
my lord that must be right because that would only be the way in which they could give negative clearance because the clause or the membership rules were UNK
mm no i see that
my lord in a in a sense that right at the very last page when they say a notified articles association rules and regulations in there amended form no longer contain any clauses which UNK restrictions
yes negative terms comes i'm sorry you did tell me from which article
from eighty five one itself it's UNK it's negative clearance a decision from the commission that you don't fall within eighty five at all
and that in term comes from which article who told the commission being given the right to make such a decision
they have that power and er erm article three i think regulation seventeen or er article erm it's article two or three regulation article two of regulation seventeen of nineteen sixty two you can apply to the commission for negative appearance
sorry article
two of regulation seventeen perhaps i'd just give you the reference in er i'm sure it must be there page twelve one is regulation seventeen
yes er yes
negative clearance article two page twelve and
yes well thank you thank you it's a rather a slight discretion and that you for those information and we're on erm c three c three c
c three c
yes
erm my lord with regards to contract in general terms it's referred to in article eighty five one a it's a an agreement as to terms and conditions this standard form contract UNK all elements of secondary competition
er i'm sorry what do you mean by that please UNK all
erm anything other than price if you like
oh i'm so sorry yes of course
my lord report paragraphs seven twelve and two eleven erm refer to the competition rules and indeed explicitly UNK that a UNK of some competition in this area is in his view at least and the reports view a good thing to protect UNK protect policy holders and again we simply said to that v d s fine yes it goes to exemption but it doesn't get you outside the competition rules
yes
my lord point eight erm the evidence it all goes to insurance points UNK and protection of policy holders and in that regard two points first of all why one can simply say v d s secondly all their UNK even if it's true the answer is v d s but in any event they must sure even if even if v d s was wrong in some way they would have to show that the restrictions were the minimum necessary in order to achieve those legitimate policy objectives
yes
and if they were UNK or were excess in that regard they would fall within eighty five one
my lord erm those are those are my submissions my lord i was going to say something about my learned friends somewhat unusual request to your lordship to make UNK comments in judgment about the defendants case my learned friend wishes to make UNK comments we save a proper place for those in his submissions when he comes to apply to strike out or say anything about that erm my lord erm perhaps erm as a as a final point erm mr bernard after having reviewed a piano UNK once wrote the only thing he enjoyed more than this directive performance was having his teeth pulled i think your lordship has not found that the last five and a half days are equally an under UNK experience in relation to this mornings sir activity
yes erm
unless i can assist your lordship further
no er i rather i stopped you mr yesterday morning when you were about to engage on a exercise of saying where do we go from here
yes my lord
on the grounds that until i knew where i'd got to
yes my lord
erm it might not be erm particularly helpful but having thought about it again i quite like you in at least in broad outline er to hear what you have to say on the aspect UNK ton UNK
yes my lord
i'm sorry about that it really is more of a second thought although i don't want to go into any detail and i'd like any broad that you have to be in my mind in this case at least
could i just get my notes together
yes of course
my lord if i while my learned friend is
well my what position is mr
mr erm my lord i'm not certain i can wear mr hat on this one
no i didn't mean you working for mr what about him generally
i think er that mr is er mr er suggestion is that in order to erm UNK matters he would be willing to submit his sort of comments brief comment in writing and hopefully if mr could fit in a quarter of an hour sometime on friday
i think that's gonna be erm asking to much mr because we haven't er beginning to UNK very close you know erm
yeah but he wondered if just that a short period of time could just get your lordship a question of
well this case i'm afraid doesn't lend itself to short entirely impossible er mr maybe have to say erm will lead to the questions and then for example spent er a long time on questions this afternoon that i've had for you mr
er my lord yes
erm and it would be quite unfair erm
mm
to try and repeat that
well
he's not available tomorrow then
well he might be i mean if it
mm
i don't think mr available in the morning mr got lots
i'm available about eleven fifteen my lord
yes
i could make it eleven o'clock if necessary
well i don't mind too much because i can erm i can always be getting on with erm the erm judgment on the on the other issues erm er
my lord
which i haven't yet got on to cos i wanted to hear most at least most of the arguments on this aspect of the case although it's got very in effect very little to do with the other but it doesn't see round er i could get on with that to a degree er so i don't mind too much but i think friday is asking to much from mr
my lord may well be right would the best thing be for simply er for mr clerk to get in contact with your clerk and to try and arrange er with all the other clerks to try and arrange a system UNK convenient time in the nearest possible future
well i mean we cannot leave it lying around erm do you know what mr position is on monday
yes he starts a brand new trial he starts a new trial
mm
would er the most sensible thing be to use tomorrow and er my tomorrow is possible but i just have a
mm
an engagement very first thing in the morning my lord but mr suggested he goes upstairs and tries to find a finds a
well thank mr very much if you if you could i can accommodate mr at any reasonable time tomorrow erm but although he may say he's only got he only wants to rest for a quarter of an hour UNK as you gather from the UNK from the bench that's er that will be the very minimum and i may well have questions to ask him although i hope i'd asked most of them to mr so erm but i'm i think for everybody's convenience it erm unless he's got a specific time he could deal with we either start say at eleven thirty when mr can be here or at two erm but if he's got some other clever idea i'm perfectly prepared to entertain him but er we can't leave this hanging around i've gotta write this and whichever way it goes we've gotta look at it again er and although i suppose i'm not entirely UNK of and i disappear to the court of appeal next term it's gonna make things extremely awkward to try and arrange anything else next term cos i've got two other judges to bear in mind as well as myself
it maybe my lord that there's a judge upstairs better not to sit tomorrow afternoon but to sit on friday
yes er who is the judge upstairs
it's justice
yes but er
i think it maybe a deputy judge i think as well
mm
see what you can find out mr thank you very much
erm yes have you managed to gather your er notes
er no my lord perhaps i was i was thinking about time to let me just sort out
would you like would you like to hear what i have to say on that one mr er do you want
erm well i think probably better for everybody to hear what he has to say
well if by way of suggestions in no in a way because they are the plaintiffs
mm
erm and erm
oh yes
i think you'd probably find it easier to rather than trying to make submissions to
yes
my lord er as indicated to your lordship yesterday erm er the primary position of er is that these issues can be decided and should be decided that in the manner that i've submitted to your lordship er and in the societies favour
in the event my lord erm that er your lordship felt that further guidance was required there are the two routes that i've indicated to your lordship briefly yesterday there is the route of er seeking some information if your lordship felt it'd be of assistance to you in UNK any doubts that you may have from the and your lordship has seen yesterday the notice on co operation which is in and at page eleven thirty two and is also the UNK
yeah
to mrs UNK s k r four and i also took you to their UNK in relation to that
your lord if one turns to the issues of reference er the commercial quarters as we discussed yesterday should only make a reference if it's necessary to do so in order to resolve the case and has the discretion whether to make a reference under article one seven
yes
erm and er you know as you're exercising your discretion your lordship there's the points in the white book my lord in the interim it would be the societies submission that there are three reasons why during the time that it may take to get any guidance from the european court in the interim the application of the bi laws and in particular the provisions of the act nineteen eighty two should be maintained and er given er their force because clearly my lord if there is to be a reference to the european court matters will take some two years or so before the european court will give it's ruling that i think would be common ground with my learned friend
that's roughly the normal stage now
mm
not quite that long but possibly
yes
see it
in the region of twenty months and two years erm in those circumstances my lord er the issue must arise in the interim er is er able er to re claim money for the central fund these are monies that are as your lordship knows under article ten payable UNK on demand and in the interim can it rely on the statutory effect of section fourteen of the act
yes
and er qualified immunity from damages my lord there are three grounds why we say er that er in the interim were your lordship minded to make a reference that UNK from the central fund should be allowed to continue
my lord the first er issue is as a matter of english law and the english law position my lord in making my main submissions to your lordship i took you to the case we looked at the statements of er the house of lords and er lord in particular with whom the other law lords agreed my lord do you wish to go back to the fact again
no i just really want cos i don't think there's any question of me this afternoon ruling on whether you're right or not on these points but i just er on second i thoughts i want to have them in mind
very well my lord
at least so you've got the factor ten yes
and my lord you've got on factor ten the references to lord and the others
yes
law lords my lord in addition there is also the continental television er case which is at tab five of your lordship supplementary er bundle
my lord this is a er a case with er strong facts it's er the case that dealt with the red hot television dutch television
oh yes
and erm in this case my lord the we have got both the judgement at the divisional court and at the court of appeal there is
the facts my lord are set out i'll leave your lordship to read it
this is tab
tab four and five my lord for supplementary authorities
one i'm not sure it is unless i'm looking at the wrong
er the wrong bundle it's the grey bundle my lord it looks like this erm
is that your that's your pl plaintiffs authority preliminary issues
that's right my lord
erm whereas i've been called yes here it is yeah tab four seven five
er tab four and five tab four and five we've been with tab four
mm
tab four is the divisional courts decision
yes
my lord you'll find the facts of the case er set out at pages three to six the character of the programme is described starting at three d
yes i do have a general idea of what was all about
exactly my lord erm
not taken from that i've ever seen it but i do recognise
i don't think any of us have ever seen it my lord erm the erm the just the in this was a case where you will find er that er a reference was made for guidance as to the scope of the broadcasting directive
yes
by the divisional court and er it was a case where the divisional court er had to er consider what it should do in the interim the lord justice er in the divisional court judgement deals with the interim position at er page twenty five of the UNK starting at letter f and er going through to er page twenty eight paragraph b and i think it might help my lord if you could read that passage in the justice latest judgment
yes
and my lord er the appeal to the court of appeal er which is at erm tab five was exclusively on the issue of whether lord justice and the divisional court were correct in the ruling they have UNK for the interim er and the court of appeal judgement the main judgement is given by lord justice er reviewed with and the erm the heart of lord justice judgement on this issue is to be found at page nineteen my lord of the UNK passage that begins my reading of this judgment down to the bottom of that paragraph at letter g so from b to g on page nineteen
yes
now my lord er lord justice er agreed with er lord justice that's at twenty a lord justice also agreed but er added er some further thoughts on the er on the issue er his conclusion er is summarized at page twenty two paragraph g of er the UNK
yes
now my lord your lordship would of seen from in fact the same case and now from the continental television case both in the divisional court and in the court of appeal that where a reference is to be made the court that is making the reference it what is sort to be done is either to challenge a british statute or in the case of er the red hot dutch case in fact the terms were caused in the statute er something which in involves a UNK decision but in either of those instances the court has got to decide in the interim whether or not the statute or measure should remain in force and there is the priority of public policy as indicated in er lord er speech referred to both in the divisional court and in the court of appeal in continental television in maintaining the law in force and a bonus has to be faced by the person seeking discipline the law to show us the simply strong case to justify the er the suspension of the law in the interim
my lord making my main submissions to your lordship erm i submitted and it is position that there is no distinction between public and private acts the UNK in the board both the act and the central fund by the law should be taken as valid in the interim if your lordship is minded to make a reference unless strong evidence of invalidity is produced so your lordship if you make a reference it needs to form a view as to the strength of the
yes
of the erm
well how would that
of the defendants case
how would that fit into the present context erm we're assuming here that i haven't decided the er european courts or some of them in your favour
yes my lord
or alternatively because i have i have made this clear throughout i come to the conclusion that the questions of this opposed er or opposed in any form which any one here has suggest
erm let me make a few announcements erm firstly longmans the UNK are producing a large and they hope definitive dictionary of the english language and in aid of this they have asked various universities to produce examples recorded examples of academic UNK and we've agreed to cooperate and that is what this little piece of electronic UNK is in aid of in case you were wondering
erm the lectures given in the department of politics can of course be described in many ways and academic UNK is probably one of the most neutral erm of them
er secondly erm there's a change in the programme of these lectures
erm dr UNK is going to be on UNK leave next term and would therefore like to give her lectures on mill and UNK erm this term so next week you will have UNK on UNK and immediately after that she'll give her lectures on UNK and mill and i will then come after that and deal with socialism and marx and all that really UNK stuff
erm finally erm i've come down with whatever it is that's going around and erm you'll notice that my voice is even more UNK than normal erm i hope it holds out erm for the UNK of this lecture
i have in the last couple of lectures erm outlined or tried to outline erm locke's basic decision erm his concept of how we as individuals are related to nature to each other and i've UNK the crucial importance of this notion of how we are related to god
erm if my reading of locke erm UNK from that of most of my erm fellow UNK and political thought erm it UNK in a matter of emphasis
erm i think that locke's UNK erm plays a much more crucial role in his thinking than many of my colleagues think and i mention this because er you might note this as a possible bias that you might like to take account of in reading locke
in short as i said at the very beginning of this series of lectures you mustn't treat what as i say as gospel erm i am perfectly capable of being a little bit UNK possibly even a little bit erm original erm in my interpretations
erm and i have been UNK the line that what UNK locke's what UNK locke's general political position is his UNK his basically UNK notion of how human individuals are related to god they are god's servants sent into the world about his business that's what they're here for and that's what UNK all their obligations they're rights and so on
it's an emphasis which is not endorsed by many of my colleagues and you'd better bear that in mind
what i want to talk about today is erm locke's erm theory of the social contract and government
now then he argues that since in the state of nature erm the individual has the right to life liberty and property he or she also has a right to take such steps are necessary for the protection o of these rights
he may defend himself against attack for example cos he has a right to life and he may also defend his neighbours against attack
furthermore if a UNK of the law of nature has already taken place he has the right to punish the offender
and this involves both the right to decide that a breach of the law of nature has taken place a right to decide what punishment is appropriate and also a right erm to implement this judgment
in other words locke argues on the basis of his general notion of the relationship between the individual and god and the individual and his fellow human beings erm locke argues that the individual in the state of nature has what one may fairly call legislative and executive authority over others
and of course every individual has that authority
let me by the way put in a UNK here
erm modern theorists of human rights just start from the position that human rights are of course self evidently UNK in each individual i'm thinking for example of erm UNK in the tradition of natural in the natural law tradition which locke erm shares erm there is a basic position which runs throughout them all and that includes incidentally even UNK to the effect that erm we don't just have rights as individuals we have rights for a very particular reason
we have rights because we have obligations
it's our obligations that are fundamental
and it is because we have obligations that we can claim to have rights
if i signed a contract to carry out a complete refurbishment of the interior of your house i have an obligation to fulfil that contract
that means that i have a right to access to your house
you can't stand at the front door and say no you can't come in at all apart from its being completely UNK erm the point would be that because i have an obligation to carry out this work i have a right to the means to fulfil that obligation
similarly for locke we're in this world sent by god about his business the business is in very general terms to UNK and multiply this means well that is the reason why we have certain rights the right to life the right to liberty the right to property because if we didn't have these rights we couldn't fulfil that obligation
so rights and obligations here are very closely connected at least in UNK in the erm in the good old natural law of traditional thinking
that's just a UNK
back to erm locke's state of nature as i mentioned erm according to locke the individual in the state of nature erm has certain rights which involve the enforcement of the law of nature erm and this means that he has legislative and executive authority
now in the state of nature this has according to locke certain UNK first of all in the state of nature this means that individuals will often be judges in their own case and that is not good UNK
erm it means that very often individuals will have an obligation to enforce the law of nature but will not actually command sufficient force to en erm sufficient force to UNK their judgments and so on and so on and so on
what is required locke argues is that the law of nature be embodied in a set of known and established laws that there be an UNK in short that it's not just up to the individual to state what the law of nature is in any particular case you know you've got a set of known and established laws you know which do that
it requires that there be an independent and UNK judge to UNK disputes i e a judge who's not actually a party to the dispute
it requires also that there be an armed force sufficient to enforce the law on UNK individuals
well these requirements are locke argues met by the social contract the social contract in which individuals agree and consent with one another and i quote him to unite into a community for their comfortable safe and UNK living one amongst another quote
by thus UNK they form one body UNK and it is implied in the contract that the majority have the right to conclude for the rest and let me quote for when any number of men have by the consent of every individual made a community they have thereby made that community one body with a power to act as one body which is only by the will and determination of the majority it being necessary to that which is one body to move one way a single body can't move in two opposite directions UNK
it is necessary the body should move that way UNK the greater force carries it which is the consent of the majority or else it is impossible it should act or continue one body one community which the consent of every individual that united into it agreed that it should and so everyone is bound by that consent to be concluded by the majority
there are lots of things in this erm do notice that locke is UNK that by the social contract individuals establish a unitary body a community and furthermore a community which has the capacity to act
there are certain problems with this conception one of which at least i shall UNK to erm towards the end of this lecture
erm there is a further implication in this conception and again i quote UNK therefore out of a state of nature unite into a community must be understood to give up all the power necessary to the ends for which they unite into a society to the majority of the community unless they UNK agreed in any number greater than the majority and this is done where are we by barely agreeing to unite into one political society which is all the compact that is or needs to be between the individuals that enter into or make up a commonwealth
the power the power locke has in mind is the legislative and executive power which the individuals possess as of right in the state of nature
these are in erm in a social contract UNK to the body UNK as a whole
now of course it is not normally practical for the community the body UNK to exercise these rights itself so it UNK them to a man or body of men whom it commissions to exercise them on its behalf
in short the community once formed creates a government
there are two acts here the creation of a community a body UNK by the social contract and then that community UNK a government as a separate act and i shall emphasise the significance of that shortly
first of all however we notice that locke UNK the establishment of a government as the establishment of a trust and he means this in a fairly strict legal sense
the government is a trustee and the body UNK is both the UNK and the beneficiary of the trust
the government is UNK with the task of protecting the lives UNK and properties of the individual members of the body UNK and there is a reading of locke which i questioned last tuesday which says that is all a government can do
in short there is a reading of locke that UNK to locke a sort of minimum government theory the night UNK theory of government that all the government can do is protect the lives UNK and properties erm of the members of the body UNK
we also note that erm this theory of the social contract is a theory about the origins of legitimate civil societies
it is a theory about how a legitimate civil order can come to be established
it is not the case that whenever we become a member of a civil society a body UNK that we are so to speak signing the social contract erm think of it erm a little bit like erm a social club erm east UNK old comrades club was actually established in the way locke describes you know a group of citizens of east UNK came together and decided to establish a social club subsequently of course all sorts of people are admitted to membership of east UNK old comrades club but that as a process which although very similar to the original contract of establishment isn't actually erm the same you know they're not actually re establishing the civil society they're joining one that already exists
i would suggest to you in short that erm just as locke's labour theory of property is a theory is not a comprehensive theory about what UNK a legitimate claim to own something but is really a theory about how private property comes to be legitimately created erm so his theory of social contract is not a theory about how we acquire political obligations it's a theory about how legitimate civil societies come to be established
it's a theory about origins
right let me now touch erm on three topics and the first one is erm the UNK question of consent in locke
you will recall that erm according to UNK erm individuals do not consent to join a civil society they are simply born into it
a civil society is a natural organism like the family and just as we're born into a family so we're born into a civil society
you have all sorts of obligations of UNK erm to the authorities that be for example simply by the fact that you UNK out of your mother's womb in that particular territory and under that particular jurisdiction
no consent is involved at all
locke of course wants to argue a strong case to the contrary he wants to argue that membership of a civil society is voluntary
he wants to argue that we do join civil societies and that we can under certain circumstances erm decide to UNK them and overall of course against UNK he wants to argue that in this respect a civil society is UNK different from the family
again think of the example of erm a social club you know relationships between members although they may be close and UNK and friendly and all that are not the same as a relationship between members of a family
you know we've got a completely different animal that's what locke wants to argue
very briefly on locke's account members of a civil society are obliged to obey the rules of that society simply because they have agreed to do so
they have given an undertaking they have promised they have UNK they have said that they would erm undertake certain obligations and a gentleman's word is his bond isn't it
they've promised
however and there is some discussion amongst UNK of locke about this what counts as consent
locke speaks of express consent but also of UNK consent and indeed in one place UNK consent is deemed to have been given merely by being on the territory of the civil society in question
the idea seems to be that you have UNK accepted the protection of the laws and thereby you have UNK undertaken to obey them
a french tourist visiting england locke's case seems to be that the moment he steps on the territory of england he has UNK agreed erm to obey the laws and in return erm of course he receives the protection of those laws
that just by coming to england and driving along the road from UNK to london or wherever he has given his UNK consent
locke does suggest indeed erm and erm the example that the rather silly example that i just gave is meant to bring this out erm that of course those who have only given UNK consent are not full members of that civil society
okay our french tourist is entitled to the protection of the laws but he's not for example entitled to vote and he's not entitled to hold erm public office
sure he has rights and there is a sense in which he is a member of that civil society while he's here but he doesn't have full political rights he's not a full member
and let me quote locke er here we are we he says but UNK to the laws of any country living quietly and enjoying UNK and protection under them makes not a man a member of that society then he goes on a little bit further down nothing can make any man so but is actually entering into it by positive engagement and express promise and compact
now many UNK have found it not entirely clear what locke has in mind and i'm puzzled by erm the confusion into which they seem to have fallen
erm they seem to have some trouble erm UNK erm under what circumstances according to locke you can be deemed to have been given to have given express consent
and some UNK suggest that and i'm thinking here particularly of UNK in his book erm UNK the theory of UNK erm they suggest that if you according to locke if you purchase or inherit property in the territory of a particular civil society that counts as express consent
now what UNK wants to say is that erm locke sort of UNK wants to introduce a property qualification for full political rights back to the question who are the people
erm everyone or only those who meet a certain property qualification
and UNK wants to argue that locke is fairly clearly suggesting that there is a property qualification for membership of the people the people being the sovereign
i find the UNK basis for this interpretation very UNK in fact there is clear erm UNK evidence for precisely the opposite and let me UNK erm one instance locke is here talking about UNK consent and the purchase of property and erm he says whenever the owner who has given nothing but such a UNK consent to the government will by donation sale or otherwise UNK the said possession he is at liberty to go and incorporate himself into any other commonwealth or to agree with others to begin a new one in any part of the world they can find free and UNK whereas he that has once by actual agreement in any expressed declaration given his consent to be of any commonwealth is UNK and UNK obliged to be and remain UNK a subject to it and can never be again in the liberty of the state of nature
in short locke is plainly saying it seems to me that anyone who say a french man buys a holiday home in england UNK the general trend nowadays erm locke is saying he's still a french man
okay all he's done is given UNK consent he owns property in england fine but that still counts only as UNK consent
he can sell it and go back to france or might UNK to america and join a different civil society
but anyone who has given express consent can't do that
so it i think it is clear that
locke is not saying erm that the purchase of property in the territory of the civil society counts as giving express consent
well what does locke mean by express consent
well locke's UNK would know exactly what he meant in the late seventeenth century
this was the age of political UNK taking and i think it highly likely that locke was thinking of for example the test act of sixteen seventy three
basically the burden of the test act was that all office holders erm all holders of public office had to take an UNK of UNK and had to erm take the UNK in the church of england otherwise they couldn't hold public office
and that could fairly be called an act of express consent
i think it is fairly obvious that erm the test act here erm was erm intended to exclude UNK from holding public office
erm UNK would be highly unlikely to consent to taking the UNK of the UNK church
but erm that is the sort of thing that locke had in mind
and i think i'm right in saying that to this very day all american citizens officially take an UNK of UNK
usually in their schools as teenagers but they actually formally join the united states of america
that's express consent
and that i think is what locke had in mind to be a full member of a civil society erm you've got to erm give your express consent for example in the form of an UNK of UNK
that makes you a full member it gives you the right to vote it gives you the right to stand for public office it gives you the right even to hold public office
nowadays many of us find that a bit strange after all i don't think any of us or very few of us here in this room have actually given our express consent to be british subjects
but in locke's day it was normal and locke's UNK i think would have had no problem understanding this what he meant
a second general erm point that i want to draw attention to erm it goes back again to erm UNK you'll recall had ruled out any meaningful distinction between the private and the public erm the domestic and the political
the state is nothing but a family and we're related to his UNK charles the first just as we are related to our UNK as simple as that you know the private and the public are identical political relationships are fundamentally family relationships
i might add that UNK notion of UNK as originally granted to adam included both ownership of property and authority over men and here UNK was trading on erm the feudal tradition of erm property erm UNK erm UNK that if you have property rights in a certain UNK of territory you also have political authority over the people UNK that or that territory you know think of a straightforward standard lord of the manor and his service you know he has property rights in the territory he also has authority over erm the individuals who live off that territory
erm and his purpose in UNK this very traditional notion of UNK erm was of course well was amongst other things erm to make the point that individuals have no right of property which they can maintain against a government
in short the king can tax his subjects can appropriate their property erm without their consent
erm that was at least one of the major political points that UNK this notion of UNK
erm in short adam had been given erm lordship over the earth and all its creatures and with that he'd been given lordship over all human beings and the kings of this earth have inherited that lordship that UNK
well locke you'll recall erm well let me let me first point out the further erm implication of this erm which is that erm individuals have no rights of property except those rights which are granted by grace by the authorities that be by the king
mm
now locke you'll recall had UNK a concept of private property as a natural right UNK in individuals independently of membership in a civil society and in doing that he was of course trying to mount a case against erm UNK position
civil society on locke's account is established to protect the property rights of individuals but apart from this there was on locke's account no connection between political rule and the ownership of property
okay the king and parliament has very extensive authority over us but that does not include erm any rights of ownership in our property as individuals
that was what locke was trying to argue
for instance erm a good illustration of this is locke's erm argument on the right of inheritance and erm in this case i am quoting from the first UNK of government the right a son has to be maintained has to be maintained and provided with the necessary the UNK and UNK of life out of his father's stock gives him a right to succeed to his father's property for his own good but this can give him no right to succeed also to the rule which his father had over other men
all that a child has a right to claim from his father is UNK and education and the things nature UNK for the support of life but he has no right to demand rule or UNK from him
in short locke wants to drive a wedge between our rights as private individuals and our rights as members of a civil society
erm as a private individual i have a right to inherit my father's house when he dies
however as an mere individual i do not also have a right to inherit his seat in parliament
there is a clear distinction here between the private and domestic on the one hand and the public and the political on the other
and i think you'll find that in reading locke that is erm one of the major themes of his argument
finally a word about the right of resistance
and here i think locke's distinction between civil society on the one hand and the state on the other is crucial and i mentioned this earlier and i'm now coming back to it
looking at UNK again for UNK civil society was a natural organism of which the state was an integral part just as a father is an integral part of a family
not so for locke you will recall that so f the way locke sets it up is a legitimate civil society is first established by a social contract and that creates a community a body UNK which has a capacity to act and i'll put a little question mark over that shortly erm and that community then as a separate act sets up a government which because it has set it up as a trust erm it can change or dismiss pretty well at will
and the effect for locke is this and again i quote the legislative being only a UNK power that is to say a power based on trust a UNK power to act for certain ends there remains still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust imposed in them and thus the community UNK a supreme power of saving themselves from the attempts and designs of every body even if their UNK whenever they shall be so foolish or so wicked as to lay and carry on designs against the UNK and properties of the subject
there's a bit of a UNK here erm how can a community act as a single body independently of its UNK institutions
you'll recall that UNK had argued that erm what creates a civil society what creates a community is the establishment of a government
the unity of a civil society what makes us all one people is the fact that we're subject to a single government according to UNK
i find that locke doesn't really address this point
erm okay as british we all form a single civil society now locke wants to say that we can act for example erm we can change the form of our government and we can do this independently of the government itself
and i think one must ask the simple question what sort of mechanism does locke have in mind
and i think it is not at all clear what sort of mechanism he has in mind
it would be much simpler if he were simply talking about the relationship between the legislative and the executive cos here he could say right if the executive gets out of hand and starts acting UNK and UNK then the legislative acting on behalf of the people as a whole can take action as indeed parliament did during the civil wars
but he is UNK in the passage that i that i quoted the community as a whole actually taking action against a UNK legislative body
you know suppose parliament starts breaking the rules and acting UNK and i say the mechanism is not clear
and that is at least one of the problems with locke's theory of the right of resistance to arbitrary government
i'm sorry to leave locke by giving you erm a problem but erm locke is full of problems
erm next week erm UNK will start talking about the life and times of UNK
it will have nothing to do with the lecture but simply to impress those that my vocabulary is very wide
okay this er this lecture is called multiple government and the federal system and it flows directly from the last lecture when i started talking about the er the constitution and about the principles and the values that erm form the american system
and if you cast your minds way back to tuesday you will remember that what i said was that the americans were trying to create a system of limited government er and yet one which er protected the UNK of individuals not all individuals not black individuals especially but of individuals this was the rhetoric of the time and the main device that they invented to do this was something called the separation of powers and they argued that where political power is concentrated the potential for abuse is greater so that where executive and legislative powers are held in the same hands as they are in our system of government the there is more prospect of government UNK upon the rights of individuals
okay
now i also said that the states which make up the united states were for a brief period independent UNK themselves in the gap between the ending of revolutionary war and the UNK of the constitution and so when their representatives UNK in UNK in the summer of seventeen eighty seven they were UNK of their independence and they were UNK of that independence they wished to protect it against UNK they didn't wish to exchange one form of dominance for another
so they welcomed the idea of a separation of powers but they also insisted on another principle probably the most important principle of american government and that is the principle of federalism
why is it the most important principle
well if you think about it it's the only principle that america has ever gone to war over
er the american civil war was fought essentially over federalism er involving many millions of men and er in which over half a million men died
erm so federalism is a fairly important principle in american government and that principle essentially is and most of you i hope will have done the first year course politics and policy making where i talked about federalism in general terms that federalism is based upon the UNK that in the same territory you can have more than one government and that those governments er are of equal status
erm in the american system of government the state governments draw their authority from the same source as the federal government that is the constitution of the united states
state governments are not subject to the UNK or control of the federal government
state governors are not to be directed by presidents
congress is not UNK to make laws for the states or to substitute them for the laws of individual states and so on
and this is built into the heart of the system so you have a new nation being formed a new political system being invented and it's invented on the basis of two principles separation of powers and federalism
and federalism er remains a very important feature er of american politics
now the political culture of the time was such that the political system which actually emerged is rather different from that which some of the people who went to UNK thought would emerge and that really reflects a number of changes one that america has grown from four million to two hundred and fifty million two from being isolated remote and scattered the population has UNK and grown america has become a vast industrial power as opposed to a an agricultural nation and all these have had their impact upon the importance and scope of government
erm in the er late eighteenth century the consensus was that you needed government for some spec specific purposes
you needed government for defence to protect you against external UNK and to engage in foreign relations and UNK and you needed government internally to regulate conflicts between states er and to ensure a sound economic platform so that you needed er a single UNK source of currency for example er and a single source of er UNK and trade controls
but over and above that most americans in the late eighteenth century believed that in so far as government had any impact on their lives it would be local government it would be the government of their state and not the remote government in washington which most people in the eighteenth century had never visited or knew anything about erm or li knew little of what it did
now over time the relationship between the states and the federal government has been put to the test
it's been put to the test in the courts er and ultimately it was put to te put to the test er on the UNK
in the civil war
and i think it's worth just UNK very briefly that history to get an understanding of contemporary federalism
if you can imagine at the convention the bias was very much towards preserving UNK independence
if you want this constitution UNK i can't go back to my people and say you're giving up all your independence there's a new national government which is gonna decide everything
that clearly would not sell back home
er and so the constitution of the united states contained within it certain UNK a certain UNK of er statement and the actual working of that in practice er was left to the politicians and the judges of later times
but quite early in the history of the united states some very crucial decisions were made very crucial decisions
and the first was made in a decision of the supreme court in the case of UNK versus UNK in eighteen nineteen just over thirty years after the constitution was drafted and in that the chief justice of the supreme court declared that where the er national government the federal government and the state governments appeared to have erm UNK jurisdiction that is they both have some say over an area and there's a clash between the state government and the national government that national government's will UNK
so where there is UNK jurisdiction UNK jurisdiction see i'm throwing these words in here UNK you know erm the national government er UNK
the actual case erm was erm where the federal government established a national bank which had an office in UNK and mr UNK was the UNK of the of the national bank er and the state of UNK er thought that a national bank was an unfair form of competition with the local state banks in UNK and imposed a tax on er on the national bank
now when it came down to it the national government UNK sorry the supreme court essentially said if the national government wishes to create a national bank in UNK of legitimate aims of the constitution then it should have the discretion to do so and it shouldn't be UNK with by a state government
so where there was a potential for conflict between national and state the court sided with the national
just five years later in eighteen twenty four er in a case called UNK versus UNK i forget precisely who UNK and UNK where erm but this was a case er of a dispute between the states of er new york and new jersey over navigation rights on the UNK river er and who had the right to regulate trade on the UNK river
now the supreme court declared that decision that the constitution gives the power to regulate UNK commerce to the national government i e it wasn't a matter for new york it wasn't a question of whether new york or new jersey should control it was a matter for the federal government not for either of the states
so quite early on some very crucial decisions were made which UNK the balance very much towards the national government
so it's wrong to see federalism in a sense as an equal partnership between the states and the and the central government it is biased towards central government always has been so and has in become increasingly biased towards it i in modern times
now you know the UNK event of american history the most important single event in american history was of course the american civil war
the american civil war decided something fundamental it didn't decide as some people argue that UNK were equal to UNK this was w one of the least of abraham UNK concerns abraham lincoln supported in the eighteen fifties i throw this in for people who UNK and there's usually an american in the audience who's brought up to believe that abraham lincoln walks on the water you know erm he actually suffered from UNK by that's by the way
it's
it's no wonder he looks so depressed most of the time but the
er abraham lincoln actually supported a constitutional amendment which would guarantee the right of people to own UNK so the idea of lincoln the great UNK and friend of black people it needs to be corrected slightly
erm in the in the civil war issue what was at stake here er was er the nature of the republic the nature of the union
erm these states had come together UNK in seventeen eighty seven er to secure common aims protection against UNK indians er economic aims and these aims bound them together common purposes and so on but was the united states a permanent union
or was it something like you know the conservative party
something one could join and leave as one felt like it
and the er state of south UNK tested that principle
south UNK threatened to leave the united states in the in the eighteen thirties and ultimately er in the eighteen sixties it did so and er it was followed by a number of other states the so called UNK states
and the question that was put then was the question that lincoln had no doubt about the answer to which was this is a is this a permanent union or not
yes it is
you know this is UNK it is forever to eternity er and there is no scope no opportunity no precedent no procedure for a state to leave once it's joined
i used to argue in the nineteen sixties that britain should become the fifty first state but i'm not so sure about that
in any event the civil war was the ultimate sort of turning point which defined that the national government er had a responsibility for ensuring the UNK of the union and it took that responsibility so seriously it was prepared to engage in what was then the UNK war in human history
and that defined the permanent character of the united states and then what happened subsequently er was of course that the in the twentieth century er america evolved into an industrial power erm and certain changes were made to the american constitution which had a profound impact
the american constitution cannot be changed except through a very UNK and difficult constitutional procedure which requires the vote of two thirds of the members of both houses of congress and a resolution from three quarters of the leg state UNK so it's not a simple majority you can't just simply say oh let's add something to the constitution very difficult indeed erm er and there hasn't been a significant recent amendment to the constitution
er in the nineteen seventies and eighties there was a long running campaign to get an equal rights amendment er which was sponsored largely by er women's groups and er and er gay and lesbian groups er and they got almost there they got two i think two states short of getting a constitutional amendment and then something called UNK happened and it all sort of fell apart
erm so the procedure then was er in the early part of this century most important er amendment whose number i've forgotten but in about nineteen twelve i think it was er a an amendment was passed which added to the powers of the federal government the right to levy an income tax er and er that UNK the relationship between the federal government and the states because the erm potential UNK to be derived from income tax are huge
and in the nineteen thirties america went into the worst economic depression it's ever seen and the state governments were literally overwhelmed by the economic hardship and the economic problems and the federal government came galloping to the rescue
well UNK slowly to the rescue
erm well UNK them up
erm so the federal system has a constitutional basis but it also has a financial basis er and the two are er closely linked
so we have increasing dominance of a national government and we have increasing importance of er of er federal monies and er taxation powers
now before i say something about er about er contemporary federalism let me just er put the other side of the case for a moment
erm you may you may start to believe from what i've been saying that federalism is a kind of UNK you know that it's a that really states have lost significance UNK a UNK the federal government federal government is now more or less a unitary state and runs everything well that's not true at all
let me just run through a few features of american political life which make it rather different to er to our own er UNK isle
every state of america in america determines its own constitution and its own political structures
and each state is entirely free to devise whatever political structures it feels like UNK
there is a er an almost consensus across the states as to what that should be erm but there are variations so there could be wild variations so that there is a scope er to determine that er each state is free to set up whatever agencies or departments parts of the bureaucracy it feels like setting up it's not subject to any federal control or national standards
it's entirely at the discretion of each state how they organize their own UNK affairs
each state in the united states has a different criminal and civil code
and any of you who have been to the united states may have experienced this
if you drive from er i remember being stopped by one of those men in the dark glasses erm if you drive from UNK into new hampshire the speed limit in UNK is sixty five and the speed limit in new hampshire is fifty five and you just cross a si er y there's a UNK which says welcome to UNK or new hampshire whichever way you're going and the second you cross that line theoretically you have adjust to the different speed limit
so if you were going at sixty four you know about a UNK before the sign you have to be going at fifty five a UNK after the sign er and you can be pulled up by a state UNK as i was pulled up quite UNK i felt
i didn't know there was a different speed limit between the two states
er an so there can be profound differences in er if you think of a subject i touched upon last time a very er contentious issue in american politics the abortion issue erm before the supreme court dealt with the matter in the nineteen seventies every state in america had a different law on abortion
so you could literally have a situation in which you could live say er a woman could er live er you know a mile from the state line and in one state er abortion er could be something which ended up with a doctor in prison for life in another state across the state line it could be something which was er you know er provided free of charge by the state public health authorities
so wide UNK entirely different er codes
this causes all sorts of UNK i mean if you erm if you qualify as a doctor in texas er and you go to UNK you have to go through another set of UNK before they allow you to practice medicine in UNK because they don't accept automatically texas qualifications they re regard the ri they retain the right to determine their own standards of procedures in these sorts of areas so their own criminal and civil codes as well as their own political structures so these are major matters
each state er UNK to UNK degrees in economic er and er economic policy making and economic regulation
different states have different practices on er minimum wages on er banking structures on regulation of utilities on er housing policies on transportation policies all of these vary from state to state
the federal government tries to get involved it tries to see some consistency but it can't actually impose that the states still retain er the right to do things their way and they do
and it's also true in erm in social policy in health care and so on
you will find er different states operating different UNK one of the one of the most interesting UNK of america in the post second world war years er was the migration of many millions of er black people from the southern states to the northern states
erm and there were two very profound reasons for that one was the decline in employment in southern agriculture the increasing UNK of agriculture UNK er millions of er agricultural workers er and the second and more important factor was that the southern states provide almost nothing in the way of social provision and certainly nothing for black people er whereas the northern states were much more generous
so if you think about the massive UNK from the south in the nineteen sixties and seventies erm i can't remember the precise figures but in the at that time er sort of the equivalent of current social security cheque er in er if in if in new york it was about five hundred dollars a month in UNK it was fifty dollars a month
so if you were unemployed in UNK and you were black you had trouble getting the fifty dollars to start with but that was all you'd get but if you went to new york you get five hundred dollars so what would you do
you know so a kind of enforced migration because of different social policies pursued by different states
and then the ultimate differences between the states are that they have control over their spending
erm they have control both of income generation and expenditure
they choose to tax as much as they want to and they choose to spend as much as they want to and no one can tell them otherwise there is no central control over that
so if you take er another example erm most american states the majority have er a sales tax of some sort equivalent to vat as we would call it er most of them have a property tax equivalent to rates or council tax or whatever you want to call it now er and the majority have an income tax as well a state income tax
so they have a wide tax base and they can generate large sums of money if they if they choose to do so and in different states there's a different culture a different attitude towards public spending and taxation and so on
if you go to new hampshire i mu i must make a study of new hampshire some time if you go to new hampshire which is a delightful place if you go to new hampshire new hampshire appears to have no taxation at all as far as i can ascertain and the most favourite er car UNK in new hampshire is taxation is theft
you know they're opposed to it in principle erm so they don't have an income tax they don't have a sales tax either er i'm not quite sure how they finance public services in new hampshire it's a mystery to me
erm so there is this wide you know a variation
but if you just take those points er an and think them through in your own mind about how this system of government UNK say from the british system of government and the position of local government in the british system you can see that well we don't really have local government do we
you know we don't have anything which matches
so while you can talk about the expansion of federal powers and the dominance of the national government in certain areas it is but nothing compared to the dominance of central government in britain over local government
if you think about the taxation issue you know the government in westminster exercises very UNK controls over what local governments can spend how much they can borrow what they spend it on erm if they don't like it they apply financial sanctions to local governments and if they really get up their nose they abolish the local government altogether
erm you know there is no doubt in our system of government that the power is highly UNK and that local government is seen as a possible convenience well a public convenience probably erm something
something we
something to be dropped on from a great height as frequently as possible er particularly if it's the g l c in the united states however much the federal government is UNK by the state government it cannot attack its constitutional powers nor can it undermine its financial base so that's a different relationship it's a relationship based not on dominance but on partnership and there has to be an understanding a trade off between federal and er a and state government
now there's something else that's important here and it's something it's an aspect of erm of federalism that people very often er fail to grasp erm we live in a small and UNK island er and we have a political structure and a party system which is highly UNK and which places er great emphasis on the question of party discipline and loyalty and er these UNK party structures control er the conduct of political business in the in the parliament and in cabinet and there is essentially no political life outside of that
it's you know it's like what's his captain UNK was it going out into the tent in the UNK or something you know it's sort of i may be gone for a while you know in the in the into the wilderness and never to return so that in the british structure er politicians are their loyalty is central rather than local because their political UNK are determined centrally rather than locally
in the united states the one of the impacts of federalism and the size of the united states and its diversity is that politicians in america are all local
everything is local in america
now if you think about conflict between the centre and the states you then have to ask the question well what is the centre
well the centre is made up largely of the president er and the congress but the congress is made up of politicians elected from the states local politicians locally accountable
there is no central UNK structures and disciplines there's no party control er no party no equivalent of the of the UNK office er in england
the politicians go to washington as representatives of their states
so to set up a conflict in your mind between the states and the federal government mistakes the nature of that relationship
the politicians in washington are there to fight for their state and the conflicts in washington are not conflicts between so much between the states and the federal government as conflicts between the states for different advantages
you know if er you know if federal government says well we think it'd be a good idea to set up a erm you know a national space agency er UNK and all these other wonderful things you know and all the people in congress say great idea great idea er we'll have to have a launching site we'll have to have a launching site in UNK er cos it'd be good to get one next to the water otherwise the UNK might come down and hit people and that would be unfortunate so we'll agree there has to be a UNK state but UNK well we'll choose UNK cos the UNK nice and you can play tennis all the year round so it's a good idea and then we have to have mission control right
you know where UNK mission control is
UNK texas so you've got the UNK going off in UNK being controlled by people in texas why
because the chairman of the committee in the UNK that decided this came from texas and this provides lots of jobs in UNK so he thought it was a jolly good idea
so he was fighting for his state against UNK and against other states who were trying to get these public projects
so it's wrong to see it as a centre local conflict as much as a conflict between the states about public goods public projects and er and various kinds of UNK
okay now taking that point then let's look at the nature of er federalism financially
as i said in the nineteenth century government did very little
it spent er very little and the federal government's er UNK really didn't amount to very much at all
but in the twentieth century and particular from the time of the depression federal spending has increased enormously
let me just le i'm not really a i'm not really a very UNK political scientist but let me just run some numbers by you to give you an idea of the UNK of the change
erm in nineteen fifteen that's before the er first world war the federal government gave to the individual states a grand in aid and grants and support a grand total of six million dollars
there has been quite a bit of inflation since then but even then six million dollars was not a lot
erm in nineteen thirty seven that is er after the first new deal and the second er roosevelt administration the federal government gave to the states three hundred million dollars so you can see in percentage terms the enormous er an enormous increase enormous trans transformation
by nineteen fifty federal aid to the states had reached two billion dollars
so we've gone from six million in nineteen fifteen to three hundred million in nineteen thirty seven to two billion in nineteen fifty
in nineteen sixty five the total reached eleven billion
but since then the world has gone completely mad and in nineteen ninety which was the last er time i checked this number in nineteen ninety federal aid to the states now reaches one hundred billion dollars
so from six million in nineteen fifteen we've gone to one hundred billion one hundred thousand million dollars
so the role of the federal government in financing the states has increased UNK and you might think that carries with it certain political implications and it does but it's important to understand how small this is compared to the total picture
let's again look at the look at the contrast
in the british system of local government finance with the wonderful UNK reforms of the present government er we have gone from a situation in which er the central government financed about between forty five and fifty percent of local expenditure to a situation where the central government finances about eighty five percent i think between eighty five and ninety percent of local spending
so if you complain about your council tax don't students are exempt anyway so that's alright if you complain about your council tax don't because it only pays for a very small fraction of what local authorities spend
so in financial terms the local authorities are entirely virtually in the pocket literally in the pocket of central government
now in america through the nineteen seventies and eighties there's been increasing concern an increasing concern that the states were becoming more and more dependent on the federal government and these figures suggest that there was good reasons this was one of UNK campaign themes this was a g a growing concern he said the federal system has been UNK it's changed its character the states are now dependent on the federal government and this is dreadful and we must we must change this
and because he had a very happy turn of phrase ron he said that the states had become federal aid UNK
you know UNK was saying say no you know but they were the states had become fixed dependent UNK and financially dependent er on the federal government and that must change says ron
and he tried to change it
he tried to cut the money that states received er to a marginal degree
but in the total picture if you take what a any an average american state spends and you ask the question what proportion of that money comes from the federal government the answer is wait for it the answer is about twenty percent
it reached an all time high of twenty five percent in about nineteen seventy five and it's gone down since
or put the other way round every american state raises eighty percent of the money it spends within the state whereas a british local authority is raising ten percent or fifteen percent
so although there has been an enormous expansion of federal aid there's also been a vast expansion of state spending and state tax raising
now one of the things that UNK was disappointed to find was that in order really to address his budget deficit he cut federal aid to the states but he did it er dressed it up in an ideological argument which said you know that the government is too big government is too UNK government should get off the backs of the people you know er we shouldn't go to government to solve our problems government is the problem that's one of the one of UNK other UNK phrases
erm indeed i saw him i saw UNK once in a hotel in er in washington this was the time it wasn't actually the time he was shot cos i got away that time but the
he erm he started his speech by saying er you know what are the what are the ten most frightening words in the in the american language an and he said the answer to his own question was i'm from the federal government i'm here to help
you know
er and that plays very well with conservative business men if you if you say that often enough
but what happened when UNK actually cut the grants to the states was that the states increased their own spending
they actually taxed their own populations more to keep public services at the level they were before
so it wasn't the fact that he'd cut back on government it's just that the government came the spending came at a different er point in the in the political structure
so erm what i'm trying to say here then is that the federal government is important the federal government tries wherever possible to guide states into good practice and it offers rewards to states to comply with federal er guidelines so that you know if you want federal aid for er a particular project you have to if you accept federal money you have to ensure that you meet certain standards or certain conditions but a very convenient way of UNK civil rights er policies
so obviously if er if UNK wants some federal money for a project they're not gonna get it unless there are civil rights provisions built into the into the project that is you know you can't just give dole out to white people and refuse it to black people erm that there has to be equal opportunities and so on
but it's interesting in american politics that there's great lip service paid to er the rights of states but really there's no ideological argument that UNK that
erm in the days before the civil war the southern UNK were very concerned to enforce federal laws in the north that the north didn't like the UNK law
you have you all read uncle UNK cabin
do they still read that at school uncle UNK cabin
no
sad tale of the UNK and so on separated from his family and his children and he runs away
and they er as in many countries erm there is a very high incidence of er of death through death driving erm amongst young people and in america each state has a different er age in which you're allowed to consume alcohol
so in some states it's sixteen in some states it's eighteen in some states twenty one er and UNK thought it would be quite a good idea if they had UNK across america er in which you know that they would raise the drinking age to twenty one er and this would then er reduce the incidence of teenage drunk driving and if you've ever been in an american bar you will know you're very often funnily enough they don't ask me so much these days but you're very often asked to prove your age you know er and you have to produce your UNK licence and all the rest of it erm and so he increasing
pure UNK you know erm if you want this stuff then you have to raise your age of drinking i mean just er you know a piece of leverage or leverage as americans say to get the states to comply
this is the president who has this wonderful rhetoric about states and federalism and you know the rights of states but he was he himself was not afraid to use the power of the federal government to try and lever the states into line and it worked you know we're talking serious money here
erm so what i'm saying is that there is a partnership between the states and the federal government there is no single fixed correct relationship between the central government and the state government it changes from time to time er more and more of the cards are coming to the hands of the central government but you would you would be wise not to UNK the independence and the diversity of the american states which have a genuine er sense of local er democracy and difference er and states very frequently resist the federal government
so the ideal as far as federal government is concerned is they devise policy guidelines and they provide financial UNK to states to implement various programmes but when it comes down to it they run up against the rock of the constitution and the constitution says that the states derive their authority from this sacred document and they are not to be UNK with and the consequence is that america has not only a federal government but fifty state governments er and those state governments are large enterprises which enjoy wide initiative and they UNK contribute to the UNK diversity of the united states as a political system
i'll stop there
thank you very much
well what worked well
er giving people specific jobs like combining one
right how did you do yours
your group
well we decided what we w what the object was and then we got into a position that certain cards so the cards were split between u the two of us so we aimed it in different directions
so you divided into two teams
yes and then we decided to pick them up played back
right okay anybody else can add anything that they felt worked well
we decided to dip into and pick one each
yes the same the same thing there
what went badly
i got one from mars i think
then i went back in and did it again
what you made a mistake
in er you know we only reversed when we got to the bottom of that last machine and why had the guy back erm went over it and go through it again luckily it was only three high
so you had would anybody of if they were going to do it again do it differently
no oh yes nick all the cards and played myself on the tune
yes
when we did all work together all the different pieces worked together and you could just have a card each and you could have just done it that way
but when you've got forty three they'll just taking ground anywhere
could you be fighting basically to see what was what
if you can relate back to branches everybody was just running around everybody's had a specific task to do you were just running round like a
we could have just collected all the cards up put them in the middle of the car park and all just stood over them
it worked quite well
speak for yourself
i know i have to look at it i
i noticed er i felt three of the groups had somebody centrally who was being fed information all the time
i mean er in terms of planning what did you say at the beginning
what did you what did your group talk about at the very beginning
whether all the cards were running off
the changes we split up so
yes we did we sort of divided the team up
good idea
so what did he
three cards each right so we chose three to look at
yes so you divided it up like that
and what was your idea jane for your team
because the there's two different ones to do so we split it and two did one and the other two did the other
so you wasn't like four five year old in a bed trying to work it out
it just seemed UNK to do what all the way down the morning and then after do all the way down the other end
mm did anybody do one and then do the next one
we did
yes did you find that UNK you at all
no i can't say we was UNK through the
we came we came first excuse me
that why our team did the same as you
ou our system worked okay for us
we were finished about five minutes before
we didn't bother about it much we've had one member as being two or three of the latest
right
to share our information
so it was kind of energy conservation yes
it's space more than anything
alright well thank you very much for doing that
i hope that got us through the little post lunch UNK period erm we're going to do another er time management game now which will take about half an hour and i need to split you up once again into groups erm okay
into three groups of six so if we have one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three
so we're going to do this exercise within this room and we'll need to rearrange the tables so i suggest that each group as having one table or two tables put it in a square to work around
so if you could now get together with your people all the ones together all the twos together and all the threes together and rearrange the tables in an area of the room where you'd like to work
ones
twos
twos
twos
threes
any more threes
threes
what are you
three
right
what you're in your group if within each group you could elect between you one a manager and two an observer
thank you class have you all decided on your managers and UNK
yes
if i could have all the managers and all the UNK please
if you could come out and out of the room with me
the erm shapes did you ever have to do that with the thingy in the middle
erm
you've got er a sh a t we knew it was a t but it could turn to different shapes
no i didn't do that one
and then you have to explain it to the person opposite you or a long distance phone call and say how you and this because there was a colour done what i've said he said my UNK completely different and you've propose all those colour bits but
they're all different
the object of that was don't assume that people have got a sign for you know
the beauty of having to describe a shape
and as they're describing it you had to draw it
so you had to draw it as they describe it
you're not supposed to be reading the news
do you know if the answers are in there
did anybody meet that famous last night about the how you find out about people
i think i told lisa again
it's one of these assertion things
aye which thing's that
what is the name of that
which one then
it was body language wasn't it
aye it wasn't particular clear though
no
what's that
what did pete say
it's supposed to be a session
so what what's that supposed to do if you brush hair it'll indicate to the male kind er that you're interested and that you wouldn't mind getting in touch with them
it's not that you haven't got or a black skirt or something
it's a love story or something
if all he wants is to UNK doesn't he
i know he does
in fact this
because apparently we've all got to avoid eye contact either that right or facial expression
i'm going to use it the night before if you've a minute
and all
don't believe it
yes
that's two there isn't it
yes
i've got they're reading about i
the manager what's the manager going to do you think
give directions
and the UNK just going to watch the group as a whole because she's not anybody to
how much longer do you think
how about sitting here UNK
unsure don't know
do you think we're going somewhere this week
nip up then because she probably
perhaps they're doing pass the parcel like
you know that piper alpha thing
no
late at night they've got the boat and the tape they're both out on tape and video and basically you have to go back as soon as the boat comes through docks the next person picks it up and goes so you've got very little time to pick up information and all the time you can't go in and the UNK going and the UNK going and you switch and they said it was next to you they said it such a
can you buy that then
yes it's about twenty pounds but it's x UNK
are we going to prepared to start that then i'll say we started i make it i make it dead on twenty five to now but if we go by that clock and if everybody goes by that one it's probably easier because that's between twenty five to so if we make it about eighteen minutes past
no but if it's like not been part of
alright so do you want to start now
right as you know i'm the head of a major advertising company
we've been approached by er the local county who wish to er make up some radio from the er agency
surprise
okay
what in order to decide whether they're going to give us the contract what they have asked us to do is prepare a thirty minute radio sorry thirty second radio presentation and we will re record for them and they will hear which we want to emphasise based on how good that was whether they want to take the contract out with us
okay is everybody clear on that
here's the to go on
it can be anything real or imaginary
the only UNK we've got on that is that it's got to be thirty seconds long we can use whatever sound effects we like we really to begin with we have got to have scripts everybody here takes part in it has got to have a script first
yes now what i'm saying is i mean there's going to be there's four of us they're five of us here taking part in the exercise yes
so if four of us were to work on it as a group
two of UNK do the script together
right so are we are we going to do the script is one person going to read it all out or are we going to go round and
let the manager decide
fair enough i shall read out the script
yes maybe
so if we three start into that
national children's homes yes founded in eighteen sixty nine c h children's health and associated with children's charities we work with among others children with disabilities sexually abused children homeless young people
throughout england there are projects nationwide they need practical support counselling and specialist treatment but above all there are sixteen thousand children a year that hope for a better future
that's a better
right what i would suggest is somebody take what i was going to say is if you time me reading this okay we get an idea of how long exactly we need to make
founded in eighteen sixty nine n c h is britain's second largest children's charity
we work with among others children with disabilities sexually abused children homeless young people and
through our two hundred projects nationwide we give practical support counselling and specialist treatment but above all we give sixteen thousand children a year the hope for a better future
please support us in our year n c h a charity for children
what ideas are need getting across how what the charity does how the er how the charity does it and how we can help
that's three priorities in that order
so i think first of all we need to need to introduce what the charity is and who they're going to be UNK
i think we'll along with a
well we don't have an idea on this
no
what does it say in the advert
you said it
who we worked for so that you introduce the charity who we work for erm
right well what did that question one what charity d what the charity does right
yes okay anything like that caring for children helping children
not really no so what we're doing now we don't want to get too carried away with one title we've got to try and find things to say how we're going to achieve it
we we've got the how you can help section here but we've got nothing at all about what the charity does and how it does it yes we need some appropriate words for getting the idea that they're helping children
yes then there's the yes what that says at the top so you can announce what the aim of the campaign is
can we get help for the best possible start we want something like that so we're saying help us to do this that's how we're getting across the idea they're erm how they're going about it
erm you could say worse i suppose you could UNK but erm
okay i want research help us erm help erm help us give something like that help us give a best possible start to them help us give them to help us to them
okay time is up
you can stop now please
okay then
and all the jokes and chuck all your UNK away first
where's the bin
are you alright there
right so what we'll do first of all is get you to your results and then as each end we'll get the UNK to make their comments
so who wants to go first
i think we'll go first if you like
yes you may as well stay there if you like or you can come down or
set time
i am
i am UNK for homes for the children's charity
our aim is to build one hundred new homes for our homeless children
children are all our responsibilities please support the children's
the kids
home
right very good thank you
phil you're next
okay
go on then
end of side one
shall i bring it down here then bring it over to there and
yesterday ten thousand children were killed
richard branson saved us over the UNK
just to survive we need your cash today
our trip is vital for charity
please support us on the hot line in hope
mm thank you it's very nice
oh i'm not too sure
we're the national children's home action for children
there is way you can help improve research we need to give the best possible start to kids
if you care to help rescue children with disabilities and teenagers who suffer abuse we want you to say yes and to help get eight hundred million pounds
phone now on with your credit card or UNK or contact your nearest national westminster bank
very good
yes thank you very much
they were all very good
okay then which observer wants to observe or come out with
i don't mind
okay then UNK what happened in your group
right do you want me to go through every point
well erm
erm we had a
a couple of tears and so on
yes go through the first five minutes there were all different tasks erm at first the girls were making up a basic UNK that would be about thirty seconds and everyone else was looking through to see what words they should use
and tracy had already no they'd all decided what charity it'd be tracy asked what they suggested so she's democratic
erm they all suggested that it should be something like UNK
and then they started looking for words that might be relevant so that's quite good
erm they put the bit of paper in the middle with the suggestion type of thing that they were and then they all looked for words erm then ian and deborah arranged the words on the paper to start ar UNK the UNK so that the words that they had they used their resources like that and anything else
tracy was keeping an eye on the time all the time they didn't UNK it none at all
was that because of lack of time
yes
at first they were very calm and at the end at the end there was a big panic that they was they were all talking over each other there was no control you know it was a bit rushed at the end but that wasn't because it was bad planning it was just they were UNK at the end
it was more difficult than we thought
they should have had more definite targets because it was a bit everyone at one point everyone was doing the same thing through the words which
why was that
pardon
why was that was that because it
because it it's UNK looking at a blank piece of paper when we needed ways to start the comment
yes
so we had to get some ways to try and get something down
they all had an input and tracy kept them a lot
erm as i say she's like she's very democratic and she's always asking them what they felt how they felt they should tackle it i mean they hadn't decided what the message should be
overall if you had to comment how do you think it went
it was good apart from the end
and then there was panic because there was no time in the end
thank you very much that group
next group okay
erm i came down and explained what the nature was what you wanted to be done you didn't really explain why and how important that our was which i felt that he said what he needing doing he said what resources he had and he said that he didn't really set tasks erm but he did ask them what they thought they should do you know
erm
that's good
sorry
that's what i was going to say
yes you set tasks but by erm dave not by ian
erm at the start it was a bit UNK they didn't really know what they was doing i felt anyway
and they didn't really decide on what the message was going to be erm they just decided to start checking lines getting words out on what the charity was going to be they split that up quite well
erm i felt that tony was getting a bit frustrated
it was
there was no
yes i stopped like
there was no UNK really to start with
he was getting a bit frustrated they didn't really know what they were supposed to be doing
towards the end it got better though and they got the time right we timed it towards the end and the wording was right so it got better towards the end
okay
erm yes and that was it really at first the and then it went through and it was alright at the end
so it was
yes it was quite bad to start with quite poor UNK and there was no
that's what that's how i felt was happening
we were given tasks but then the tasks had been given to certain people like yourself starting to want to do the other things that other people were doing and then everybody wanted to do instead of doing the tasks that they were set
yes that's what i mean
there was quite a lot pressure and half the team weren't listening to what ian was saying at that so
alright so there was a bit of competition between
nobody at the end
when we asked for a script from that side from the beginning it didn't come
well no because we hadn't us given us any ideas towards the end it got better and they were
towards the end it got better and they worked it was a bad start but it got better towards the end
and we actually got all the words out
we got the words up there and timed it right and everything and then a UNK was done
okay thank you very much
it was very confusing key words when we started using key words and when we asked because something wasn't there and we consulted the script we were still cutting words out but at the script was definite but sort of like two of them well they had doubts and like we started cutting words out and then like the words that were out
ian started on the script
there were some use of that to begin with the key words a lot maybe got stuck on the piece of paper because
maybe not according to
we're all pulling together
what about your team terry
i think you you're
er right everybody seemed and getting it follow it by erm the first stage of the planning erm did the manager clearly understand the nature of the situation
erm i feel that she'd read the brief but hadn't studied it because she went back to half way through and er looked at the objectives
erm she established the objective not UNK but UNK erm there were all sorts the resources available what we have yes that's not a problem but the at the same time the rest of the group went to establishing the objective and there was a lot of over talking by people and i feel that she didn't control it and say look this is what we're going to do now
then we didn't achieve we're didn't produce a work plan or organiser we went straight in people were UNK out bits of papers you know it ended up as a big pile of words you know
so he took on the task of er writing the script off his own bat he wasn't appointed to it er but he stuck with that throughout and erm he stuck to his objective
erm he organised the coordinating after a while she did actually stop them after five minutes and explain the time situation er the final objective were the constraints
there was no really interaction on that on anybody's part
er nobody looked at the time which did cause a problem
yes we did
you were looking at the time but it didn't come up i mean
we did yes we mentioned it i mentioned
yes you mentioned it a couple of times put there was no one really keeping a watch on the clock
not that i saw
can i
there's eleven minutes to go and literally everyone starts UNK
you know everyone's like
it says it really doesn't it
alright then moving on moving totally on
yes er
UNK feedback
yes but not on an on going basis
it happened a couple of times the exercise
if puzzled
okay well i did try to UNK them UNK them to make the most of each person's individual skills
er people chose what they wanted to do
erm
i UNK
shit look joe you speak to her you sit and talking across her she's talking to sharon you know that that's all the way through it
come on alright
i love you too
erm
come on gary
erm good point she did er give them letters and she told other people to contribute she erm she at one stage ask everybody what they what the record was
er the main problem was the time constraint
there was five minutes to go
right
and we're still you know fighting about changing the script and what have you
but they did come up with the work on the results and then they did get time to plan it
right
and they UNK it as well
er although shirley she took over the ro erm she took the role half way through of down on the floor splitting things up things over er the rest of them were cutting out words and what have you and writing out the script the way they wanted it and she just stuck them on the floor and they changed the script so in that respect she was
they changed the script once
yes no i mean
it depends how you
ah no but you but you weren't aware of that because you were on the floor as i was saying five minutes ago
i don't want all that over here
erm i mean all in all they did they did get the final result the scene came together right from the last eleven minutes to achieve the result but it was just there was a lot of confusion at the beginning of the start
right okay well thanks very much if you'd like to get tables back
is there a pair of UNK anywhere
a pair of UNK
yes
well quite an interesting exercise i think
i hope you're not well several interesting things have come out of there it just shows the sort of thing about working under pressure and the limited amount of time erm the limited amount of planning time for the managers certainly
erm if the man who were the managers
ian you were one and tracy if you could just say a few words
what did you find were the difficulties and how did it go really
erm i thought mine when i came back and i briefed everybody so that they all knew what was going on
yes
erm then i think it probably had us confused for a while whilst we were just trying to decide who should do writing and who should do what but then i decided i'd chose two people and then we started cutting things out so then that went okay then
erm then we all just worked at getting pieces out on paper all that was going fine and then i assigned two more people to stick all the pieces together and trying to create sentences from it and i think the only time that i we lost it was like right at the end we were like looking for a few words to make our sentences make sense
and so we were UNK a bit because we were just trying to get there but apart from that i think it went okay
like we didn't have any arguments amongst the group i mean i was everybody was quite willing to do everything everybody was helpful came up with suggestions
so it was okay
okay what about you ian
no go on
what did you think we actually got on very well i mean i thought we worked quite well together as a team
we did yes
yes
we erm given that you have to do okay i didn't brief them as fully as i could of and half way through i looked at it again just to make sure i hadn't missed the bottom line that said you know stand on your head instead in the park so i just had a little read
and we made within two minutes to sort out what we were going to or we decided what charity first then we decided two would decide on the script while the others cut out relevant pieces that we thought might be useful words
and then when the sc we had a look at the script and we changed it a little bit and then we all went they were cutting out words so we were doing the first few all three ways and we'd look and say okay so it was a UNK mess as we all looked through for three words and ended up with and i got down on the floor so we knew where we were
and then we changed things like the name because we found somebody's name in all these words somebody and we just UNK it down and at the end when we were running out of time and we did about three times have a look at the time we did change the script slightly to fit the words that we'd found so we had responsibilities instead of i don't know what it was but instead of another words just because we'd found it
and we just changed it again
but once i think we were we were going in a mad rush er each saw his responsibilities for that word and that'll do and then we'd say yes and stuck it here
in terms of managing the time did you feel it worked quite well
yes i mean we got the end result
yes
okay we changed a few words just to fit the words we could find but yes we had about a minute at the end we read it through and yes it was fine
i thought we worked alright together
okay
sorry can i just make one small comment on that
pardon
can i just
you did actually again it's the time thing yes
originally you weren't really looking at it five of you all fell into the same trap you know they get half way through and they did have something to do and they did sort of start rushing
okay then let's leave that there and then talked about that at tea and you can have a talk about it then
come on ian
well i have to admit with our group the first ten minutes or was a little bit UNK because i felt we i came in we set down the objects i felt we did that well and we were clear of the timescale from the very beginning
we decided quite soon which charity we were going to go for and we divided up
i mean i had tony to go through and find key words that we knew we were going to need you know simple words like the of with a that sort of thing that we knew that okay we wouldn't use immediately but we'd look ah there that goes there and use it straight away
erm we set tasks that erm two people were supposed to be working on the script while two people looked through the paper
now i think what te what happened there was we er we UNK away from setting down sc er scripts to finding good useful key words and phrases out of the paper that we could then fit into the script and as it had gone that way i realised it was working and didn't see any point in trying to get it back to the way it was originally going because it was going fine
erm we had an example advert early on that we actually read through for the simple reason of finding how long it was going to take so we had a target as to how long we needed the advert to be very early on and we could work to that
erm we carried on er it got better as it went on
tony wasn't impressed a little bit but a little a little UNK up and we were away again
erm i felt that er we had plenty of time at the end i mean we tried only three times to get it right and it was okay and i felt we worked well as a team in that amount of time
alright well generally then i think from hearing what you're saying erm some good points some perhaps things that you'd do differently next time and then what it obviously says about you is that you're all managers and you all have different styles and you possibly do things in different ways
and you've been in a scenario where there's one manager and there's a few people who aren't in a managing role but you are actually managers maybe they'd like a little UNK i mean i think some good things have come out of that and possibly things that you'd do better next time
we all achieved the target
yes you all did really well
yes thank you stephen
yes perhaps you'd
we all achieved the end result
everyone's just trying the same situation
and they thought
yes patches of chaos possibly in the UNK but you got there in the end
erm i think what we'll do now is have a quick cup of tea a nice friendly UNK cup of tea
and then i want you to meet i want you to be back here by quarter to four
it's called time it gives you a little space at the top so you can fill in what you feel to be your role and if you can fill below all the tasks in respective order that you do in a typical day
right so a complete UNK and we'll start again and we'll come back to those in a little while
we're going to spend the rest of the session on time management
we're going to talk about three methods of managing your time
the first of those is delegation a much talked about subject
erm how many of you delegate
yes
yes the vast majority
how do you go about that and what sort of things do you delegate
i look at all the jobs that's got that have to be done in the day right and look at which ones i should do and then all the other jobs i just share out between the relevant people
right is there any kind of pattern to that or is it on a daily basis that you do that
no certain things certain specific jobs are set to certain people
such as
that are on going
one of my senior section manager does till results anything to do with till results my section manager does UNK
another section manager does something else and they do that every week
okay does that and you find that works well
mm very well
er what kind of checks to do have do you have to keep on that
about once every week i'll check that everything's been done
well with the UNK obviously it's checked every day but erm things like till results i check every week to make sure it's been if she's been but she's really good so i just have to check up
what they did at a branch on our district erm again it was just like set up people were given specific tasks but at the end of the three month cycle they'd change some people er those people's tasks so that they so they wouldn't get UNK and plus if one person was off if you happened to be on holiday you've got somebody else that can do the job at the standard and not let the standard fall
so you're not just UNK on one person and if that person's away you're stuck
anybody else delegate
delegates
i think everybody does throughout the course of the day without even UNK anyway do they
certainly the only go the only way i run a shift the way she runs UNK is erm by going you it's the same thing every day you've got to run through everything on the same point order because you know you've been doing it it's got to be done at the same time like bread the last lot's got to be on by four
erm so you it's one of the second third things to look at when i start at three fifteen it's the third thing i do
the first thing i do is check the stocks followed by date returns and er you know erm get that done out of the way and start looking at the of the night and what have you setting that up and maybe the late night process hand over from the branch manager walk round doing any detail he wants me to do and hand over from late nights
department managers new UNK do all the bits and pieces on and wanted me to do while i wait for the shift to come in and they start at seven
er keep an eye on them i'll have a bit of UNK here and then erm so he's until eight o'clock and then you get everything pulled out
erm UNK until ten o'clock er get the warehouse get the clear out UNK
so where do you actually delegate within that
to the er because there's no other management in the place you just delegate to another member of staff
and is that er do you have one person that you allocate specific tasks or do you go on a daily basis
er it's like it's like the foreman on the UNK for some reason there's a er in the systems or whatever er the UNK er the night UNK er when he takes over he knows what he's doing he knows what i want because i've spoken to him about it erm he knows what items i want to leave for stock people erm and sue the UNK manager she'll know if i want extra people on the UNK because we're quiet or i expect it to be quiet erm she knows where they've got to be and i'll come back and review it with her
okay anybody else delegate
yes well how do you do it teddy
well it's you go in the morning and it's the same jobs every day really basically
erm the i first tell people what to do because they all know their roles and when you go in the morning and you're just basically going round checking that they've already done it all
okay
erm if there's something needs doing extra you just ask the person who's best for the job to sort it out and to do it for you
so your role is more a checking and writing one similar to what helen
yes well with the staff i've got yes they're all there
at night times i've got my jobs to get stuck into on the UNK as well just hope that everybody works as a strong team basically
yes does anybody here not delegate
i did delegate but i won't do it now i do literally
say that again i missed that
er i sorry just clearing my throat er i did i did delegate if somebody put it on the end of somebody's assignment then i to it but i tend to find i UNK what people can do for me all the time and don't identify just how much those people can give me back and i did or i do have a tendency at times to give people like before to hold on too much try and do too much myself and er you can't do it that way in case
but once you've got to know your people better develop your people better
right
it's something i've got to work on
to decide for yourself what they're capable of
why does anybody else find difficulty with UNK
no i was just going to say that if you try it once you know you know if they can do it they'll be
oh yes
i was going to say i like to set somebody task as they're down for and i look for it and nine times out of ten you'll find out if they can achieve that very shortly very fast
and if they cannae cope with it they'll come to or the majority will come and say look i cannae do it
if it's something silly that they haven't been trained for but most jobs you can delegate and they'll do it just as well as you
it's just a matter of having confidence in them to do that
since norwich you just can't delegate like erm you just ha you don't have any other management there only section managers and you delegate that job to er supervisors erm it's a very on hands management situation
you can delegate to anybody can't you
you can delegate your staff as well
yes fair enough but erm
depending on the task it depends what the job is
yes i mean like i mean making late payments i'm UNK people to fill up those late payment
okay it's delegation but it's not erm the sort of like a responsible job if you see what i mean it's a job that they're employed to do anyway but it's not a separate sort of task
yes okay
what's the difference between UNK and UNK
delegate erm you can delegate the job but you can't delegate the responsibility
right so when you delegate what are you UNK
specific tasks the physical
but when you delegate that task is there anything that you retain
the responsibility that it's being done right
right and who is ultimately accountable
yourself
yes right okay
when we're talking about UNK tasks i think tasks can be almost UNK into two clear sections
has anybody heard about how tasks can be UNK
i think they mentioned it on the video
urgent and important
right then there's that which we're going to come onto in a minute
it's active isn't it instead of reactive
reactive yes
can you erm explain what a reactive task is tracy
it's something you haven't got planned into your day isn't it it's something that comes up and you have to respond to it so you have to have time between the day to be able to do those things
okay can you give an example
erm it's like to keep my day planned out but like the district manager might walk in or people might go off sick and then you have to fill somebody in to that position
things that you just don't think are going to happen
so you act
especially management goes down ill or something
okay so they're unexpected can you thing of any er another kind of way of erm other tasks that possibly could be described as reactive tasks
i've got customer experience
pardon
customer experience
so you've got customer query or something like that
yes
the bakery and you're expecting a delivery especially like on produce and then you have to go off or something like that get people UNK right up
okay what about erm if the opposite i mean if we've got reactive tasks what's the opposite of that
UNK
UNK or possibly just active
and how would you describe an active task
something you do every day anyway
right so they're regular
regular yes
what do they do for your department
i mean that can you think of examples of active tasks
cleaning checks
till checks right interesting that you should say that
erm just filling up shelves
yes interesting you should say that because the definition i had was something quite the reverse
many of these are planned for isn't it you might do it every day but you've planned for it
right
so you you'll be able to do it every monday but you've planned for it on monday you know who's going to do it and they you know it's set up
okay so it's something right
the way i would possibly define active and reactive i would see active as things that actually take your department forward a step
they are things that you do which actually improve your department both in the short and in the long term
the long term specifically
things like okay ordering possibly could be reactive and active because yes it's something that has to be done every day but if your order in spot on that is an active task it would improve and benefit to your you would say that
whereas reactive i think one typical task that's a reactive task which is yes it's unexpected or whatever is cardboard collecting because it's the type of thing that happens regularly but it doesn't actually get your department it doesn't
it doesn't achieve anything
no in a day you do now then later you've got to do it again
it's one of those UNK tasks
yes i mean can you think of any i mean putting that kind of interpretation on it can you think of anything else other than cardboard collecting
UNK the cabinets dressing them down
UNK
