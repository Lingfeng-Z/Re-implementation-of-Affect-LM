do you often find yourself doing these tasks
all day long
all day long right
and most of the night
one i think one of the tasks that you find branch managers doing on a fairly regular basis is collecting cardboard
what
some of them do
my branch manager does it all the time
yes my branch manager does it all the time yes it's his regular way out
it's UNK
UNK exactly you've hit the nail on the head there UNK
it's a comfort blanket that's what it is when you see your branch manager collecting cardboard it's usually because he's feeling a bit stressed out
no it's just because he's lazy
it could be just because he's lazy
alright what about when you mentioned as well we've got reactive and we've got active tasks
what about you said something about somebody mentioned important and urgent tasks
who said that
i did
yes what do you see as those being
well urgent tasks would be tasks that are done at that time to complete them
so urgent equals time
equals time limit
limit and i mean urgent is now isn't it
yes
it's to be done a s a p
what about important
important it has to be done but it's not as it's not as important as the urgent
is that is that right what do the rest of think
no it needs to be done but it's something that
it needs to be done but do you know what i mean if you don't your important things on time they become urgent
yes
no because things come up UNK so things will become urgent that maybe you didn't think were important but have just suddenly emerged
do you know what i mean
unexpected things that emerging you have to do there and then like
the whole day's important isn't it
the whole day's important
yes everything a lot of things are important and what you're saying is true alex that if you do the important things when you should do them they won't become urgent but equally what tracy says is that is true is that you will get unexpected things UNK up where you have to drop everything
i tell what is urgent is a message coming down to you you've had a delivery team they're going to destroy cases of whatever so that's urgent that has to be done there and then because it's a danger to the public or whatever
so that's important
and then you've got UNK
how long i mean how in terms of in terms of time that you spend on urgent or important tasks how long do you think an urgent task may take
not long not very long
so it's relatively short
and what about important
you might take your time on that more time
so it could be something that's rather time consuming
can things be both urgent and important
what can you think of that possibly is
well your could be important first thing in the morning today as you're UNK into doing other things then it becomes urgent doesn't it if you've had to UNK your and whatever
right
what i'd like you to do is to have a look at your time one and first of all see notes down on it make a note beside each task that you've got on there whether it's active or reactive
bearing in mind that active are things that take your time forward in the long term reactive are things like scale checks you know you're daily fairly UNK tasks like that
aren't some of them both
sorry
aren't some of them both
er that's a possibility yes
you know you could say these scale checks they're but they're still urgent to be done
the they're still they're not active in that they don't actually progress your department do they
if your scales are wrong you're not progressing are you
no but we're not we're not arguing that they're not working
just UNK them as being reactive and active by them
totally UNK
it tends to be the case that when a task is identified as being reactive you can usually delegate it down because it's very it's a UNK everyday task it doesn't actually move the department forward
it's not strictly a managerial task
has anybody got any reactive tasks on their lists
yes
yes
well shout out a few
not as many as active though because you could say that stock checks and checks are reactive because you're doing it every day but stock checks move the department forward on your stock reports
right
but you could delegate it down couldn't you
i mean i would say the UNK of that and trying to improve your stock results erm as a key result area is the active part of it but the actual everyday doing those checks you can delegate that down
so reactive you delegate down
i would have said in the in the large part
why have you got any down there
UNK a UNK part of if i wanted to do anything i'd take a leaf out of i would say is that but i delegate down through the butchers
cutting meat
do you like it
yes
would you say that cutting meat and getting it on the shelf every day takes your department forward
yes
it's just an everyday task
i would agree with you yes
an everyday task is something that you have to do every day so
no i'd agree with you because to me pricing is active or whatever it is
you couldn't wait
that's priority that's got to be
no it isn't because it's a day to day activity
yes but it's all based down on cutting more
what you've done is there you've done your cutting programme and then you delegate yes but the actual cutting give that to the butchers
yes
so the UNK the bit that you do and then to them basically just cutting it while it's still down you were still the awkward thing is
both
which bit are you doing UNK you do the actual you plan the what did you call it
the
the cutting programme
the cutting programme and you cut the meat
i cut the meat yes
but do you cut meat
yes friday and saturday i do
but why
delegate to someone else
because we haven't got the staff to do it
right
it's the same for the provisions manager they have the same kind of thing isn't it
but it could be delegated
cut meat brings my department forward and if i don't cut that meat and don't build up slowly upwards therefore my department's going to stand still isn't it
what do the rest of you think
i agree with him i agree
i mean do you think that the actual cutting of the meat should be a managerial task
no
no i don't but who else is going to do it if i don't do it
yes i agreed
okay we've got two issues here
if you've got a situation where you're the only person around well yes obviously you're going to have to do it and you can't you're not in a position where you're able to delegate
but i would have said that something like cutting meat if you've got butchers around it's not something that you would be you should be spending your time doing
that is normal it happens all the time
you if you had something more to do you wouldn't be cutting meat though
i'd rather be on sundays cutting meat UNK meat packing meat and doing the same for everybody else
yes there's a situation where you get
there's nobody else there
yes but we we're talking about the days when you do have other people available what would you spend your time doing
cutting meat
that excuses my question like you're going down your priorities you take and in the low branches we still have the same old jobs to do there's the UNK x thousands of pounds
yes oh no i agree with that but when you're cutting the meat what are your butchers doing
my butchers are not there
no but we're talking about the days when your butchers are there
what am i doing then i'm filling the shelves
what does the rest of you think
think they like cutting meat isn't taking his department forward it's an everyday activity
if he took more staff on and they were say filling up provisions putting the pies out every day is taking the department forward it's an everyday task
order it correctly in the first place
right
if the manager's department
if you order it correctly then your staff can function on a daily basis
it's when you don't order it correctly it's when you go wrong
if you get your books right it'll all happen on the UNK
say that again
if you get your books right it'll all happen out on the UNK all the manager has to do
because that's what you're expecting them to do
yes but that's not what a regional manager's supposed to do
a regional manager spends more time you know okay it's a little bit longer i deal with more lines than you the pressure is far you know every branch manager i know the guy's got to believe that they'll get staff from somewhere it's just as long as they get the order in and the availability right
does anybody else have reactive tasks on their list
i've had during the week which are UNK that sort of thing
which tasks do you have UNK
thing like checking UNK through the post and things like that
so a lot of mine are reactive because i just haven't got any staff
no but if you had the staff i mean we're talking about a hypothetical situation would you still try doing that
no i'd give that up any day
okay does anybody find themselves doing reactive tasks when possibly they do have the staff
yes
there are certain things like active that i actually do throughout the branch as well
i mean i could quite easily delegate it out but i can't because it's a management function so i've got to be the one that's got to walk round the branch for half an hour taking twelve blocks off checking all the sealed
so that's actually within procedure that you have to do that
yes it is
okay so that's obviously you're then able to delegate
i think you're often asked to do reactive tasks when i've done all my tasks you know i've got all my staff doing this and then i've got to help down on the UNK and it's not that i'm doing something that i'm you know i should be doing as a manager it's that i've done all of mine and i'm going out to give them a hand
if i had if i had more pressing tasks personally i wouldn't be doing it
yes
i think erm shifts differ slightly through other departments in the sense that it is only there for one day
the only thing that you can really do to take yourself forwards in a shift situation is your UNK for the following week
you know er right look at previous weeks with you know er branch to mind the er the account for the kind of day is er the account is probably pretty much the same as it was the previous week
there's very little chance of it catching UNK
er but i mean everything you do is designed to set yourself up in the best possible position for when the staff come in and throughout the shift leaving it as best you can for the branch manager the next day
it it's all reactive to that day in that there's very little in carrying you forward
yes some of the departments some department managers i think have more erm their goals tend to be more short term possibly than longer term
yes the same thing is like erm if i do the rest of the shop for the rest of the d that day but i do goods the next night erm that UNK okay for the next day and it's only like on a one day basis
mm yes okay
so active is a job that gets done on a daily basis every day
no
no not necessarily no an active task is something that takes your department forward actively UNK the way your department runs which could be something like
monday thirtieth may nineteen eighty three
you've forty one years past service in the lighthouse board george
yes that's correct
i was forty one years and several months in the lighthouse service
now could you differentiate between the various types of UNK
well there's a lot of there's the land stations which are near towns or and then there's the UNK there were the island stations and then the rock stations
island stations the families were on them
all the families were on for except the three weeks holiday during the year they were UNK on these islands all the time
and the rock stations of course there were various types of rocks such as skerrymor and bass rock and bell rock and er quite a few rocks stations
so i think we had twelve rock stations er what we called rock stations
now how many rock stations in your forty one years did you actually serve on
er well only two er and skerrymor but i was er three year because it was called a rock station or a UNK station was a big island the island of UNK seven miles long when the sea wasn't near the tower at all but er and skerrymor the sea was UNK round the towers all the time
now what is the precise location of skerrymor
well it's about er twelve miles from UNK and er about er three hours UNK from UNK where the relief boat was the relief ship
and when were you actually stationed on skerrymor
er from nineteen er forty eight to nineteen fifty one
three years
can you describe the actual lighthouse
well the tower is er i'm not quite sure about the exact height of it it's i think it's a hundred and over a hundred and fifty feet high er the to the top of the UNK i think it's a hundred and fifty three feet high to the top of the UNK
and er the tower is solid for forty feet from the rock
er i don't know how deep it is going in the base in the foundation i think it's about twenty feet to the foundation
and every stone in that building UNK about a ton and it's er each stone is UNK into the next stone and right into the centre it's no lot of er solid buildings are just a UNK of er stone and then UNK in between you know but this is solid right down to the centre to the UNK in the centre
and that's solid for forty feet up
then there's er the door the door at forty feet and there's er a UNK ladder going up the forty feet you've got to climb up to get into the door
mm
i believe the walls at the foot are somewhere in the region of nineteen feet thick
they're nineteen feet thick at the door
mm
and then there's er the storm doors which are pulled in er during UNK weather and the doors are oh about six inches th each plank and it's about six inches thick
you've got to haul them in with a UNK
and these storm doors are closed when the gale is threatening heavy UNK on and there's another door inside that about eight feet inside that another heavy door and then there's another ordinary door inside that
there's three sets of doors at the at the entrance
then the bottom UNK there are two er water tanks
er take about two thousand gallons each
for fresh water
fresh water aye fresh water and er the water it comes ashore with the ship you know and UNK
mm
up in UNK in seven UNK up by a UNK
er that was when i was there but now it's pumped ashore with well by hose from the ship you know and er they put water in about once or twice a year
can you recall the layout of the living quarters etcetera
yeah well er there as i said the first er UNK after at the door is the water tanks
mm
two water tanks
the next UNK is where they have ten tons of coal in er UNK
and the next er UNK is the is the UNK where er the food is er kept
the next UNK is a workshop a UNK and various tools there
next is the kitchen or their living room
the next is a flight of UNK er flat of bedrooms two bedrooms two UNK in each bedroom
and the UNK another the next flat is er also two bedrooms and er next er flat again is the library which was a magnificent room
er it was the whole s tower from the from the er the coal cellar
it was actually lined in oak right up to the to the light room
most of the stations are lined in pitched UNK but this is lined in beautiful oak and oak UNK and er
then after the well there's er the library as they called it was lined with books leather bound books great big kidney shaped oak table and beautiful chairs there and we used it as the office you know for the principal keeper did his returns and all the rest of it there
and er then er after that there was the gun room or the magazine where they stored the UNK for the gun and er then the light room
and the light room the machine case where the machine for UNK the five the lens which er weighed about five tons and there were this machine UNK the lens and it was machine was solid brass erm just which had to be polished e every week and er oh beautiful brass polished brass and nobody ever saw these things you know except maybe the commissioners when they came round no visitors there
you were stationed there in nineteen forty five
nineteen forty five yes
and that was your first UNK as a principal
a principal keeper yes that's correct
what were your er UNK of the station the lighthouse at that time
well i was after coming off and er i was quite used to the rocks you know that type of er station so
but er well it's nothing really important about the UNK there
mm
er it was i really don't think of anything outstanding
say on the subject of shipping at that time
can you recall the type of vessels
oh the vessels they were quite well out from us
er they er in the days of sailing ships of course they were they were really they were it was really a dangerous place
cos if they were beating against the wind and there were three wild UNK about three miles off
there was er the who was called after a UNK who invented some type of UNK and er the UNK who was one of the engineers did the building of skerrymor one of the surveyors or something
and then the er UNK which of course the famous light one of the famous lighthouse engineers
the three UNK oh well they were very dangerous UNK
you could just see them at low water and er that was one of the danger points but i've never seen ships coming close to skerrymor at all
but when i was there were once one instant is er the man on watch in the morning he spotted a floating mine come in right down to close to the rock and er it UNK just about er a quarter of a mile or maybe two hundred yards off the rock off the tower and er of well when a mine UNK of course it becomes er alive
when it was floating of course the when the an when it holds it pulls the UNK something to do with a UNK with er with the mechanism of it er
so it was swinging back and forth almost coming to the rock and we thought well if that mine goes off that's the end of it
and of course i er UNK the office headquarters in edinburgh told them about this so they sent a mine UNK out from UNK
there were some mine UNK still floating about there
and er they went into instead of coming to skerrymor and said there was no mine there and they turned back to UNK again
and we were left with a mine there
and obvious phoned er UNK to said their ship was we never saw it of course
went twelve miles from us to
er some UNK aboard that boat
so then er one morning the there was a very heavy UNK on and the anchor must have given way and it w we saw the mine floating away towards UNK so where it went after that we never heard
thank goodness for that
aye
how many keepers george were stationed at skerrymor in your day
er four keepers
there were three men on the rock and one man ashore
and every second month they the occasional keeper the UNK keeper came out local man he came out to make up the two men then went ashore to cover the cover the UNK like that
mm
and where was the actual relief station
the relief station was at UNK
but originally it was er for skerrymor was in UNK and when er was built they changed the they took the keepers from skerrymor to UNK
mm
so there's two the keepers from the both rocks were in stationed in ashore at UNK
and is another lighthouse out from UNK
out from UNK it's about twelve miles from UNK
mm
now one UNK i believe it was the foreman UNK involved in the building of skerrymor described the landing on the rock as being like climbing up the side of a bottle
yes i heard of that but i er i think it was sir walter UNK actually that said that
but er yes it was it could be and there was a blow hole there as well
they sent a fountain of er water right up into the air
now of course they were UNK with this water UNK water coming from this blow hole
but that was er they put a charge in that and years afterwards and of course
the blow hole was still there when i was there and you see UNK of water coming out of it
but nothing like what was originally when they were building the tower
can you describe the actual landing process for supplies and men
well there was a UNK er which was about er oh about er thirty five yards long out to a reef
and there were pillars going out from it to the rocks er UNK into the rocks
this is a form of UNK
just a form of UNK just a UNK which is a form of UNK and we put a UNK up on the end of it
and when the sh when the relief came in the ship lay about a mile off the never came near the rock at all because it was just a mass of UNK you know and the ship lay about a mile off and then the launch came in with a crew of about half a dozen men and the officer the second mate usually in charge
and then about quarter of a mile off the UNK they drop their UNK their anchor and they came in then and then there were two ropes er thrown to them then
the anchor rope was and the and the breast called the breast rope and then there's a rope from us on each er the bow and the UNK
and it was very poor holding ground and there was a man on the anchor rope or there was a man on the three ropes on the crews on the three ropes
and er when the anchor man always had his hand on the rope you know and you'd hear him saying anchor coming home sir anchor coming home sir
and the engine man he was on his knees beside the engine the engine was sticking over and the officer was in charge watching when we was watching the boat coming towards the UNK you know
then you'd hear him shouting let go and the two men let go of the two ropes on the UNK and the engine man was shot out and went back and picked up the anchor and UNK it and sometimes UNK two or three times during the relief
is there not something of a permanent UNK running in that vicinity
yes on the west side of the rock there's a permanent UNK running there
there's one small landing you can er you can do in the in the west landing they called it
er they you can very fine day you can make a relief there
if there was a UNK on the east side where the UNK but there was also a UNK landing which you get into the UNK but it had to be a very fine day to get into the UNK and there was a UNK there er you could a crane there that you could take everything out of the boat but it had to be a very fine day to get into the UNK
tell us something about the provisions in your day
in my day well every man had an allowance er and we bought our own provisions but every man er they were supposed to be by the commissioners but you got i think seven and six pence a day each man got seven and six pence and we UNK that money together and bought our provisions er like that
but there was three months er commissioners put three months supply of what they called iron UNK onto the rock
er a bowl of flour and er and er so many UNK of bully beef and er i think that was about all they supplied er which wasn't taken
but we if we used a tin of bully beef we had to supply that tin of bully beef out of our own seven and six pence
we used the flour because the flour would go bad then we had to supply that the commissioners put it in originally but we had to keep it going out of our seven and a UNK
and er then but oh we kept er quite a good food to ourselves
did the keepers receive an additional sum UNK danger money
oh yes you got er i think it was about er about twenty pounds a year we got er for er r rock allowance they called it
over and above the seven and six pence a day
can you recall in the past years the keepers ever receiving beer or whisky allowance
oh no they got no whisky but they got er UNK be when the rocks were started first when the commissioners started the rocks first the bell rock was the first
and er then skerrymor and then you had there was erm a supply of beer er allowed to each rock
each man got a UNK of b was allowed a UNK of beer a day
and there then this was UNK in they gave this beer to keep for lack of exercise keep them regular
and er then in nineteen sixteen er beer was getting UNK and UNK of course and commissioners decided to stop the beer and stop the beer and er increase the UNK salts in the medicine chest double the UNK salts in the medicine chest
and did you ever hear of UNK building up amongst the men
oh yes very often UNK building up among the men
and i never had any problem at all when i was there but some of the keepers had
er i remember one fellow er i think i can safely mention them now but they're both dead anyway
two first cousins from the UNK area and er their grandfather left a croft to the youngest son and these two first cousins were on the rock on skerrymor and er the principal keeper he was an orkney man
he UNK sometime during the night and he heard this UNK up in the in the light room
he went up and here there's two first cousins were fighting about the croft and that was left about fifty years before then started fighting about it and one had got transferred to and that kept it quiet
UNK there were many occasions night and day when a UNK was raging outside
now what was it like to be actually in the tower itself
you never thought anything about it at all
you knew the UNK were hitting the tower but you had great faith in the stability of the tower
you never gave it a slightest thought
was there a problem with communications to one another
not when i was there of course it was er it was er radio was there you know and we called up the shore station at UNK at nine o'clock one o'clock and five o'clock every day unless there was er a fault in the radio which we were usually able to overcome
and the noise of the sea itself how was that affected
oh it could be never bothered er
well i've seen er the it's receiving er message and suddenly the message cutting out the sea going right over the aerial
and er the aerial was out the window and up the side of the tower
the sea hitting that was about fifty sixty feet up
and the sea hitting it there and cutting out you know and then of course when the sea went off you established communication again
what pressure of er water might be hitting the base of the tower
well er they er took tests both there and at and the er the in summer UNK the pressure was three tons to a square foot and in winter UNK six tons to a square foot
so that is pretty UNK you know when but of course it was dispersed round the tower you know it didn't hit in one lump you know
was there an actual UNK in the tower itself
oh yes there was an actual UNK in the tower
you could you couldn't feel it if you're standing on the middle of the floor but when you went up to the UNK with your chest on the UNK you could feel the tower swinging away back from you i don't know what er distance probably maybe twelve inches maybe more i don't know
but you could feel the UNK of the tower when in a in a heavy gale of wind
not the UNK not from the UNK
when the sea struck it was terrific you know the whole tower UNK and you'd think a giant got a hold of her and UNK the whole thing up
but when there was a strong gale of wind er the er tower UNK a lot
i recall reading that i think it possibly was skerrymor or UNK but it was stated that the UNK clock actually stopped
yes that was on skerrymor on skerrymor that was a swing
is that a fairly common phenomenon
oh yes quite common the UNK clock stops quite often used to stop quite often with the wind
and they're no UNK there now but they were there when i was there
oh i've often seen the clock stopping
and were there things coming of the walls for instance
no never
mm
we never had anything on the walls anyway
i see
now we haven't mentioned the affect of fog
in your days on skerrymor in the mid forties there would not be a UNK
no UNK but it was an UNK form of signal station
er we had er UNK a quarter of a pound in each UNK and er there was a UNK what we called the gun going right up
it was geared on the top of the UNK and er it was really er a UNK tubes you know
and they were then there was an electric cable coming from the top with two UNK in the top and this cable came right down into the into the UNK door
and you attached this quarter pound of to it then you UNK it back up and there was a clock in the light room which struck every five minutes and every time the clock struck you fired the charge
and that er UNK charge could be heard sometimes at thirty miles away
and some times the ship would be come in quite close to us and couldn't hear anything
of course it's the same thing with the UNK
er sound is very difficult you know like that to your never quite sure the way it goes
was this not something of a fire hazard
no the i don't think so
but have you ever heard of UNK style lighthouse f fires
well er the skerrymor went on fire after i left it
er about er what would it be about six or seven years after i left skerrymor it went on fire
they but they don't know what caused that fire er they reckon it was an electrical fault from the generator that er supplied the it was a s a fifty UNK bulb in each room and there was mainly for the radio
a little stewart UNK engine er two or three about five horse power or something
and it was on the UNK in a in a porch on the UNK to prevent fire so it wouldn't go on fire
petrol engine and it er what caused that fire this night in skerrymor they don't know
the man wasn't watching the light room he saw smoke coming up under the so he went away down and there was a fire in a in the er in the library
and er of course he UNK the other two fellows and there were no fighting there was only about two little fire UNK on the tower
and er there were well they had to get water up from the from the bottom t ladder in UNK and three men er with UNK trying to and of course they couldn't fight it
and they fought the fire until they were finally er had to go out of the tower altogether
and they were very fortunate it was a fine night and they were able to take UNK down among the UNK and the hole
then there was about a thousand rounds of UNK in the gun room in the magazine
that er UNK the UNK there and UNK the whole thing
and er the explosion went right out through the through the trap ladder into the light room and blew the UNK out
and er it also did a rent about i don't know what about fifteen twenty feet deep that's all it did in the wall
and er but of course the whole force of the explosion went right up in the light room
and the whole thing was UNK the whole the erm the floors in each er flat was one big circle of stone er about er it would've been about twelve

mr tommy UNK
can i ask firstly mr when you were born
august the sixth nineteen twenty nine
now was this in UNK
in UNK house er by UNK
in UNK
in UNK
that's correct
and how long were you in fact there
well up until the time i would be about eight years old when my father decided there was a change in the estate then and it was off to UNK that sir douglas and lady as she was then decided to go and wanted my father to come with him
but him being from up there and my mother also and their people were still alive which was my grandparents on both sides they were very reluctant to sort of go
but when a job came he would be wanting a UNK different shooting ground in UNK comparison to the hard rocks of UNK
mm
UNK green to the tops of ben UNK and up black mount where the UNK estate took it was it was in their estate
so therefore my father was very keen to go too
mm
and that's how we decided to go
so UNK i should safely say was my first schooling
even though i was about eight and a half
mm
now your father was the UNK at UNK is that right
yes he was the UNK at UNK
who was he employed with then
well the estate er the duke of UNK had the whole of UNK and then h general stewart who was born in UNK and worked and made his fortune if it was as you would say in canada on the c p r
canadian pacific railways and he was able to take a lot of people from the place he was born in out to canada
mm
what d'ya recall of your early days with your father at UNK
pardon
what d'ya recall of your early days at UNK with your father
well he was a very active man my word he would soon go right from the house to the top of as you would say because we had sheep then
and if he saw a sheep that shouldn't be where they were and the gentry about to come within days he would soon get them down
mm
without a UNK dog
and well i remember hearing about it and saw it probably as i grew up myself
so he was and it had it's UNK house was really a lovely place
did the did the gentry come fairly frequently to the estate
yes
oh they came up with their servants all servants up from the south by train to UNK and then a UNK or vehicle of such that was in it then because it was only metal roads we had then
but they were good metal roads that took all the traffic
well i remember at that time the steam roller that was just doing the road outside UNK house and UNK the day i was trying to get on it with a very good friend of ours that's now dead
a hugh
no relation but a great friend of ours
he was a steam roller driver
mm
and were the gentry in er UNK lodge or was it UNK
no UNK lodge
that's right
UNK
that's right
and my mother er went to help them in the lodge in the season time also
fr from that time can you recall any incidents which er your father may have mentioned to you even as a young boy
well
or stories about the people that were there or
well
UNK by
ah well yes the UNK by will remember being on the road side the famous tramp
aha
the gentleman of the road
my word and me just as a little boy of eight years
i was no fear of being frightened of them because they were part of the establishment
and well did the gentry know that too
you mentioned that you were perhaps more scared of er ministers
well yeah ministers er
when i think of it nowadays and i see children so very going round to the various churches that when people used to say about ministers well
when you heard there was a minister coming i was just afraid and looking to see would you see that dark black UNK individual coming
and even that seemed a but thinking of the old tramp and he was in a sort of all UNK looking way
my word but you weren't frightened of him because you were told that he was an old man and one of the road men of the road
and there was no UNK to be taken from him
is it correct to say that the tramps actually used to make a special point of coming to see your father
oh yes
made a special point of coming there because they knew my mother would give them a bowl of soup or what was ever on
she was baking fresh scones hot cakes anything that was going
and my word they enjoyed it well
they wouldn't come in they wouldn't come into the porch even
they would sit outside wait in that days we had a seat out in the and even if was a seat for sitting outside they would sit on their own way or on a rock
no they just had their own way of life and you wouldn't change it and they had stories to my father
they would tell sing where they came from and who they saw and all the way up they came
and they would be looking for a bed for the night and it would be in the old hay shed that we would put them but there wouldn't be a problem
it was in the winter time so it was full of hay but they would be very careful and we would ask them that they had no matches in case er there was no cigarettes much and that but pipes they were pipe smokers
old clay pipes with black twist
but they would soon tell that they would have their before they would go to bed and thanks er very much when getting the bed and you could er UNK for that they would never
but the odd one yes we saw the odd one but they were very odd
aye they were very odd
y you refer to them as mile stone inspectors
mile stone inspectors and gentlemen of the road
mm
and there's a story about the late duke of UNK when he was travelling up to estate where his lodge was
there was UNK a tramp that would have taken the a nine then but this one in particular and he was very fond of him and he would ask when he was around to that he would get over to see him
and when that poor tramp UNK out on the UNK one severe winter or spring time the duke found out where it was and to this very day there's a little UNK and a stone put on it
that was the er lord of UNK i think tommy that the stone was
yes that i'm referring to yes
the lord of UNK
i cos i can't picture another stone you know on any other UNK and i've been on plenty that and i travel and no and i can never know of another st stone that was put up to a tramp
anywhere in the north as far as i know
but that one was and i heard a year ago but i never saw it till the bus driver i went with some years ago up to john UNK
mm
and going up to john UNK and right into past castle may where the queen mother has and into the church where sh where the UNK goes when they're living up in up in castle may at er well er UNK is buried there too
there's many a person UNK to my name
from these young days that you spent in UNK can you recall how the tramps actually looked
oh they
how would you describe them
erm the tramps
well UNK looking
wild looking as you would say it now
but the very opposite to what people would er th think of them as regards people now
and that's ordinary people
but they looked wild because they would have long hair UNK a and all oh my word they were wild looking but er
and probably it was cold weather they would have two or three coats er you know
and jackets probably below and their little bag of stuff
whatever they were carrying
they generally came all year round
yes oh yes generally came
ah but they always watched th they would be in some place over bad UNK you know
er you know if there was a bad storm somebody would oh you better stay here today too again and he might be there three or four days
so he would still stay there because he was told about the weather
and he would know himself
mm
you see it's not what er anybody else would say that it was good weather
he they knew that they had a great sense of the weather themselves after being out in it
did they ever mention to you or your father that they in fact got caught out by the weather
oh well sometimes yes they would be very wet when they would come
and when they would offer to no they wouldn't they would have their own way of drying it in their bags they would have another clean or you would say clothes to put on but we never ever heard of them doing a washing
mm
or whatever
well they would be UNK
it's like i better not say this but UNK over that when i when i used to work with UNK my word they was good UNK
very good friends of mine
but they would work they would never see them with UNK
they came with a good suit on and they would go to work with a suit double UNK and then and they would work there and make a lot of money and when the next thing they would do they would hit into town and get all UNK out and then that was them from top to bottom from their hat right to their feet and then they were hitting the road then
yes i could say that that's true about UNK
mm
the tramps never mentioned some of the places they were actually forced to stay whether it was under a road bridge or
oh yes they yes they would stay under a road bridge too because you would see the er if you would look a bridge and they would say oh there's a tramp there's a place there if you could tell me and you would see the rocks put up and where the bed was always above water level oh yes
mm
below the certain bridges
mm
depending how far away a house you see was and how they would be
but never two of them meet together
we you never know that
they would be always er passing
they didn't go round like that they were very UNK as you would say
and what happened say
they would never
were there ever occasions when there was one or more in your hay loft
no i don't think ever i can remember
i th well i think er there was once or something but he passed he didn't know that this er was so then they passed on
mm
you see one stayed but he was there before him and the other one carried on
no they would never they would never UNK together
mm
like UNK
no they would never
they were they were very fine people
and the tinkers that came there
mhm
er wouldn't want to but from there was there was one lot
and there were and the women folk would have their UNK and the men were tin UNK
they would make UNK and UNK like you were being requiring in your sc er UNK or in the milk house as you would keep milk there
so they were all and very UNK looking
but they had for the winter time they their houses to go to
mm
and they were just coming round in the summer
mm
and their horses and my word they fairly looked after their animals mhm
did the UNK people have any special name for the tinkers
not really no
you've never heard the term summer walker
er no i could never say that
or mystery folk or
er well
UNK
as the years came on they were beginning to get mystery fo folk but er not in my time
well that sort of people that was coming
if ones came as in little wee pi UNK we called them the little lorry things you would sort of keep your eye very much because you didn't know they were looking for scrap and if you told them you had nothing they might go away with your iron gates or something
this was during the mid thirties
oh yes i would say that yes that was coming more that way yeah
coming more that
how about the individual er tramps
did you ever have bye names for these characters
well th there was one joe UNK
er but i don't know what's that
but somebody so told me aye and i said that was a funny name or was it else's then
well i said i remember a man called joe UNK and but er oh i wouldn't er but one said oh joe UNK is very black looking
well the bugger is just coming on and he was cleaning the car down UNK her car so he says i turned the hose on him
well the hose landed on him alright but it landed on his parcel and it the whole thing fell out on the road
so there was a bit of
mm
among the few people that saw that happening
but er he was quite a character the man that did that
did you ever have an opportunity to see what the tramps actually carried with them
no well i could never say i was kept well away out of the but my father probably might have seen
mm
in his bag
well i think it would be a change it's when they're when they're when they're jacket would be wet they would have another
mm
jacket in the bag
so whatever he and if he was dumping anything oh er they would ask the father said er just er to dump that
they wouldn't be left with a whole pile of stuff or er
no oh no they or they would dump it in a place where nobody would see it you see
and when they were coming along UNK were they making for anywhere in particular
we well er see they were on their rounds and then they'd be going round by UNK and probably UNK they were just doing their circular
aye they had their places for
yes it's amazing aye
and did you have ever a chance to gain some sort of insight into their UNK
who they were in fact
where they'd come from
on some cases yes because i was always told this man he that used to come and he was so clean looking and that he was a UNK
well that er an UNK that he was trained as a UNK
as a man's UNK
but somebody er whatever he no he didn't carry anything to do that no
but that's what he's he told you
oh yes but he told somebody that he was a UNK
and you would see that they were very some of them intellectual people
mm
too and who knows how they went to the road
mm
did they fail in their exams or something or went to drink or
it's said nowadays about drink but i don't know
they were quite er learned men they weren't UNK you know
mm
so something just peculiar at that very time put them to the
did they ever do any form of casual work
s some of them did yes if they came in the UNK and then in the ar in the harvest time
yes oh some would w work but some wouldn't
er and if they would work they didn't want money for it but they would stay a while with you so that they would get their bed for the night and they would get their grub
mm
what type of work did they
well they would take in er they would er and they would put UNK potatoes you see when that was coming on that time
and they would help to lift potatoes and they would er stack corn and hay
oh yes and that's those only that would do it but you wouldn't get the ordinary man taking any he would just be on his rounds
and you wouldn't say oh i think it's going to be wet today john you better stay
not him his mind was made up on going and that was it
and were you visited by the UNK the pack man character
yes
who sold goods
oh yes er who sold
er there was one UNK that er erm i can remember of him and he had a UNK and well he had a UNK soap i suppose cos people used soap then with your UNK brush and that and proper UNK brush and UNK probably that quite
yes but i remember right a
so it was things that wasn't too heavy to carry but things that was always needed in a house and that you could run out of
when we were er were living all on the road so we were expecting to be supplied by vans
mm
and my word there was plenty of vans in them days
both getting butcher meat
what even in the thirties
yes oh yes er when we had a wee UNK van coming up from the UNK to UNK when UNK lodge you see
so these people that had little private shops in them days did well because when the people came to the UNK it all the commodities were bought to as well as them
it's not like nowadays when people has big UNK
mm
buy their stuff away down south and take it
but no they would buy it there aye
so provisions were bought fairly regularly in those days
there wasn't the same er bulk buying that you see nowadays
no there wasn't the same
but only well we would get it buy it in bulk ourselves supplied by er UNK of glasgow
mm
and it would be coming on the UNK and
up to UNK
yes to UNK yes and that same UNK would be calling in UNK and all the villages and this UNK for UNK would be going round beforehand and you would be getting a hundred weight of sugar and tea it would be in a big tea box er probably er UNK coming from UNK but you the whole or you could buy a small quarter
but oh yes you would buy all that stuff in bulk
mm
but that stuff that was in bulk but you would never er no UNK no UNK
mm
can you recall in those days tommy how people kept UNK
well er there were it was big UNK that'd be underground
if there was a big bank at the back of the house they would have a hole just dug out and er built up with UNK
mm
and therefore it was when you would go in there it was quite cool
mm
even in the summer
well UNK cool
they would they would watch where they would where they would UNK this thing out
mm
from
but yes it was UNK cool
mm
and the produce was salmon
and the UNK it was it was sort of kept as within a reason of time of course it wouldn't
but er and of course stuff was UNK
UNK
UNK of course
you buy er salt it away in barrels in boxes and work on it until it was through
now was that your father's own particular task the UNK of the UNK
oh n no really i can't say that
er we only probably did it when ourselves we got UNK beforehand on the last shooting and to keep
but no er there was so many UNK having to be shot in the winter time and it would be sent away you see
but not away what they're doing now or but it'd be sent down to their premises down in the in the shooting UNK in the south
mm
and that and to their friends
and there would be always a UNK or two cut up for to be given to the village
mm
oh yes that was one thing
i always remember that
so where did the UNK actually go to
well it well ah but ah but they never they never killed it in that quantity as they're doing it now
mm
to make money
no there was no money made of it
it was just for their for their own use
mm
and UNK of UNK that was the best part in the they would be sent away to themselves the UNK
but the other parts with the UNK and all that'd be cut up given to the and the lodge itself for the
and all the estate men first of all would get everything
and all the UNK then that was paying rent
in those days how many people were actually involved on the estate
well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair UNK
they had to keep the river UNK all flowing and if there was any UNK of rain and stones they would have to keep all the UNK in good order and they would
the UNK
yes the UNK
that's the salmon UNK
mm
you see
and they would have barriers going out so that they could so that the gentry could go out to stand on that ladies and men
to cross the
yes just yes you see
the UNK
it still on the rivers
but now it's made of UNK or concrete
mm
now and that cos that's the only thing that could stand
mhm
to the weather
but er that's the way
and the and the UNK repairing at the UNK and all the UNK round the lodge
and the gardener there was always a permanent gardener but he was he had enough to do but the estate men would be sent up to clear that
and UNK and UNK they would have themselves
all self contained
yes self contained yes
there'd be a joiner and he'd be engaged in a
ken welcome back
could you introduce er the people your team particularly as i think one of them has a different name to the label in front of them
yes i'm afraid mike UNK has been delayed in UNK for today so nigel UNK who's a member of our committee and is a deferred pensioner is taking his place and les taylor is the secretary of our maxwell pension action group
and you are ken UNK
i am ken UNK i am the chairman of the group
ken we've you've given us er a document in re response to er the good committee and your views and so on
we've got a number of questions we want to ask you because er though you're UNK to all of our erm activities in this enquiry we are also looking to a report which is hopefully going to be influenced the bill the government brings forward
so we will er if we may er not ask you to introduce your document we we'd like to get on with the questioning
if at the end you feel there are points we haven't covered and i forget to invite you would you say you would like to make a UNK statement
yes by all means
very good
jimmy
well ken obviously everybody was UNK regarding this national scandal of the maxwell er pension fraud that er the committee who were making enquiries obviously were implementing the fact that we should have a report and UNK was set up and the recommendations that have been laid down as far as UNK is concerned in order to strengthen the pension scheme so that these UNK can happen again now have you read the report
yeah i've read i don't think i've read every thousand pages of it but i've done quite a lot of it yes
mm having read the report and possibly being on the end of the complaints from the pensioners in the maxwell fraud er what was your view regarding the proposals that are being made
well we feel that there's it's obviously quite a lot of points that are very good in the report but we really feel that it's concentrated very much on the administration of pension schemes rather than security and i think that whilst if everything that everyone of his recommendations had been law i think it would have made it more difficult for maxwell but i don't think it would have made in impossible for maxwell and i think that what th what we see the problem is that in many ways the maxwell problem was brought about by two major factors i think
one was the failure of the self regulatory body i m r o and the second one was really the fact that he was able to change his financial year end from april ninety one to december ninety one and during that period he was able to do things with those erm those funds in his accounts and er and really there was there was no check on that and i don't see that the that was in er good would have changed much of that situation at that end
it would have made it more difficult but the way that maxwell used to involve himself in bulk transfers you know and move two hundred pensioners from there to there and er no money followed and this sort of thing i think that er that he could of quite frankly done exactly the same thing and we really feel that the that the role of the pension regulator and the and the opposing role with i m r o that you really if we're not careful we're going to put in another layer of bureaucracy and have a pension regulator who's got the task of checking a hundred and twenty eight thousand pension funds when really there's probably out of those a hundred and twenty eight thousand ninety nine point five per cent of probably being very well run and quite safe and what we can't really see in the report is a is a method of identifying the determined UNK at a at a very early stage you know and we're just terribly disappointed that er that good has just thrown the whole of the matter back at i m r o who we feel have proved to tha that i don't think they're up to the task i think that the that the whole question of er of the power of a self regulatory body which to us works on blowing the whistle you know the whole the whole effect of a self regulatory body is that it's members that it it's really like a club isn't it you know and we're all members of this club and if one of us er is gonna do something wrong then the rest of us are gonna have to pay for it
well in the in the question of i m r o as far as it's erm occupational pension scheme members are concerned er there's no there's no compensation responsibility and i think that means that you get no whistle blowing and in i mean there's we've got i mean one of the points that we heard of just last evening was that one of the of the banks involved ended up er in its arrangements with maxwell of asking for a hundred and sixty per cent of shares for every hundred per cent of loans that it made to maxwell
now to me that means that city organisation must have been very doubtful about the whole future of the maxwell organisation when it was getting to that stage and if one looks through the through the UNK you know which now number about the same number of pages as the as the good report you know you will get an er a feeling of what maxwell was doing and how that was all being happened and with leaving all of that with i m r o we just don't think it's going to er we don't think it would have saved the position
ken
well i think if i m r o i think if i m r o members had a UNK a compensation responsibility or er then i feel that the members would have would have would have allowed certain things to happen
i mean when one starts to scratch the surface let me just give one example i mean we feel er i m r o fails on its membership i mean the fact that you had UNK investment management which was the beneficial owner was an organisation in UNK
now i m r o asked er we understand for the be the management of that organisation to give accounts for that for the c for the senior company to i m r o prior to its membership about a i think was about eight working days before i m r o approved that membership
we we've asked i m r o if they actually got those accounts and what they learnt from the er from the UNK company and they've told us they can't they can't tell us it's er it's private correspondence
can we actually pause there cos you've done a good bit of digging on that one
er david UNK on this very i come back to you
ken erm y you've asked some questions i've actually seen the i m r o letter and can i say that there are two questions in the i m r o letter to mr maxwell and UNK which quite UNK asked for accounts and also details of the ownership structure coming out of UNK
i haven't seen the re final reply that went from er the maxwell organisation to er i m r o but i did see a draft reply
the draft reply contained one threat to report i m r o to the UNK and investment board for excessive enquiries er and for an unreasonable attitude and the other er bit of the reply was effectively a form of covering up presenting full financial information and UNK to i m r o those replies were drafted by people inside the maxwell organisation and you may want to comment on er the position although i should stress at this stage that i like you have not seen the final version of any reply and i do not know whether i m r o UNK
what we do know is that i m r o asked for this information in june nineteen eighty eight and not long afterwards i m r o granted recognition to b i m and other maxwell companies all the more surprising perhaps having raised the questions whether the question must come about did they continue with their investigation or did they let the matter drop and perhaps you might to comment in that context
well i think we can all i mean i think just the fact that they were asking those questions i think literally days before they gave the approval worries me
ken but asking the question is rather good isn't it
oh asking the questions is fine
cos they were actually on to something important
yes but i would have thought that you know i m r o sh should of then i asked i write and asked them the question i r really would have expected a reply to come back yes we found this and so and so but we then UNK a little bit further and erm
can i just ask on that ken
yes
do you not think that almost regardless of the reply and whatever that reply contained with what we now know with the benefit of hindsight about UNK which was actually known by i m r o there's not for the benefit of hindsight that wasn't known at that time shouldn't i m r o have refused immediately to license any organisation that was controlled out of UNK in those circumstances
absolutely i think you know i mean i just feel there should be a total ban on anywhere where you can't get the information that you require you know
so let's leave it there and you but you were saying ken you've UNK
oh i think the story goes on from there because i don't think though and this is a personal opinion and i i'd love the committee to i don't know tha that er i m r o ever did get accounts out of UNK because a year later b i m the m the ownership of it was transferred from UNK back to england but guess who the owner was transfer to a charitable trust so we've got erm a company that is handling the investment management of seven hundred million pounds worth of pension funds which is owned by a charity and the and the accounts that were given to i m r o and these accounts were given to i m r o a year later were charity commission er type accounts which evidently showed something like five hundred thousand pounds in that charitable fund and er and no transactions you know so and that company that was running that was the beneficial owner of our investment company where all the errors took place
can i can i just put some other bit of information in front of you as well
you mentioned the accounts of the maxwell charitable trust as having five hundred thousand of assets i saw those accounts for the first time the other day and i found that they had five hundred and one thousand of assets of which er five hundred thousand UNK of a purely hypothetical transfer of an asset from a UNK trust to the u k trust and that asset had no valuation done on it as far as i can make out a and no reference to any valuation appeared in the accounts so we actually had b i m apparently owned by a charitable trust on the face of it with figures of five hundred and one thousand of assets but in practical accounting terms and valuation terms no evidence that those five hundred and one thousand pounds er of assets had any valuation approaching that figure
can now can we actually move on a bit because that has been very valuable what you said but in fairness to mr maxwell it also has to be said doesn't it that up until he UNK these assets er this process of throwing organisations peoples monies into a spin UNK and pulling them out of different sort of UNK was something he regularly did and we've had witnesses to say how well he did manage the funds and how they grew whether when they should sell stock and when they shouldn't sell stock and so on
so we're actually concentrating on the actual business of that in the final analysis despite how he behaved large amounts of funds were stolen and you b you've kicked us off to a very valuable start about whether that would be harder to do faced with a maxwell type character if all of good was implemented
so w we're grateful for that
we'd also for those new pieces of the UNK you've given us today over erm UNK
but can i take the questions back to jimmy please and continue
well obviously the sad reality of the thing doesn't come home to our UNK and a man comes up last week and tells me that he's been paid off by the daily record he's been working for them for thirty five years and he asked what how much pension will he have and says that he's getting four years pension
now that's a s er sad reality of this er national fraud that er maxwell committed
now what i'm saying to you is that there's a big question mark as far as UNK er report is concerned and they can talk about er the surpluses they can talk about the trustees but there's no majority as far as the employees are concerned and this was the question mark that we were saying that one of the reasons why they were saying you know that the employee should be in the minority because in the end paragraph of the summing up of the UNK report that states quite clearly that all the responsibility and all the but the employer now you yourself has said that er as far as the schemes and we're talking of something in the region of a hundred and twenty eight thousand
now say for instance that because of the minimum UNK er agreement the employers have got to pay whatever their loss is and if and i asked this question of the t u c that if there was a situation of where the employees were in the majority and forget the pension regulator because there was a regulator anyway so you can add whatever name that y you liked to have but the fraud still went on but say the employees were in the majority as far as the trustees is concerned and they were in full control and the control was taken away from the employers and there was a federation of the hundred and twenty eight thousand with a central fund paying off heavy loss of any minimum UNK then surely that would be the ideal situation in order to safeguard because when i asked UNK himself when he submitted his report he said they could not give any UNK assurance that nobody could UNK in any scheme under the proposals he's made
as far as i'm concerned personally i think it's very weak take it back and re draft it and allow the employees to be in the control of their own UNK because after a national fraud and a scandal that's taken place that we could never trust any employer to carry out a scheme
if i can please er i think our comments on that er perhaps mr ray is being er using the UNK global UNK when he refers to employees
in the pension scheme there are typically three groups of members the existing pensioners er those people who are still working for the company the employees and the third group of er members who work for the companies generally referred to as deferred members
they all have interest in the scheme so that we would believe the thing to do would be to have at least an equal number of employer appointed trustees and employee appointed trustees and the employee in this i'm using it UNK so it does cover all three groups and we also believe it would be UNK because er inevitably the e er members er probably wouldn't know a lot about pensions themselves to have an independent trustee from an independent company who UNK in pensions and pensions laws and could a advise them on exactly what the law says and what they they're legal duties etcetera are
yeah but you know that the UNK report makes it quite clear that the employer is responsible for starting the scheme winding up the scheme and increasing or decreasing the contributions
good d good does in fact do what you said and his recommendation er for final salary schemes is er a third of the trustees should be or have the right to be er from the members and er we've in our er comments to you have er looked at a global point of view and said no not are these proposals worthy in themselves but using a different criteria that if they had been law as ken said earlier would they have stopped maxwell and a situation where a third of the trustees were er were they members er would have made no difference er cos typically in our cases there were originally about four trustees er and unfortunately for us three of them were named maxwell
little further
peter
well yes just to look at the wh the question of balance of power between the employer on the one hand and the members on the other hand and then between the different categories of members the active payers in the pensioners and the deferred pensioners
how do you see the proposals in the er good report and what exact proposals do you have yourselves
well the proposals in the good report as i said for final salary schemes is that a third of the trustees should be elected from he actually says from the active members er we know and comments that in great length a about the difficulties that it would be to er actually er elect er members who are pensioners or from the UNK er i find that er somewhat UNK view point in that er the pensioners at least get communications from the administrators of the scheme every month they get a monthly cheque so it sh shouldn't be beyond the wit of man to be able to er be able to contact the pensioners and organise pensioner meetings but pensioner trustees to be elected
postal balance easily enough
in fact i think UNK enough i think the way that the daily mirror trustees are now organised with postal balance and representatives classes i think you know is almost a model now of how a set of trustees should run you know they but they have got a very good scheme of how they do actually elect their trustees from various groups of members
but do you envisage the employers should be in a position of the minority on the scheme
well i think the whole problem is erm is really we should some someone's got to ask the question are final salary schemes going to last well into the next century
you know because if you are going to ask an employer to enter into a contract between the between an individual employee then really you've got to give him some advantages to do that and i think that er i don't know what the figures are or the number of final salary pension schemes that have been launched in the last couple of years but i should think it be quite few and i think that there is a difficulty that if we go too far in taking power away from the er from the employer erm then i can see the UNK of final salary pension schemes so i think one's got to keep a balance there of erm you know that i that you mustn't turn the employee off completely from this type of scheme
that's very clear thank you

ken if we could er look at what's actually happening out there to pensioners at the moment i think of which we're all very concerned but there has been a small item of good news to balance against the concerns we have for those pensioners that are still suffering from uncertainty and that is some money has started to come in as a result of legal actions and settlements out of court
can you tell me what the current position is as you understand it
yeah
and what your views are on some of these settlements that have been made
yes well erm i think i mean i did check with the various trustees last week and the current position is erm there was basically a four hundred and sixty million that er that was the original missing figure to which now goes back over two years er UNK have come to into over a hundred thousand now with the
hundred million
hundred million sorry er i got th i missed off the nought on the end erm
it's
erm and yeah er but that was his UNK er so it's so of that four hundred and sixty million er a hundred million odd er just over a hundred million has been recovered but unfortunately we still have three hundred and eighty million of UNK erm that is due in part to the fact that with low interest rates really the liability value has increased
so you know there the UNK are very good very welcomed by us but basically we're two years now since this happened erm pensioners have been suffering extreme mental UNK for that period quite frankly they're utterly confused they don't understand what's happening and to ask those sort of people to rely and put their s their whole future security on the UNK of out of court settlements where claims are made for two hundred million and there's a thirty two million you know they're getting totally confused and i think that they just do not know what's happening they want long term security we're now getting an increasing number of people who've retired since the schemes were wound up and are therefore getting a hundred per cent of their money from the company fund which we're told is going to run out in two and a half years time
so we've got this group of people who are and just retired they're sixty five and have just retired and they're looking forward to their pension le lo losing completely in two and a half years time unless something's done about it
i think that's a near UNK situation
can i just make one point ken cos you were saying they're getting thirty odd million of er of a request of two hundred million
it was actually thirty million wasn't it of a claim for fifty million of which there was also a secondary claim which was dropped
yes i think
so that so that actual that particular settlement was rather a good one because it was thirty odd million plus eight wasn't it
oh yes no i think i think that er and i think that you know that particularly the mirror group newspapers trustees doing a doing an excellent job you know but we haven't really got into the into the stock lending er arrangements but the cases those i think are particularly you know important to us you see because there is a there's another hundred and fifty nine or a hundred and fifty three million i think of UNK out at the moment and those i think are the ones where we're going to really see whether the banks dig their UNK in or not you know i think we've we're rea very early stage but basically i mean we've still got eighty getting on for eighty per cent of the missing monies still missing and we're into our third year
ken would you say though that erm one or two recent announcements connected with these judgments i think including the er the judge in a recent m c case which actually went i think against the administrators b on shares but actually the judge said if the argument had been made that er these assets were held er on a trustee basis then i might have made a different decision
er would you not say that this has shifted the onus of responsibility very much on to the financial institutions the banks and others who had dealings with mr maxwell and isn't the judge in effect saying in your interpretation er of that these institutions er really have got to show they were UNK than white in their dealings and actually went in and investigated him thoroughly
well i think i mean i do agree and i think that the that er that pressure is now getting on to these city institutions but erm but i still come back to the basic thing that really you know what appears to me is happening is we've we're having literally millions of pounds taken out in issuing these massive UNK you know a hundred and seventy eight page UNK are sort of being and really the money for those is coming out of the remaining money in our pension funds and really i feel that what wou what is happening is this as far as i'm concerned is all due to the self regulatory body being set under the financial services act and in a way i feel that you know we're being made to pay for sorting out a mess that somebody else is making
i mean and i think it is the lack of the regulate the er the regulatory control of city actions i mean one of the points that we've been recently been advised on is that one of the city institutions which has already been er fined er from its london office on a UNK is in effect the new york and london offices are deemed to be one entity and i think that er what we've been advised is that erm i forget the phrase i wrote it down here somewhere that what we would be advised to do is to take action against that particular city institution in new york because that er it is deemed that the london and new york actions are in fact one and that the that er what in fact the er and i think the f yes there it is that in a way though what we've been advised is that the basis of that action would be that the organisations london and new york operations are essentially the same operation and bound by a strict know your customer rule as UNK by u s UNK law you know
now i can see the sense of that you know we could probably go to a new york lawyer on a no win no pay basis and take action UNK an and argue that case but you know is this what really people who've paid pensions for thirty or forty years should be dealing with you know
it was can i just bring you back to that point
yes
that particular organisation i presume is the one that is known as the most profitable investment bank partnership in the world or in history and presumably the reason why you've been advised is because the advisor or the director to robert maxwell who was UNK in dealing with robert maxwell business wherever he was in the world and i mean i've seen er UNK and UNK to france where er that particular director i believe mr UNK was i've seen UNK about jersey business to mr UNK er presumably er you're being advised to take that action because in effect it was operating as one operation with transactions UNK through new york UNK through london as seemed to suit the circumstances but not necessarily with any rational basis other than er to avoid perhaps regulation
er ken you don't have to answer that the david sitting behind you a number of er representatives of legal firms representing interest and david's making sure it's worthwhile coming today
chairman i can't imagine how you could possibly UNK that
no i think i think
the interesting point is that i feel is that this is this all has a very heavy bearing on the regulatory system because i think that really we're now being financial services is a global village and you know whether somebody picks up a phone and di i think in fact didn't you have somebody gave evidence here and said that they could not investigate one of UNK transactions because it had gone through the new york office
now if we're going to try and eliminate the UNK the sort of problems then really we've got to think of on an international regulatory basis rather than just in the u k
david
can i bring you erm back to the u k and what we can do in the u k although i agree with you we need to be looking with certain organisations at regulation on a trans atlantic basis but from a u k point of view erm the good committee report has suggested that a pensions regulator should er be brought into being
do you think that if we had a pensions regulator er it might deal with some of the UNK by robert maxwell er and some of the er aspects of where he UNK the law and managed to take over pension funds
i suppose in asking that question i've got to ask you to rule out er all transactions er which have sort of UNK through new york and london at the same or at different times because quite clearly the good committee would er all their suggestions would fail on that behalf you've just destroyed the question i was going to ask you really before i got to the question
no i don't think so no i don't think so
i mean th there's one little phrase that i picked out of good which o regarding the pension regulator and he actually used the word that he UNK the pension regulator and i now quote will be less pro active than the f s a regulators
how you can be less pro active than i m r o i can't understand or i m r o at that particular time but what it appears to be me is that erm that if we're not careful we're gon th the pension UNK just gonna be a rubber stamp factory
you know it's got a hundred and twenty eight thousand pension schemes papers are gonna flood through the door and annual reports and that sort of thing and it seems to me that all of goods th the way that this pension regulator is deemed to act is that he's expecting the auditors and the actuaries to whistle blow and
well i think i would i would UNK it i mean i it they've got the responsibility to whistle blow now you know professional they've got er you know they're they these are professionals and they should they should whistle blow and i mean maxwell is a perfect example of how nobody blew the whistle and if you read through the UNK those lots of these people knew what were what was happening an and the whistle should have been blown and i see no reason why the why the pension regulator is going to get any different response and also i mean really these people are being in many cases given by th given information by their clients you know and i think it's a very difficult situation to turn round to somebody like mr maxwell and say well look i'm terribly sorry mr maxwell we're going to report you to the pensions regulator you know and i think that er you will just find that i just don't feel that the pension regulator in that respect i mean i think that i might like to if peter suggested a pension fraud squad that had a open telephone line and the same sort of er powers as the serious fraud office you know so that if er anybody in a pension fund could ring a number and er and people absolutely UNK th that i mean they ge they say somewhere in the report that the pension regulator is going to have er powers and monies to do spot checks
well how on earth do you start spot checking on a hundred and twenty eight thousand companies you know the first nine hundred and ninety five that you do may be the ones that are running perfectly
can i just put to you there that the pensions regulator may be able to handle aspects like audit reports and established well established documentation and procedures but are you not really suggesting erm that in the circumstances of maxwell where the committee saw for example a transaction that actually had thirty different transactions and therefore unless one looked at the overview of those thirty transactions one couldn't realise that the bank effectively was involved in a fraud
they're a very well known bank but nevertheless effectively involved in a fraud
now how is a pensions regulator going to look at those thirty transactions therefore are you not effectively saying that the pensions regulator may work in areas where pensions regulation actually works now
the problem is the pensions regulator won't work in the areas where regulation isn't working now
absolutely
yeah
i think that's
i understand the point you're making about er self regulation and er i think it's brought a lot of the problems upon us and enabled the UNK to take place er and that's what de regulation and self regulation leads to
what would be your proposals for controlling pension funds
well i think if er if what had ha if er i mean before what he had before self regulation was the d t i issued erm certificates to investment management organising you know and i think that if er if power had remained on that basis with the d t i don't i'd be sitting here now
i don't think the i don't think the d t i would have issued a investment management certificate to robert maxwell you know because he'd done naughty things in the past so he just wouldn't have got the certificate
i mean it was what and if you go through all the papers you can see that robert maxwell really saw that self regulation erm legislation being that he could finally get control through an investment management company of his pension funds
were the d t i open to erm pressure suggestions information from members of pension funds
i don't know but i er no i think i don't know i'm not you know my experience of pension funds is it's you know is only in the last two years really i'm er
you're an expert over that bit maybe
the other thing that might contribute to er improving matters would be if the compensation arrangements er were such that the er fund managers were involved in having to provide some of the UNK compensation if there were any to be paid then there's obviously a very good incentive for them to police themselves more thoroughly
under the present compensation er proposals put forward by good it would all be provided by the pension funds themselves and there's no pain for the fund managers er no requirement really for them to blow the whistle
UNK
no the erm none of your papers to the committee concentrated on the compensation er proposals from the good report and as you know it's a scheme er which is proposed to be UNK restricted to losses UNK arising from fraud theft and UNK of assets and is just up to a limit of ninety per cent
how do you consider that the proposals for that scheme offer adequate cover er to members of pension schemes
no we don't erm we in principle obviously we are in favour of er there being some form of compensation scheme and that has to be regarded as erm a step forward er it would be better if er whatever compensation scheme is gonna be introduced was introduced now and the committee recommended and not in nineteen ninety six or whenever it may be that the legislation is UNK
er but in terms of the proposals they actually make erm we find them somewhat UNK in that erm it says earlier on in the in the committees report that erm accrued rights must be protected erm it doesn't say accrued rights which have to be lost through UNK of assets must be protected
whereas the proposals that they're making is only those rights which may be lost because of UNK of assets er would be UNK by the compensation fund
we feel it should be extended to all assets er all accrued rights that are not able to be provided
erm we believe that er where in cases of erm UNK or fraud the compensation fund should be for a hundred per cent of what has gone
in cases where it's due to er under performance in the case of UNK for example or other situations we can see the argument for having a smaller proportion but it should cover both
does the compensation scheme cover that
no not at present and we believe that it should
er you think you think it should be wider then a wider scheme
yes absolutely wide yes
in order to cover any er any rights which are lost and secondly er it's inevitably the case that we are particularly disappointed er that the proposals are not retrospective
after all if it wasn't for the maxwell fraud the good committee would never have been set up
erm we feel that er in that circumstance the proposals should be retrospective erm and we find the good committees er comment on this UNK in that all they say is we do not accept that retrospective implementation of the compensation scheme is appropriate full stop
why not
we think that it should be
er if for no other reason than er if the compensation scheme was to be made retrospective to include the victims of the maxwell fraud it would at least erm restore some public confidence in the in the pensions industry
er and after all if all the efforts that have been made that we have discussed just at just now er towards getting the money back are successful well then the compensation that had been paid would be UNK
so those are our main concerns about the compensation
well i'm very interested in what you say er could you could i ask you a couple of questions
how do you think the retrospective scheme compensation scheme would actually work and if i could give you an example erm should it apply to all schemes which have been affected in the past er perhaps after a certain date or if you were going to make that decision where would the cut off date be how far back would you go and what schemes would you look at er if it's gonna be retrospective
only look at er it's a scheme that really raised the whole problem that the erm er
ken commented earlier that er prior to the financial services act coming into force which i think was some time in nineteen eighty eight the er d t i was responsible and there come back to the d t i if these sort of things had applied and er compensation effectively by the d t i for UNK administration or whatever so that er say we don't pretend to be pension experts so any UNK that i would suggest might well be appropriate as at the date of the financial services act becoming into force
after all it was suggested er by er michael howard in who was corporate affairs minister in nineteen eighty six in the house of commons he said that the government believe that members of a pension scheme are in effect investors in that scheme and that they deserve the protection of the bill will extend to investors and it never did
so it would not seem unreasonable that you know from the date of the financial services act it might come in there
would be a wide ranging scheme covering all the aspects of the
we believe it should be
could erm i ask you then how you think it should be funded
well the proposals that are made in the in the committees er report for funding erm seem to us acceptable with the exception of the comment we have already made erm i acceptable in the sense that they would be borne by erm all pension funds in proportion to their the size of their assets and in relation to the size of the er compensation has to be paid
we believe that it would be more sensible if a proportion of the compensation would be met by people like pension fund managers if for no other reason that it would encourage them to er keep their own house in order erm and you know it's not a bad er principle to operate in these areas
now you know wi with lots of experts in this field and so we UNK we only simply put that forward as a general suggestion whether it should be one third from them and two thirds from the pension funds you know i don't think is a matter of great importance to us but we do think that the should perhaps be a bit spread a bit more widely than just into the pension funds
it's probably not to yourselves providing the compensation was paid and that's fine but it would be a matter of great importance to those for whom that it would have to provide the money
sure
and how would you envisage that er was operated
h how would you balance that out back to the date that you're talking about
well
w we can see you can UNK from now if we start it now you'd say well everyone now knows that if anything goes wrong this is what they will have to pay but how are you going to take it back
well actually no i would disagree with you at the moment
if something goes wrong they don't know what they are going to have to pay because if i'm a pension fund manager now i don't know what is likely to happen in the next year which is going call on me for compensation
all i know is that probably during the course of the year something will happen and i might have to chip in you know a thousand pounds or a million pounds or whatever but i don't know how much it's going to be
in this case at least it is possible to calculate the total er total amount that is missing and that could be divided up between your pension funds and it would of course be a one off hit on those funds
tha that would mean that all pensioners who are drawing the pension from pension funds would be UNK back to the date that you're talking about
no it's the employers ultimately who will be UNK because the employers are required to make up any shortfall in the assets of the funds not the pensioners
so the pen employers pay
ultimately yes
and that but al as we said a proportion of it we believe should be met not from the pension funds but from the er from managers
but if you've got er four hundred and eighty million pounds missing and you're saying that pension fund managers should er pay a third of it and this is a pay as you go scheme rather than a funded scheme of compensation how many pension fund managers do you think would be able to cough up their third
i don't have at the tip of my fingers the total level of funds managed but
once again there is n not necessarily er anybody to write out a cheque for one million pounds o or whatever
most of these UNK er inevitably aren't necessarily for pensions payments they're back to the active members some of whom won't make any actual claim on this possibly for thirty years time so there could well be a er a scheme which is arrived at which is a pay as you go which isn't any great liability o on any one pension scheme at any particular moment in time
i thought you were trying to actually pin responsibility not to organisations but to people that here was mrs UNK philosophy really working and market was gonna discipline pay out their own pockets
now if i'm the fund manager and you've gotta deferred member nobody's gonna waste thirty years for me to pay up their pension i won't be here probably in thirty years time er so they want the money up front
they don't want me paying d you know like their pension deferred so if you're serious about the fu pension fund managers paying we're talking y you know earlier you said four hundred and eighty million whatever it is lost they're paying a third pension fund managers have got to come up with that sort of sum
now i just don't think that's rea realistic that's different from saying you may have a bail system cos that's what i thought you were suggesting and for people to b come into the ring as pension fund managers they would have to perhaps to put up UNK of a million pounds each to o operate in this area and that if they behave badly if funds went missing if it was proved they were UNK they would lose their million pounds bail just as people lose bail when they don't turn up to court
now that seems to me that might UNK er slightly might do but i could i think that wha i what i thought you were saying was different from what you ended up saying and i'm not sure which
i think the thing that sort of has really UNK me UNK right from the start of this thing was that when this when the financial services act was put before parliament everybody was told the UNK report and everything said pensions are the same as assets all your assets and must be protected as such
th the house was told that and that was what the situation
it then went into the city to set up their own self regulatory and we in fact went to see mr UNK and he was quite he was very quite UNK about it he said well they considered it when they were UNK considering the investors compensation scheme but the sum involved in pensions are so great that they could not afford to UNK a pension er a compensation fund for pensions so therefore there's a pension fund for private investment but not a pension fund er compensation fund for occupation
now how you work it on your scheme or whatever scheme comes up it just seems to me that if you are going to have self regulatory body there's got to be responsibility for it and how you impose that responsibility could i'm sure be in all sorts of different ways
we've got to find we're taking up all very well er jane
er it's really is to follow on from this debate that we're having about what should happen if a shortfall occurs erm and we've heard i've been listening carefully to your views about er the way in which you agree with the good committee that a shortfall is an employers debt the employers responsibility to meet that shortfall and we've been talking about that shortfall should be met but the good committee also concluded that er pensioners should not be regarded as UNK erm and you also agreed with that
could you explain for the record what your reasons were for arriving at that conclusion
could you take that
i think that the i think the question of that really i'm trying to i can't quite frankly i think that's mike UNK in this who particularly investigated that one but i think that basically what we were really saying was on what i was saying earlier on is that if you make it too difficult for the employers you're going to take away the incentive to run a final salary scheme you know that you know i think basically final salary pension schemes are good for the employee you know i think that was what our fundamental thinking of on that was
do you think this er really goes back to the fundamental issue which the good committee didn't really address which was the issue of ownership of the pension funds and assets and that whilst pensioners and to an extent employers these days regard the pension fund as deferred pay and pensions payments as deferred pay the ownership of those funds is still left erm neither still er an argument about wh who owns the funds and er a lot of this follows on from that
yes well i think that's why you that's why i keep on trying to come back to the regulatory system because what you really in fundamental form a pension is a contract between an employer and an individual you know you pay me so much money and when you get to a certain age i will pay you
that's the fundamental as far as i see it of a pension fund
the problem i think comes when you go when you become UNK you know and i think that's and so therefore unless we're going to come up with some system where we do insure our pensions as we do our home then you you're still back to the basic contract between a company and an individual
i think that's the real sort of problem of trying to say the assets belong to the for the pensioner you know i think there are great difficulties unless you're gonna rule out final salary pension schemes
great
ken i calculated you've actually given us nine major points in your submission
now are there from our questions issues which we've missed that you just want to touch on before we conclude
well i think er well we've gotta er i think we've gotta few points there's one on stock lending which we think needs to be looked at
do you wanna make a couple of comments
yes
you make some comments
er good er concludes that er stock lending is er no different from other aspects of er the market in general er as i understand it stock lending as far as pension funds concerned usually works with pension fund has this collection of stocks and shares
er financial institution is sure to meet its position it comes to the pension fund says can you loan me th this stock in the return of which i will er pay you the equivalent sum of money plus some interest
that sounds all very well and good the way as my reading of the at least one of the UNK is concerned is that er maxwell operated this in entirely the reverse
he er wasn't the UNK he was the UNK he went to the bank says can i borrow this collection of treasury bonds which he has to put pension fund assets to stock so he's immediately er going against his duty as a trustee cos it's costing the pension fund money this er excess of five to ten per cent
secondly he UNK bonds were immediately sold to another part of the same part of the organisation again at a discount so that cost the pension funds even more money and to the final injury the payment of that cash for the er treasury bonds went to accounts which were not the property of the pension funds at all
hence we are four hundred and eighty million and whatever is out of pocket
er we would say that as that as far as pension funds are concerned stock lending in that way should be UNK and the UNK ca carrying on that er is that er it should be any account for a pension fund should carry the names of pension funds and any transactions involved with pension fund money whether it should be a duty of financial institutions to make sure that any account they were paying money into was a pension fund account
if i may say so is a key point isn't it that a lot of the transactions you've discussed were off market transactions they were unusual transactions and the financial institutions that were carrying out those transactions whether they were acting as UNK or acting as UNK they would have had knowledge that those transactions were not normal market transactions
so if the law was clear that in those circumstances they should have been on notice and should have therefore watched where the money was going there wouldn't have been a problem and are we not saying that legitimate stock lending which i think is what good is UNK is suggesting if carried on properly on market would be all right but if it immediately goes off market into the back doors and back rooms and people can't see what's going on and the financial institutions take part in that then they are doing something that un undoubtedly is probably going to cause loss to pension funds and shouldn't there be a clear law which makes them liable in those circumstances
you were saying it was wrong anyway weren't you
oh i'd say it is w wrong anyway in that er i say it's the it's early er on it in the report good defines what he determines a trustees duty and as i said to a sort of effectively ought enter into a tr transaction which immediately cost UNK kind of money rather than making money for the pension fund then it is against that duty in the first place but it's to it should however be ma made explicit that it is against that duty saying stock lending may be okay for a pension fund but not stock lending where the er pension fund is acting as the UNK rather than the UNK
right ken any other points
er can i started to comment on about the er bank accounts which are you know er my the reaction that i saw was all round the table and i think we would go further that er any company handling pension funds should carry pensions somewhere in their names and all on all their paperwork etcetera so that everybody's totally clear that they are dealing with pension funds and er to agree with a comment that you made in one of your earlier reports that er designation of ownership of shares of pension funds should be clearly er marked on those shares er that also would of er at least UNK these financial institutions as once again that they were handling stocks belonging to pension fund and they still have ignored it in the case that er they did but er they would ha not had the excuse that er apparently some of them have made that er they were not aware that these were pension funds assets
i think still claiming well it's not that i didn't know but anyway er ken
er well we did we were gonna raise a point on that the clash of the regulatory rules and the duty of under trust law you know and i think there was a comment tha that i picked up with professor UNK you know in his report which i think where he said the government obviously have greater confidence than i in UNK on UNK trust law in relation to modern commercial developments such as unit trusts and occupational pension schemes which its founding fathers never UNK
now there was nothing in good really that i think addressed this UNK between those two types of law
now i think that good did say oh well there is a law commission report expected but i think that you know that good should address somewhere tha that problem of trust law and UNK and then i did in fact on going through the report and er you know and also your own reports erm there's the one about designation of assets you know which i think was a very good recommendation of yours
i think the actuarial responsibilities and the wider role of actuaries was important
i think the UNK independent UNK for actuaries was another important factor custody confirmation by the auditors UNK of transfer of assets independent auditors for pension funds independent UNK arrangements in house investment management you made some comments co ordination or the various regulators co ordination of the professional advisors establishment of a pension tribunal you know now as far as i was concerned or on my sort of looking through it those were all recommendations that you've made over your two years and i couldn't really find any response to those in good and i think that's a you know we personally found that disappointing
also i mean we take your point and we've made it before ken that there's a real danger of asking for a report from someone like professor UNK and then cherry picking it instead of actually taking the whole because it does actually add together in some sort of UNK erm and had professor UNK report been accepted in its entirety we may not have been had the pleasure of having you back again today but thank you very much er all three of you for coming
thank you very much
i would suggest is the timescale between these things happening and it getting to the regulator and being UNK
in the present
didn't understand for two years i mean told the regulator
yes er whereas if there were independent trustees responsible to the regulator and they were properly trained they would i suggest be able to smell out very quickly an UNK and would have a group straight to the regulator if only to call a stop for someone to have a look at it
nothing recommended to UNK in that particular cause is of any good
i don't think so
erm er imperial
i m p a cs belief is that er if you get the trustee balance right that's the first place where the decision ought to be made but there should be a fall back position which good has given which they trustees could go to the regulator in the case of er not being able to solve things but our feeling very much on surplus is that the money is there first for to pay pensions and until pensions are paid up to inland revenue levels whatever they are then no money should go back to the company
the question of taking pension holidays in between out of surplus is a sort of mid UNK position but er very definitely we feel strongly that money should not go back to the company
we have suffered from the same thing as the other two er UNK have said today of money being used from our surplus to provide for redundancy and erm it's been UNK by money being available from the people who were made redundant going to the company and swelling their balance sheets while all the cost side of it comes out of the pension fund and that has caused a lot of ill feeling particularly from the older pensioners who have seen years of inflation when their pensions were not made up to the same extent
in the old days when there was a possibility of erm ad hoc payments made er that sort of thing was taken care of since the UNK of the company that hasn't happened to the same extent so there's a very strong feeling with the older pay er pensioners that they paid money into a pension scheme which now shows a surplus but other people are UNK from it
we need we've got lots more questions to ask you
peter
erm mrs UNK you mentioned briefly earlier the role of the regulator
how do you see the regulator doing his job with a hundred and twenty eight thousand schemes to monitor
great difficulty i would imagine
erm er well we welcome the erm er the proposal that there should be a regulator
somebody er to whom the erm er matters could be referred to er whom er could remove trustees er who are er not acting in er the best interests er of the fund er to whom er i understand that the erm beneficiaries could er appeal if they felt that their fund was being erm used i in the wrong way which is something that we haven't got at the moment
erm i mean just going very briefly back to the question that you asked erm about this how would you stop what's happen happening is by having we would have thought a pensioner trustee because even the question has been asked how did it get through the union trustees and the answer that most of them are employed and they are looking over their shoulder because jobs are going redundancies are being made you've got a pensioner employee er a pensioner trustee on there and they're not looking over their shoulder for their job they are going to do the job of a trustee and watch the fund and they would then be able to go to the regulator if they saw something that was UNK but if somebody is employed by the firm might be very worried about doing because they're more bothered about keeping their job
though the case you're putting that the pensioner trustee er ship is more powerful than you originally put cos up to now you've been put it in grounds that it's the trust should be UNK representative of it
yes
now you're saying er rather well that in fact that person or persons could be more independent
yes
because they're actually not worried about being sacked
yes
either erm because redundancies are coming or as imperial trustees found they were just got UNK of as a way of moving them off the trust
yeah very good
large UNK being UNK in front of them
i mean we ought to say in our case approved our the proposals of the company they raise no objections in which only the who raised objections the employees didn't and in the high court case we've just said how can an employee be independent when he depends upon his employer for his future work
so really what you're saying is that if we're looking at trip wires to stop things happening there's a power a really powerful case for a pensioner trustee but you're looking for whistle UNK
yes
there's also a powerful case for having pensioner trustees that they will so there's far less chance of erm people UNK their arm although they could have the UNK in front of them
that's
but that's the problem we all face isn't it
and we're also saying that if you have a new pensions act the work of the regulator will be much easier
why
you won't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time
UNK
could i could i turn to one of the major UNK of erm of pension fund surpluses er and that is the plight of the deferred pensioner
the person who leaves the company's employment er could i ask you each of you in turn briefly for some comments about how you feel deferred pension rights can best be preserved if they can be preserved at all er adequately
i suppose in one way as a pensioner i shall say what happens about you know i'm not worried about if you're a pensioner because every time one someone becomes a deferred pensioner our surplus goes up
yes
because the liability is UNK
yes
i cannot see why the UNK having a liability for an employee if that employee becomes a deferred pensioner that the UNK having a liability for the fund
but don't
yes they are
can i you the example you did before to other people was that if you worked you know your normal scheme forty years and if you worked for ten of those forty years you become deferred
do you have a quarter of the right you would expect if you done the forty years
is that the sort of way one should UNK the position as a deferred pensioner
yes
what i think my colleague is saying is that when the UNK is assessing the commitments of the funds he is looking at the anticipated increased earnings until the person UNK and i think when the calculation is made for somebody who is er a deferred pensioner of leaving er a pension fund to take his money elsewhere a similar calculation or the same calculation should be used the one that the UNK last used in looking forward and saying what the commitments are
that way the fi the surpluses left behind would be less but the person transferring and we're going to see more and more of this today er takes a fair amount of money with him
but of course if salaries go up UNK throughout a forty year UNK and the chairman is given a forty year UNK which is quite or pension UNK which is quite a suitable one if salaries go up and someone leaves their company every ten years then the first three UNK are obviously going to be at much lower salary levels and it's not going to be satisfactory the first three UNK are just index linked to inflation there is the problem of how does one index link them towards the final salary
otherwise that person having worked for four different employers during the forty years will not retire on two thirds of final salary but will retire on two thirds er only perhaps the last employer for the last ten years
it isn't a question chairman but it's easy to ask as it seems we you said a ten year but what about a thirty service of deferred pension that could be an entirely different situation because that is inflation put under the post office and b t ones it's inflation UNK every year so for the ten years if he's if he's got another ten years before he draws his pension at sixty he would have that er deferred pension inflation UNK every year
so a thirty year old service might be entirely different than a person with ten years service UNK his pension
yes the reason why we picked a forty year UNK of work or working life er with four tens was because professor good himself told us that er on their research the common employment pattern today is in fact four employers over the working life and of course that is very different from the experience of many pensioners who are drawing today from their pension funds because many of them were long term long service employees throughout their lives with one employer
but you were saying weren't you described this world which lots of us now have lost and somebody leaving school starting a job and retiring from that job so the UNK the question david's asked you is more important isn't it because deferred pensions are probably gonna become more not less common
they are becoming a lot more common yes when you look in the report and accounts there are far more of these deferred pensioners there than er than ever used to exist and it's something which i must admit we haven't given a lot of thought to yet but it's something because it's growing that we will have to address erm in our federation we will have to address that problem
and the danger presumably is that the surpluses we were having our discussion and debate about earlier on those surpluses that and i do understand why you feel the pensioners should benefit from their surplus but it the reality is that the employers and possibly the pensioners are currently arguing amongst themselves for the benefit of those surpluses but in fact one of the significant UNK is often the deferred pensioners
yes
and the deferred pensioners are not actually getting in on the debate they're not often represented on the trustees in fact
no they're n they're not represented erm but i think we would b you know i mean i think they should get be considered certainly erm dependent upon the length of service which they have put in it's certainly something for the future
i was gonna make a point about the one you raised the UNK of the situation
i don't know enough actuarial work to be able to and what settlements they should receive but our own experience is that it's hard enough to round up pensioners to form an association and we UNK deferred pensioners and they're even harder
we just don't seem to be able to track them down or attract them in quite the same way so there is a massive practical problem if you want them to have a voice in how things are done there's no doubt about that
we have that same problem but er it can be solved quite easily the employer knows the addresses of pensioners there's nothing to stop pensioner association being formed
we are unable to get addresses of our so it's word of mouth how we how we er include but why should not the employer send to all pensioners and deferred pensioners notices about the associations
could i ask you very quickly on that note do you think the answer is to try and set up a voting mechanism amongst the deferred pensioners or is the answer that one should actually appoint a professional independent trustee specifically with the duties of looking after the deferred pensioners in the debates that you have identified often take place
we were told that is impossible to take a vote because with big organisations like b t and the post office one example was to sell off a UNK there are eight thousand people but they were just told you can either defer your pension leave it with the post office pension fund transfer it to the leicester and alliance who bought UNK or take your money out and take up a personal pension scheme
they were given no votes or erm opportunities and of course the same thing will happen if and when the UNK is sold off from the post office er there's twenty thousand people there
i doubt very much whether they'll be given any opportunity to voice what happens to them when they're transferred or what happens to the fund
they'll be given the same three options i should imagine
so you would feel probably the best mechanism would be the appointment of somebody who is given that responsibility and solely that responsibility of reporting and looking after the interest of the deferred pensioners
yes
you would agree with that
yes i would agree would favour that because i think it would force another issue if the independent rule too often against the deferred pensioners i suspect they'd organise themselves
you see in british steel we have seventy thousand deferred pensioners and er it is a group of people that i feel extremely sorry for because er in nineteen eighty six british steel introduced into their pension scheme while it was still in the public sector retirement at sixty where with a pension credit UNK on length of service so if you had thirty five years service in you could retire at sixty as if you were sixty five and there was nothing done at all for deferred pensioners and in certainly our submission to british steel for seeking improvements we asked that they er they look at deferred pensioner with a view to paying their pensions at sixty recognising that it was a very high class plane that might have to be er achieved in stages
we also recognise that there is a tremendous problem for deferred pensioners in achieving reasonable transfer values er it's a massive problem for them even where they could find perhaps something to do with that money and a scheme that would do them better not always because there are people that give bad advice but there are some that go into it very thoroughly and when it comes down to the bit the transfer value they receive makes it im practically impossible for them to do it
but we've got
so we would like er to support what you're saying
we've got six more minutes david
er shall i combine my two found questions which the committee would like to put to you please and that is there are two points that really do come out of maxwell very much but i think you've had some experience
one is bulk transfers and the second is UNK of assets
er in the context of bulk transfers would you like to comment on the good committees conclusions on the bulk transfers of members between schemes and how they operate and do you think that er there is widespread abuse or do you think er on balance your experience has been that where bulk transfers have taken place they have taken place UNK but i would in that context ask you to comment whether there has been an unreasonable time delay where you have experienced bank bulk transfers between the transfer actually taking place in terms of employees being transferred from an undertaking to another undertaking and the actual transfer of their pension funds
what happened in UNK case was that enormous delays took place between the employees being transferred and the actual transfer of their pension
er and could you also comment perhaps on the UNK of assets and any er points you would like to make in relation to the present five per cent limit on self investment
the er issue of stock lending if you heard the maxwell pensions earlier on comment on stock lending whether you think pension funds should do that er in the case of maxwell as you're probably aware a lot of the stock lending was off market rather than on the market and perhaps you could also comment on the use of independent UNK in terms of the custody of investment
er i'm sorry to throw all those at you very quickly but they are er obviously five minutes left and
b t th the question about bulk transfers
sorry no not british steel apologies
well i i'd say one thing by illustration from our own situation er we were transferring bulk and i felt that was UNK unfair because the members were given a choice
the existing members were told you can either join the new scheme with its improved benefits reduced contributions with certain rules that were operating in favour of the employer that were against them but it was a balancing act or if you don't want that you can stay with the old scheme and continue with exactly the same terms
the third choice was the obvious one you can take your money and get out
er now we the pensioners had no choice we were picked up and put into the new scheme having paid our contributions appropriately to the old scheme rules which were the higher contributions but only to pick up the new scheme rules that were against our interest
now i can see no good reason for that being UNK i'm not quite sure how you stop it but i think it it's a basic problem with bulk transfer the individuals do not have a say
very good
b t
well i've already said about the bulk transfer UNK i quite honestly don't know whether any other option can be given to people they've given the option to defer their pension with the post or their present scheme transferred it new company scheme or take out er the money and take out a personal pension fund er i suppose there might be a possibility of offering people after a certain number past a certain number of years the opportunity to remain within the fund they're in but er the contribution and who makes a contribution may be a problem but that's the only other option i can see
we don't believe that pensioners ought to be UNK transferred they should be given the choice
and if that was in the statute there would could stop the
indeed yes
can we then go back to the other one on UNK
very difficult indeed er hearing the maxwell people talking earlier i think er again and made that point very clear
i think we can point to some of the things that can happen that worry us
er if you stand back from our situation and see it that er the contribution rate for employees was reduced from sixty five per cent for er a company i it became a balance of cost and that works out now at five per cent so the total inputs of the scheme is ten per cent of earnings and that was down from eighteen per cent
er without being an UNK i say to myself that's a pretty UNK thing you've done and then it causes you to start looking at the monetary background of all of that an and again i i'm speaking here largely on what actuarial advice we are beginning to receive
i think the conclusion coming out of that is that as a result of what i've described and a few other things as well not least the fact that the company has now UNK its contribution rate to no more than ten per cent
when it gets to ten the members stay at five when the company gets to ten the damage is picked up by either reducing members benefits or restricted index linking
now with a hundred and eighty thousand of pensioners and forty thousand scheme members and all of the trustees currently made up of employees and scheme members it's pretty obvious where any correction of loss of funding is gonna come from isn't it
there can only be one target it's the pensioners
so er when schemes by the good service of actuaries can be re written in such extreme terms i begin to worry about it and i think it needs an input for more than one direction on the actuarial fund in our case the trustees saw fit not to use actuaries to get away
but on actual UNK of assets erm do you for instance with separate UNK do you have any views about the custody of your schemes assets
not no i i've really not given thought to that subject
b t anything
well i was impressed by the erm the maxwell erm peoples comments that the funds should be clearly marked pension fund accounts and that er there would be regulations that this money couldn't be transferred without some the regulator again or somebody making er agreeing to the transaction but i erm fully understand that would be erm very time consuming but er that's the only way i can see that the fund should be clearly marked that they're pension fund and shouldn't be transferred without some authority agreeing to it
we have separate UNK the bank of scotland are doing this and er i think er having a separate organisation outside is er an important first step but you've then got to tie up who gives them instructions and that obviously needs careful thought needs to be done through the trustees
just one question that i wasn't able to put on the committee's behalf but i think it is something that we would be very grateful for a short written comment and that is the information that your members that the members of the pension funds actually er rather than your annual members as well in that context actually receive annually and whether you feel that is satisfactory
we can send you that
yes i think also how you feel it could be improved would be very relevant and how you would feel in the context of a pensioners meeting an annual meeting like shareholders have in companies and how you if you have any views on how such a meeting might be managed in relation to the deferred pensioners interests the existing pensioners interests the employees interest and obviously the company's interest being adequately reflected at such a meeting but i think we would welcome that aspect
and also efforts you've made to organise yourself as groups and whether you've been encouraged or not encouraged by the owners of the scheme
thank you
that would be very helpful
can i thank you for coming today th the media often has lots of comments from the UNK classes saying UNK british UNK cos they only concentrate on this place
i i'm not gonna comment whether i think that's right or not but anyone viewing your contribution today would know that outside there in the big institutions of our society democracy is very healthy
thank you very much for coming
thank you
thank you
we thank you
books are written by ex UNK and have a spec have several UNK answers
they have here is an answer is too in an exam
this one's excellent because these are the
alright yeah
this one erm he sort of tried hard and put a lot in thinks he should get full marks but he's not going to get very much because he's missed this he's not answering that properly
yeah
and he said that
but it's very good to see where people go wrong and to er help you get it right and that one is the one
is it like that in this one
what's that
my
ah are showing how people answer different how they got
erm yes er yeah
how marks
and right electricity
okay what's erm the difference between a metal and a non metal
erm metal and non metal
erm a non metal is a UNK a solid no
most metals are solid
erm can you think of a one metal which isn't a solid at normal temperatures
no
find it you might find it in a UNK
mercury
right
right
so solid non metals
some of them are solid some of them aren't
er physical properties of metals
what will metals do
what can metals do very well that non metals can't do
erm well they're hard so they can erm make things
because they're
you can make things
right
s
you can make things with them
UNK
good
they're hard you can make things out of them
erm a lot of them are shiny
how do you make erm how do you make wire
with metal
okay
how do you make it with the metal
what do you do with the metal to make wire out of it
heat it melt it
you don't need to heat it they just there's a bar of it and they pull it
oh right yeah
pull it through a tiny hole
stick it through a UNK
mm
so it's if you can pull it out it's UNK
mm
have you ever tried UNK any metals
no
lead or soft metals you can hammer them into shape
seen anyone beating a car panel it's got
yeah
a UNK and they're beating it
yeah
so they're UNK
you can hammer them into shape
right
they're UNK don't need the proper words you just say they can be pulled out
if you try that with erm a piece of wood you try to pull it out into a long thin wire it would just break
try it
yeah
with a piece of china or something like that it'll just break
right
all metals will stretch out it'll get thinner UNK
UNK you can UNK it
right
into shape
so those are the some of the physical properties
have fairly high UNK points
some of them not as high as the non metals but most of have got to get to a few hundred degrees c before they start
erm some of the uses of metals
tell me some
oh erm the uses of metals
what actually what erm oh god
what could you use metals for
er anything computers
right
so you can use them for because of because of it's cos you can draw it out you can make wires out of it
you can shape it into almost anything
you can make very specially shaped for
yeah
almost anything
but there's another use of metals erm two sticks about say about one's made of wood and one's made of copper
erm someone's going to heat one end and then hold the other end
which one would you rather hold
copper
wood
oh
we'll try it
no the wood one
why
because wood takes longer to burn copper would just you would you could you would feel the heat you had if
right
you held the end
the wood would be the first to burn but you wouldn't feel much
wouldn't feel anything
no
holding the end of the wood
but holding the copper after a few seconds the heat all the UNK be UNK through
yeah
to your hands
conducted it
mm
so metals are
conductors
good conductors of
go on
good conductors of what
good conductors of
well what's it just been conducting
electricity
good that's another one
good conductors of heat
heat yeah
and good conductors of electricity
mm
or we sometimes just say good conductors
so what about the UNK the non conductors
can you think of any of those
materials which are very good at stopping electricity stopping heat getting through
if a material UNK electricity well it UNK heat well because it's very there they work on the same process
if it's an UNK it stops heat getting through and it'll stop electricity getting through as well
mm
so can you think of any good UNK
erm
oh yes
erm
erm have you got an ironing board
yeah
got to put the iron down on apart from
on plastic
so there's a special little bit that you put the iron down on
oh metal
is it metal
i dunno
erm sometimes it's UNK
right
er the plug and the cable going to any electrical appliance
mm
erm how does it conduct electricity
what's UNK what's inside that wire that UNK electricity
a fuse
no that what's the wire made of inside
erm no it's not zinc is it
copper
okay good copper
it's a metal
inside there's a metal but it's not just two bare wires is it
no
so what's wrapped round the bare wires
erm UNK so it won't it doesn't erm it UNK it down
does it slow it down
cos if you had just if you didn't have the thing erm over the wire it would just burn right through very quickly
so is it you've seen you've UNK a plug haven't you
yeah
well
you've always got something covering the wire haven't you
got something covering the wire
what is it
plastic
right
so the plastic is there because it's a good UNK
yeah
if you covered the wire with more metal say you put two pieces of wire spare wire
mm
or wrap some aluminium UNK round these to protect them not going to be much good
no
UNK a good conductor
yeah
very good conductor
erm so plastic is an UNK
mm
glass UNK most of the non metals are good UNK
somewhere in be in between are a very interesting group called UNK
have you heard of those
i have yeah
yep and they're probably nowadays as more important than the conductors
and that's what we use for electronic circuits
so UNK are things that sort of conduct and sort of don't
yeah
erm
in between
they just need a little push to make them go one way or the other so
mm
because of that we can control we can say turn on turn off whether they let the electricity go through or not
erm so UNK erm tell me about an electrical circuit how it works
well you have if you're doing an electric circuit you've got to have a er a bulb and a switch
mm
and batteries to g to do the circuit and you can have erm volts in it as well
okay what are what are volts
volts erm it's a term used for electricity
okay
volts
right what sort of electricity
currents
the current of the electricity
good
doesn't have to be current but it usually is
best thing to do is to draw a little picture erm so what does volts measure
the amount of electricity that's going
yeah
it measure the potential erm i've got a three UNK battery in there somewhere cos i'm working
i'm going to make you hold one end sort of there's the there's the battery going to make you put one finger on one terminal the other finger your other hand on the other one
mm
one and half volts
is that going to kill you
no
no
erm drive it with erm a hundred and thirty two thousand volts
yes
okay
the high voltage
why
what's the difference then
well it's got a higher voltage
yeah what's what does that mean
why is that
it's
going to be
well it's higher on electricity it'll give me an electric shock
mhm
how does it do it
it goes through your nervous system
okay
into you're arteries
right
and your heart
right
so it'll go through you and it'll UNK your muscles so you stop breathing and your heart stops
mm
and effectively it's a bit like UNK
mm
erm get your heart started again
so that's another good point erm you know what to do if someone's had an electric shock
don't touch them
right
cos they'll still have electricity
okay
on them
you don't touch them what do you do
turn off all the mains
good
erm get a stick or something
right
something like a wooden
wood
stick or
yeah
a rope and UNK him round
drag him away from the actual
right
mains
okay
and then what do you do
when you've got them away from the mains what d'ya do with them
erm god i've done a first aid course
erm what do you do
right erm
could you still touch them if you've pulled them away from the mains and everything
yeah
once you're sure you've pulled them away
but as you say switch off first and then still use a stick or something to get them away because it maybe the switch doesn't work and maybe that's why they've been UNK in the first place
cos they thought it was switched off
yeah
and it wasn't
so get them away from the mains and then what do you do
erm do the quick a b c
right good and erm
check the UNK check the breathing check
yeah
the circulation
and just treat it as a
yeah
erm
just try and get their heart beat started
get them breathing started because the longest they've been paralysed er
try and get some oxygen in there
get that going and ring for an ambulance
yeah
erm so what's volts all about
well it takes a while to explain but i'll try and do it quickly
erm let's see this is a UNK of water right
mm
erm if the UNK very high and say we have a little a little pipe coming through there in the bottom
what's that
that's the dam
oh right yeah
so that's the that's the wall and this is the water
right
now if the UNK water level is fairly low there'll just be a little UNK coming out here
mm
if there's a lot of water in the dam right up there just pull the plug out here it's going to really shoot out
yeah
be a lot of pressure there because there's a lot of height
mm
of water
well you can think of the height of the water as like a voltage
mm
it tells you ho it's called potential volts measures potential
it measures electrical potential you can just call it potential
and if you think of what potential it's got erm sort of like this UNK if you like
if you
mm
now if we have a little hole in there we'll only get a little bit of water coming out no matter what sort of
pressure isn't it
well let's say let's say we've got a fixed pressure now we're not going to mess about with the height of the water it's a constant hundred feet or so
so if we've got a tiny hole not much water is going to get out
what does
no
come out will be really sort of UNK out
but not much water will get through
when we had a great big hole in the bottom of the dam
more pressure
a lot of water would come through
well that hole is a bit like resistance
yeah
right so if we've got a lot of volts so lot of volts that gives a lot of current
and what's current
current you can think of as the amount of water that actually gets through the
mm
amount of the amount of electricity that actually gets through
mm
and the resistance
if we've got high resistance what do you think will happen with a high resistance
they'll be a lot of current
with a high resistance it's UNK the current it's stopping the current
oh right yeah
okay so high resistance gives low current
low current
and obviously a low resistance
will give a high current
gives a high current
a low resistance is a big hole
a high resistance is if there's a tiny little UNK hole
yeah
it was trying to force through that
yeah
the current is you can think of it as the amount of water goes through it's actually the current is the amount of electrons that get through in a second
so i've got someone here on the outside of the dam counting the electrons as they go past
well lots through to day cos there's the big hole or there's a lot of pressure
so if you have a lot of pr a lot of pressure a lot of a lot of volts
mm
and a big hole which will give a low resistance you get a terrific amount
yeah
going through
if you have a big hole but only tiny little voltage then you won't get much going through
so
so it's er always the opposite
volts the more volts the more current
yeah
but resistance the more resistance
stops it
the less you get through
yeah
so the current
reduces
the current is going to be something like multiplied by the voltage
right
so if it's got ten times the voltage you'll get ten times the current through
which is why one and half volts you know won't do you much harm
no
but assuming your resistance stays the same your resistance is about one UNK million ohms
so if your resistance stays the same and we keep increasing the voltage at some stage you say ooh it feels UNK
mm
ooh i don't like that
that's around erm sixty seventy volts you can say oh don't like that ninety volts stop
erm two forty volts
so current times the voltage and then divide by the resistance so current equals v over r
r
you've seen that before
yeah
you don't usually write c for current because it gets confused with lots of other like UNK
so we use i
erm
yeah
that's but that's basically how electricity works
and it needs to have a path to get there and back
so you have a battery and two UNK on it
then you have say this goes round to a light bulb amps
mm
doesn't light up
the electric you say oh the electricity can go round there and if it gets light
no it's not it's not UNK
but can't flow through it and get back
so it's not quite the same as this water analogy cos it's got to have somewhere to go all the way round
yeah
which is why we call it a circuit
okay
erm so if you can try to think about where is the circuit
where does it start off from what started the battery what pole of the battery
can it get all the round and back to the it'll work
mm
if it can't get all the way round cos someone's pulled this wire out or opened a switch
that's a short
or
circuit isn't it
it's an open circuit
oh
it's an open circuit if there's a bit of a circuit missing
oh right yeah
circuit is missing
a short circuit is when somebody takes a short cut
now there's the battery
that's fine yeah
right there's the battery and UNK got to go we usually talk of positive current going round this way
goes along here and through that big resistance it's a high resistance
right
so it's a little a little tiny hole it's trying to get through here
mm
and it's stopping it
not much UNK getting back
you've got a big thick piece of wire across there join it up
you're not going to get much current down there at all
no
most of it's going to take the easy way short cut
because this sort of looks like something about this big
that sort of pipe
yeah
so for the water to go down the current to flow through
mm
so it'll take the short cut the easy way making a short circuit
won't go the long way round a short circuit
no
erm and if did that with a car battery erm it'll probably UNK
i've seen erm a UNK metal about that thick UNK on the UNK of a car battery
it's erm when you start a car have you ever been in a car when someone's started it up in gear and the car moves forward
yeah
well that's just the battery doing that
oh right
so it's got enough power stored in that battery to do that
and in a few in a fraction of a second if you try and if you short it all out give it a very you know great big wide pipe to rush through the virtually the whole contents of the electricity of the battery tries to get through that and a UNK is like that very
mm
little resistance goes thorough there UNK the metal very rapidly UNK the metals and then turns the turns the UNK metal into UNK
mm
and UNK
and usually the battery UNK
mm
so don't drop lumps of metal over batteries
very dangerous
yeah
okay that's the bit about electricity
let's see
alright
where we can pick up some marks
now tell me what erm what sort of preparation you did for this
well erm we had books like these topics that we had to cover
yep
and er i told mum the other day that w in double science we've still got to do one and a half topics
and she couldn't believe it cos like you know now we've gotta start down getting some revision
mm
we've still gotta do one and a half topics of these books
but erm i looked through the books and erm i wrote down notes and things like that and i looked through my exercise book
and erm at the end they have er questions at the end of each topic
okay
which helps you
this is all about the UNK system and that
and erm i just basically did that
when you're UNK you said the other night you cover the answers up and try the question
it's erm really about the only way to do it on problems
yeah
because if you look at a problem and you read through have someone to work it out you say yeah and that's yeah obvious
erm if you have the just the question and you've got to work it out it's not so obvious
mm
and it's a good way to check if you know it
right question number two
nought
we'll start with that one because no because no one should get nought on a question i think
because there's always something even if you kno you think you know something you about it
a bit of common sense will usually give you some answers
mm
like erm people always know a lot more than they think they know
and they don't want to put down what they do know cos they think it's obvious
yeah
but put it down they get some marks
we haven't done about circuits
ah right
see mum and i looked a bit up in my book
right
each lamp is fifteen UNK thirty volts
they arrange them in series and plug them into the mains supply
draw a diagram you didn't
no
so you didn't get anything for that
what is the current through each lamp when they're switched on
show your working
two forty UNK
now right okay
that's definitely give you one for that
all UNK can be bought
which fuse should they put in the plug
i put thirteen
well
mum said usually it's three
well erm
cos there's a lot of UNK to light up so i thought thirteen
looks
give it a higher
it does it doesn't really matter erm there's only give reasons for this choice
if stronger circuits another bit of
okay erm protective device
what's that oh is this the teacher's
no i put that in yesterday
later
right
a fuse is not an UNK okay
it's a conductor
right
a fuse again
it's a deliberate weak link
let's say you're going to tow erm one car with another car
and you've got this good UNK rope you don't want it to snap
you know when UNK ropes sometimes
mm
UNK and they snap
so you have the UNK rope and then you have a little bit of old rope that is UNK than your rope
mm
and you use that somewhere in the and you tie that to one car and then join that up
so that if something breaks it's going to be that weak old rope not
yeah
going to be your new tow rope
well you can think of it a bit like that
i was UNK i was telling you looking at it from another point of view last night of the what happens when you put electricity through a wire
may i pinch one of your cigarettes
ooh look at that
yeah
oh erm having to put electricity through a wire
erm it'll either stop the
little bit of electricity and then make it more and more
it will increase the electricity will increase through the wire
right
okay
so you're increasing the electricity and what happens to the wire
melt
right
good
before it UNK i mean no we don't normally melt the wires what but what happens
you notice the erm you've got an electric fire running what happens to the UNK
the UNK
what's the UNK
the flexible connection
the cable
erm
the wire that goes to it
well it won't work because it'll be
it's gets
too hot
so whenever electricity whenever electricity goes through a conductor usually a wire the wire gets warm
mm
erm the electricity every bit of wire has got some resistance and erm electricity will be struggling through UNK it up
er what happens in a light bulb when you switch on
the electricity flows through and lights
the bulb up
why does it light up
because UNK been there's a bit in the bulb that
how does it how does it make light
how does how does it light
the little bulb inside the actual glass bulb
right something there's something inside the glass bulb and what happens to it
well electricity flows through it
right and what happens when electricity flows through this little UNK of wire
lights up
why does it light up
i don't know
i mean the erm your hair UNK doesn't light up when you put electricity through it does it
have you ever seen your hair UNK light up
no
you have actually i'm sure
have you ever looked down into the hair UNK
heat
right and you see it red
yeah
especially if it's if as when it first turns on or if the f the fan heater is not blowing very much
and the you see bits of the element UNK red
mm
if you if you don't with a hair UNK if you weren't blowing the air over it what happens
or say a fan heater erm a fan heater in the bathroom
mm
it happened to that the other day
erm as i say it turned the element on but no fan blowing air over it to cool it
did it melt
UNK and it would melt so because of that they put a little UNK thing on to cut out a UNK cut out to stop the current flowing
mm
or it would just melt
so light bulb when you turn on it gets warm then it gets hot then it gets red hot then it gets white hot
it gets so hot it's giving off a lot of light erm light UNK are hot to touch
mm
yes so they're
yeah
giving off heat and quite a bit of that heat is coming off as light
right
so they're deliberately made so we get light out of them
erm that's ohm's law is part of the question two
and to work out any of the UNK or
right
amps is current right
yeah
so we'll go back to ohm's law here
current is volts divided by resistance
right current in amps let's give you two volts and do you know what we measure resistance in
erm no
i do know but i sh i should know
okay
on her majesty's service
ohms
ohms
yeah that's it
called
yeah
who's law it was
now so on that one
well they give you they even give you fro from that by UNK then equations you can derive other equations you come up with other equations
that's one of the equations that you come up with
okay
so current is equal to UNK is equal to power divided by UNK
mm
right
erm current which one
how many marks next question
three
okay
erm there's quite a bit to go into with that but that's hopefully given you some idea of how electricity works
mm
the equations they will give you in the book are in that one
erm they give it er you just have to know what power is
power is the UNK
mm
so erm electric UNK are measured in power
UNK
mm
UNK
you know when you've got a UNK plate on it
mm
and it'll say so many kilowatts
mm
it's just a measurement of power
right
so instead of measuring horsepower you're measuring kilowatts
erm okay
let's have a look at two papers
right you've got a lot of twos on that one
couple of fives on this
five on number five
right again electricity here you didn't get two marks electricity board could use wind generated power in several ways
so when there isn't any wind you can use the UNK power stations instead
you're something funny by using
sa saving
yeah
erm i mean i wouldn't necessarily agree with all these markings because everybody who marks the markings are sometimes slightly different
yeah
but erm that's a that's a reasonable answer
two out of three
what UNK may be used in UNK power stations
two out of three there so UNK nuclear reactor wind and what's the other energy source that you can use
well not wind
UNK
yeah what UNK need UNK power stations
UNK power
erm UNK is the fuel that you're heating
so that's like erm they use gas power stations as well
yeah
so they're probably looking for both UNK which includes gas
okay so i think you've got definitely got the idea there
yeah
that's okay
now are you alright on charts
bar charts
yeah if you turn over i've got eighteen out of twenty two
brilliant
good that's good
because that's a thing that will apply to all subjects
so if
mm
you're good at that you can get marks in lots of subjects
yeah i'm alright on that
just on that
okay
that was all about smoking so oh yeah what's a load in a river
i've got a question
l o a d
yeah there
yeah
i looked it up but i couldn't
erm if you look at a river that's working run running quickly down from the mountains
mm
to the sea
it's carrying with it a lot of soil bits of rock
mm
that's it's load
i put the impact of the river she didn't
mm
give me any marks
no
no
it's also called the
it's what it carries down to the
mm
sea
when it gets to the sea it UNK down
when
mm
it UNK down it drops a lot of the UNK mud and rocks
so higher up it's dropping the rocks
mm
as it gets slower and slower it can only carry smaller and smaller UNK
mm
by the time it gets to the sea then it's UNK down a lot it's usually carrying very fine UNK
mm
which it drops as mud
and the mud UNK out further and builds a delta
mhm
er the UNK delta or the UNK or the UNK delta
yeah
okay so that's what the load is
the
right
stuff that it's
the stuff that
just the load it's
carrying along with
yeah
erm so you could pick a few up a few marks on that
hmm
yes good answer
take it to an expert who'll tell you what's happening
but the question is you have to design the experiment and you have to be the expert
oh yeah
so we get some UNK and put a hedge
well i mean that'll that might be worth a few marks
mm
erm yeah
don't give it anything to eat
give it just UNK and see if it eats it
if it doesn't i'm not touching that
UNK are obviously not eating the wheat and the corn
no
should be something else
but
mm
if it does start eating the wheat well okay
now we'll give it a choice of a few other things
mm
and see if it eats it when he's not starving
erm and on to the UNK
iron is one of the most important metals
so of the metals iron is very important so is copper because we use it a lot in circuits erm
is that right
write in a write a word equation to get is that right
well an equation has an equals sign in it
oh right yeah
so it's one thing plus it's the in this case it's iron plus oxygen gives iron oxide
oh right okay yeah
erm so it'll be f e plus o two will give f e two o three
yeah
erm or f e three o four
there are
mm
two types of iron oxide
erm so you just say the symbol
first of all you just think of it in words the iron plus the oxygen gives iron oxide
if
okay
you wrote that erm well for one mark you'd probably wouldn't get
probably get
anything because you want the you they want the equation
they want the yeah
what three things can be done to prevent it
erm keep it dry keep it covered erm
i put it
i wouldn't have given you the mark for covered
definitely a mark for dry
what do you mean by covered
you usually say erm protected by paint or UNK
yeah
but it needs to be you need to have oxygen and you need water
keep it away from oxygen is another one
make sure there's no air around that'll stop it UNK
right
iron ore
right
iron ore it comes up every year erm an UNK
right
an UNK is when you've got two or more metals mixed together
so
right
erm bronze is copper and tin
an UNK is best when it UNK the best of it's component metals
now we don't we don't need to work with iron
the thick UNK pan is cast iron
it's black because it's still got a lot carbon in it
and
right
it's UNK
if you hit that hard with your hammer it'll just break
yeah
erm a steel pan if you hit it with a hammer it'll UNK
mm
so UNK steel is an UNK of iron
two reasons pure iron to make car UNK pipes
right there's an easy two marks
at least an easy one mark
why is UNK steel called UNK
have you seen UNK steel UNK
yeah
okay
do they rust
no
so why might it be a good idea to use UNK steel for a car UNK pipe
because it won't rust then
so you won't be replacing your UNK
well yeah
every year cos it won't rust away if it's UNK steel
erm okay right
fancy a what would you do to produce a movement of the UNK needle
turn the switch on
size of the movement more UNK put more batteries
what would you do to reverse the direction of the UNK needles first movement b
you wouldn't reduce the batteries to reverse it to make it go the other way
you'll reverse the battery
turn the battery round the other way
oh right yeah
in the circuit and then the needle will jump the other way
yeah
three marks here
electric currents
UNK currents UNK work by UNK currents pick out appliances that use for UNK
okay a pack is one
erm a drill electric UNK probably use a UNK because you want to lower it er an electric UNK would use a UNK
you i think these are what would you run off a UNK
so reading lamp UNK and three marks so we're looking for three of them
electric
yeah
UNK you run off and a UNK
yeah
erm things you would and you wouldn't want them connected to the mains stuck in your mouth
yeah
right
so some of them you can work out buy if you know what a UNK does it steps down all of the current it reduces the voltage
mm
so instead of dealing with sort of high trying to push everything so if you bring your voltage down from two forty volts to say you could get a UNK a battery UNK for a tape recorder
if you that runs on one and a half volts
mm
three volts sorry three volts
so plug two forty volts into that just not
mm
UNK to bring it down to a lower voltage
so lots of things like that it UNK
right
erm
that one i that second paper she put the answers in so
okay
my teacher put the answers in
erm right
a number of materials including metals are UNK at very low temperatures
they've got very low UNK the opposite of resistance so the good conductors
you have a look at the chart
mum seems to think i was right
right what is the UNK the critical temperature of UNK wiring
oh no not that one
i've got the wrong one sorry
so minus a hundred and twenty there i mean that's they're just the there's not a lot of difference really
oh no that's not right
i
no
wouldn't give you any marks for that
no
because you didn't put the minus in
yeah
that's why
there's a chart in here hang on
no it's in this one
there's a chart and mum seems to there it is
read that then and i put forty two
right
four weeks january seventy eight UNK and electricity demand in california four weeks of january
so that's the electricity demand
and that's the power what's the highest for jan seventy eight
so the highest forty two
erm forty one forty two
it doesn't go
right forty two
forty two maybe forty three but it's very close especially that they haven't given any scale
no
to read it
so that's the electricity per so that's fine
yeah but i got that bit wrong
forty two
okay well they get they've got lots of them to mark and they marked quickly but i looks alright to me that
hmm
sorry i just wanted your opinion i mean
mm
i mean it might be wrong but i can't see
okay
you don't know much about UNK and UNK
oh no
things
right erm oh it's a bit late to get into organic chemistry
yeah
so i'll
now are these
yeah her marks were
complete UNK of UNK
erm still haven't got any oxygen
that should be a plus that's what's wrong with it
mm
so should have put a plus there
UNK plus oxygen gives carbon dioxide water
right
erm so change that
this is your paper isn't it
will largely be seen after the new year's day holiday so essentially you could still that the first regional survey to have been largely compiled of the results drawn er from the beginning of this year and the and the and you know you see some reference in the press release to estimates based o on our survey of manufacturing employment er for the regions those figures are consistent with our national figures on the trend in manufacturing employment and our short term forecast which as a matter of fact was UNK published at the end of last month so results
thank you very much
erm i think the main story as we sort of lead off from the from the news release is saying that essentially erm our interpretation of the results is that the r the recovery has spread erm to all regions of the economy at least in terms of orders erm and in terms of the mainland erm economy including northern ireland but i'll go into more details on that in a moment
erm i'll just sort of er talk briefly about sort of main trends and sort of output and orders and so on and then go through in terms of some of the implications that results as regards to employment and domestic crisis
erm looking at the employ sorry looking at the output side er the question looking at trends and output over the last four months shows that in all the four regions manufacturers say that output has increased over the UNK four months
erm the UNK rise is recorded in yorkshire and humberside in wales and in scotland
erm in yorkshire and humberside a little bit unexpected the october survey showed that orders were flat and expectations about output were also fairly flat so it's come through erm rather better than people thought it would in the yorkshire and humberside region
erm in wales and scotland also slightly better than people expected erm a rise was expected but not as strong as we as we've actually seen erm the welsh and scottish er economies certainly there's UNK clear evidence in scotland but i think one can read it for wales as well showing that the manufacturing economy er very much being UNK up by the electronic sector erm and that probably er helping to explain why growth has been so strong in those parts of the country
erm other regions also showing increases erm east midlands south east west midlands erm all of those show increases on the back of in previous UNK borders
the same true though to a slightly less extent i think the north west so although the increase is not as strong as in yorkshire wales and scotland nevertheless continuing to
trends
erm the parts of the country where things have been a bit flat seem to be the north and the south west and both of those are regions in which export orders received fell in the previous two surveys so that seems to be consistent although in the north they seem to have picked up somewhat in this survey erm and optimism is also erm er stronger in this survey than it was in the previous one
erm in east anglia erm sorry that's true for the north and the south west in east anglia er output also has been flat erm but that seems to be related to weakness in export demand in the region erm export was the UNK er in that region of any region throughout the u k although total optimism is strong so it seems to be the case erm though business is being done the export economy erm in east anglia
finally northern ireland shows that there has been decline in output over the UNK four months and the only region t to say that erm it's fair to say that north northern ireland has been a weak region throughout er the recession erm and although in this survey optimism has UNK up a bit so it's close to the u k average it's nevertheless a part of the u k which has really been behaving er rather differently from the rest of the economy reflecting its sort of i its particular problems and the fact that it's not part of the mainland economy
so that's what's been going on in terms of output in terms of orders already received orders are up in all mainland regions of the u k it's the first time that we've seen that since er the beginning of the recession and that's the sense in which we think one can say erm reasonably sort of er UNK that the recovery has indeed spread around the mainland economy
again yorkshire and humberside er scotland and wales tending to lead that erm all of them as i said have got strong output trends erm in terms of yorkshire and humberside the orders er seem to be very much domestic rather than export but widely spread between sectors which gives
reassurance to them
south east also doing well and in the south east looking at the it seems to be the case one can't put too strong an el too strong erm a sort of weight on it but it seems to be the case that in the south east it's the food drink and tobacco sector and chemicals which are tending to lead the way there erm scotland also strong export demand
orders growth has been less strong in other regions
the north which is consistent with the output story and the south west again consistent south west has seen falls in export orders for s three surveys in a row now erm the north west again export orders flat and again down in northern ireland
going from there to and that's a sort of history of where things have happened over the previous four UNK four months to expectations about output this is the first survey since the recession began in which all regions mainland regions of the u k say that they expect output to increase over the coming four months
admittedly in one or two cases the UNK is fairly marginal but nevertheless it's the first time all the numbers have been positive
the regions which are leading are in some cases different from those which have been leading in terms of the historic trends over the last four months
erm east midlands erm expect to do well and that continues a reasonably firm trend
east anglia also expects to do well and that seems to er stock numbers indicate an end to de stocking in east anglia and that being the explanation
south east very much consistent with past orders and with expectations of orders both total and export so in this case it's sort of the export total story as well as the domestic demand story helping the region
and the west midlands for four or five surveys we've seen strong total orders broadly based between se sectors strong output trends so the west midlands being our leading er region is consistent with what we've seen from other surveys
erm and then the UNK regions coming through the north west the south west wales and northern ireland
i think it's fair to say particularly in the case of wales which is perhaps one of the more surprising erm elements there wales as you know has tended to be quite a strong region during the recovery period erm it may be because er certain i think a lot of although as i say wales is a UNK region in terms of the expected
expected over the next four months it's nevertheless from a reasonably high level because it's done well so far erm and i wouldn't want to over stress the sense in which wales is perhaps not doing as well as the others
erm it would be wrong to say wales is a weak region on the basis of this it's just not doesn't appear or doesn't expect to grow as strongly as it was growing
that's the sort of the general trend erm and from there we can go on to other things
as far as employment
is concerned erm we ask er companies questions about the trend in employment over the past four months and the expected trend and we then calculate from that and the numbers are at the back of the book pages seven page seventy one basically and on the graphs which follow
we calculate that on an estimate of what we think has happened to employment in the quarter erm and that calculation tells us and it seems to be re reasonably right in the sense that it's got a good tr a good record of tracking erm the official numbers when they eventually come out
since the that methodology tells us that although employment has been cut erm in the first quarter of this year on our UNK er calculations in many regions of the economy with the south east particularly hard hit well in one region the west midlands for the first time we're seeing an increase in employment
now admittedly it's an increase of two thousand out of about half a million so one isn't sort of er getting over excited about it but nevertheless it's the first upward number which we've had
so employment tending to er level off there at er at the er level
investment has turned positive overall at the u k level and the regions which are leading investment expectations and this is people's expectations about what they're going to do in terms of investment in plant and machinery over the year ahead which i think is probably the meaningful one to focus on rather than buildings numbers erm the two regions which are leading that are the south west erm and that makes sense because the south west is has the lowest number of firms who say that they're working below capacity and also the west midlands for the last five surveys the west midlands has either been the most optimistic
region in terms of the general business conditions or the second most optimistic so it's not entirely surprising that they now say that they expect to invest on the back of the strength of that optimism
domestic prices only three regions expect prices to increase by a meaningful amount
erm they are yorkshire and humberside which i think is probably related to the strength of orders and demand in that region east midlands where they where it's sort of consistent with a trend erm in the last few surveys where they say that they have achieved modest price rises erm and where costs have not been falling erm and also wales
but nevertheless it's im important to remember that this is a survey erm which is conducted at the time of year when most UNK or many companies raise their list prices and if one looks at the past sort of record of this survey both at the regional level and the national level one generally does see a bit of an UNK in the pr in the prices numbers at this time of year because people are raising their list prices erm and once you allow for that erm i think these numbers are er very good in terms of prices trends very low for the time of year
the other thing on that sort of erm side is that this is the first survey which we've had since we started doing the survey in nineteen eighty eight when the first numbers were compiled it's the first survey which we've had where the majority of UNK manufacturers say that their unit costs have already fallen erm we haven't seen that before so the majority of regions said that the costs had fallen
erm all that sort of leads me back to where i started from our perception of this survey is that it's encouraging in the sense that it suggests that the recovery in the economy is erm widening and UNK if you like it's widening in the sense that it's spreading to all the mainland regions of the u k and it's UNK in the sense that erm firstly although there are regional variations within this it's clearly not purely an export story and it's not purely a domestic story it's a mixture of the two which gives us some reassurance erm it's also UNK in the sense that there's no evidence from the survey of anything which is likely to trip up the recovery in the short term and remember that most of these er questions relate to the next four months not all of them but mo most of them relate to the next four months so one doesn't want to UNK too far forward but nevertheless if you look at erm er most obviously sort of the crisis and the inflation questions if you look at er
political and economic conditions abroad which has declined the constraint on exports in six out of out of er the eleven regions you see no evidence of any UNK constraints likely to trip up the recovery
i'm not saying it's not gonna happen but there is no evidence to suggest that it will from the survey
thank you richard
questions ladies and gentlemen
er just one question i don't really understand the erm employment levels
erm on page seventy one it says london and the south east shows manufacturing employment still falling is it the sin that war then this would seriously affect the alliance the nato alliance
in other words we were we were considerably concerned about the extent of the war
now you can see what would have happened if UNK advice had been followed
the original objective was to UNK south korea it then began to unite korea but if you raise the objective to an assault on china proper then you would have to quote general UNK who was a commander on the spot er you'd be fighting the wrong war the wrong time and in the wrong place
what would be the purpose of that UNK
and the answer was nothing unless you actually wish to attack china and er defeat china through military means and the task of doing that of course was enormously out of proportion to the original er cause of the war
er the UNK missiles crisis
now here you had a very different situation because the nuclear dimension was now starting to become very important
the erm UNK of that crisis was the attempt made by the soviet union to UNK erm medium range missile bases on cuba
and president truman sorry er president erm kennedy er a democrat it's democrats that always seem to get involved in these kinds of wars as was the case in the vietnam war erm er president kennedy in fact took this to be er a radical change in the strategic balance and th this is the way the crisis was represented
but in fact the problem was the position of UNK and of the communist regime in cuba
the er UNK claimed that these missiles were not offensive and indeed the weren't offensive
the united states had the same sort of missiles in italy and in turkey and before this crisis had developed president kennedy had in fact ordered them er to be er returned to the united states these missiles had no strategic purpose at all because a major change that had come into the strategic equation was the arrival of the UNK missile and it was these missiles really which held the strategic balance er and were to change in fact UNK both international politics and global strategy over the years to come but i'm going to talk about that later the point i'm making here is that er UNK claimed that the missiles were there in the event of an american assault on cuba they were a deterrent weapon in exactly the same way as the defensive deterrent weapons er were d were defensive er for er the united states and for the soviet union
and the context in which this was er argued er was er the bay of pigs invasion of cuba a c i a american supported invasion er which er failed very badly but which certainly indicated the american desire to get rid of UNK and er UNK was UNK in effect that he had as much right to defend an UNK as the united states had er to defend erm its allies and in the same sort of way
now kennedy had a dilemma although cuba was in the UNK and although the united states had the biggest navy in the world and the biggest UNK and was easily able to UNK cuba if it wa if it wished to it was vulnerable however in other areas in particular it was vulnerable in UNK and it was vulnerable in UNK china
in nineteen sixty one prior to the crisis the americans had to face the rather UNK settlement in UNK by which they accepted a communist erm er government or at least a government which had communist members erm kennedy wanted to intervene in UNK but again was UNK by his british UNK wouldn't in fact accept er that we should get involved in a ground war in UNK china
er in the case of UNK the er situation there was er that russia er of course the soviet union could intervene in UNK more or less at will given that it was a small island in east germany and was always a vulnerable always in a position of being a UNK
so kennedy couldn't act UNK he couldn't simply do what he wanted to do which was to get rid of UNK because if he'd done that then his policy objectives in other parts of the world would be in UNK
he couldn't threaten the soviet union directly because the soviet union was a nuclear power and couldn't be threatened er so the course of action he took was intended to be moderate and to secure the objective solely of removing the missiles from cuba not of doing anything about the UNK government or the regime or anything of that sort
and so they came to a negotiated settlement by which the UNK agreed to withdraw the missiles and the united states promised that they would not interfere with UNK again although from that day to this they have maintained of course their economic UNK
er and here you have a case of UNK er and the UNK of war and possibly nuclear war erm UNK out
limits were set in short by both sides on what they sought to do and how they sought to do it and these limits erm weren't self evident at the time i can tell you because the american military the UNK of staff on the executive committee that discussed this an and took the decisions were all in favour of making s air strikes on these bases and possibly er an er an armed intervention and so the military advice here er was er was rather similar to that of UNK that is turn the crisis into er a different kind of crisis turn it in fact into a war
now thirdly the vietnam war now this was perhaps the most UNK war the americans ever got themselves involved in and has had deep and permanent effects upon american policy making to this very day
now what were the limits so far as the vietnam war was concerned
well initially the united states genuinely believed that with a small force perhaps about a hundred thousand maybe two hundred thousand troops but principally using air power that they could prevent the north UNK from helping the UNK in the south and thus continuing the civil war
now one can make judgments about means and indeed as i was saying in my last lecture the actual capability of the weapons you have can only really be found out when you use them and then you can see very often that they are in fact UNK
now wa the erm war began with operation rolling UNK and this was erm er president UNK plan er to pound major targets in north vietnam by aerial UNK and make the cost of their intervention in the south very high so high that they would cut off the UNK cord and UNK the UNK into submission through ground operations in the south
that was the basic plan
he started off as did truman in the united nations by trying to get the security council to adopt a resolution er calling er the north UNK and UNK er an american i e u n intervention
this failed
it failed because the french and the british were unhappy about supporting such a move and indeed the united nations looked very likely er to be more erm willing to condemn the united states than it was to condemn north vietnam but the view of most countries in the world at that time was that north UNK that north and south vietnam were part of the same country that the UNK in nineteen fifty four which called for UNK should be UNK and that the united states was UNK in a south east asian country for no good reason
so it is a hostile atmosphere and so hostile was it in the united nations that the americans decided to UNK it and what they did was to UNK erm an article which called for the removal of votes from those states who were in who were in arrears in the payment of their dues of their funds and there were several countries in that category two of them the soviet union and france and the reason why they had not pal paid their dues was because they objected to the use of the these funds for UNK forces which had not been authorized by the security council in their argument the security council was the supreme authority and the general assembly had in fact not the right to UNK er UNK activities and indeed if you read the charter this is the case although legal advice is conflicting on that point as it usually is
erm well the solution to that was to hold the meetings of the general assembly where the hostile american majority was but not to permit a vote to be taken on any resolution and this meant that president UNK could pursue his then secret plan of bombing the north without any hostile united nations resolution being passed against it
two years later the americans quietly dropped the whole issue and the un returned to normal but by that time of course the situation had become what it was er a war
well limits then so air UNK and the use of some ground forces but principally to get er the south UNK army er to contest er the UNK on the ground
well that failed as you would imagine it to fail if you take the civil war in vietnam as being in effect a war of national UNK as the UNK called it because what the north UNK wanted was in fact national unity
they were fighting for an objective which was far more important than local arrangements or local agreements er with er foreign imperial powers about who governed what er in their own country
and so they were prepared to go on taking the punishment taking the cost because their objectives were ha had a different scale of value to the objectives sought by the united states
two or three years later with half a million troops they are still no further forward in their struggle in vietnam and the cost this time was to the united UNK political system because the effect upon domestic politics was fairly severe
after the north UNK revealed that they were able to sustain erm a w er their war in er erm the south it seemed regardless of what the united states could do to them er after they'd revealed this in the UNK offensive of nineteen sixty eight then president UNK announced he would not be standing for re election and that was a significant admission of political defeat and if you remember well you probably won't remember but you certainly should've read about it president UNK was returned with a majority er on the platform of ending the vietnam war
the casualties i think were something like fifty seven thousand dead and a very large number of people wounded because of the particularly UNK kind of war with all kinds of weapons being used
now why was the united states defeated and was this war a rational war
well the objective was the maintenance of a friendly regime er in a country which had become part of the american sphere of influence
no one however at the time questioned why it was necessary to do that
what was the significance of keeping south vietnam in the american fold
no one asked that question they simply focused upon er the communist UNK in t any more questions ladies and gentlemen
if not there are some drinks at the back and you can ask us any questions informally
thank you very much for coming
thank you
yeah
i'll give you the five later
the overall problem area was possibly introducing the buyer's guide
really
possibly and sometimes the c q
yeah
i think it w it can get a little bit over UNK and i think that may be well fear of the c q or fear of the buyer's guide but it shouldn't cause any problems in the real world and i think the more you do then you'll realize that er they're not gonna say oh my goodness me stop leave now i must speak to an independent financial adviser
yeah what's one of them erm and the c q is a structured UNK are you happy just to take down one or two details will that be okay
mm
and just end of subject move on
and if they wanna look at it then let them it's not the end of the world
cos some people do want to examine what they're gonna but the vast majority just sit back and ignore it
so it shouldn't be that much of a problem but i do recommend erm this weekend amongst the many other things to look at the c q or at some time before you go out in the big wide world and do it for real to look at the c q and pull it apart so you know what each box is actually for
i know you have done a c q on yourself and we've looked at each page in detail but i think until you actually do it yourself and maybe write little UNK to let you know what's on the next page so you can UNK it most effectively to move round the c q as opposed to you UNK er as opposed to it driving you can drive it but that should be done in the UNK of time but i do recommend you do it before you actually do your first full appointment cos it might pay you
right if there are no further questions then on step one we're now gonna move on to surprise step two
and what is step two then er bill
explore their needs
yeah exploration of needs
and what do we mean by exploration of needs then barry
sorry
what do we mean by the exploration of needs then
i'm so i'm sorry i didn't realize you'd started
erm
asking questions o generally open questions maybe sometimes closed questions
yeah
just to get erm th the customer's attitude to things and erm
what's the purpose of erm what is the real purpose of exploring someone's needs
you're right
UNK
in what you're saying
UNK
yeah UNK yeah
so we then find you can get them to do something about it
and yes you ask and open probe but follow up with secondary and UNK open UNK what they mean if you broke your back and couldn't pay the bills how would you suffer what would what would be the problems if god UNK you did die last night what would you want your family to have how much do you want them to have when do you want them to have it what would they go without if they didn't have it okay so they start building mental pictures rather than saying okay you need hundred thousand pounds worth of life assurance because that's a fact
mm
and we sell to emotions as opposed to just hard factual information
so we explore we probe and you can probe in a variety of different ways but what are the three UNK we have that you come across
getting back to the successful sales course day
UNK
summary
yes summary statements
okay and what's the purpose of a summary statement
the questionnaire
yeah
definitely yeah because there
what does that tell the customer
you're listening to
you're listening
you are listening to what they told you and you got the right picture you know the right facts and the right details and the right emotions so you can go back and cover the right plan of attack so you can sell them products they actually want and not what you think they
because this has happened time and time again and yes they do need more life cover or they do need a UNK policy or a savings plan
erm and people will take on board different methods of being UNK some will respond to audio UNK some will re respond to some visual UNK er UNK er ideas you know the ones we looked at last week like the old peggy symbols and erm the cheque book UNK and life assurance the ten percent rule and there is one another which we can look at another UNK called er erm some of you may have come across it before others may not and is hey so mr prospect if you hadn't made an adequate retirement plan what financial problems do you think you or family could have
and see what he comes back with
what affect will that have upon you or your family if you made inadequate erm pension provision
have we got notes on this er
i've got a handout for this one what would you and your family have to give up in retirement if you'd made inadequate provision
could you really survive on twenty four pounds a week or whatever the benefits would be
and finally how do you feel about that
and if his
his response is well what do you mean you're a bit worried about it how worried are you
who's come across that before
t s b
mhm
yeah cos that's where i got it from
ha
well the other thing you put on the end of that is after saying how do you feel about that how would your wife feel about that
oh yes yeah
you pitch it at
don't you
yeah
give yourself mrs prospect how do you feel about having
pounds
pounds a week you know you know the kids are off your hand pounds a week would pay your would just cover your er your food bill
yeah for life insurance savings er any erm investment product we have to offer or based on and around that because they're all open UNK and you're gaining his thoughts and feelings
mm
so try it this afternoon and see how you get on
so if we've er if we've explored the needs satisfactorily there may be more than one need there may be a need for life insurance pension planning some form of UNK maybe they want to save for their future or
their investments
so what should come next
priority
yes UNK and UNK
who does that UNK
the customer
the client
the client
yeah let them do it we've covered a variety of different areas investments life assurance protection etcetera on a scale of one to se one to seven which is the most important one being that the er your number one priority and get them to UNK it
so they're telling you what their needs are how concerned they are about it and what they wanna do about it because they're more inclined to take your advice when they see you second time round because telling isn't selling
let them tell you let them paint pictures
so yes we UNK and summarize the needs
so again there's some UNK so just to clarify things we're looking at primarily life insurance for yourself and your wife savings plan for your daughter UNK say in six months' time and pension planning is the least of your main concerns today would that be the case yeah i guess so
so you check your understanding and you've listened to what the guy has said
so you're UNK what you wanna do and where you wanna go
so you've UNK and summarized what do we need to tell them that we're gonna do now
take it away back to the office
yeah that's the whole thing we've gathered all the information now we UNK been there an hour an a half maybe two hours depending upon the appointment so you go back to the office and work on a plan of attack
now at this UNK here you wouldn't actually say what products you're gonna do cos you're not gonna go back and say well i'm thinking of er two hundred thousand pounds of UNK term assurance and we're looking personal pension plan but you'll tell the guy you're gonna go back to the branch we've got a variety of different things sir and what i wanna do is to go back to the branch and work on one or two ideas for you and then present them to you at some time in the future
yeah
so the guy knows what you're gonna do and more importantly you're gonna come back and see him again
cos why is that important
so he doesn't
sorry
to remove the pressure from him there
yeah okay you're not perceived as a wonder going in there and closing a sale while you're er
objection make sure
yes
that you're gonna get er they realize you're gonna come back to do the sale
exactly yeah
and if there's an objection you wanna know about it now
cos there's no point in coming back and doing a second appointment and just go through the motions cos that will lead to what
if the guy doesn't know why you're coming back
further objections
more objections
do you think he might be committed to do anything there and then
no
not a in hell
present your recommendations to him and he'll say well yeah i'd like to think about it and you go off then oh fair enough then so you go back to the branch and the second becomes a third
mm
and the third might become a fourth the fourth unlikely to become a fifth and you think what a waste of time that was
okay
don't waste your time
forty appointments a week is hard work you wanna make sure they're productive appointments
so we've arranged a second appointment he knows we're gonna come back what could what should we be asking for at this point
referrals
er referrals yeah okay
now if you've planted a seed or if you haven't planted a seed then are we in a strong enough position there to ask about the people we dis we discussed on completion of the er first appointment
no
not at all are we
why is that
you've come to the end of your appointment and then suddenly to just say okay tell me about these people
yeah
he's not gonna want to know
hang on a second you know what's this all about then
so what we can do at this point here mr prospect if you cast your mind back to when we first met tell me how you feel how do you how do you feel today has gone now what should he say
fine thanks very beneficial yeah
something er i it's unlikely to be a negative response so if you
hopefully it's gonna be some form of positive response i'm glad you should say that because if you cast your mind back to when we first talked i did say that if you were happy and only if you're happy
half a dozen introductions
now we spoke about bob smith or whoever tell me what's his telephone number because i'd like to meet the guy and see what he says
one of two things happen he'll ei he'll either say yeah okay and give you the number or what might happen
he might say he'd like to speak to the guy first
yeah the chances are he may throw an objection up
yeah
and say well hang on a second and what do you do with objections
UNK
UNK them knowledge probe answer and confirm
no problem mr prospect i'm glad you feel that way however i am seeing you in a UNK time have a chat with him between then and now and when i see you next week i'll ta or whenever the UNK be i'll take his telephone number from you then
would that be okay and how's he gonna feel
yeah the UNK off him straight away
yeah
okay but can you see the
if you don't bring it up a at the first part with plan to proceed you can't do it here
if you can't do it here you can't do it at the beginning of the second appointment if you can't do it there then the chances are you'll do it right at the end and if you haven't made the sale i guarantee you won't ask
guarantee it
so at the end of each appointment you want a result and a result is either the business or introductions hopefully both so i hang on the importance again
so we've planted a seed and we either get introductions there and then or we've UNK the way to the pick them up at the second appointment
now when do you feel the lion share of objections are gonna come
really
when do you feel he's gonna UNK the most and say hang on
oh er what the business or
yeah when do you feel that the majority of objections are gonna come out or the strongest objections
the point of sale
yeah really yeah
the second appointment when you've done your you've gone through the presentation you've done your benefit statements and you say right is this the policy
starts today that's when the lion share of objections are gonna come out
you're always gonna have objections i think you've seen so far throughout the whole sales process some are more awkward than others but you got by them but the majority will come when you ask for the business or go to ask for the business
so what would you feel is the sort of objections you might get out there
er i wanna think about it
can i leave it for now
i wanna think about it
absolutely
yeah
i wanna talk to somebody else
speak to somebody else yeah
can't afford it
yeah
changed my mind
er different quote i need a quote
can i speak to someone else
oh right i thought that meant
you know wife or father in law
no it could be another adviser it could be their accountant solicitor somebody else if i may
hasn't got the authority
might need his wife there to do it oh right
sorry
he could ask why do i need it
yeah
erm okay do i need it or changed mind
i didn't realize you wanted to sign up the business today
erm
well the thing is if at that meeting you don't say what is gonna happen at the second meeting
yeah erm don't do it now don't do it now
can i say
yes fine mm
any more
i think those are i think quite realistic objections that you are going to come across
big battle with them
so how can we UNK this happening
you tell him exactly what's gonna happen at the next meeting and providing what you present meets his needs and is within his budget will he be proceeding
yeah
get the budget
get the budget
so who has heard of anna before
yeah
okay which in a UNK says exactly which one could
so what does the first a of anna stand for then
authority
authority
yeah okay
justified
at our next meeting is there anyone else you need to consult before making the decision to proceed now at this point it's coming to the end of the first appointment you're pretty sure you're on your way so the pressure is off he's feeling fairly relaxed and hopefully he's enjoyed the whole sale process with you so what should his re his response be
he should say well no i can't think of anybody
well if it does then you need to know it now why do you need to know now
get them there
get them there UNK it okay because you want to save your time
you don't wanna go and present to somebody when he says well i've from UNK or standard life
so what objection does that remove from this little er
speak to someone else
speak to someone else
get rid of that one there yeah
anyone else
anything else rather
sorry
no
okay
what's the first n
needs
needs
needs
yeah
mr client are you happy we've addressed all your needs during the discussions today
now the chances are he's gonna say well yeah i thought so because the size of the c q makes them identify just about everything so far but in case we have missed something
what objections does needs get rid of
what does that need remove from these objections
do i need it
do i need it
yeah any more
it should get away it should get rid of think about it UNK thought
mm
okay we'll look at that
the second n
now
at our next meeting mr client i shall not only be making recommendations but i will be explaining how each recommended product works for you in great detail
recommendations happy with them is there any reason why we'll not be able to proceed without delay
what does that get rid of
erm think about it
ask to think about it
can't afford it
don't do it now
don't do it now
don't do it now yeah
change your mind
change your mind i suppose yeah mhm
it might get rid of that as well it might do
and the last a
amount
okay
and finally mr prospect mr client rather are you in agreement that the amount of money whatever it is which is available to implement these re those recommendations
what does that now get rid of
can't afford it
can't afford it
UNK enough
UNK eh doo now i don't care in what order you do anna it could be UNK i don't give a UNK
or UNK i don't care so long you include it at the end of your first appointments because at the end of the day all you're doing is saving yourself a bit of time and that's the whole purpose of anna to make sure that when you go back on your second appointment this guy is committed to do something
so when your managers speak to you at the beginning of a er of your monday morning meeting to say gerald how much business have you got landed for next week you can say with conviction two definite cases
if you don't do it it'll be two possibly UNK because you're not too sure you've got to go back to the second appointment and he might do it but then again he may not
so who are you UNK
yourself
us
you've gotta be hard on yourselves and say this is my business i can't afford to waste time i want to deal with people that wanna do business with me
so you want strong effective second appointments by doing strong thorough UNK
i've got a handout for on this one
UNK away like
i think it should be part of the selection procedure how to do shorthand
so that is step two
the exploration ne the exploration of needs by open UNK erm UNK by visual er UNK using peggy use whatever tools you have available at your UNK but don't move on until you feel the guy is either totally not committed to do something or sufficiently disturbed to do something
again be aware you don't go completely UNK
summarize those needs cos there may be more than one and tell him what you're gonna do what is the plan of attack when you're gonna see the guy again and when we do our business building up you can take it back to erm the benefits of him introducing us to other people by keeping policy charges down and increasing bonuses whenever possible cos it's in his benefit he introduces us to others so we don't have to advertise or very rarely advertise
and then very importantly the last UNK anna cos that really is belt and UNK it's tying the whole thing up so the guy knows exactly why you're gonna come back
yeah
any qu any questions
do you ken
yes i do
good
right
well now we'll now look at the second part of the er sales video as a help first and again give you an example a flavour of how to conduct the next set of role plays
is that loud enough for you
yeah great
step two exploration of needs
this part of the selling process is directed towards finding out about your client and completing the c q with all clients you must attempt to complete all relevant areas of the c q this includes gathering hard facts date of birth UNK status dependants hobbies and so on
soft facts are also important as they'll help you to get to know your client better to understand their feelings views and aspirations in a number of areas
at the same time look for referral opportunities for example if a group hobby has been identified then who does your client do that hobby with
and when you're about to complete the c q you must make it clear that the information given to you and subsequently transferred to the c q is in UNK confidence
you should also give your client an indication of how long the appointment is going to take
as i said before i need to take one or two notes about your current financial situation and i'd like to draw your attention to the fact that any information you give me will be treated in the UNK of confidence
is that alright
yes that sounds fine
but tell me how long will all this take
oh er about an hour on average it does depend on your circumstances
it is important that i put myself in a position to be able to give you the best possible advice
fine
okay let's get started then
er graham davis is that your full name
no it's graham kenneth davis
fine thank you
and your wife's name
er janet
okay so we've looked at your current income and expenditure what i'd like to do now is move on to the future
at what age do you hope to retire
oh sixty five i suppose
okay so imagine you were sixty five years today how much of your current income would you want
all of it
most of my clients say that
and what arrangements have you made for that
oh i haven't er i suppose i'm expecting the state to support me
yes unfortunately though it's getting less likely that anyone can rely on that
if you had retired yesterday and you hadn't made proper arrangements what impact would this have on your way of life
well erm the mortgage would be paid off and er so we would have the house and erm i guess we would receive the state pension
yes that would be around eighty pounds a week
and the children would be off our hands by then
well that's true but what would you want to do
what do you mean
well on top of the expense of maintaining the house and the car you may want to continue any hobbies you may have or take more holidays
you may even have grandchildren by that stage and so you'll probably want to help them
how would you afford it
i don't know
you see these are the sorts of issues we must address to ensure you can maintain your current lifestyle
do you agree it's a concern
mm
can i just check you're not currently in a pension scheme are you
no i'm not
and you couldn't join one
no my employer refused to consider it
he was quite UNK
well we should also look into you contracting out of UNK
has that been suggested to you before
yes but erm
once you've established your client's needs in this area of the c q and completed the relative parts move on to the next
okay so we've looked at how to ensure you have a happy retirement but what would happen to your family if you were to die before that
well i haven't given it much thought but er if i were to die i wouldn't want my wife and family to suffer
so that's protection is important to you
have you made a will at all
no that's er that's something else we've been meaning to do
if you had made a will who would be the major beneficiary
er basically who would you like the money to go to if you were to die
well my wife and family
so on your death you'd want your estate to pass on to your wife and then on her death to the children is that correct
yes that's about right
had you died last night what would they have
well the mortgage would be paid off and er well i do have some life insurance
oh good
do you know how much or what income it does provide
er the mortgage is for fifty thousand pounds and i think my life insurance policy would pay out about forty five thousand pounds
right
okay so the mortgage is paid but what do you suggest your wife does with the forty five thousand pounds
oh i guess she'd have to invest it
well that makes sense but we can't be sure what the interest rate would be
now er your wife and family would receive around four thousand pounds a year to live on is that what you want to happen
well no that's not enough they couldn't survive on that
what would you want them to have
well i'm not too sure but well at least enough to pay all the bills and have a bit left over
can you put a figure to that
erm say about eight hundred pounds a month
so that works out to around ten thousand pounds a year
how important to you is it that your wife and family can have this protection
it's very important
mm
very important
well now you've made me stop and think about it four thousand pounds a year is nothing
ah but she will get something from the state won't she
oh yes she should receive the UNK pension of around fifty six pounds a week
is that all
i'm afraid so
so combining the state benefits with your own life insurance that still only provides around seven thousand pounds a year
how do you feel about that
it's pretty UNK stuff isn't it
well it can be if you were to die without leaving proper protection for your family as premature death isn't just one death but three the death of a father the death of a husband and the death of a salary
unfortunately i can do nothing about the first two but it is my responsibility to protect your salary so that your wife and family are looked after
so if she needs around ten thousand pounds where's the extra three thousand pounds a year gonna come from
i don't know
i guess that's where you come in
yeah
UNK material
appointment all areas should have been discussed
at the end of this process you must establish how important each area is to your client
we've discussed several areas today the effects of retiring from work on little or no income the consequences of your premature death on the lifestyle of your family the result of ill health on your standard of living and providing you with a custom built savings plan
is there anything else you'd like to discuss
no i think we've covered just about everything
if we were to UNK these needs on a one to seven basis one being the most important and seven the least which would be the number one priority
well i feel that er protecting my income if i were to die would be the most important thing at the moment and er possibly er making some provision for my retirement
that's probably all we would want to look at for the time being
okay
in order that i can make my recommendations realistic how much do you feel you can UNK invest on a monthly basis to protect your wife and family and make provision for your retirement
er let's say a hundred and fifty pounds a month towards a pension and er maybe fifty pounds towards life protection
okey doke that's fine
and you're sure you're comfortable with that amount
yes that's fine
okay i'll put together some ideas based on the areas we've discussed today and if we can arrange a time for me to come back i can present my recommendations to you
that's fine
again ensure that your client is happy with everything and
any queries before arranging your second appointment
so when would be the best time for me to come back and present these ideas to you
well we're going on holiday next week so it will have to be after that
erm how about three weeks from today
er fine yes that's fine yeah about what time
this is the best time to take your client back to the introductions you mentioned earlier
tell me have you found today's discussions to be of benefit
yes very much so
it's amazing how much we all trust to luck and hope that it will never happen to us
yes
if you cast your mind back to when we first spoke and how we build our business by word of mouth introductions i'd like the opportunity of meeting one or two of your colleagues and introducing them to our service
well er i i'm not sure that they're really interested in insurance
well i can appreciate that
i just want to exchange one or two ideas with them which they may find to be of benefit
erm you mentioned your brother earlier and er geoff from the sports and social club i'd like to give them a call do you have the numbers
well let me speak to my brother first but erm give geoff a call i know that he's looking for something
geoff banks is that it
yeah
thank you
yeah here we are geoff banks nine four o
aha
you should proceed to support these referrals with age occupation family circumstances and so on
anna is a UNK for authority needs now and amount and has to be introduced at the end of the first appointment
it's used to gain a firm commitment that your client will proceed with your product recommendations on the second appointment
in order to clarify my thinking mr davis when you receive my recommendations at our meeting is there anyone else you would need to consult before making a decision to proceed
no i don't think so
and do you feel we've addressed all your needs today
yes definitely
good
so the next time we meet providing your happy and you understand all my recommendations is there any reason why we couldn't proceed
no er provided i understand
and you agree that two hundred pounds a month is available and affordable to implement those recommendations
yeah
great fine i think we're done
thanks for your time
not at all
you can then close your first appointment with some form of appropriate sociability
when dealing with step two remember to probe and explore your client's needs summarize and UNK them then get permission to proceed with your product recommendations
you can then arrange your second appointment and request any referrals and finally anna
right
there you have it the way to conduct your second er your er step two within the first appointment
any questions or comments
okay
then at this UNK here i'll now nominate what products you'll be working with and you'll have these two products throughout today and tomorrow
so robert barry and UNK you'll be doing role play number one which is linked around life assurance
joan diane and max will be on p h i which is role play number two bill roger and UNK you'll be looking at pensions and rob you'll be just doing savings
so in groups b and c role play it'll be your nominated product okay you won't have to do one on savings yeah
so maybe you'll end up doing er two life assurance pe two life assurance presentations or to p h i or two pensions and the benefit of that this way is that you all can see at least one presentation and one UNK around a different product as opposed to the one you're working with
is that clear everybody
mhm
right
so know that if you now refer back to the book that i've given you this morning and if you turn to where it says okay it says stop here do not read on
if you can subsequently turn over from there you'll see inverted commas first appointment skills
excuse me i just have to rush over here for no real reason and touch something and rush back again
you can have this one
okay the second part of first appointment skill role play i e step two the exploit of needs is to be conducted using the appropriate page of the UNK c q which relates to your nominated product
so for life assurance it'll be page twelve of the c q but it's role play number one
the p h i is role play number two pensions is role play number three and savings is role play number four
so if you can turn to the appropriate part of your book that relates to your nominated role play
assume that you've done all other pages of the c q and this is the last page to be addressed
even these ones that you haven't done in between
er yeah can i just read this out and i'll explain
