er we did it erm er just after UNK when er we started backing the white russians and erm before we write off erm everything the communist er government of er russia has done over the last seventy years as being evil what i think we've got to be aware of is that we may once more be UNK the forces of nationalism which in UNK and i think of going up er in the period in the thirties very much lead to erm two world wars and er i'd like to know more about er some of the forces the so called democratic forces that are backing erm mr yeltsin
well i don't think there's any danger of us UNK the nationalism
the nationalism is there at the end of the lead already isn't it
yes but er i think that erm before we champion er or back er people like mr yeltsin and say that they rep represent progressive forces i'd like to be clear about where those forces see themselves going because i don't see nationalism as a progressive force in the er in the last decade of the twentieth century i think we need to be concentrating on those people who are trying to build a new international order rather than splitting things up in the soviet union in a way which may be UNK
professor UNK how worrying is this rise of nationalism in the narrow sense of the word and er your concerns about UNK by UNK yeltsin that concerns the republics er which might suffer considerably UNK for example has always been er some sort of conflict with its neighbour like
yes
well some of these national conflicts have been artificially created by the soviet state but of course some of them haven't like the UNK border conflict that's been going on for centuries it was existed before the soviet and it's gonna go on existing after it
erm i think UNK threat as it were to the UNK is actually a UNK move he wants UNK to remain within the soviet union er and if it does so he's not going to make an issue of the border but er if it does break away completely i think what he's saying is well there's a UNK that we're going to have to UNK because large eastern areas of UNK including huge industrial towns are predominantly UNK by russians
now of course if UNK were to give er water tight guarantees of cultural UNK to those russians then probably that would cease to be a serious pointed issue
president of er has warned that there could be a real and serious civil war and the conflict that there is between UNK people and UNK i'm not sure that i understand it but i suppose it has some similarities to so many other conflicts we see around the world northern ireland er yugoslavia just it goes back hundreds of years and
yes well it's the classic UNK christian UNK you know it's like southern spain in the middle ages and so on you know
i was being UNK by central authorities for so long but now they've taken the lid off
that's right it's been UNK under a kind of blanket and that blanket has now been taken off
er president of UNK of course he's president of a country where again northern UNK has a huge russian compact russian population that might want to break away
now if these issues are badly handled yes there could be civil war between the republics
UNK is er ringing up now from london what are your concerns
yes er i'm very worried about this aspect of er whose finger er on the nuclear trigger because the nuclear referee in the soviet union is divided between mainly peace states russia UNK and now UNK yeltsin has said that he is going to protect his russian UNK in UNK and now i fear that if that comes to some kind of a conflict then it'll be very uncertain as to what arrangement could be made about er UNK international agreement and about ultimately too er any kind of nuclear er congregation
well UNK yeltsin this morning has said that he wants a UNK over the use of nuclear weapons and about ninety percent of which i think are on russian soil that perhaps can be interpreted additional safeguard to have another UNK
you've got to get UNK agreement before anyone can press the trigger or is this actually much more dangerous than it sounds is he saying we want to take over the nuclear weapons
well again it could be UNK if things get out of hand but er and i think the UNK warning in that respect is fully justified
er the former soviet republics are going to have to decide what kind of defensive alliance they want among themselves
UNK for example is already stated in its er declaration of UNK that it regards itself as a non nuclear zone so they're not going to want nuclear weapons for themselves and er i imagine that the former republics will have to quite a comprehensive military alliance perhaps on the lines of nato and that nuclear weapons will be vested in that alliance
russia will be the leader of that alliance and therefore like america nato will probably have the UNK say on what's done with those nuclear weapons
that's how i see things UNK er but it must be said that russian UNK have got to have this self restraint not to abuse those nuclear weapons just as the united states has had to
of course if independent republics do get control of their own weapons it's blown out of the water their non UNK treaty caught you hasn't it
yes of course it is and er that points er to the danger of a the UNK of the soviet union i
this is an area in which we legitimately can get involved do you think
beg your pardon
do you think this is an area in which we can legitimately get involved
yes most certainly because er the point is that er we're involved er with the erm er and the UNK of the start of an agreement and er i think that the west er therefore has er direct er responsibility also in this matter and er i fear that er ten percent er alright ten percent of the nuclear UNK is in UNK is in and er we do not er have some kind of proper arrangement being er agreed too
then er even one percent of nuclear UNK that er could be used is a danger to world congregation and i fear very much er that unless there is some kind of a proper cast iron guarantee er with the UNK to the soviet union er there's going to be much er trouble especially if er there is an ethnic violence er UNK on the borders and again er UNK yeltsin has said that er he is going to want to control er the position on the borders well he may not get the agreement that he seeks er one hopes that he will but he may not
okay from er high UNK are you fearful of what's developing or are you delighted at events
i'm absolutely delighted
i'm quite amazed that the question has even been asked you know that er that er is this a good thing i mean er presumably the people that are arguing that it's not a good thing and that are concerned about events are actually UNK er these people seem to think that it's okay for a country to be occupied er like poland was occupied by germany and UNK and france that's okay er and in fact you know we should just turn a blind eye to it and just let it carry on forever
i'll be arguing that the end of UNK and communism might be a wonderful thing but that period of instability that period of change can be very dangerous
well of course and er and er UNK has right from the beginning er embarked on a sort of a campaign for independence in a most UNK peaceful way
despite your english accent are you UNK
my father's UNK
hm
i sort of regard myself as a sort of a dual UNK now but that's one thing i'll be looking at er in the next few months hopefully
yes i obviously UNK is the is the country i'm most concerned about
we've had er callers earlier on suggesting that there could be problems between russians and UNK if an goes there which seems almost certain it will now
would you be happy for britain european partners and the americans to recognise UNK independence while at the same time saying look don't take it out on russians who are living within your borders observe human rights and all the rest of it is that our affairs and our business
well i did hear that point it's interesting because in fact UNK er president UNK yeltsin signed an agreement in july er which effectively russia recognise UNK as an independent state it was the second country in the world to do that er all of this was sorted out in a very er good er peaceful sensible way there obviously russia has concerns in UNK er not least the district
all of that was sorted out and agreed and that's the way to progress in these matters
people get a very negative attitude they think that these like there was a caller recently that sort of UNK nationalism with er with you know UNK and that's completely wrong i mean but and you're all in the news you're always hearing about the radical nationalist UNK as if they're some sort of strange breed of person but in fact they're just like the mps in our house of commons UNK elected people sensible people who want peace they want prosperity for their country and er there's no mad empire imperial ambitions UNK has no need for an army or anything but er apart from just maintaining er internal er control but er people have a very strange attitude a very anti nationalists i find it curious
would you like UNK to be part of some sort of erm soviet federation UNK i mean just some loose trading or defence partnership
i'm sure that would happen but UNK if it had the er complete independence to er choose it's own trading partners it's own defence partners then it would make sense for UNK to have some sort of a trading arrangement with the old communist block and
ra rather so the e c can become a member of nato
well i the way i see it going is that the e c will expand to not only UNK about being but also other er forms of soviet republics
i was struck too by the way in which we started the programme by considering the dangers of the situation and there's no doubt that that's correct but it is important to say perhaps the most important thing is that the end of isn't in the soviet union and the break up of the soviet empire is an enormously positive event for all of us for the citizens of the soviet union and for us in the west it gives the opportunity for much greater stability real stability peace and prosperity then ever existed under the old regime
with all that said of course the transition period is going to be very dangerous for the kind of reasons we've been talking about already and i think is right too when he says that er the so called nationalist in the non russian republics if you're a democrat in a empire then you are inevitably a nationalist as well because you want your nation to have its natural human rights
andrew UNK from er UNK in essex what do you feel about this
erm i think it's probably inevitable but most of the republics will become independent but i think the idea of them becoming independent in their present borders is very worrying indeed cos that most of the borders are UNK and becoming independent with those borders ethnic conflicts built into it erm and i think unless there's some sort of er negotiations about what border these countries will have before they become UNK independent we could see quite a lot of UNK
in fact some of the republics have such a mixed population it's almost impossible to see how they could be separated out russians and UNK erm and all the rest of it all UNK to some extent
is it possible geoffrey UNK to have some sort of sort out where people could be encouraged UNK perhaps to leave their villages and towns and go back to the republic from which their parents or grandparents originally came
yes i don't think changing borders is the right way to approach this problem
in some cases population UNK there's bound to be conflict whatever happens it seems to me that these problems can only be solved first of all by ensuring that all UNK ethnic groups have the right to their own culture their own language their own religion and so on and to exercise them in their own territory but they're not UNK again in jobs and housing and education er and then also as you say to help with state sponsored finance people who do decide that they want to migrate that they don't want to live in somebody else's republic that they do want to move across the border into as it were their own republic
UNK is historically enormously difficult there may be two or three very clear cases in the soviet union when it came be done without much dispute by general agreement but on the whole i reckon that observation of human rights is the way to approach this and then of course the er growth of economic prosperity if it comes will actually help to ease these problems
andrew UNK here we are handing out advice well UNK but i wonder if er russians and UNK and all the rest aren't going to say mind your own business leave us to sort this out
erm well i am a bit doubtful about geoffrey UNK point of view erm because he's assuming erm sort of democratic UNK etc on the part of these governments and i don't think that's necessarily so
i mean i think the most UNK example is the which is erm ninety per cent UNK population
is part of which i think is just ridiculous and will be a nice well meaning democratic UNK guy in but considering the history of those two countries i rather doubt it erm and i think the best way of securing er the safety of that population is actually to change the border before the borders are fixed and settled and before these countries actually become independent
geoffrey UNK are already reports of erm an enormous number of refugees trying to get out of parts of the er soviet union in poland i think in one area they've closed the borders having let through twenty seven thousand refugees in one day there are now huge UNK of traffic at the border post
henry UNK warned yesterday this might happen do you fear that we could face a flood of refugees
yeah
well it is possible of course and i think that er the european nations including those in eastern europe er ought to be getting together to consult about what we can do because i don't think it's right simply to send these refugees back as the er italians have been doing er in fact there likely to be amongst
they've been doing it to UNK at
yes to UNK that's right
erm i think these refugees are likely to include the most UNK the best trained and so on they'll be a grave loss to the soviet economy erm but i think they're a potential gain to us and er i don't think that i think therefore we should make arrangements to try and absorb them if we can and let them contribute as they undoubtedly will to our own economies
well what do you think if there's a mass migration from soviet UNK should we absorb those UNK into the united kingdom and the rest of europe it's just after half past nine you're listening to radio four this is nick ross we're discussing as you've no doubt gathered events in the soviet union and how they affect us what if anything we can do to influence them
graham bishop is on the line from brighton in sussex
hello there erm i was calling in to sort of object to the erm whole presentation of recent events in the in the soviet union
firstly i don't think there's a substantial disagreement between yeltsin and the so called hard UNK except over the question of timing so as to win the market and someone's introduced them to the soviet union and secondly i don't think you can treat UNK yeltsin as some kind of democrat at all on august the twelfth he threatened to rule russia by UNK just at the definitely UNK and the russian nationalism and he built some sort of support and i think it's very wrong to UNK the events there with the revolution more it's been it's been much more of a power struggle between different sections of the you know the UNK there along the lines of the events in UNK
can we just the two things you've said
firstly that he's a UNK erm just like the others i mean are you talking about and the people who lead the coup and that you're saying UNK no different from them
i think the key point is yeltsin like UNK unlike the coup leaders is part of a very privileged UNK in the soviet union and the difference is that to express the erm you know trying to put them advance themselves in society at the expense of the rest of UNK society applicable difference is erm much more UNK and sort of packed on the end to justify er that the moves they are making i mean at you know like i say that can be seen in the very democratic step that UNK been taking since he's been the russian president
i must say professor UNK i was rather struck by pictures in the papers today yesterday of UNK yeltsin standing over a UNK he'd shot it was strongly UNK of pictures we've seen of the former president of UNK
right and indeed er i must er correct the impression that yeltsin is anti UNK i don't think there's any evidence of that at all er a and er i would regard that really as a UNK on his character but er russian nationalist this is a very delicate question
we've always in the west used the term russian nationalist as one of abuse er and that it seems to me as because it's always in the past been associated with empire russian nationalists in practice have UNK other people but after all why should the russians not be UNK just as the british as er a citizen or a UNK can be UNK er provided that doesn't go with UNK other people
now it seems to me that er UNK that kind of russian UNK and he's shown it by UNK as equal partners with UNK with the UNK republics and so on er in which he said that er russia is no longer going to interfere in their internal affairs so they are equal partners in these UNK
so that
but that UNK today when he's not only threatened to intervene against the republics that have been attacking their UNK but erm since he's become russian president he's constantly threatened and the area of and you know denied it sort of national
i think the key point about UNK is one reason why perhaps people in britain and so on shouldn't be UNK too but if you see the rather cynical attitude of the western countries towards recent events not just in russia but right across the eastern block very good example was condemned erm but when following the UNK erm the west has gone on to sort of do deals with the winners and UNK links er with the people responsible for that UNK the killing of the soviet union went the other way and consequently erm that's where you know western resources are directed
i'm sure if the UNK have won now that is erm would be dealing with them just as now
there is a human characteristic that we like to think see things in very clear cut ways and you're saying we shouldn't go UNK and just think that UNK yeltsin because of his courage standing on the tank and helping to prevent the coup we shouldn't go UNK and think that he's er the most marvellous human liberal democrat who ever walked the earth
i think i think we should see it for what it is which is a power struggle inside a ruling UNK in the soviet union for which we don't really have an interest in taking sides
er of course er yeltsin does sometimes take own measures and that's because the situation genuinely is very dangerous er and er i think that everyone would agree that really
anthony UNK from essex what's your view on this
good morning nick
hello
nice to speak to you erm i'd just like to say that er take me now as a as a normal chap from england who looked across right through his life at russia as the big bad bear and eight years ago i had the opportunity of going over there just an ordinary chap and er of course there's so much about the soviet union we don't know we did we erm for instance we were over there in UNK when they were celebrating sixty years of the UNK of the UNK into the soviet union
and i didn't even realise at that time that there were fifteen states in the soviet union
now we travelled the best part of the UNK and we also UNK into and er we were there about a month just under a month and erm one of the UNK that i got there just as an ordinary chap no not learned politically so i can't speak on the level er of most of your callers today but er i realise that here you had er people in actual fact my comment was the country's half finished everywhere you went there were building UNK so far UNK er projects UNK and you've got the impression that they did need communism in a way to make the thing work er the er let's take the UNK i mean that that's where the UNK come from and they love a good time er those sort of people in a way need a strong government
are you saying that things could get worse now that erm communism is gone and is going to become even more UNK
what i'm saying yeah
you've got it in one
what i what er i in fact what i did notice in that time that i was there was that er when you talk about the old guard the young people anybody under forty er they were a little bit cynical about this communism UNK and UNK and the rest of it they all went to say they would all go to UNK er statue and in effect have a blessing from UNK we went along with them on one occasion very pleased to do it but you got the impression that the younger generation were already in UNK and the people now that are out there with yeltsin were UNK away from communism now the thing is this that UNK came along in my opinion exactly at the right time and tried to move things a little our way a little way from the UNK which obviously couldn't be sustained
and UNK has actually caused economic problems not resolved them
yeah you're right and that's what i'm saying they have tried and i think they've let UNK down
let me put this to geoffrey UNK professor UNK we've heard of a people ruled by UNK and then by is there going to be any thing but UNK now
will democracy really work
well of course there isn't very much of a democratic tradition in russia that's quite true but that's very different from of the russians and all the soviet people and saying they're simply incapable of living under democracy
any nation has to learn democracy er and it seems to me that all the people of the soviet union have shown over the last four or five years a lively interest in politics and considerable to participate in politics er one of the problems is of course is that they've been doing so too much and in too UNK a way they're going to have to get together
that's what i'm saying they need they need just a little in fact we do here you could argue er i feel that all the elements there are of a turning into something a bit ugly i think i think they were very quick to drop those UNK down now i know i know the fellow who in who set up the k g b could have been the most popular bloke in the soviet union but nonetheless er he was down within a day i hear this morning that UNK talking about border changes and quite frankly they're moving too quick and UNK at least was providing a bit of restraint and i think it they want to think in terms of decade
ian UNK from UNK in hertfordshire are you also concerned about instability there
i certainly am
erm i'd liked to discuss the point about what aid we can give to try and promote the stability and the event of prosperity of the country
now the present british government is very anxious to give the russians our financial expertise rather than practical help to promote a market economy
you think our financial expertise doesn't amount to practical help
i certainly don't because erm according to this policy the first thing the russian people have got to put up with is a high level of unemployment
now i suggest that we
we've become quite expert at that haven't we
er this is the point i'm going to make this is absolute UNK
i mean after thirty years of policies our own real economy is UNK growing unemployment
now i suggest that er don't you it's vast numbers of russian people UNK about with nothing to do is certainly not going to promote stability
what the russians want is technical help and equipment now our own industry is in decline er yes particularly in machine tool industry and i think the first thing we should do is to go over there and see what it is they actually needed what they actually need right now er one of your previous er correspondence er speaker turned round and said well they've got half finished buildings and things like that i mean er people have got to be put to work because people in co UNK employment is the only source of real wealth but the market economy isn't interested in promoting real wealth i mean it's only interested in what it can get out of an economy not what it gives
if were going to give them transfer real wealth machine tools and all the rest
yeah
how's it going to be paid for
are we going to divert er an aid programme from the third world to prevent people starving and so forth to the soviet union or are we going to have er funds from the national health service from education who's going to find the money
erm is the money really erm this is i think this is a bit of a UNK
a country can produce these days as much money as it wants
only if it creates inflation
er yes but if you're exporting the stuff why should it create inflation
i mean this is the cause of inflation surely is to have more too much money taken too few goods and if you produce more goods this helps to UNK er we didn't have inflation thirty years ago
well this is a marvellous new form of economics if we could just create things and er export them without getting paid for them and it wouldn't us
that's right
we could
we could because the sense of wealth is people at work have people UNK their UNK doing nothing erm is absolute er you know is UNK
but the
the fundamental point that you make is we shouldn't be simply offering good advice or bad advice we should be offering real aid real goods
that's right
and doing so for the goods
er the goods that what not goods that we want to give them like UNK food and ludicrous UNK to find out what it is that they want this of equipment and no and don't forget the know how i mean we are we have a hell of a know how in this country which is not being used
okay
let me get to UNK to and commander michael UNK are you a naval commander incidentally
yes i'm retired
er do you think we should er give substantial aid to the soviet union
well the er point i'd like to make is that as of last saturday the er erm the UNK were building a new UNK every forty days they're spending thirty five percent of the g n p
on UNK and erm i wouldn't it be prudent to insure that erm they stop spending all this money on UNK before any aid is given to them
i thought it was twenty five percent of their it's a big sum anyway
no i it's an enormous sum i mean i don't think anybody in the west is spending er as much as ten percent on UNK and er i heard a on television not so long ago saying that in eighty percent of their industry is on UNK
geoffrey UNK
yes i think that we could actually kill as it were two birds with one stone here er the conversion of military industry into civilian industry has begun in the soviet union but it was going very slowly and part of the reason for that is it's very expensive now that seems to me a worthy UNK for western direct economic aid
but another reason is presumably in the past because the military was terribly powerful much more powerful before the coup than now and UNK was frightened to start UNK it too
precisely that's why this is an excellent moment to offer precisely that kind of aid because those UNK have been largely removed
so commander UNK we should not just offer a stick saying that we aren't going to help you until we start UNK your military programme we should offer UNK too do you agree
well i don't mind how it's done but erm i hear nothing on the many people on you know who talk about erm giving aid erm a dread from this problem is this vast erm amount of the g m p and going on UNK and going on one way and another
i would have thought they've simply it had to be agreed that was stopped and then as the professor has said i mean we give all the aid we can to turn their erm military er industry into erm what was it instead of guns
we move to another caller from in UNK
what's your prospective on this
well i really feel very UNK about present events in russia and er particularly on a UNK on world politics what on
i just feel in an absence of a russian from the balance of power gonna leave the UNK of the united states totally UNK
when you say talk about the middle east are you from that part of the world
i am from iraq yes
from iraq
yes
erm interesting president saddam UNK has er also UNK er the ending of the coup and the fact that er UNK has backed
let me let me interrupt you here i must support saddam UNK i don't believe he carried his own policies i'm concerned about the UNK people themselves
you know i mean this has this has been used accused saddam UNK has er is a is a supporter of er the coup but er the real implication i am talking about is the problem
hm
i think the solution here is a and er future will be totally UNK
you raised a very significant issue that i haven't heard much addressed in recent days and we know that there hasn't really been a super power of the soviet union and any other military sense for the last couple of years
he has he has since the gulf war
i mean look at look at the conduct of the gulf war
absolutely and this is again having enormous implications particularly in the entire world
and now you gonna have the whole resources will be totally controlled by one super power
geoff geoffrey UNK is it a good thing that we no longer we have too super UNK powers viewing for authority and all the rest of it or are you as worried as
on the whole i think it's a good thing er it's only five or six years ago that an UNK called paul kennedy published a book saying that america was in decline as a super power er and in fact i think what's happening is that er there are there are going to be UNK of super powers now in the world and they're all more modest than american and the soviet union were a few years ago
there's the united states there's europe western europe plus central europe now there's japan and there will be the ex soviet union in some form er those arrangements will be complicated but they will be less ca UNK as it were the danger will no longer be of UNK there'll be very serious could be very serious conflicts that could arise
just come back
i don't agree at all
sorry
i don't agree at all
do you not think that up to now middle eastern countries and some other nations and people as well have been of the super powers in their giant struggle against each other but now the united states may be able to take er if you like a more mature and more relaxed attitude
maybe
i am sorry i d i agree with you on one point that the middle eastern er government that of the super power from the reception but what really happened in the gulf war is a typical reflection of the injustice of how the war was being conducted
it was conducted in a in a UNK effect because was totally UNK and america got the upper hand and they simply played the game by their own favour without giving due consideration to UNK or even the justice er element and this is how the world's gonna be and america is an arrogant super power
what's
it's certainly something we're all gonna have too er adjust too thank you for pointing it out that the united states is going to have such enormous influence er from now on we're all going to have to get used to it and er get used to how to deal with it
from coventry what do you feel about what's been happening in the soviet union
well the thing that concerns me is the UNK in which er rushing to ban the communist party
i would rely on mr yeltsin and mr UNK that the only possible way in which they could have reached the UNK they have today is through membership of the party
there must be many able russians who take the same line as the only way forward could be incorporated in a democratic russia and very substantially contribute to its recovery
you you've been a communist yourself
let me give you my family history shall i
oh if you can do it in a sentence
i'll do it very quickly
i am the great UNK of the founder of what is now the greatest one of the greatest in UNK
my name is as you know and company that found these was which was my uncle and well erm about mr yeltsin and mr UNK to lead a russian political book and i could which was the name of the company today
now in this book they will read that the progressive forces of the late eighteen hundreds and the early nineteen hundreds will endeavour to educate the workers from the er UNK and textile industries were not basically communists
let i
but were social democrats
forgive me i don't want to go back that far but let me just put the point you've made to professor UNK
the communist party should not be banned it is true that many members of it did support er an coup on the other hand so many people joined the communist party for UNK and it's not very democratic to ban a party which has had su such power and such membership
well first of all it hasn't been banned er a suspended it while it's role in the coup
UNK it
just a moment suspended it and then UNK his first secretary has the right to do it UNK the central committee and then what lower party er bodies do is up to them
however what i think is the most important aspect of this the communist party is not and never has been a party in the normal sense of the term it's a closed shop for the ruling establishment of the soviet union and therefore it's quite simply UNK with politics
eighteen months ago it gave up its UNK of politics but it continued to exist and it continued really as a kind of dog in the UNK to prevent the er establishment of normal multi party politics
therefore it seems to me that the communist party really has to disappear it's a good thing that it's own general secretary has UNK it i anticipate that it will break up into a number of political parties perhaps one kind of social democratic party on the left and another if you like a kind of russian unionist party on the right erm but as the communist party it's simply UNK with the emergence of democracy in the soviet union
let's move on if i may to dr UNK calling from cambridge
hello
hello dr UNK what do you feel about all this
well er i became er unhappy with the communist party many years ago because it didn't follow the philosophical teaching on which works the erm UNK
they said that in a political situation if you had one side you could call it the UNK say capitalism was the UNK and communism was the other side and that was the UNK and that these two would one another and it was only when they came together and got their good points both of them adopted that one was really going to get a satisfactory solution
do you think we've got a satisfactory solution in the soviet union
some kind of social democracy in russia erm on the other hand in central UNK as for example i think it's quite likely that former communists although they may UNK their former UNK will in practice take over as national communist parties and continue to run their economies well there will be private economies but with a large state sector and run on a pretty tight UNK
so i think the answer is we're going to see a variety of things there is a tendency i think amongst er soviet citizens at the moment to regard the market economy as they used to regard communism that's to say there's a kind of ideal which will bring about universal prosperity and relief on all their worries
there is a certain danger there cos in fact er the market economy in some ways is not as pleasant as that suggests
hazel clarke from UNK
i i've been in germany recently selling i took a number of our british products over and i saw half a ton of my UNK in the german supermarket
also while there i was working from eight in the morning till seven at night
i was able to talk to the german customer and the people on the floor who are UNK worried about the number of people coming in from the east not only east germany but they're very worried about people coming in from eastern europe and secondly there was so much east european food that was for sale in germany at very low prices and there's food that used to go to the soviet union
now it's made the people i have friends in moscow who are saying that they are losing a lot of their food supplies because the west are taking the most throw down prices so that the UNK and the UNK can get the UNK they want for us
throw down the prices from the west but of course good high real foreign currency for soviet union
exactly but also it was food for them
hm
and they are losing their tradition of the food that they have been getting from eastern europe
so what can be done
i think that we it's really like taking chocolate from the mouths of babies to take food from people in eastern europe who are rather desperate
it really we need to encourage the trade that eastern europe and the soviet union and if it one of the former speakers said we need to give them aid and UNK for people who can erm show them what to do
they need the technical help
actually the speaker that was talking about this was suggesting we give them an enormous amount of real UNK assets er without it costing us anything
now i know of no law of economics which would permit that would you be prepared for us to pay a lot out of tax UNK resources to give to the soviet people to help their economy to help them survive this very difficult transition period
i don't think it's so much monies that they need
what they need is certain products
it comes to the same thing doesn't it
and i un well as i understand it from the friends in moscow their traditional industries are very UNK they may have erm the expertise in the UNK section but the other things what they need is some of our engineers and we've got a lot of engineers who were working overseas and at the moment aren't
if we could send some of the people over there to help them to UNK things and UNK things
so professor UNK that would be a relatively cheap way it'll still cost money but relatively cheap way of really helping these
it would be a relatively cheap way and other things we could also get european community this isn't a british problem it is a world problem
yes professor UNK
yes we have got some UNK resources that could be er diverted towards the soviet economy food surpluses for example the coming winter is going to be very difficult in the soviet union and i think direct food aid may well be necessary
we don't have to worry as much as we used to about its being UNK by the party state apparatus for UNK erm then of course there's them the problem of longer term aid how we help the soviet union integrate itself into the world economy
this is undoubtedly an all european problem united states canada japan everyone else should be involved er i think we should probably identify with the UNK aid and help hm key projects like the conversion of military industry into consumer goods er like transport and communications key areas of the economy where relatively small amounts of investment could produce big returns and then finally it seems to me we should be extending to the soviet union for membership of er international financial organisations like the world bank and the international monetary fund whichever in criteria of course for helping countries and for integrating international aid to those countries
graham calling from in sussex is it the economic aspects that concern you most
yes well the economic effect on our own country well when i say under er europe er with this proposal that er we have to open up our markets er for the benefit of the soviet er because that is going to cost er what they're what they're asking for not only in soviet but also across eastern europe is that the agricultural market the steel and the textile market all the most sensitive areas should be opened up to them and that's going to shed a great increase in unemployment er within the within the common market
are you a good old fashion UNK
no not at all er but i am someone who believes you've got to have level playing fields which we do not have er or won't have er with the implementation of the common market er regardless of any relationship with the soviet union in UNK er after all to what has not been published very much er is that you know got to take into account indirect as well as direct and erm if you look at for instance the united states er which is constantly packing the common market people which is of course er
i'm going to have to cut you off cos we're running out of time but i very much take the point you're making that it could've had this trade effect on us just in the last ten seconds professor UNK is it possible to predict what's going to happen in the soviet union over the next six months is it gonna be for good or
it's quite UNK at the moment
i think the long term results of this are entirely good but in the short term there's going to be major instability making life possibly quite nasty for everyone
professor UNK and to all of you who called and listened thank you until next tuesday bye
they're good to watch something like this
even might be blocking them
tough rule to bowl to the er new UNK that's his first delivery and he stands rather quickly at that one down on the leg stump runs away off the pad there's a shout i think more of UNK from tufnell than er conviction
well all the sri UNK seem pretty good at adopting the UNK of sticking the pad down at the back follow somewhere after it
oh they loved that yes and er that one's played with a bat to off and there's no run
bill to your rescue once more
erm five foot three and a half
feeling more like UNK
almost like er and just in case you haven't anything about out comes the end sheet as a plays it too
silly point and there's run now what have we got on five feet ten he's a UNK giant
trained over here with mill hill cricket club that's stuck a bit by er tufnell and i think we might say that beat in the air his attempted sweep failed completely
no run still a hundred and eleven for three
that means an insurance manager
tufnell bowls quickly UNK and that UNK through outside the off stump ooh UNK and UNK of disappointment all around the wicket there UNK by victor marks yeah in the box
yet to get off the mark
tufnell bowls and there's a shout again as that goes near UNK silly UNK right hand and there's no run a hundred and eleven for three still
had a very good over from bill tufnell there it's always a bit tricky when you come on to bowl and it's turning and it's a long day ahead and you you're expected to get UNK and you expect to get UNK and you can get very UNK when they don't come but he's got one now he's got now he's UNK well all morning now he's UNK almost for an hour but he's got that one wicket and he that over was full of confidence he UNK one up UNK the length and got into a bit of a UNK and then he UNK a quicker one which tried to cut he then UNK the pace and he could off nick it to the a very good over and he's bowling with great confidence at the moment
lewis taking over from the greatest at the UNK er lawrence and er first time we've seen lawrence this morning and on the subject of frustration victor which you were just UNK then did you by any chance see tony locke at er old UNK when UNK took his
er no
it was terrible to behold
i was only one at the time
oh i'm so sorry
you wouldn't have noticed much about it
here's lawrence first time in action today bowls a ball full length and very UNK indeed dasilva UNK off and there's no run
yeah
that is the other thing when the ball is turning and your partner is turning it mild and getting UNK
yes
and you're doing your UNK at the other end UNK trying even harder and harder the harder you try often the worse it gets
that's right but locke was turning it on occasion and just couldn't strike at all except for the one wicket if he UNK quicker and quicker he might have been in trouble
a hundred and eleven for three still
as lawrence bowls to dasilva
cool
and that's a UNK and dasilva is UNK in the extreme it's a no ball now whether that was because it was a UNK i think but we don't know whether it's UNK or not as far as UNK was concerned it brought a run down to square leg anyway and er dasilva is now eighteen total a hundred and twelve for three
no i think it's just that er then your sorts of signs i think to indicate that was a no ball because it was i'm sure an UNK er UNK and er they still did well really to get a bit of back on here so
slipped out of the hand quite obviously that it wasn't a deliberate UNK we must add that that's went out today thirty four here's lawrence bowls outside the off stump and the new UNK who is not yet off the mark lets it go through to the wicket keeper
hampshire who's been er UNK at point now UNK back to square leg because the point area is becoming rather heavily UNK at the moment with a very square UNK and er an even UNK point cover point
er lewis and UNK there so the UNK view is somewhat UNK lawrence in from the UNK end bowls to oh the full length and he's off the mark with four UNK that down to deep third man there is no deep third man and er he UNK in a little token UNK to the other end but no one was going to chase that or stop it by any stretch of imagination four the total a hundred and sixteen for three
and david quite got his bearings right full UNK that one i've been watching this summer this slope at lord's can play UNK with UNK and i always get the impression that er he's he bowls better than the nursery end at lord's david lawrence
hm
but tufnell of course must have UNK there at the moment
oh absolutely yes
here's lawrence bowls and that's a full length again but it's down the leg side UNK it very UNK it's a good throw from tufnell well a quick throw from tufnell it lands in the middle of the pitch in actual fact but they have to hurry for the two runs now one hundred and eighteen for three UNK now and is six dasilva eighteen
he thinks he's found a friend in the score box he keeps waving in that direction
what's that
no ball or one short or
no i guess checking on the number of balls left in the over i think
oh well
cos he's lost the
that doesn't often happen
yes
all kinds of signals going up there to the score board
lawrence in again bowls ooh and has a bit of trouble with this one gets it on the bottom of the bat from which it UNK away it's a short leg and there's no run
and er i shouldn't really have started this over because lawrence takes so long to go through it erm find UNK waiting think it right
signals to the dressing room see what comes of that
one eight for three out today for thirty four
lawrence bowling the last ball of this over and it's a UNK and gets underneath it he's six dasilva is eighteen it's a hundred and eighteen for three and after a word for big it will be brian UNK
have to tell you about henry hall of hampshire
well as usual when er david lawrence comes into the attack things start to happen in this case we had a UNK a boundary and a UNK
plenty variety wasn't it
yeah
UNK agreed a signal i can't you haven't heard before he lost two of his little erm
oh dear
things he keeps erm little barrels he keeps er number of balls he's had to put two pound coins in his pocket instead and i think that's put him off anyhow he got it right
one hundred and eighteen for three which means thirty nine runs added in the first hour today and it's tufnell coming up now to bowl dasilva up he comes bowls this one dasilva pushes forward and it just goes under the bat and UNK there by the UNK no run
russell pretty good figures this is er fifteenth over two for seventeen eight UNK giving the one wicket that goes field him for thirty four and he comes up again that little hop and bowls to dasilva goes down the pitch tips this one up to mid on but er won't get one as figure lawrence is there to stop it so no run to play to sixteen UNK seven twenty eight
this is UNK er lawrence seven UNK nought to thirty four and we haven't seen from lewis yet
tufnell bowling from the end round the wicket with a five four field that one er just ugly looking thing there er dasilva just UNK his leg out about side leg stump of the ball and hit the pads and goes up
they brought a UNK from the offside to sort of short square leg to stop him i suppose sweeping and that's why he played that ugly UNK shot there
yes while attempting to hit him with a bat
here is tufnell coming up again bowls over and outside the off stump and that one goes to robin smith and he's hit somewhere on the boot and UNK off down the pitch
it was a well pitched up ball i like i like love tufnell when he gives it a bit of a on the off stump
he's got his five UNK there four on the leg side at the moment so saved er long leg as well bowls this one and that again he thrust forward that front pad and dasilva and stewart comes in from mid wicket to field it
a hundred and eighteen for three and the asking rate of the start of the day was er three point six two over it must have deteriorated from the point of sri UNK
it was three point eight five a couple of UNK ago
it must have er haven't got all that worse then here's tufnell comes up again slightly faster than the other one hits him on the pad or bit of that pad maybe robin UNK very close in there and once or twice he's UNK he's never quite sure whether off the pad or off bat and pad everybody UNK at him poor chap anyhow catch it a hundred and eighteen for three end of that one from tufnell so he's now UNK fifteen UNK two for seventeen that one was yet another maiden
and he's bowling very well he's opposing all sorts of problems but he's also getting frustrated because of er the UNK technique of going down the pitch putting his left pad in line with the ball and then letting his back UNK behind that left leg and quite rightly my view tufnell keeps appealing when this happens and jack hampshire keeps saying not out
what it's frustrating for a slow bowler is that if the UNK put his left pad down the wicket and held his bat up in the air clearly not playing his shot for all to see then i'm sure that we you know it the UNK be given out l b w quite frequently but because the bat is UNK just behind that left pad erm he's never given out
it's a UNK
yes it's a
of old and UNK a slow bowler
yes i think they get treated rather tough don't they i think the UNK take advantage of the of the always be in the UNK mind and he's got to be certain
lawrence runs away from us now comes in to bowl to and that one he lets go outside is the right pronunciation you UNK you look at the b c pronunciation
i think you've put on one too many UNK
i said didn't i
you carried on too long
i don't think i did at all dennis
and i shall stick the b c pronunciation
yeah disgusting you as in run that's right
that's right you thank you we've got the b c UNK there haven't you
well thank you for the supporting me victor that UNK came from the UNK one there
got back to his mark and we're going to have three slips lewis gone to join the slips so it's er three slips and the UNK as UNK for this one packing were the up comes lawrence now past UNK bird bowls to him well pitched up and he played a rather UNK stroke really and he turns it away down to square tufnell is down there fields the ball throws back quite nicely he UNK very well let's say that and one run goes on the total er so that at the moment three hundred and four runs are needed and it's about three point nine seven the required rate
three hundred and four runs more needed it's quite a target this isn't it
well UNK it's out of the question
it is isn't it
and of course dasilva erm not flashing those strokes round like he did on that first UNK er playing a very sensible UNK from the point of view of sri UNK but his erm haven't seen many of his flashing strokes
no
strengthen leg side field for him now
there's a deep mid wicket a deep square leg a backward point a backward square er short leg and a forward short leg and the mid on
lawrence catch behind and he's given out
caught down the leg side he wasn't going to walk he waited for UNK bird and that's the lawrence delighted with england of course too dasilva caught down the leg side a good catch there by russell and sri UNK now a hundred and nineteen for four and dasilva is out caught russell UNK lawrence for eighteen
ninety one balls and one four and not a typical dasilva UNK and one does wonders whether in the end it might have been better for sri UNK to play at a more natural game
yes it may be i mean in fact he was some problems by UNK because he UNK put a man at deep sort of mid wicket or square leg another one back there to stop him UNK
yeah
and he showed him firstly he's a wonderful UNK he also had two choices he had two short legs there as well
yep
and lawrence whether he meant to or not UNK the ball in short er round about leg stump he sort of half went to UNK didn't he
i think he just UNK his UNK
i tell you what erm i've got to revise my bit in of UNK i'm such an UNK of him and everything i haven't i would have thought he was a brilliant UNK i think during this summer he's really begun to read the UNK erm strengths and failures and set the field
yeah well he's certainly prepared to do er make a few UNK field placements and that was a very strange field that lawrence had
yes
and when someone goes out erm playing a little UNK you can't you know you have to give the england team credit for UNK some unusual problems
it's i mean he played very well dasilva i think but in a completely different mode to the first UNK he was purely set on trying to save the game trying to battle with i think he didn't bowl very well hadn't UNK very many short balls in the day and that was perhaps the first one he's had to receive and er he was caught in two minds really
you do take a long time to come out has not reached the non strikers and er some said he had a little reading from who
i suppose they're waiting with their pads on are they
well i don't know but it is a long way down people who don't know lord's you have to come down from er and er perhaps they're not quite ready but it is there must have taken i don't next time perhaps put the clock on it but this must be a three minute or three and a half minute
two and a half minutes since the wicket gone
have you technically presumably erm UNK could appeal you can be timed out if you're not on the on the field by that time but then of course you've got another erm eighty yards or so to walk to up to the far end
are you it is difficult to cross at lord's er i mean it is as you say it's quite a trek from the er from whichever dressing room you're in down the steps through the long room there's always someone coming the wrong direction then
there's lawrence now a left UNK down to the rear and this one he turns away and it goes straight to short leg and erm everybody UNK up and sits there well UNK there by morris at short leg
comes along it's a tremendous support i'd love to be a bowler on UNK side cos you get UNK for an whatever happens
got UNK for the UNK did he
no probably not
and i think we must assume that he was no ball because he was a UNK and not because of front foot
i think so because oh it's still difficult to interpret UNK sometimes but he was waving his hands towards the UNK
yeah but he doesn't have he doesn't have to be noted in the score book that he was no UNK for a for a UNK but out of interest perhaps he was letting him er so giles there left UNK played some lovely strokes in the first UNK wasn't in for long then UNK goes down on his knees there up and outside the old stump he's playing backwards the ball goes through to russell
by the way the lot of seemed to be played in hertfordshire these days and one of the great days is at UNK and that's on september the first on sunday when they have their annual single wicket competition and that's a great local event and it's bound to encourage all the young UNK in the neighbourhood they're trying to make up for the lack of cricket in schools so well done UNK and that is on sunday next er first of september and i'll give you the time in a minute if i can find it when it is it doesn't say but it's probably all day at the UNK club well done UNK encouraging young people to play cricket sunday first september
here is lawrence bowls this one on the leg stump push there the short play UNK by morris and that's a wicket er that was eighteen dasilva a hundred and sixteen minutes and he only had one four and if we remember his first UNK when he scored forty two with seven fours and he was in only for that thirty something minutes was it
thirty seven minutes er a contrast and erm well
you may be right
i don't know
i think he didn't look natural did he
no i mean england have UNK much better at him and UNK for example is very difficult to get away because it is spinning a little bit and i'm sure that they the england UNK must have said to themselves we're not going to bowl a lot of short balls at we must keep it full length erm and so part of this slow score is due to better england bowling
UNK sixteenth over there you've just pushed it out and a number er lewis coming in from backward point
this is his sixteenth over two for seventeen with nine UNK so far bowling from the far end the nursery end with a cluster of UNK you've got a silly point and a short leg and a slip and he's got er at the moment four men on the leg side as he's had most of the time and five on the off and now a slight adjustment we're gonna have an extra one around the UNK
lewis is coming up to very close backward point a silly point we have smith a short leg we have morris so there are a good UNK and the slip both with hands on hips are five men round the UNK and a mid on a long leg mid off cover and the point and tufnell false run erm stops in his run john hampshire signals no delivery and they start again a hundred and nineteen for four at the moment the score
and UNK for this one from tufnell pushes forward and it's hit on his pad outside the off stump possibly loud appeals from everybody there's a rather high pitched UNK i think we've got some young people in or a lot of ladies today
anyhow there were the UNK were appealing from the i should think about two thousand five hundred people in the ground here
entry was eight pounds today or four pounds for o a ps and young people tufnell comes in now past john hampshire and that one slightly faster one and edge away and was UNK by a falling lewis at that backward point position both in there let slip and er i don't think any of the UNK i think er not happy at all against tufnell er in remember his very good figures at the UNK and now he's following up with some very steady bowling here with the pitch does help him
this one now er again hits him UNK on the pad UNK out on the off side and UNK picks it up from extra cover
UNK the general who's been switching the field around as to suit each UNK
tufnell now with just the three men on the leg side six on the off up he comes bowls this one UNK it up and driven straight back by goes straight up to lawrence mid off and there's no run resulting from that
so the two men out today UNK tufnell for thirty four and dasilva caught russell UNK lawrence for eighteen the UNK fell at hundred and eleven not a hundred and nineteen remind you of the start of this seventy nine for two
now one hundred and nineteen for four tufnell bowls this one forward goes and the ball UNK up towards and another maiden over so now they've had sixteen UNK ten UNK for seventeen and er i think in the old days you would have been quite proud of those figures erm victor
i would have been UNK to bits
i see i mean it's good to see really that er test match has been UNK well almost dominated at the moment by a slow bowler it's an ideal situation for in england UNK done their job england are in command got lots of runs to play with but it's definitely the left arm UNK who's causing the greatest problem out there he's landing it in the right place he likes variation in that over confident enough looks very tempted always very difficult to come in at first twenty minutes as a UNK when you've come in on a turning wicket a very difficult
well he's got six for twenty five at the UNK so he's doing well in his test career but it's lawrence now to bowl for the left handed who pushes that one back down the pitch gets plenty of time
thank you UNK six for twenty five and then a slight contrast one for a hundred and fifty but he UNK a great many UNK that's er he's proving a very useful addition to the england side and he's being used erm very sensibly by UNK
it's also good i think for cricket in general that he's got a pitch that helps him a bit on the fifth day and that's how it should be
yeah course i mean as a bat er pitched a bat on this is a UNK a beauty but are there are rough spots which you've helping the slow left arm or help any UNK
so UNK now as lawrence comes up and bowls to him and this UNK off the edge and that's going down up towards the third man going over the ropes down the far end and that's one boundary there off the edge at one hundred and thirteen for four lawrence won't be to happy about that but it happens to all fast UNK
one twenty three for four which makes the erm the target now exactly erm three hundred
three hundred
balls being collected we've got erm three slips and the two UNK still
three point nine six is the asking rate we've got three seventy five at er seventy five UNK after this one
away goes lawrence UNK away from us now UNK up his run UNK and UNK but it goes over the back of his neck through to russell no run
i'm not sure if david lawrence is the type of bowler worries about getting nicked before hit before it happens pretty frequently he's such an attacking bowler
no it's bound to happen
all he's worried about is getting UNK and he's as i think i said yesterday he starts to feel a bit frustrated with his UNK control the ball flows all over the place and then somehow or other he's got at the real quality UNK in the opposition side he's got dasilva out might have been a slightly lucky dismissal caught down the leg side and he's got him out and he's done that in every match he's played he's given away runs pretty rapidly but he keeps getting vital UNK as well
well he's running up now see what he can do with this one ooh over second slip down to the four runs another one has slip and a leap like UNK and erm away he went
he might be a bit less philosophical about that one in that it was it was great it was UNK wasn't it
indeed well i suppose it was i did it i don't think he got a catch did he UNK he's given a leap in the air and he's now on his knees explaining what's happened
well it went very quickly
terribly fast it was er over his left shoulder going down there like a rate of knots and he's now telling the other slips putting his left hand showing where it might have gone
anyhow it's four runs for who is now eight and he's made them both in four but his two fours eight when you get three fours two fours i think and a three in his first UNK of eleven
away goes lawrence now living UNK pushes this one forward that's a better stroke goes square on the off side to the nearer to the two UNK by robin smith
just one other cricket match again i said in hertfordshire this one's at UNK near UNK and their cricket UNK long way ahead in fact but it's erm twenty first september but we shan't have time to talk about it before two o'clock and it's in aid of the garden UNK at UNK a very worthy cause that and john UNK taking a UNK eleven against the UNK who are the local team john runs them down there so that er that is at UNK two o'clock start twenty first september have a look at john UNK and his UNK eleven all in a good cause and the UNK watch them as well
here is lawrence bowls this one oh
wonder why he took his bat up just away i don't know
went through to russell and certainly a good overlap from lawrence his score is eight runs so a hundred and twenty seven for four and now describing play for the next twenty minutes we've got john UNK
he's bowling with considerable pace there did lawrence that UNK him up and he was rushing in he's got his line right round that off stump and plays a bit of a open face anyway so those in the slip gordon beware and the one that did get an edge it flew through both ian UNK who's at second and graham UNK they both stand pretty close they work on the theory that it's better to drop them then to have them UNK in front of you but they could have been about five yards deeper in that the one that went flying through with the character
very quick ball indeed here's tufnell UNK from the nursery end UNK the ball into his left hand he's now to bowl to who's down the pitch driving to lawrence there's no run
it's a fascinating contest between tufnell and particularly another right UNK who's found him very difficult indeed
he's having all sorts of problems outside the off
three men catching on the off side a slip UNK and silly point
there's tufnell again passed on by john hampshire bowling in UNK that he gets it away very fine indeed he's running right underneath us here he gets to the ball now you can almost hear his UNK past the and a good return and has two
brings him to nine a hundred and twenty nine for four
some UNK from left and dennis and sri UNK haven't given up hope
here's facing tufnell UNK again but he doesn't make contact this time the ball goes through jack UNK leg who now have a bye ian UNK moves from slip takes off his UNK and UNK to throw to russell
now this contest i'm looking forward too it's young left UNK who plays all manner of strokes where the superb hundred at UNK last weekend and er UNK in particularly since UNK the leg UNK on a short leg side boundary and it was similar situation today
let's see if he does he comes chapel now to bowl to him and he UNK that away on that leg side that's the area you're gonna try and hit it that's four runs anywhere near it so making intentions plain he's going for that leg side boundary that was a real power shot hit with a spin this is exactly the way he played at UNK he got away with it there he moves on to twelve i think there's going to be a field change as a result of that and quite rightly so
david lawrence moving from mid on he's going to strengthen that leg side boundary
goes in front of square
he's a deep forward square leg and there's lawrence about thirty yards away from him a little UNK here's tufnell the he cuts it away on the off side that's a fine and wide give himself a little bit of room ease that away through extra cover steward in front of the UNK four more which is the way he plays sixteen not out
a hundred and thirty eight for four
yes all coming in boundaries thank you bill
from eleven balls he really is an exciting young player
surveys that leg side boundary
it's two men saving single on the off side as a mid off and here comes tufnell again to bolton that's pitched up and this time plays a very defensive shot on the off side the ball UNK out to smith at point that's the end of UNK over
UNK on his cap and UNK away towards the out field
has nine and sixteen sri UNK a hundred and thirty eight for four yes it has UNK his figures seventeen UNK ten UNK two for twenty seven so ten runs coming off that over
it's exciting though david lloyd who's UNK into the box again
well that's the way to play i think against philip tufnell around the bat plays natural games you swing it away swing with the tie hit with the spin UNK again the next delivery was a rank one which he cracked through the off sides
take the take the battle to the bowler
away goes david lawrence the start of the fifty ninth over of this UNK a hundred and thirty eight for four he's UNK to short outside the off stump he lets that go through to russell
there's one thing best UNK he played in that UNK down at UNK and it was a short boundary it was a good deal shorter in fact this one we have here at lord's in this match is a six over cover off good old UNK who was UNK downhill there at UNK all arms and legs and UNK him over for six
he would have enjoyed that
yeah
he was not a happy man no it was a great shot
he give it a full swing of the bat
david lawrence is a little quicker than tony his present with some problems with his last over UNK away through the slips
it's who's facing lawrence now he's in and bends off a short ball going towards UNK at leg UNK played it pretty well in fact the ball UNK up towards his UNK angle the back down played it very safely
you'll know more about it than me john but er i just think that david lawrence er from the UNK end is click this morning he's UNK some very quick deliveries we've been saying all along that this is a very UNK pitch now and a good UNK service er against the but there's been some quick deliveries this morning
yes all that rhythm one day you have it the next you don't and er lawrence has certainly got it today you can tell by just looking at a bowler running in if he's easy and relaxed lawrence i suppose never really looks relaxed when he's UNK into bowl but he's UNK he's right at the UNK
away he goes again now past UNK bird he bowls that's another quick ball outside the off stump and er lets that one go through to russell
so it is a slow pitch there's very little pace in it for him but it never puts him off he still comes UNK in and er he'll flat out on anything that it we were saying some days he gets it right and others he doesn't
just had a chat with UNK stewart and erm he offered that he thought david lawrence was a bit tired in the test matches that he's played and that it's took it out of him and not very quick
i should think he is tired he's been running around this field he's been at deep square leg at third man and everywhere and he just gave me that blank UNK
yes they haven't really looked after him in the field have they
they could have put him down to UNK somewhere and left him there quietly for an hour or two but certainly yesterday he was running all over the field
UNK his UNK with a sweat band on his left wrist UNK up now comes UNK in again to bowl to that's a quick ball and UNK down into the UNK off the back foot short UNK it down too smooth
UNK and together at second spinning it it's sort of back spin version UNK er puts it on his head he'll be happy with the way the morning's gone hmm
they've removed the danger man as far as england were concerned and dasilva both back in the UNK and they were the UNK that england needed
certainly felt if sri UNK had any chance at all of knocking off these runs they had to score big hundreds
oh that's not to be sri UNK are a hundred and thirty eight for four and here's lawrence to pitched up and he drives outside the off stump the ball goes through to russell low again beaten back at the pace UNK a shot outside the off stump he was trying to hit it somewhere through extra cover
moral victory there for lawrence who very UNK it's good to see UNK pull through turns on his UNK and sets off back again in search of his mark
he's got a long way to go to find it
all of thirty five yards i should think
had a chat with UNK bird on the way back
not short of a word UNK to the UNK
i saw UNK this morning and i said to him how do you let these UNK follow through the other pitch
oh my oh my
he's had a good game they've both had good games difficult for them with the ball turning and UNK round the bat
an UNK nightmare really lots of appeals
away he goes lawrence again to the right handed and that's short on the back foot plays it down with a dead bat ball UNK little more than a yard or two
so another over full of effort from david lawrence he takes a massive breath and then UNK himself off some distant corner of the field
a hundred and thirty eight for four has nine sixteen and lawrence has completed thirteen UNK now one for forty three
best bite of erm when everybody's round the bat and there's a bit of action
do you think so
oh i do yeah i used to love it and i'm sure these two er get i mean very good UNK is UNK bird and john hampshire
they'll be happy with this situation with UNK around the bat and having to make decisions
well there's three men UNK round them now as tufnell comes to bowl to who covers up and plays a very certain spec defensive shot
there's robin smith who's moved a little UNK in fact you can't call him silly point now he's more of a silly mid off on that's sort of line and he's about three yards on bat two men out deep on the leg side there's tough on the who's UNK that one away on the leg side i think that could well be safe for who's chasing wicket two UNK it's over the rope and four more runs to he's kept up his one hundred per cent boundary rate moves on to twenty five fours and it again his eye very much on that short leg side boundary and tufnell and UNK they're having further consultations and that leg side field being adjusted again
lawrence is coming UNK which means i'm sure that becomes UNK
he's gone to bowl in the deep mid wicket position and UNK just giving himself a few yards er mid on
here's tufnell again for that one comfortable low in turn he played pretty well in fact but it's down in front of his feet and then very UNK picks down and picks the ball up gives it to jack russell
very UNK attitude this young man only twenty one
straight through UNK hand this time i'm sure that's the stewart a little in fact UNK at the UNK that's the UNK in was well home
was suppose to rapidly back up he's twenty two born thirtieth june UNK
he's got a single
he has he's broken his little sequence there twenty one
a hundred and forty three for four
interest to see how he plays david lawrence when he gets his he'll be he can just slash him away on the off side
on nine facing tufnell UNK out a full length ball and guides it down on the off side poor old david lawrence has to give another painful chase their from backward point but er he UNK after it and sends it an UNK return on the er he's UNK round as he threw it
poor david lawrence the ball does seem to follow him around whenever he's bowling as well he ease himself back to his position now two more to he moves on to eleven
a hundred and forty five for four
UNK for lawrence to reach his position
he's there now a little and tufnell UNK his approach gets up to the and UNK his hands in the dust of the foot holes and sets off back to his mark
he's bowling from the nursery end here at lord's where a skip comes in to leg stump but he UNK that one nicely round to
he'll a deep square leg
he sends the return one more to he keeps the strike the end of UNK over a hundred and forty six for four chasing four hundred and twenty three runs to win
david lawrence is certainly having a lot of work to do in the field as well as bowl runs a long way that's to be better at deep back with square leg in place of philip UNK and let UNK do some running about he's just had a drink there
is fine swinging the ball with the tide erm when UNK bowling just an alteration in the field mike was deep forward square leg if that's the right place he was neither square UNK or mid wicket and it's prompted him to move UNK but he's just a natural swing for the left UNK to hit with the tide in that mid wicket area
which he did with UNK he looked at the area assessed it thought well i can get it there without any problem at all
prompted UNK to move mid wicket
UNK has moved himself now to a very advanced second slip no he's going back to the aisle or to i thought perhaps his position as lawrence comes into short down the leg side and russell takes it on his knees but the conscience i think of the ball not carrying he just mostly can chris lewis that come up a yard or two and lewis UNK a mark with his boot
who's probably the UNK first at position a yard or two behind jack russell and UNK is probably a yard in front of jack russell at second slip and lewis a foot or two up on him at third
conscious of a ball not carrying through all the time to jack russell and while a slash or a drive will go very fast to them have to be sure that the ball is going to carry
away goes lawrence shirt UNK with sweat he bowls to who plays well forward taking the bottom hand off the bat and the ball rolls up to lawrence who doesn't field it it's hugh morris running from short leg who then hands the ball to philip UNK gives it a good UNK on his right UNK
lawrence i think gave his UNK to turned his nose up a little and UNK it into his left pocket
it's the sweat rag erm david lawrence er uses that at the end of every ball er from UNK just to wipe his UNK he really is sweating UNK as you say his shirt is very wet he's had a lot of work to do
a very warm day here at lord's UNK just starting to get up a little in fact the sun has just disappeared behind one of a very few clouds
away goes lawrence to takes it again with the bottom hand away from the bat it's off the back foot this time UNK it down in front of him a short of a length ball
yes there's the er sweat rag as you call it being UNK from UNK to lawrence who as he UNK his hands rather like a UNK
well his which is a UNK of a delivery and the new directive of course UNK bird immediately called it normal
great nasty ball to get
it was dasilva wasn't it who lucky not to er to be UNK on the hand by that
no intention i'd thought
no slipped out
still got to deal with it
tell me if you've had ninety miles an hour straight at your heart
lawrence takes a deep breath and starts off again with this massive approach comes in now to it's short and it ends in a way i think probably off the body he tried to take the bottom hand away again that they do seemed to be trying this angle of attack at him as UNK there at leg UNK and a short leg and they're trying to be don't forget the balls at 's UNK he's certainly UNK by that one
he looks right david lawrence i must say and that was a very quick delivery and getting back to your other point that slips coming forward going back it's just every now and again that it doesn't come out right from david lawrence it goes down comparatively slowly but when he does get it right it really flies through to slips
there's a huge i know we keep saying it but it really is his greatest virtue
away he goes again with those huge boots of his UNK in now to that's pitched up UNK him on the pad ball go going down the leg side
trevor UNK a little he's UNK his UNK pad now UNK in there at the rate of knots and er hugh morris at short leg UNK
i think we've said it before did about david lawrence that he has the ability to bowl very quickly and in that learning curve of test cricket he's now got to go from a lad who goes for five and six and all the regularly he's got to drop that economy rate down to three and still take the and then he's a test bowler
yes he's got to become with experience only come with playing tests
with and malcolm not really firing for derbyshire i shouldn't think lawrence would be a UNK certainty for the winter team
he comes down to and that's a better looking shot from comfortable defensive slope which he pushes back up the pitch and from mid on a rare a house bowl with more economy great economy er in this UNK walking over one for forty three a hundred and forty six for four
well also better figures er what you've got to stress is that he doesn't lose pace
he bowls more consistently he gets it in the area that troubles top test class UNK which is off stump a decent height and a decent pace without really falling all over the shot only come with experience
he's UNK away down to deep square leg and trevor ward the kent UNK there with a large drink for him
it's tufnell to bowl to he's a good contest he edges that one away on the leg side just for a single that's a shame because er it really is a good contest this
he has a run hugh morris UNK after it and returns the ball to russell
moves on to twenty two
a hundred and forty seven for four the UNK continues with
sri UNK there certainly supporting their team
cluster of four UNK round 's back now they're all UNK as tufnell comes in to bowl to is it an appeal from tufnell as the ball UNK him on the pad but he's playing well forward but the question tufnell is asking really to john hampshire is he playing a shot
he's just hiding the bat behind the pad
couple of decades there has been an UNK interest in the UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK and society at large on the one hand it worships at the UNK of science and technology and then it turns and pays its cash and it does pay its cash and its UNK at the signs of the UNK and at the other various things dealing wi or are a part of the UNK
almost every newspaper national newspaper and local free papers will have er their UNK television and radio chat shows again will have their resident UNK telephone call lines to find out what the stars have in store for you an UNK interest in the in the various branches of the UNK
some few years ago we were told that we were entering the age of UNK
now this was really rather a low key introduction to a whole new way of life that at the moment is sweeping through the united states and is on our doorstep
not just a religious movement but something that involves and UNK every area of life from high national and international politics right the way down to the very colour of the of the latest UNK the new age movement and sometime in the future we're gonna lo talk a little bit about that
but there's this involvement wi with UNK
now it's not then that society doesn't believe in the UNK we believe in the UNK society at large believes in the UNK the tragedy is that the natural man the natural person however as always is more willing to believe UNK than he is to believe god's UNK
our priorities get turned inside out they get inverted
scientists UNK that the principles of natural law that UNK our universe cannot be turned aside you cannot ignore them they are fixed they are great things that you cannot alter god cannot do anything about them
and so when you come to the bible and you read the account of jesus here on the earth turning the water into wine of jesus UNK the storm when you into the old testament and you read accounts there of the children of israel of the me of the tremendous miracles that were performed by UNK god for them well of course there's a natural explanation to it because you can't do these things there are natural laws that stop you doing them you cannot take a glass of water even if you're god you cannot take it and make it into a glass of wine instantly it's got natural processes to go through
and of course when jesus came and he UNK the people and he spoke words of deliverance to those who are UNK and he spoke words of that brought help to those who are blind and so on there is of course er to the natural mind a very natural explanation it can all be explained away because you cannot do these things
and yet the same science and the same technology that UNK of the UNK of the natural laws the same time is able to set it one law against it another itself and he can do what he wants
these same men use one set of laws to cancel the effects of another for example the application of the law of UNK enables them to cancel the effect of the law of gravity that's why you can go up in an aeroplane
man can do it but god is not allowed to do it he can't do it
well let's look for a few moments this morning at one such incident when jesus did do it and it's in er mark chapter four i want to read a few verses from there mark chapter four
i'm gonna read from verse thirty five just the paragraph there the last paragraph in that chapter it says on that day when evening had come jesus said to them let us go over to the other side and leaving the multitude they took him along with them just as he was in the boat and other boats were with them
and there arose a fierce gale of wind and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up and he himself was in the UNK asleep on the UNK
and they UNK him and said to him teacher do you not care that we are UNK
and being UNK he UNK the wind and said to the sea UNK
be still
the wind died down and it became perfectly calm
and he said to them why are you so UNK
how is it that you have no faith
and they became very much afraid and said to one another who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him
jesus had been with his disciples and he had spent the whole day in teaching and preaching to the people he'd been explaining to them what the kingdom of god was like he'd been telling them some of the UNK that perhaps we're familiar with he'd been telling them about the parable of the sewer and the seed the man who went out and he UNK his seed and different things went wrong birds came and picked up the stuff that fell by the UNK some fell on UNK ground and it couldn't put down any roots some fell amongst UNK and they were quickly UNK but some did fall in good prepared soil and that grew
and so jesus had been teaching the people
and at the end of the day he's tired he's physically UNK and he says let's get away for a while let's go over to the other side
now it's im that's an important little phrase there what jesus says let's go to the other side
he wasn't going for a joy trip he wasn't going out in the boat just to se to while away an hour or so to relax and to UNK he wasn't going there to just to get away from the crowd of people that had been following him and had been listening to him he had a purpose in going in into the boat to go to the other side
we're not gonna be looking at it this morning but it's quite simple if you were to read on down the reason why is because on the other side there is a man there who is UNK of a whole UNK of demons who desperately needs deliverance and jesus is going over there to bring healing to bring deliverance to this man
but it's important for what we're going to be thinking of this morning to re keep that little phrase in mind that jesus said to them let us go over to the other side there was purpose in going into that boat
and we see in this account this incident in the life of jesus that jesus is able to bring peace
there in the midst of UNK in the midst of UNK in the midst of anxiety and fear in the in the midst of UNK these disciples not knowing what to do where to turn jesus christ is able to bring peace
and the good news the message of the gospel is that jesus christ is still able to do that
into your life into my life he is able to bring peace
whether we know him or not whether we've never had any dealings with him in the past or not he is able to bring peace once we allow him to come in and to take control of the situation
but even if we've known him for many years if we're committed christians if we've been followers of jesus there are occasions there are times in our life when there is UNK and there is UNK and if we allow him to se to take control he is able to bring peace
so th let's look then back at this illustration for a moment this incident jesus then gets er a few of his disciples and they go out in the boat and there are others who follow him they get into their boats quite likely quite possibly that many of the others would have been followers of jesus some of his other disciples it's unlikely in these very small little er UNK fishing boats that many of disciples would have got in there might have been four or five of them that would have been about the lot and so the others would have got into some of the other boats which were nearby and others are the people that had been listening to jesus they too get into boats and they pull out following him wanting to hear if he's got anything more to say wanting to witness anything else that he's gonna do they wanna be there to see and to hear what jesus has to say and is going to do
and whilst they're sailing across this little lake there in the evening a sudden storm UNK up now in the version of the bible that i'm reading from it says there that er that is was a fierce storm other versions will er give different e different expressions it was a fierce sorry a fierce gale of wind
er some UNK will put it tha that a that a great storm blew up but he word that is originally used there is the wi i UNK the idea that this is no ordinary storm this is just a sudden UNK that has blown and in a in a short while will blow itself out again but it's a strong word that's used here a word that would that would UNK a UNK or a UNK something above and beyond the ordinary course of events that these disciples many of them experience UNK would have known and been able to cope without any problem
so whilst they're sailing across everything is calm everything is peaceful and suddenly there arose this fierce gale this UNK
so much so that the waves were UNK over the boat and the boat was filling up with water
and these disciples and jesus some of them UNK experienced UNK they'd been UNK all their lives their fathers had been UNK before them and they were frightened
they had never experienced anything like this before
and we find that life is not all plain sailing
life is not just sailing through on a mill pond with sort of red UNK in the UNK and that UNK picture life is not like that
but life has its UNK it has its UNK and some of them are a lot UNK than others
fearful UNK sometimes come along our way and we wonder what is happening to us and we feel that we're being thrown around and UNK about from side to side there seems no way out
there's seems to be no possible escape
and you have to start questioning
and that's just what these disciples did they started questioning what's he doing there
we're working here
we're gonna die
and there is jesus asleep
well we don't perhaps quite use that sort of language but we start saying well where is god in all this
if there is a god of love why doesn't he see my situation
if there is a god of love a god who cares then why doesn't he do something about it
why doesn't help me
why doesn't make a way of escape for me
where is this god of love when i'm going through this situation
now that's a question that we can all come up with at times whether we're christians or non christians we come up and we question where is god in this situation
why doesn't he do something about it
if he is there if there is a god can he not do something
why can't he help me
as i said life is not all plain sailing there are troubles there are UNK and some of them are very fierce and some of them would cause us to wonder if there is an escape
now that doesn't matter whether we're christians or not christians that is the course of life that happens to every one of us
becoming a christian is not the solution and the answer and the th the grand UNK it UNK all of life's problems it takes away all the difficulties
jesus christ never ever made that claim in fact he said before you follow me count the cost
weigh up what it will cost you to commit your life to me
it's not an escape route from all your troubles and all your problems it's not an escape route from all the difficulties and all the unpleasant things in life it's not a UNK of ease and of in of un UNK and enjoyment day after day
the sun will not always UNK on you
jesus said before you follow me count the cost
weigh it all up
but don't be a fair weather man
don't be a fair weather UNK
and when the difficulty gets going gets hard you turn back he says don't do that
but before you start count the cost
he said that a man who's gonna build a build something let's put it in a modern setting the man who's gonna a man and woman a couple are gonna put an extension on their house they don't just go down and buy a few dozen bricks er and a bag UNK and start they work out how much it's gonna cost them first of all
you see they might have enough for that first barrel load of bricks and the first bag of UNK and sand but perhaps the money will run out shortly after that
and they've got is just a perhaps a few courses of brickwork
they might even get half the wall up but that's as far as their capital goes
he says no he says any man wanting to build an extension on his house he's gonna sit down and gonna count the cost of it
he's gonna see how much it's gonna cost him in pounds and pence
he's then gonna look at his bank account and see if he can afford it or not
and he'll only start the job if he can afford it that's if he's a wise man
and jesus says so count the cost of following me
now jesus wasn't saying this to stop people following him
not at all
he wanted them to follow him
but he did not want them to follow him under any false UNK
he didn't want them to follow him thinking that he was just a free ride a free ticket for all their problems a and difficulties
as the bible says in the world you have you will have UNK you will have difficulties you will have problems
there are the problems of life which are common to every one of us whether they're christian or not christian whether we believe in god or not there are problems and difficulties and situations that are they're the common lot of UNK
we all know suffering we all know grief we all know UNK
but jesus says weigh up the costs balance the account
and so we've said life is it's gonna bring us problems it's gonna bring us UNK it's UNK and some of them are gonna be very fierce
but you know for the person who does not know jesus christ as their saviour for the person who has never committed their life to god listen to what god says for that person
he says the wicked are like the UNK sea and you know as far the bible is concerned the wicked is not necessarily the man or the woman who does terrible deeds the wicked is not necessarily who is who is a UNK or a child UNK or a thief or a wife UNK or something like that the wicked is the person who UNK god who turns their back on god who says thank you i can go through my life without i don't need you i don't even believe you exist and even if i do believe you exist i'm gonna do things my way i'm gonna go through life as i choose
and god says the wicked are like the UNK sea for it cannot be quiet and it's waters UNK up refuse and mud
there is no peace says my god for the wicked
that's the word of god through isaiah the prophet
there is no peace for the wicked
for the person who UNK and UNK god
who wants to go through life by UNK doesn't mean to say that all the kind of life is one big storm not at all
david the UNK he could see the wicked and he said why do they UNK
why do i have a hard time and there's the UNK person UNK
he said but david only saw the surface
and you know the surface is not all i you look out on the sea and it looks like the UNK mill pond it's calm it's barely a UNK of water but it's not still
i remember many years ago we had friends who had a fishing boat er herring UNK and in UNK the there's a young lad going out with them for a night's fishing and it was a beautiful UNK night
and the sea was it was as calm as the mill pond
i've never been as sea sick in all my life
because you see that surface water it was only surface water because when that boat was drifting there was an awful lot of movement
it was it was going from side to side
it was going up and down
there was a lot of movement under those first few inches of surface water
and that's the picture that god through isaiah uses
and this particular it maybe all nice and calm on the surface but underneath there is a whole UNK of UNK
that's what it says it brings up the mud and the refuse
that comes from the se the UNK churning it up but the sea is never still it's UNK and in as the movement there underneath although it may appear calm on the surface but there are times when it's not calm on the surface it's as rough on top as it is underneath
most of you won't remember the time and i certainly don't some of you will you'll be familiar with the er healing accounts seeing pictures on er either in magazines or on the television news in old news UNK of that time when UNK stepped out of an aeroplane and he's just been to germany and had a meeting with hitler
he comes back with a little piece of paper in his hand waving it peace in our time
the scrap of paper and you know the th the result of that and you know the conclusion of it all
the whole world in a matter of months is UNK in the in the UNK of the second world war
oh it looked good on the surface but underneath it was dark and peaceful
and your life can be like that
it looks alright on the surface you're not going through a hassle at the moment and our memories are short fortunately and once we come into a calm patch the UNK of yesterday are quickly forgotten
we were just enjoying the calm and the peace of today
but underneath there are those UNK and those UNK
and jesus he meant to come and bring peace
they say peace it doesn't just go on the top two inches of the surface water it goes right to the very depths of your life and keeps
one occasion jesus said my peace to his disciples shortly before he left my peace i leave with you
i don't give what the world gives i do it
i don't give something i haven't got i don't give something i've no right to give i'm not giving you something just for i'm giving you my peace
and there was never a time when the life of jesus is not UNK us
you go through all sorts of situations and circumstances but there is a peace and an equilibrium it wasn't just on the surface it was right to the very depths of his being the whole being
but you say but i am a christian i've experienced god's peace i've accepted jesus christ as my saviour
i love the lord
i seek to serve him
but there are still those raging UNK that come
there are still those UNK that hit my life and would not be around and would almost UNK me
well there is a difference you see there is a difference
and the big difference for these disciples was that they were not alone
though you're going through the storm but jesus is in the boat with you
there is the difference for the person who has put their trust in god who has committed their life to christ and they will go and you and i will go through those UNK and through those UNK and be knocked around and be almost UNK by them but the thing is we are not alone jesus christ he is in the boat of your life with you
he says i will never leave you
i will never UNK you
let me come into the book of UNK and those words he uses are actually to be UNK and UNK
cos in the UNK i will never leave you
i will never UNK you
he promises that which is i will lead you till the end of the age
and jesus was there with them
and that made all the difference for them
and they turn to him and he speaks a word that brings deliverance
and he gets up and sees the situation and remember he said jesus wasn't out for joy ride he wasn't just passing an evening relaxing and UNK and resting away from the crowd he had gone into the boat for a purpose he was going to the other side and no storm was gonna stop him getting there
there was a man there who desperately needed deliverance
he was UNK with a whole UNK of demons
he was he was th they took him they UNK him up and they let him loose in the local UNK and left him there
you can imagine the population of th of a nearby town every now and again they would come down and perhaps throw some food over in this man's direction a loaf of bread a UNK of meat or some other food every now and again so he would keep alive
but he UNK and UNK and UNK through the local UNK
so they tied him with chains but the UNK powers were so great in his life that he UNK them like new UNK
here was a man who desperately needed jesus
and jesus was going across to the other side to look for this man
and no storm was gonna stop him
and the disciples didn't know that of course
they were just concerned for themselves
we're gonna per UNK
we're gonna die
so jesus when he sees their situation he's not concerned by the storm by the way he's not put out by that because he knows he's going to the other side but for the sake of them he gets up and he speaks the word jesus he said peace
be still
be UNK
silence
he speaks that word of command and the wind UNK it really is UNK
the UNK calm
and the disciples are happy once again
and jesus asked them a question he says to them why are you so UNK
how is it that you have no faith
and j b phillips in his UNK he puts that last question like this what has happened to your faith
you see it wasn't that they had no faith they had faith we were saying the other week when we were dealing with this we all have faith it's what we do with it
they had faith their faith was in themselves and in UNK out and they couldn't bail quick enough and so their faith was not realizing anything it wasn't producing the goods
they had faith they had seen jesus perform miracles they had seen him heal the sick they had seen him give sight to the blind they had seen some of the tremendous things that jesus had done
they'd been there at the wedding when the wine that water had been turned into wine
they had they had witnessed him casting out demons they had heard his teaching they were familiar with jesus they had every reason to be to have faith in him he says what has happened to your faith
and very soon they were he said a moment ago they had taken it from jesus they were no longer trusting in him and they started to trust in themselves in their own ability
you see as long as things were happening their faith was riding high
as long as the miracles were flowing as long as the sight er was given to the blind people as long as the UNK were walking as long as th the UNK were being UNK they had faith ten feet tall
well when you see things like that happening you can afford to have faith ten feet tall
it's not difficult to believe
and yes certainly you and i can be like that
when everything is going fine for us and god is in quote blessing us when our life is flowing UNK it's easy then to have faith it's easy then to trust but do you know those disciples in that boat they were no safer after jesus UNK the storm than beforehand
their safety had not increased one little bit granted they were more comfortable and granted they were enjoying themselves more they felt better but they were no safer
during the past two or three generations there have been there has been this idea of god's favour being expressed in blessing
very often we'd link that blessing with material things the physical things the healing the prosperity you know god's UNK us just because i'm sick he UNK me
i can't find that in god's word
it's not there
that is not an evidence of his blessing
you see if that's how we're to judge blessing then what are we to say to people to men like c t UNK who UNK an inheritance that in today's value just in the early part of this century but in today's value be worth millions of pounds to go to the UNK and to china and to india
in later le li years leaving his wife behind him cos she was unable to go and going to serve his god UNK where is the blessing in that if this is how we take god's blessing
or what are we gonna say to men like UNK taylor there in china buried his wife and buried his daughter and son
and UNK in UNK his whole family within a few short years of getting there
men like jim UNK who in seek of the taking of good news of the gospel to the indians becomes as a young man a UNK
to men like teddy UNK who in his whole life serving the of the UNK ends up as a UNK
he was UNK
where is god's blessing in that
if we UNK god's blessing with the nice things that happen to us then they were not blessed
and they've given far more than but you or i will ever UNK doing for god
and yet is that blessing
is that what it really means
is that what the bible means by being blessed by god
let me read you two or three verses the bible has to say about blessing first of all the verse in the book of UNK chapter ten verse twenty two
it sets the scene perhaps for it said it is the blessing of the lord that makes rich and he adds no sorrow to it
and we read that and we start thinking of UNK in the terms of pounds and pence and material possessions
of course it's nothing to do with that
but as jesus said a man's life does not consist in the in the UNK of the things he UNK that's not how you gauge your person's UNK
it's not how many stocks and shares they've got it's not what the size of their balance is how much they've got on deposit account how much credit how credit worthy they are that is not the UNK of a man or a woman
here the wise man says the blessing of god it makes a person rich and it does not bring sorrow with it
it's a strange verse
put it to the back of your mind a moment please
as i turn in to the book of genesis i read there of god coming to abraham and saying to abraham that abraham in your family all the nations of the world are gonna be blessed
how is that blessing gonna come
it comes through the messiah
it blessed the for abraham the messiah
jesus
because we become middle class
because we've become better off
of course not
we are blessed in him because he gave his life for us
that is the source of god's blessing
not in getting but rather in giving
the apostle paul when he's writing to the UNK in his first letter to them one UNK
well what is this
what's the definition
i suppose if i come around and ask each one of us this morning can you give a definition
i'm writing a dictionary and i'm stuck on a word i want the definition of blessing
and i suppose for every person here there would be a i would say a similar but a different er definition
there'd be a lot of similarity to it and i think if we're honest a lot of it would come back to things
well let's see what god himself has to say cos he gives us a definition of blessing
gives it to us in UNK a hundred and thirty three and it's in the last verse
he is talking about god people being in unity
and he says as a result of them being in unity dwelling together in unity he says it is there that the lord UNK the blessing
whatever that is
and it gives the blessing for what it is
life forever
that is god's blessing
that is god's blessing to you
that is god's blessing on me
it's not how i UNK financially
it's not whether i'm in good health
it's not whether a whether i've all my little UNK prayers answered
god's blessing to me is life forever
that's his blessing to you
it's not making a list
it's not giving you total health and free you from all sickness and diseases
it's not answering all your prayers
it's not making your life easy
it is giving you life forever
that is the blessing
that is his big parcel he's given to you
it's wrapped up in a
thanks be unto god for his UNK gift
the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
those disciples they had the storm UNK for them and it got easier sailing
it was plain sailing then to the other side
they were more comfortable it was a it was a more enjoyable journey and let's be honest if i can go through life without UNK and without problems my life will be more enjoyable of course it and these difficulties and these UNK coming away coming your way your life will be more enjoyable
but like the disciples it will not be any better or any safer
their safety did not depend on the storm being still
their security and safety depended on jesus being with them
that was it
your safety and your security and my safety and security in life does not depend on how pleasant my ways are and how pleasant my UNK are how much i manage to UNK and how i can overcome all the little difficulties and problems and steer clear of the big ones the security and safety of my life now and in eternity security is there in the boat and lying with him
see the real peace is not the UNK of the storm the real peace is that the assurance of who is going to stop it
that's the promise to your eternal life
i will never leave you
you don't understand the circumstances you don't understand the storm i might i might not leave that to me he says i will be with you
i will never leave you
i will never UNK you even to the end of the
well let's see
