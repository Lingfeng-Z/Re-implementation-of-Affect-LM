yes
we shall just have to pretend it's not there there's not there's not quite as bad as when i had to speak for amnesty on radio essex last year and it was live as every word every word i spoke was being you know being heard by a lot of people and that's that was very that was very UNK
erm i think since we've got some new people here i'll perhaps just say a little bit about the group shall i just to explain how we operate and erm and also how this meeting is going to operate erm
we are one of about three hundred amnesty groups in the country probably about this size perhaps well were i mean this group is probably about an average for the you know the groups in the country some are smaller some are much larger but er usually it's about a dozen or so people meeting once a month or that often in a room erm but apart from groups there are a l there are a great many more people who are called individual members of amnesty about eighty thousand i think now who are who just joined by writing to headquarters and many of those have no contact with the groups at all we've had list of the people in this area and they run into hundred and fifty two hundred people who live in this area who er who belong who belong to amnesty but don't actually come to a group except for a small number of us
so the groups are very important though because the groups do a great deal of the work for amnesty cos UNK different from many organisations erm in that er what the groups do particularly the letter writing erm helps to make the organisation work it's not just a matter of raising money we do things to fund raise or two er have a proper publicity erm the le the letters we write for prisoners and helps amnesty to do it's work and not many other organisations operate like that
you can still do that as an individual member cos in the magazine that comes every two months there are always cases but er it er it's not qu UNK the same as doing it in a group where we have our own particular prisoners to look after
so as far as this meeting's concerned erm most of our meetings are basically business meetings but we have tried and we will try to put in speakers and do different things from time to time we had er a woman last time who'd been to central america recently and she gave us a very interesting talk on a visit to el UNK and UNK erm and we we'd like to do that more often but what we do really erm to begin with any rate is we go th we go through the headings on this sheet on the on the minutes we use them as headings for others and erm items on the agenda and er some may have more to say than others and there are one or two not on there which we'll pop in as we go along
so we start with apologies does any one have any apologies to give to ann
yeah UNK and UNK
yeah mike and he's erm i don't think he's i think he will be able to in future he's got a meeting arranged tonight and he'll be here next time
we don't have from UNK school do we
mm
yes
you're there oh sorry
you're not the same that's why that's why
i'm sorry i'm so sorry right so you're from UNK school
yes
right good that's
margaret can you ask if i circulate that list again can you put your surname anyone who's new your surname and then address
oh are you new
yes
can you put your surname and address so i can send you the minutes after this
i've got
right and so your group's actually is it now
yes
the other way the other way of in which you can get more close to live amnesty is to UNK as a school group or a youth group or a religious group erm that's nice to see you tonight
erm right now er if you look at the minutes then of last meeting erm can anyone see any thing they want to correct there at all
if they if they seemed to be alright then i just sign a copy and that goes into our records
can i just draw people's attention to the very last point which was made in case any one sending large sums of cash through the post office erm it it's been running for a long time
my mum was the only one who
and you're
so what are you talk
your correct address is road isn't it it's still reads as if it might not be please note that on the membership list UNK 's address is not avenue
is there a avenue
it's avenue
it should be road
it should be road
so is there a avenue
yes there is yes
oh i see
she normally she brings them round to me but erm
shall we just yeah
getting fed up with it
on membership list UNK 's address should be
it should be should be yeah
should be 's road not avenue
right erm so were happy with the with the minutes otherwise alright i'll sign them er
eleventh
eleventh always have to look at them to see
like that
oh you want the UNK of is that what you mean UNK of the UNK people
yeah
they're on they're both on
oh they are on there alright and i've got your address
i've got the address of the other the other
right erm now are there any matters arising from the minutes which erm you want to bring up now which won't come up under any other heading
usually it's sort of following up things which have been mentioned which erm mary events that have taken place
i wonder about this justice and peace group who requested a speaker did they hear any more
mary lives near them
well then
well i'm rather curious erm phone call from eric UNK
UNK is the chair of the UNK group yes
people keep asking UNK
mm
for help and in fact i had already spoken to the justice and peace group so i don't really know where the UNK had come but he said he got a list from british section and bishop's stortford hasn't got any representative at all which is extraordinary so i don't whether rose has little note and told mr
a list of what
got a representative for as a speaker
no representative amnesty all for only known he had i think it was UNK and he ann was out he didn't get her i thought no it wasn't you it was ann and he and he couldn't get her i don't understand quite what's he talking about but anyway i phoned the justice and peace group and found they'd already
spoken
yes and a she's phoned tonight and said she hadn't arranged anything yet but it's in hand
oh i see she hasn't actually given a talk but she's going to
but she's she going to deal with it
i think it's alright
i haven't spoken to her since the last meeting so
but if you do speak to them perhaps you could get them UNK again cos they used to be didn't they in sister may and paul's time
i don't know where they
yes
that was justice and peace group at st UNK
yes
oh right
yeah
yes
yes
so when he's
yes
we should ask UNK when he speaks to them to see if they could do that no right
what happened what it's not as bad as it sounds it'll
oh that's a hand that she she's going to speak that's for the
but erm i understand from quite often got erm individual member UNK enquiries to UNK cos they couldn't find a group erm there's a
oh that's for
yes that's in the UNK it's in the phone book so
see i don't know what
any rate i said we were very much alive
that's right so if
right okay the other thing i was going to ask about we had a big promotion of amnesty by the body shop last year er and we noticed that our price were also going to do promotion of amnesty and we asked wonder if we look into local shops and see what they could find out and what was going on did you find anything
yeah i went in yesterday actually i spoke to the assistant manager and erm it was not good news at all he got two like plastic UNK of leaflets in front of the till
and erm they were absolutely UNK they were really full and he said erm i sa he said he hadn't had to fill them up at all in all the time that it's been running and no i asked him if he had any enquiries and nobody stopped him and asked anything about it and then he turned to the other lad who was beside him the sales assistant and he said no i've had no enquiries at all so that was it
it's a similar story
i just took erm some leaflets take a look at that
it's just erm oh it's their own leaflet at our price
yes
yes
yes but it's about the erm thirty to er
thirty thirtieth anniversary
yes erm the programme on television
mm
erm but again they said they'd hardly anyone had taken any
was that the only publicity though there were no other no
alright liz
i didn't i think that was the that was it was just that
would you bring that other chair
er group
i don't know whether it
would the did the staff seem interested a got a nil positive response from them assistant manager or the other guy who sort of looked at me as if i
erm no it wasn't like that at harlow
i wrote out a
oh doesn't sound very doesn't sound very hopeful
oh dear
erm the body the body shop staff were all give were all given training weren't they and a lot of details and they had a video that they use with them perhaps that's the aspect that's not been looked at so well
mm
yeah
still they've got leaflets there that's something i suppose mm right so there's not there's not a lot more we can do then really is there
yeah
unless you can have
think it's
no if they're if they're if they're not doing it you know the way the body shop did it probably won't come to anything mm right erm are there any other matters arising people want to bring up from the minutes no
oh probably the future of
yes i think
erm right so we'll move on erm to the treasurer's report er now that UNK is a treasurer she can tell us how we stand
right well we have two hundred and sixty five pounds and sixty eight pence in the bank at the moment erm which actually isn't very much if you think that we've got to go right through to july to our next fund raising event so i was wondering that if anyone hasn't paid their subscriptions for last year or if anyone UNK for christmas cards i think there's one or two
how much is the subscription
i don't know you'll have to ask mary
right
how much is it mary
i think it's still
no you didn't pay
i didn't
no i know
i think i made a little note
i think it's still only five pounds isn't it
oh i haven't checked with
mary how much is the subscription
well it's we haven't altered it it's still two fifty if you're an individual member and five pound if you're not
if you're yes
we need a lot of new members
it's because the erm we can't really let the balance go to low especially if we've got the a g m coming up or probably be erm something
don't we
i don't i don't really know i can't remember what
twelve hundred pounds
we extend it to this year as well as last
no what i mean is we don't double the amount i'm sorry we were supposed to send six hundred
ah
in fact this has been a bit over ambitious very pleased with ourselves weren't we perhaps we haven't given ourselves enough
but there's still some christmas cards
ah right well perhaps we can chase people up when they
they there's the little bits yes not too much but a little bit
oh yes that's
but we have been as l low as that before
oh yes
yes it's just that quite right we haven't got a fund a major fund raising event now until july unless anything else of you know smaller UNK up and our two street UNK we know will bring in quite a lot of money
yeah that's right and we had the car park last year didn't we
mm
mm
that was earlier on
mm well we'll just have to go easy
so that's all i think
yes as i say
right now erm the next item is the prisoner but we actually don't have a prisoner at the moment do we because our we have we eat every UNK each amnesty group has er usually nowadays one er given to look after and our most recent prisoner was er UNK is that the right one
yes
from yugoslavia and we heard UNK he was released about august didn't we and then eventually a couple of months ago that he had definitely released erm and were very pleased about that cos was he released before the end of his term he must have been
he was well it wasn't much before it was erm he should of come out in february he came out the previous july
mm
so
mm
so seven months plus another year i think he had already
yes
and he was previously in prison for UNK for handing out leaflets er asking for the independence or the separation of his bit of UNK wasn't he from the from the rest
erm so what were doing is were we hope were waiting for a new prisoner to be allocated to us erm and perhaps we could perhaps we could perhaps we can write and remind you think we should do that
yes
haven't heard anything at all have we
i'm not sure in the lists in the magazine we should have appeared as being having been released
yes i'll check it
he hasn't been in has he
mm
i think they were playing on the sheet i'd sent back doesn't say that we hadn't had any official UNK still didn't although we had it on the telephone we hadn't had anything written
no UNK have we still not had a letter from er
no we haven't
from m i s and that
we had a letter from the international UNK in august or september i think saying that they'd changed the law and all prisoners of a certain category should have been released and our prisoners were amongst our prisoner was amongst that list but erm they didn't say that they haven't got any definite news whether he had been or not about the release
yeah mm
and it wasn't until i phoned the co UNK that he was able to tell me that oh yes that was months ago he said
you know haven't you heard and i said well we've not had any official UNK
well
yeah this is interesting it gets confusing perhaps because erm i rang british section british section today erm UNK about er ah there it is were are we erm UNK about er groups having two prisoners you brought this up last time and as the result of me talking to somebody there erm it became clear that british section still showed us as having UNK as a prisoner erm and they weren't aware that we were no longer dealing with him he'd been released and what they say is they usually get UNK from international UNK
mm
erm and i said well you know as far as i'm aware we've had UNK
yes but it's not written you see
but not written
but it's interesting but the
erm
the co UNK was very definite about his list he there was no question that he had he'd got something written is even he hadn't
mm
perhaps we i mean then british section said to us on this erm and i'd s already said i think er by the time it got to this stage of conversation that we were without a prisoner at the moment but awaiting one and he said well that would ex that would explain it because er until we UNK it british section UNK it you won't get another prisoner they're waiting for UNK from r e s
won't get one
ah well in that case it would be a good idea to write to r e s
so it needs some an action somewhere to erm er he said could we get if we've got a UNK that's from r e s could you send it to british section
no we haven't i anywhere
yes we yes the rea the reason why it this why UNK is if anyone else doesn't realise is that the international UNK which is the international body controlling all amnesty groups throughout the world of which there are maybe fifty sixty i've lost count of the number erm
is in london and we deal with the british section which is are the particular bits but the prisoners have to be UNK and looked at and found by the international UNK then they're passed on to british section who pass them on to us and a great deal of research goes into making sure that they really are truly prisoners of conscience that they've been in prison for some er possibly because of their belief or religion or their race erm and they've not taken or UNK violence not taken part in or UNK violence and then they are full prisoners of conscience erm we maybe allocated them
who should i write to british section or
well some i think it's probably british section probably the best way just to write and say that we know this is the case
erm
let them let do you think let them let cos if we leave it to international UNK they may still not do it
mm
or both
co UNK come under british section and international UNK
the what
the co UNK
i don't there isn't a co UNK for prisoners as such is there
no i'm not sure
there's a UNK for UNK
so you go prisoners that i list them
ah yes
yeah and is he under british section
he comes under british section
mm and if he knows he's been released why doesn't british section knows this
well
mm
it's serious isn't it
well we cou we could write to both if necessary i mean they'd want them to know that we that our UNK been released and that we can have another one
yeah
well certainly who ever it was i spoke to today said their files show they was still dealing with it
mm
what was the outcome of the request of the multiple persons
right the i was about to er come to that erm the erm there is no reason why a group should not have more than one prisoner erm the practical situation is that groups are UNK up to get a prisoner at the moment in fact erm not always the situation but at presently there is a waiting list for who have groups to have a prisoner allocated to them erm if we so wish er ah if a group comes onto the list who has er ah and their prisoner is released and we er in that situation we and any group without a prisoner at all goes to the head of the list and be allocated straight away but we could request a second prisoner and that case would be put to the bottom of the list so when the other groups who who've got no prison will take priority now but we could request a second prisoner if we so wanted so you are talking about a motion at the a g m but it's not really necessary
oh i see
it is
the UNK always there but
the UNK there if we wish to take that up
yes i've always i've always understood more recently the reason why that there would always seemed to be enough prisoners when we know there really must be enough prisoners throughout the world is that the betting procedure and they're making quite sure they're the right people takes time and money and effort erm that's part and also there are some areas of the world now where there aren't as many prisoners as there were there are very few there are very few prisoners of conscience in latin america because they don't put them in prison they just get rid of them they just disappear and there are practically none from latin america countries cos of these UNK rather than being put in prison erm but it's a sort of combination of reasons i think but er quite a long time now ten fifteen years i think groups have only had one prisoner whereas when i first joined and UNK there we had three didn't we at one time
yes oh yes
so that was when there were far fewer numbers of groups than there are now
mm
mm so i'll see
but anyway our prisoner we are fairly sure he's been released he's a we had him for about two was it one or two years
about eighteen months i think
yes and on the whole recently we've had prisoners who been UNK for sort of two or three years we've made up petitions we've sent postcards and we've written letters and er they've been released in reasonably short space of time but then mostly the prisoners which who haven't had a very long sentence unlike the one i mentioned on the way here tonight have the russian who had been in thirty years
ooh
erm and he was released and he came to harlow and we meet him and that was that was very good erm but we haven't had one like that you know for a long time
erm just UNK press we did say last time that would be that UNK release would be mention in the press did you manage that
yeah
oh
well i'll do it in the
yes
erm
right
sorry got to got a UNK on that then what who we writing too on that i'm
who do you think you're writing too
i
erm
i mean i was very much got the impression from her i i'm sorry i didn't get a name the chap i was speaking to but erm it he was very distinct that we should get a letter from i s and that have UNK and er and send it on you know that they all should also should get a copy so it strikes me we should perhaps write a write to i s and perhaps send a copy with a covering letter to british section
i got
erm and brochures sort of thing you know
do you think we should go to i s
yes british section
that an idea yes we if we let them both know then erm we might we might speed things up
yeah then yeah
mm
erm see if there's a UNK and also get er something out
mm
get things moving
yes because it'll be nice us it's i mean they UNK there is a lot oth there is there is a lot of other work now there prisoner are prisoner of is still fairly central isn't it he or she to be to be er the work we do
the most sort of personal thing i suppose erm let the group open
right now if we look on erm we come to regional action networks another reason why amnesty seems not to allocate more than one prisoner and all now is that they have expanded the ways in which we deal with prisoners and the world is more or less been divided up into areas erm of smaller regions and groups are asked to choose one or two regions to deal with particularly and we have for quite a long time now erm been concerned with southern africa and central america and we get information through on prisoners and what's happening in those two regions so john do you have anything else on africa at all
erm i have nothing at all through me erm no UNK come and er no information really there is this change of co UNK up erm
you mention that
co UNK up erm you know i haven't yet had contact from er no i thought i'd been given a new name but no i haven't had con any contact from my new co UNK yet erm but that wasn't in my mind when i spoke on thursday about christmas perhaps i ought to pursue that one in time for the next meeting and see what's happening in south africa and are getting it in south america for
yes
erm i'll well perhaps pursue that
mm
for the ne in time for the next meeting erm there was what's full name for er not sending in a return or couple of returns erm at the last meeting and i've dealt with that and sent them off have they sent you anything else
no thank god
right erm
but er i have nothing er no actions at all which is UNK to me i why nothing's going on i don't know
yeah right thank
i'm UNK of peter he always has much more
are you kidding
it's i mean these the work with the original action network seems to seems to come and go you've got a very large amount at one point and then nothing for sometime it just depends er i think which country they're targeting and how much there is because we had quite a lot on UNK didn't we during the early part on last year not much on south africa recently as if they don't quite know what to do you know with the situation there it's not quite er clarified
mm
right now peter do you have anything on central america this time
erm not a great deal no actions
mm
er so i've a isn't it it's a case of no news is possibly good news again erm i'm trying to get in touch with the national co organiser for carl and john without er any success erm i know he was going to the erm the british section just erm he was gonna check on them and what actions were forthcoming but er i haven't heard about that erm i dare say there's some on the way erm the erm the other few points were erm UNK talk last month she mentioned that erm she was gonna give sort of the more forms sort of side presentation and stuff at their centre in north london i've gotta date for that now it's erm the eighteenth of march which is a wednesday so eh i'll certainly be going if anybody else is interested that's er that's the date er it's not entirely to do with but it has a link in erm we were mentioning campaigns last month i believe there's a fourth coming one on UNK peoples which er it's all sort of UNK off by erm the er five hundredth anniversary of UNK the UNK erm the erm cast and the whole of all the sort of the region and action networks and the UNK are erm gonna have a big link in with that campaign so erm i i'd really like to see us sort of getting involved with that yes and i mean i'll be involved to an extent anyway cos some of the actions that i'll getting will be sort of addressing the issue of UNK people's but erm they if nobody else is UNK to take it on i'll i'd certainly be prepared to erm sort of co UNK that campaign erm having said all that erm i mentioned to a few people that erm in the process of buying a house so erm i could be moving in well hopefully as little as two months time so erm i mean if er is as quite as it has been for the last few months i probably won't have any problems but erm UNK law it's bound to pick up just as i'm moving house
so erm
is the house local or erm
yeah it is local so i'll still be coming to the group i mean it's erm going i mean erm just bear that in mind i might need sort of some help with coordinating cards and things and erm particularly if we do opt into the campaign er it might be UNK for somebody else to do it or at least sort of give me assistance
what is
it ah sorry
i don't mention it
it's central UNK special action stands for it's gives another regional action network erm right i think that's it
right now erm were going to have it on the actual headings as far as the minutes concerned cos we didn't deal with anything very much last time but the next item on the agenda erm is usually campaigns and amnesty erm usually has one or two or more campaigns running on a particular aspect of it's work or a particular country and there was some that really started maybe two or three years ago and which have continued erm in a smaller form since that time
one of those is a death penalty campaign which was a very big one about two to three years ago when we focused particularly on the united states and all the other major countries which erm which er used the best penalty to fairly large extent er do we have anything catherine on that tonight
yes we do actually
mm
erm a couple of days ago that's what they call a surprise action
what a surprise
we asked for space and they said oh mid april and that actually is the next schedule step down action and that's going to be on europe and that'll run from april till june erm but from now till april if anybody would like to write the country which is UNK and this is because they're they suppose that they have extend the death penalty in UNK to include the murder of an off duty police witnesses at the moment it's only erm the death penalty only exists for on duty police officers
so erm it's not actually very big there are about eight addresses here they do say if UNK able to write in spanish
if anybody can sort of if you write in english maybe could send it to you could get it translated at the stortford oh that might be very useful erm i mean i'll certainly do some letters and if anybody else wants to if they let me know i'll let them have the addresses for them erm there are fax as well and that suppose to be a quicker way than writing a letter actually than send through a fax right erm if anybody can then we could send them to you and ask you to send it on and we would sort of UNK would be covered would it margaret
oh yes it could be yes it could it could be if it's not too much not UNK now
yes so the wouldn't be no
so if anybody would like to write i'll let them have all the addresses there are about eight there so erm otherwise it's just the urgent action network which is er a constant thing really
did one yesterday for a man who was due to be UNK today erm i don't know whether he was or not but he probably in a few days time
which country was that
united states
united states
oh gosh
so er that's it anyway it's just UNK at the moment
so you'd like people to come to you afterwards if they help they can
yes if they want to take their address
right thank you erm now ross isn't is there anything further on the thir last year was the thirtieth anniversary of UNK foundation in nineteen sixty one and we've had a campaign and that and that still sort of running is there anything more on that
erm no there's nothing on that
no so perhaps we have finished
well i mean hopefully there there'd be at least er sort of thing erm in the UNK to see what went on during the year
mm
at the moment we have nothing so just have to wait and see
yeah right
now what about these other campaigns we mentioned last time did we decide what or did we leave it till this meeting cos there was india and there was women's
women yeah i spoke to and er it just
yes er i'll campaign
india we were going to discuss it with
so women you've sent have you sent up UNK name or will send it up
i'll will send it up
yes
the late contact
it wasn't er it wasn't a very long one was it was two or three months was it
yeah
mm
i think it was february to april
mm actually we had a women's campaign last year didn't we
yes we did didn't we
sort of a continuation of
we had a fairly good result
yes
i do recall four out of ten released
mm there was quite a lot of publicity given to that wasn't there
yes it was very good
so you'll let me have that information
or shall i if i send the form off with your name then they should come straight to you
right so what was the situation with india then that's that how long was how long does that run
erm
can't remember that far
erm i think it was march to about july something like that
march to july
yeah
that's really a matter if anybody who's interested enough to take on what we call co ordination receiving the material and then you know telling people what letters are needed
erm
is that running for the same period of time as the women's campaign do you know
seems to overlap it's just slightly longer isn't it
overlap slightly march to ju july
mm yes
are these the campaigns involve then
this is receiving the material passing and sort of distribute it to the people within the group who are interested in writing letters
and it's mainly just writing letters is it
and advertising it and just anything you can do er
you'll be
to
you'll be you'll be sent instructions on what who to write to and it's a matter of sorting those out and erm sending out letters to group members like asking them to write to this person or that person so that's not too bad
are you interested then
some help brilliant sort of meetings
well can i bring say bring it to the meeting and
mm we might even manage i mean we might talk later on about this but perhaps you know have two or three people working on a campaign if it was felt to be better that way mm
mm yeah
you you've had no news of this UNK people as a campaign
no
i was wondering about that
i'm sure it was in last month's news
no
good news letter
it hasn't been in the i cover but i have some information you gave me it hasn't been in that at all mm
mm
mm perhaps it's gonna be a big one
making it all i know sort of saving it saving it perhaps to american news
it is it is it's gonna be a really campaign
i thought it was the they're gonna sort of initially kick it off in march
no it hasn't
it hasn't been mentioned no these things sometimes get delayed don't they
yeah
mm
delayed
is that right
i think it's gonna get most
yeah
were sending february news letters so if it's starting in march
can you give us a copy
think were gonna UNK
right er liz would you do an just to receive the information on india and look through
yes if
yeah
if i find it too much cos i start i'm starting a full time job again i i'll ask to share it hopefully
yes it sounds it sounds as it's for a limited time anyway so you know
yeah
good thank you very much
yeah it says it starts in march
so i i'm pull your name and address out
oh great
well we'll shall wait we shall wait to hear about it cos it i don't see there was anything there was there
no
right so that's india so that's good so were so the campaigns erm we are going to be involved in then er will be the women's campaign and india campaign
that's quite good because y often there is a country though we haven't had many campaigns on countries sort of lately have we it's been more on different aspects on UNK work so they're obviously going back to picking on countries where they deal that'll
right now the next item is the press and we have a press officer yeah like to perhaps say what's been happening a little bit and you know talk about the next time
no i haven't done anything recently but today i actually rang publishing one of the papers about UNK release and spoke to a guy at the herald and post and someone at the observer said i hope you put something in this week
mm
and i actually found that it was it was better to actually talk to them than just send them
press release
their press release so i might do that in future send out a release and then follow it up on the phone call
cos you've got contacts now you know that you know who the people are
yeah speak to them
mm
but i found at herald and post the actual UNK have only been meeting and i've been sending all the erm all the paper work to harlow and bishop's stortford but they're just sort of the erm the advertising people so erm that's why we've not had anything in the papers
mm
though i've found out now
mm
have they moved to luton recently somebody reported
i don't know
had a conversation about this
well when i rang about news was it june last year they were still at harlow
mm
they used to be in they've all gone over to luton
we do get bits in don't we from time to time
yeah recently
no
i think they if they i mean as long as they know we are going to tell them or give them something each month they ought to begin to look out for it
no it's just a bit of you know the press release that
mm
especially if only goes in advertising section
yes i think we started doing that originally because er the people from the UNK group said they did that every month didn't they issued a press release and sent it to all the local papers that seems to be the way of doing it
mm
and if you found that you know if find that
yeah i might of thought still send out UNK the letter actually this month
mm
probably
so i hope really there should be something in those two and i'll try the citizen and the star tomorrow
mm
try speaking to steve at the star
at the star
yeah he's quite useful he's good at that sort of thing erm
so this i thought about doing something on the erm the new UNK group what we when we finish the
cos i get some details from they like that sort of thing
well
if you're happy with that
mm
yes
yeah i start at the moment
yeah
yes have you i mean if you ask kate then kate can come to these four
good
if we can do the UNK things
did i tell you about that
when we went it was really funny when we went to do the talk erm afterwards when we were all sort of getting together and having a chat they're telling me about they do artificial they artificial UNK pigs
UNK pigs
don't you up at with a UNK and a bit of cotton wool
and john and i were just in fits
it's not part of the
no
what item were we on
right so were UNK were happy with that then
so we'll do something on the on UNK school group if you're happy with that
yes we have had other school groups but they this is the thing this i mean it could happen with you as people move on and leave school er you need to encourage people lower down the school to get interested and then it'll carry on otherwise they tend to drop
right now we've come i think to future events erm and we need to just try and list anything you know that's coming up so partly so that we've actually got it down writing and we can look back on it
so we noted last time that i booked the library in bishop's stortford for two periods this year for display we've booked the er street collection in bishop's stortford for july now are there any other dates we need to mention
no we got the harlow street collection though erm seventeenth of october
seventeenth of october
yeah
these two collectors are our main big fund raising events erm we have got we have got erm is that over we have got over five hundred haven't we in harlow i'm and bishop's stortford haven't we
erm in fact we've got five hundred and twenty seven that
is that bishop's UNK
harlow one
in harlow
the last of the collection is harlow last intake
mm
yeah
and that and that was a bit of a all year so that's that passed
yes
erm and we find although amnesty does run er door to door collection which we are always encouraged to join in which we never have which is i think always in june in june now it's good time it's a good time of year for it but that means going round putting envelopes in doors going back and collecting them the arguments on the doorstep about amnesty er going back again if people are not in and we as a relatively small group covering a very big area we haven't felt able to do that and we actually find that by standing in the street with each person having a tin for one or two hours we can do quite well that way and er that's
they say wednesday erm activity at UNK bush thanks for sending that information i've sent off the letter and said that we will take a stall and if anyone's free to help
me
on the seventh march
which day
wo women's day
mm international women's day

but even if no one else can help i will take part in it
where is that the playhouse

no
erm shall we erm see what shall we do about this it's saturday the seventh of march on a saturday

right well perhaps i perhaps people could as actually come and speak to me afterwards if they if they think they could help at all that's international women's day and all the local organisations have been asked to take part
certainly it's for your
it was quite good last year
yes and we could sell our products and that's sort of thing

yeah got a couple
anything you we got some of those things tell me i'll bring it along
mm yeah
right any other future events that ought to be mentioned
erm i suppose i don't know whether we ought whether we should mention it here erm the national a g m is a future event really isn't it
yes
erm
brought it with me
er
and what are the dates again i think it's the weekend before easter isn't it i think
er oh
april
run out of hold on
right april the tenth to the twelfth is the is the national amnesty a g m which is held over a weekend and this year is in exeter
exeter
the twelfth
exeter er so that's the weekend before easter
er of april
and we normally have members go we've had as many as five one year or was it six erm not always that many i think was it three of you went last year i think it was three wasn't it
three last year
yes erm and we were prepared to UNK as far as our finances would allow you know people who are going but ex exeter is quite a long way so the travel is going to be something isn't it
erm
well i think
who's thinking of going
i i've booked erm
oh
out comes yeah so
you thinking of going erm
yeah i eh
peter
should still be going yeah
UNK going
UNK going
oh UNK
yes i spoke to her
yes she's definitely going isn't she
mm
any anybody else
anybody else thinking of going
any other offers
cos you're going by car are you or
i'll drive yeah so there are three seats spare in my car vehicle
so that you plymouth
instead of writing a check send the cheque
if you can stand the strain of the noise and diesel engine all that way
all the girls in the back
you can get there you can get there perhaps if you can get there
i've got a seat in the back mate
you can get there on motorway erm all the way practically can't you
mm
you can get there on motorway all the way
i ha i haven't looked at the round there yeah i'm sure it's not too bad really you know you know
m four
right is there anybody else cos we have got forms haven't we
it's not that long if that's the case then er not that long a journey either
no
it's motorway all the way
erm anybody else interested for it you said not didn't you
it's not to late to book i think it says something about UNK after sixth of march or something on the form doesn't it
we'll make it
i don't think she was in no
right does UNK had a form she must cos you said she's booked peter have you g peter you've got forms have you
don't think she has got a form no UNK have you got any spare forms for that
no i think i've distributed them all didn't i
mm
we could get one from british section couldn't we
you think i thought you said she's booked she hasn't booked
oh no she's definitely wants to go but she hasn't actually filled out the form
well she's going to it
erm yeah i think she said she'd get one directly
erm
i think er i guess that any individual members would get them in their erm journal
yes
i might i might yes we i well i'll looks like it
i'm an individual member perhaps i've done got round to opening the
i'm not sure i'm not sure they have been there
that's possible
quite happy you know telephone them to send on
ah right well we'll just check yeah
cos that's when we get to that nearer the date we could we could just you know when you're confirmed that you've been booked and you're definitely going erm we could look at the finances and see how much we could afford to give erm something to each person to help with UNK either with the accommodation or the transport
mm
cos the accommodation is quite a bit isn't it
it's fifty sixty or more probably more this time
no
seventy six pounds
it's seventy six pounds
mm
more of sixty five last year
mm yes
erm
that's nice i'm it's very good that people are going anyway it's got
that's for the whole weekend
mm
mm
erm say anything about that
well it's not sort of place you can get it to before breakfast is it so er no
mm
it's not we have sometimes gone very early on a saturday morning to places like nottingham but it's not too far for that
right well that's good erm and so in relation to the a g m erm we did we were asked about putting in UNK erm are you having to leave the one about the press after what john said
how do you feel
one what one that we erm one yes but as a group why don't we review having another prisoner when we got
when we got when we got the next one yes certainly
yeah and then to see
mm right and are we i mean if anybody still wanted to put in a motion there is still time just about
yeah about just about yeah
but eh you'd have to have it sort of written out and more or less ready i think to go
all groups are invited to send resolution which may or may not be actually debated but erm we don't normally send one in but some groups they send them in no one 's thinking
think the closing dates a few days time isn't it
thursday
thursday yeah
oh right so it's very close
got to be ready tonight if they're to get it
no
right erm so i think i think as far as future events that's all what we need to mention
now erm rose is secretary and she's had things through from er british section headquarters and she'll tell us what she's got there
erm i don't know if this one concerns us it's about er a working group for children do we have we don't have a working group for children
no we've never been very close to the now
i won't obviously
erm i've also received information from the region erm with lots of events that's coming up in the east UNK region erm just run through those quickly er there is a workshop on this thursday at the courts erm there is on thursday twelfth of march there is er somebody from the UNK committee for human rights speaking at an open meeting that's the fifth er wednesday first of april there is er somebody called duncan he's a UNK surgeon who works part time as a volunteer at the medical foundation for the care and victims of UNK who will be speaking at st mary's and st UNK group and that that's bury st UNK and then the next east anglia regional meeting is on saturday may the twenty third at bury st UNK again
may twenty third
yeah may the twenty third it's a saturday two to five UNK at the UNK meeting house bury
bank holiday weekend isn't it
i don't know
that's all from region
er i've also received minutes from the UNK forest from UNK group and they also have a lobbying workshop erm that's on the second of march and they're asking if anybody's interested in that
is that an evening
it doesn't actually say
i think it's
but er probably would be
if you're interested could follow it up
they meet in don't they meet in UNK or was it UNK somewhere in that area
UNK
mm
was where they help UNK
monday mm
would you be interested in it
well i might this the time fitting in with the families they're likely to come back to
okay well i'll i put some information not full details
right
erm actually there wasn't a lot of detailed stuff there was erm materials for gr groups and winter sales
do you want to pass that over to UNK please
which we have a erm there's a bit about release policy and procedures for local groups er groups can help their prisoner with UNK or other erm relief erm on the christmas family particularly and it's explaining you know how they do it and the best ways to go about it
mm cos there's a special fund available for that that's particularly why they
anyway they explain all about it if it would if we need it
er there's a mandate workshop
oh they no sorry they're offering still a mandate workshop for the group erm sending a trainer
i'm the trainer
you're the trainer oh well
i've been very bad on this recently i've really been too busy or tired but i have got i have today i have had arrived oh not today the last few days the new mandate workshop so
so you've got to read through it and let
i was gonna say having spent some months or years well
it's all the new bits in about it yes mind you there's always been a mandate the mandate workshop was the very first one that's produced but this is an updated version and changes
yeah have there always been workshops continue workshops on mandate or
yes there's always been a mandate workshop
or just when there reviews
no there's always been a mandate workshop explaining why you know what our mandate is
you did give once to a group a few years ago
yes i've done the mandate workshop yes and i've done it with other groups too
mm
so you've covered a bigger region in the past not just stortford
i have about five or six groups i can i can go and give talks
so even if we don't call on you to do it you won't be called
and i have a lobby workshop too
UNK mandate what the don't do or do
will there be any erm talking about lobbying be in erm before and er
i don't know
done any
so the er lobbying workshops is the
that's why they're being cancelled
UNK forest and UNK are doing erm they've got some lobbying workshops
mm UNK it's got that in mind
yeah i mean he is
lobbying workshops would be that combined erm there is er a one page journalist leaflet which we can order a pound for a hundred that's it that's all our journalist friends
yes that's erm yeah i last month i received the er this booklet on the trade and they seemed to be coming out to doing campaign on erm a collection between british training and goods er and their use abroad erm and they now they've got a booking form for a fringe meeting at the a g m if anyone's particularly interested attending
shall i pass shall we pass this one
yes the report on this book
yes there are there are feature on the just highlighting a couple of case for these i imagine a problem book
yeah
and there is
it is a good book that i i've read through that it's quite an informative
it was in one of the sunday
it's called the m s p the military security police mm
security
i could seems to though they're getting stronger on this than
mm it's come to the front of the journal hasn't it section
yeah
mm
one er stress in my on what happens so that it's UNK it's been manufacturing leg UNK that's been going out there to the UNK hasn't it wasn't it to
they didn't mention they'd mentioned somewhere else but erm
somewhere
i think it was central america wasn't it
wasn't it UNK
no
UNK they had some sort of electronic UNK chamber
thing electric was
oh yeah the erm the house of or something
yeah
wasn't one of the chair was though the man held up held arms was it
he wasn't an i think he was
oh perhaps erm
got a number of
yes mm one wonders what a british company are doing manufacturing leg UNK anyway in the twentieth century
no when you get to when you get to the magazine i'll see on the front cover
yeah
it's not it's very
right anything else from headquarters
erm i know there's a world conference at the assembly central hall westminster twenty second of february
it's bury st UNK interest in asian we generally go if we've got an asian prisoner we haven't perhaps it's of opinion
sorry i missed that asian week
as
conference on the twenty second of february
er raffle tickets have a raffle ticket
i'll give it to peter are you interested in that peter or
er this is erm er this is the spring can't read out what it is the spring this is the great spring raffle amnesty does get quite a lot of money from the UNK er they start off with just the christmas one now we have them all through the year i think
and they the first prize is a thousand pounds cash second prize family holiday cottage in the isle of UNK and third prize holiday cottage in norfolk and fourth prize holiday apartment in UNK and the i mean the idea is you take a book and try if you have a place of work or friends that will buy raffle tickets er just try and sell them and er how much are they er
fifty pence each
fifty pence each right erm and er fill in the slips and either bring them back to us or send them off yourself to headquarters shall i put i'll put those out for anybody who feel they could sell them it all it all helps to raise money for amnesty and helps to get them erm spend the money on the new UNK
yeah i have a UNK copy of new UNK i'm not quite sure why they sent them but
it's on it's on the right
yes it's got stuff that we could use that's all
mm
er the news letters we get monthly news letter for groups er this one which is all about what different groups in britain are doing can give you ideas
were not gonna have were not gonna have quite enough are we this time i think if perhaps the people who come regularly erm perhaps could take first erm i don't know you we have ten is it ten
yeah and i've taken one
mm
they are interesting i mean then they're got quite a lot of information on about what's going on
yeah
within british section
yeah
anyway
i'll erm the international news letter which has lots of groups and details about people getting killed
mm
what's going on
erm and then if anyone wants to look at these look at the er ninety one annual reports
haven't seen them
and these booklets that are
has that recently become ninety one
no we had these two meetings ago but i bring it with me on meetings for anyone who's
yes and people should tell you if they take it mm
okay that's all
right very good that's all from headquarters right then we move on to then any other business erm i think mainly it's just the odd verse with arrangements for next meeting because our next meeting is our own a g m erm at which we erm elect our officers for the next year er and there are other arrangements to make erm we sometimes put a little form don't we on the end of the minutes that people to fill in if they wish to nominate someone i think we should do that even though very rarely gets actually filled in erm and we have some post which we have elections for others where we can phone the people who are doing those jobs and hope they'll carry on
and i think the erm the jobs which are elected are the chair person and do we still have a vice chair person are you still vice chair person
i
well john and i are both chair person are co chair at the moment erm
yeah we don't we don't seem to have a vice chairman looking at last years
perhaps it was because of that we didn't have it and the treasurer and the secretary are officially erm and we do have constitution don't we now of course so we can look at the constitution and see what it says
erm i think what those post were erm elected and then the
means we've got to produce
right we did actually draw or we not draw we adopted a constitution during the year and the officers that are erm elected are the chair the secretary and the treasurer erm and other together with other such officers yeah to determine by general meeting erm so it's really only those three er and we have sometimes had advice chair if there's only been one chairman haven't we one chair person erm so i think people need to say if they don't wish to carry on the jobs they're doing and if anybody wishes to nominate anyone in a particular post then slip at the bottom of the minutes could be filled in and either brought to meeting or sent back to the secretary
erm i think i will give up being chair this time i've done it too long too long and i've had it john as co chair during the year and i hope that he'll be able to carry on as chair person i think really i've done it done it for long enough erm and we'll have to ask we hope we hope the treasurer just taken over will carry on
erm and if anybody else has any other post they they're interesting in doing in taking on or would like to help with that could be said as well couldn't it
well are we then not going to have another co chair
well it depends how you want to deal with it i mean erm this the i think it was just my idea last year of sort of erm sharing some of the load i think at that point and hoping that someone could perhaps take over erm this just says the following should be elected a chair b secretary and c treasurer but erm
well i will you know i mean will carry on as chairman but i i'd welcome competition in the post if anyone's interested
but it's unfair saying that i erm i continue in my inefficient way if you're all willing to put up with me
i think if you are going to be the only chair person then there should be a there should be a deputy so if you're not able to take the chair there is somebody else
perhaps yeah erm
somebody could perhaps sat and
perhaps that's a good idea
that person ought to be elected as well
mm what under that'll be a what vice chairman or
well was to be chairman was to be vice chair now under these this new
is it in the constitution
it isn't in the constitution no
no it isn't is it
no but you
mm
not very good at drawing up UNK are we
it does actually say together with other said officers and committee members as shall be determined by a general meeting so if we wish to elect or choose somebody else we can do
erm but there's be a good idea to have
she's taken someone's
well i think we'll see what we'll see what comes if somebody else wishes to compete for the chair the post of chair erm then you may perhaps like to invite them to share the chair with you or they can become the vice chair
erm only too willing to welcome competition cos they're all to aware of my short UNK mm
mm
erm so
well if there isn't anybody else who wishes to compete with you for the chair er then i think there ought to be a vice chair
yeah
right
now the other thing about the meeting is erm we sometimes arrange for sort of special refreshments or something different in that line it's at UNK house erm do you want do you want us to do anything about that ann or
yeah interested in any spare wine glasses please
sorry
bring some spare wine glasses i've got some wine glasses
wine glasses
what we have wine and soft drinks and
what you want six
cheese and biscuits
a little bit of that yes to have afterwards mm
UNK wheat
cheese
cheese and biscuits she's saying
what do you want help with that ann would you like people to bring some or what
mm well UNK you can confirm with mary i think mary's offer to possibly
shall i shall i leave you and mary to sort that out
okay
between you mm
what date is it
i'm not sure what date it is i haven't got it on here have we really
is it the tenth
no the eleventh
the tenth
yes it's not going to be the same day because it's a leap year
it's the tenth then
so it'll be what did we say the tenth what did we
mm
right
tenth of march
tenth of march
where's that then
that'll be at erm ann i've forgotten your number
that's fine what's the address
oh sorry ninety four
is this all
oh yeah
yeah
get rid of that on tape yeah we won't be UNK
why you writing it down for
so that the next meeting
right that's good that's it without your tape recorder
right erm so now that's er the a g m now erm any other business
right let see erm er who's got their notes
ann did you say yes
i said yes
right ann you gonna start
well this i told you about this french boy that phoned that contacted me he's erm my name is i'm nineteen i'm a student at harlow college i'm studying english foreign language and law a level if there's an amnesty international i would like to set up a group in the college i hope you're involved in local groups are writing you to receive about me and information about the local group
so i well i sent him er our sheets er sheet about the group and the minutes and er i contacted michael er who said he'll be very happy to help in so i er phoned up this chap and said gave him UNK number and said erm he'd like to come to this meeting tonight he said yes so i went to pick him up and i just couldn't find that UNK house anyone who knows harlow he's in UNK i just couldn't find the number it was i just couldn't find anything less than thirty seven
and i had got pick up two so i just had to give up i phoned him up when i got here apologise he hasn't been in touch with michael yet i don't know why not er though why er sorry
erm there used to be
sorry there used to be a group at the college i think
yes
well there used to be that's right with you john talking about college group just about that time
erm yes and it's funny thing i haven't sent things to the college with the other stuff that went out but er we have i have spoken to michael about college yeah i mean
so we didn't yeah well if we've got someone's who's interested in starting a group that's the time which to start we did yeah but there was a group er previous thing but i think that there was one girl who was very er keen but i think when she left it probably UNK
mm
but
yeah i did discuss it with michael i'd forgotten that i just remembered now
maybe i don't know if he's shy or anything why he hasn't phoned up michael yet perhaps i ought to ask michael to phone him then he does yes
maybe yes we have we have approved school or er student group officer so we should perhaps let him you know perhaps we should perhaps we should come back to him or michael could
mm
well shouldn't shall i
should imagine mm
take that number from you cos i'll i'm probably going probably be seeing michael this week
do you want the letter
yes okay
right that's fine well i that would be very good if there was a group at the UNK at the UNK at the college there ought to be one at the college
mm
of all of all the
mm
you know
oh he's only he's only there till september till
oh great
he's only there till the summer by the way
yes well perhaps we could get it going quickly then
right erm now er do you want to say something
i did yes erm when erm we thought our prisoner was finished the co UNK wrote to me and said would i be interested would our group be interested in erm writing to UNK still because with the civil war going on there's lots of cases coming up for example there was a whole hospital full of patients that were taken prisoner i don't know if they were actually physically removed or whether they were held in the hospital without access to medical treatment for something like ten days and erm UNK did say she'd help me last time and i wrote back and said yes two of us could write once a month well they're taken that very UNK and got two or three things from the already and erm if anyone else is interested in writing an odd letter say once a month to yugoslavia maybe they could erm let me know later on
good that's fine right any other business
shall we have just a quick lisa and dean want to tell us what's going cos they've had you had the first meeting now haven't you
do you want to tell us what interest there was
i was about to ask the same thing yeah
are you going to interest
well i called a meeting but i didn't think i advertised it well enough because there was a lot of interest and then i think we held it at the wrong time as well didn't we
mm
we held it after UNK so we've organised another one for tomorrow lunch time and erm and lot more people express interest because of that we haven't actually got any letters yet
no that's so when we leave there should be more interest
mm good
and i'm intending to hold a few more UNK as well to sort of get interest going again because it's been a while since we did an assembly on it so if we do another one that usually gets it going again doesn't it
what you run UNK with on particular topic then
yeah well we'll take erm michael gave us say erm a an assembly sheet didn't he and we just read from that and that got a lot of interest from that
yeah
mm good
how many teams were suppose to meet out of that
it was about twelve people
how many is that
there were a lot more people than that
that was last week
i was gonna say there were a lot more people when we went to school
there are a lot more people than that there i only put one advert
well that's lot more people who are interested
right
even so that tell us
ah right well yeah i suppose
advertise in stortford
twelve is a working number

erm
yeah
right rose next leave your bit
oh i got something right come on

yes i had a request from speaker at UNK high school and have a name of somebody there i think it's a teacher or pupil but
a lot of people would say

yeah i think i do yeah UNK
that was margaret UNK what it was yes
yeah
the name of the person is linda er
what was it a request for a speaker
yeah
yeah right why have they sent that to you
yeah cos UNK name went off to that batch that was sent out
you know there i wasn't actually in but that was the message i got so

linda
mm i've got a mr head of UNK mr i
there we go so who is this person is i don't know that's their name i have now that's a
yeah
so that'll be a speaker day
okay
will you follow that up
you you've got the name of the person have you
erm shout that out again and
erm UNK high school
no the i've got all that
linda
linda yeah
yes it'll be worth following that up cos that's one of the erm they they've done quite a lot of work of amnesty and general studies in the past there was a sheet of sort of quotes of how good the amnesty was and there was one from the teacher at UNK or what what's margaret UNK school so erm yes if you could definitely follow that up erm john
yeah
cos that'll be a very useful school to have interest
erm
erm i also have a letter er from a kate i'm not sure from which school she goes to but she's fourteen and she's going to one of the local schools
mm
but erm she was hoping to come to the meeting this evening but she phoned at the last minute and said she couldn't make it but erm i don't know if it would be more appropriate perhaps for the schools groups to get in touch with her and i
did she leave her name and
er yes but i it's at home
yes could you perhaps you could find out which school she's at
yes okay
erm
could give her a ring find out what school she's at and then
and then if it's fine with her we'd have some well you'd let you know contact
what's the time
alright yeah okay
right
because it's i mean it would be very good if we could have several schools
yeah
interested
er have you got all these people waiting to be told
right i hope we won't be to long now perhaps if we could just bring up the item you wanted to mention
yeah erm right yeah that's all the other items erm what's been er been going through my head recently is er the looking at the pattern of the meetings and the way the meetings are arranged and how erm at the last meeting we had a speaker er and that i think we all found that quite interesting and the one from central america that things and i feel we ought to have that much more frequently than we do have er a either a speaker or a focus of some sort of meetings erm so i think that's something i'd like to raise and get the a g m at the next meeting i think similar thing we ought to consider there
erm quite how we arrange cos this as margaret says there's a lot of business to get through on occasions but er this meeting seems to had a lot but you know er whether we could UNK er a business meeting with a speaker so i thought functional meeting every two months and a speaker attending er the other month erm i'm really UNK it open for ideas what do other people feel and
maybe we should have speaker on a separate night
mm well this or is everybody happy with the format as it is er
is it not but er
yeah
UNK a very good idea but difficult to organise
mm
i think a every so often it'll be very interesting very sort of we did try this once didn't we
this has UNK up before oh yes this idea of trying to change this
michael started the ball rolling in my mind er yes he i one thing erm yesterday erm one thing he started to coming to more meetings last year and erm i think he'd seen one or two people come along and not
mm
a couple of new people come along and then not follow up
yes there can be
mm erm and he wh you know he is thinking well is this is that the reason erm so er i don't know you know er i think perhaps it's worth looking at perhaps we can all thing about it and have a look at it at the a g m
i think i think it would be a good idea to have as every sort of maybe every two or three meetings to have something a bit different erm and we do we do find if we want to get through the business quickly
we can
we can we can
we can
pressure
we can do we've just got to i mean we've just got to ask everyone to give a very brief report erm on another occasion and then it can be kept very short i think though there are there are times when you know we do want to hear what's going on with sort of er networks and campaigns we do need that time as well don't we er so we can't i don't think we can always do it
well i'm yeah UNK i wondered about sort of executive committee and er i know you're not very keen on that idea and it does tend to remove information from the ordinary members if you have a small group of people dealing with the business and a separate lead
we have had that in the past haven't we
we
i can't remember
remember we used to have a prisoner group didn't we when i first came so that the
what groups yeah groups for particular things on the you know like campaigns or prisoners there were special groups dealing only with this those they met on there own not there weren't any
schools groups
yes the schools group yes i mean that could operate more in fact we could have instead of having just talking about the about the india one er instead of having one person at it could be a group of three perhaps er
but then they'd still presumably report back to the main group about what they'd been doing
yes
yes
so you're really in a way you're not much difference than where you started
i think UNK right if we really want to get through the business we can and however busy we are erm
i wouldn't we wouldn't to every time but i mean it can be it can be just a very brief report on what's happened you know if we want to get through
if we said like if we every second month say or every third month then we knew we were going to have a speaker we could the time before we could then do the business more thoroughly and carefully so that the month of the speaker we could just go through it very quickly
alternatively to alternative to speaker can we get erm you know brief films about different countries and political systems and so on
mm
yes we have the video too we have we have the erm the amnesty video and we there are there are schools videos to
do they do different videos for different countries
not they're not no the one i've the one the group has is a general one it's on UNK work
oh i see
yeah there probably are ones on different countries
i'm not sure that amnesty does produce on one particular country
erm we have
other organisations that
yes they might yes mm
though even that's the sort of thing that on t v that er
we can video ourselves
that's right
mm
yeah
yes there are a lot mm
there's all these workshops margaret
yes i have about twelve workshops
on all kinds of things
on all kinds of things yes
i enjoyed that very much that last one
what was that one
what was that one
it was about death penalty wasn't it
there's all sorts like recruiting making contact with the schools er lobbying er there about ten or twelve different workshops now almost on almost every aspects so and that would be something that we could give if these weren't
but there has to be one guarantee in because i think once we had rather good one about six people kept you can never tell how many come i mean you'd want maybe bigger more than more space in this room
well we've have got another room maybe we might sometimes be able to use haven't we
well we could use the
or your dining room yes
it's probably better that
mm we often need to use one more than one room for those
mm
mm
though we do seem to be doing quite well in numbers
yes we have lately yes
better than last year
that suddenly i mean it means you divide into smaller groups quite often and have discussions on you can yeah
speak on what you've got
no might be my speech do we need a meet in a more public place erm
no we can't
but you erm
yes you
erm your business would take care of itself if we have that pressure of booking it
i honestly think it would
i think if anything i'm sure it would
yeah mm sure
i think
i'm sure that it would make us more careful the months before
mm
right going on the streets think it would going to find that many people that could speak to
that was
erm sort of relative
yeah that needs something if you actually set up a system and then a business meeting one month and a speaker the next it puts a lot of pressure on one of us or some of us to erm this is true
maybe if i think it sounds as if people would like that you know at least every few months perhaps to have something different
yes
maybe people could just be thinking or you know if they hear of somebody who might be able to come and give a talk like your friend who was very good erm you know we could make a note of it and or ask people you know could talk to talk or something that sort
mm that sounds a possibility i think i think it is interesting to have someone like that you know
mm
like we had you know who could talk about experiences you know in a in a particular country where there are human rights and problems good
right erm so that's it is that all the
business
yes just remind people the next the next meeting erm is tuesday the tenth of march we always meet on a tuesday evening and it will be at UNK house in harlow which is said on the tape
must be of benefit
right er people can take what bits from tables they want them or i've got s i've got one put out erm shall we open that door a bit it's getting a bit hot in here erm don't know if mary wants any help out there
good
yeah erm the other er aspect of any discussion of vienna is the er is discussion of the congress system itself
erm whether that was a er a success or failure
erm the general response to this is that it was a failure
there's an even more er perhaps er pertinent er point on this that er that did it did the congress system actually exist in any meaningful way
again erm perhaps we ought to refer one of the still rather good stuff on this is from er is from UNK book
and indeed i see one
UNK
UNK books eh
yes there's a rather good i was recommending UNK book er last week
erm it does have a rather good section on the congress system
and i'll i will endeavour in a second to er find it
i would say that erm we could perhaps describe the congress system as a partial success
a partial success
it helped to keep the peace
so in that sense again in the language of the old ten sixty six and all that it was a good thing
however you see a tendency in erm after eighteen to be perhaps more serving to be serving the interests of the er east european powers
and then it became perhaps a UNK er entity
of course they had a problem at the outset that being all the powers had agreed on the need for joint intervention say er vis a vis france
in eighteen between eighteen fifteen and eighteen er the great powers did intervene in france
they had an army of occupation in some of UNK north eastern departments
france was on in a sense france was on probation in eighteen fifteen to eighteen
erm and we could take it back to the hundred days UNK when the great powers have all er decided to er to prevent UNK from making a UNK in france
but the great powers had agreed upon the principle of joint intervention
but of course as far as britain was concerned this could only be intervention against france
and what you tend to see happen is not so much joint intervention after eighteen er fifteen or eighteen
you tend to see individual intervention
erm austria in italy
france in spain
russia in UNK
and of course ironically the western powers britain involves herself in UNK
britain involves herself in UNK
so britain UNK as well
even though she was hostile to intervention erm you know erm by say er france in spain or whatever
yeah
so we get a strange UNK situation developing
so is it like somebody could erm i mean work against france in that situation
in that well yeah i mean in a sense er that's right because if you think about it in eighteen in eighteen fifteen er the great powers stayed in existence mainly because of a fear of a of fear of france
yeah
erm and er that's what that was the UNK which held them together
when that's no longer perhaps valid then the powers have got their erm have got have got their own interests to pursue
erm it all gets mixed up of course because there's erm russia which is seen as a power you know the UNK power
a power which is concerned with the threat of revolution in europe
russia UNK to help UNK in UNK
so it's UNK you know you do get this paradox
but wasn't that cos er it was only UNK revolt though
well yeah but it was still it was i mean don't forget and it it's perhaps a point you know erm a valid point
the greek UNK which had been going on since the early eighteen twenties
the greek revolt was seen by european liberals who in a sense might be having a hard time of it in those years
the greek revolt was seen as a UNK er event as well as just an anti turkish er erm UNK
erm and that's why you do get erm er european liberals going over to UNK to support the er the greek UNK
yeah but russia didn't case russia intervened as a pro liberal thing
it's like
no
but nevertheless the intervention was there
yes so
and i mean it was er i accept that it's hardly that russia perhaps was intervening in the interests of er of erm of er russian policy in that area
but erm but the fact of the matter was which whichever way you look at it russia was supporting essentially a liberal nationalist revolt
couldn't you say that about the british in UNK
yeah but britain UNK at least well i'm not sure about that
i mean er britain was er britain's concerns out there were to maintain british influence in the area
yeah
erm it so happened that the group that britain was supporting perhaps were UNK although UNK was almost erm was always rather UNK about how liberal they were and how UNK they were
so is it almost like this thing which is like by chance
possibly so yeah
yeah
yeah
erm okay so that's er that's some of the erm er major aspects of er of the congress system
by the way just getting back to these UNK
erm er the intervention of france in spain
er france UNK intervened in spain initially to put down a liberal revolt
ironically because you know french public opinion was very hostile to that intervention
ironically in many respects the french intervention UNK the way for the success of the liberals in spain
it's a strange you know
it it's it is UNK
by the eighteen twenties perhaps the congress had become somewhat er UNK
possibly it was increasing tension between the great powers the congress system
was that in
i'm suggesting that by perhaps the eighteen twenties the congress system was becoming somewhat UNK
yeah erm course the other problem the congress system had i suppose a te a technical problem
there was no bureaucratic machinery erm er to support it
there was no kind of permanent congress house like you know or congress building
er and of course obviously there was no congress army
perhaps it was over ambitious
and again i suppose though its main problem was the UNK or the er different interpretations er that the great powers had
UNK of course between britain and the other powers
couple of other points about the erm er about the er vienna settlement in general
let me erm let me refer to erm the holy alliance erm people i'm sure will come across this in their in their reading
the holy alliance
it was established in september eighteen fifteen
erm it
sorry
when was it established
september eighteen fifteen
it came from an initiative by UNK
it was signed erm er it was signed er first by austria prussia and russia
and in a sense the holy alliance came to be seen as representing their interests
UNK anti liberalism anti nationalism
why it was called the holy alliance was because erm er the UNK agreed that they would er that they would rule their states and treat er policy erm er according to christian principles
they would they would rule their states and conduct policy according to christian principles
interestingly all erm er most of the european powers came to sign this erm it wasn't it wasn't as ex
it wasn't exclusive like the UNK alliance of eighteen fifteen
there's a couple of points er perhaps worth making about it
er britain didn't sign it
britain refused to sign it
it would seem that UNK was UNK in his er in his UNK of christian UNK and principles
erm it's been er it's been suggested as well that in some extent it reflects the religious UNK in europe that was taking place
erm i think you know it's was one of the UNK of history that er that intellectual movements developed counter intellectual movements and even while one intellectual movement is UNK out like the er it's counter is rising
and if we can put this into UNK erm er nay almost UNK mouse terms that the UNK was based upon UNK
erm er UNK attitudes and such like and in the UNK was a strong very strong element of opposition to religion erm and traditional religious UNK
ironically erm er erm even towards the end of the eighteenth century you see some of the UNK of religion
and UNK which is seen as the as the movement which UNK the UNK in a sense
there's a very strong religious UNK er to this and it's argued that the holy alliance is perhaps an expression of a significant religious UNK that's going on erm in europe in the early nineteenth century
erm amongst UNK er there's one there've been suggestions made about the holy alliance
britain was very suspicious of it
because of course erm ah well which european leader could not sign the holy alliance
for a very obvious reason
don't forget that the holy alliance erm UNK it's UNK to conduct their affairs on christian principles
oh turkey
erm obviously the presumably the UNK of turkey as a as erm as a UNK could not be expected to sign the holy alliance
and there was a suspicion in britain that it was all a bit of a plot to er to kind of UNK turkey
and sort of exclude turkey from european er consideration
it would be in a sense it was leading to a kind of psychological isolation of turkey
and there was this view in britain that maybe it was some kind of russian er you know that it was a russian manoeuvre
a UNK manoeuvre to UNK turkey
erm UNK interestingly UNK er later regarded the er holy alliance as meaningless
UNK said that he signed it to please the UNK
erm and yet perhaps erm it's
perhaps it was important erm because as erm as i'm fond of saying that in history perhaps what you believe is more important than what actually happened
and the holy alliance became part of in a sense liberal UNK
to european liberals the holy alliance was a UNK plot directed against the liberals
okay
so er a few other little aspects of the er of er the UNK of the holy all of the er vienna settlement which is sometimes UNK
er the vienna settlements er contained other elements
for instance it agreed to abolish the UNK trade
at the vienna settlement the great powers all the great powers agreed to take no further part in the UNK trade
they agreed to abolish it
erm various trade agreements were made
er the river UNK was largely erm er largely became a kind of er free trade river
you know it was bombing through all these different UNK er different boundaries
there was the UNK up of trade on the UNK
erm so there were try er we might describe some of the elements in the vienna settlement as confidence building measures
erm attempts at international a greater international economic co operation
so maybe we shouldn't be er so quick as to er just er erm dismiss er the vienna settlement entirely
right i'll be back in a tick
just want to say a couple of
right
erm if you check with the er if you check with the erm handout on you know er the topic areas
erm what we've been dealing with on vienna is dealt with in section forty six reaction and revolution in europe
what i'll erm what i'll do next week on this is a rather UNK topic this one erm it's in the general section
and there's an overlap with question twenty six french history eighteen fifteen to seventy one
erm er i'll try to deal with the erm it's very difficult to separate these topics out and teach that one as a topic in a sense
what i'll do next week erm we'll perhaps through concentrating on france we'll do a quick gallop through europe eighteen erm about eighteen fifteen to forty eight
and i'll focus in on the eighteen thirty and forty eight UNK
but that will involve erm er france
now erm more to the point and i'll erm i'm reminding myself here
i haven't set any essays on UNK have i
no
erm didn't you
oh
no
no
you said you weren't going to
well why on earth should i say that
i dunno
it's i thought it was odd when you said it
it's a major topic
it's question twenty four on the old er topic list
i will i'll set essays on UNK on erm on er on next time we meet on monday
erm and let me remind everybody because i don't intend erm er waiting for people to cough up on this so i would like to remind people to get it it's the thirteenth today
so i want i'd like everybody's erm payment for the conference thing next week if UNK
how much is it
how much is what
no the rail i'll check that out today or tomorrow and i'll be able to say to say on monday
but i'll let let's imagine for the moment that it's still that six fifty
so we're looking at we're looking at nine fifty
let's call it ten quid
if the rail UNK gone up as i expect it may well have done
so do you want the rail fare money next week as well
erm
might as well
no i don't need the rail i don't the rail money in er cos i presume if you pay the seven quid you'll be more or less committed then to paying the i'll get the rail money a bit later than
is it a wednesday
erm
it's a thursday
it's thursday the nineteenth of march
normal time
what about five o'clock
about UNK
right erm yeah look at the congress
just wanna wrap this up now erm by bringing in the erm example of UNK
er the er greek revolt
erm just to UNK on that slightly
it started round about eighteen twenty one although actually there there'd been erm er UNK in the amongst the christians in the UNK area for some time
we needn't worry too much that thought but erm the greek revolt itself in eighteen twenty to one to round about eighteen twenty five had gone on without any european intervention
to some extent this was due to the influence of the er of
erm who was able to hold er the russians back from intervening on the grounds that it would be er seen as intervention in a er in a revolt
erm the revolt is of course essentially a nationalist revolt
i suppose there are liberal UNK in it but it's essentially a nationalist revolt
after eighteen twenty five of course erm the death of UNK especially of nicholas russia is more inclined to intervene especially as the greek UNK are being defeated because of the mention the intervention of erm UNK erm er egypt a problem for the turkish empire
the ruler of egypt UNK intervened in the revolt on behalf of turkey with the promise of territory in the area
erm and the revolt begins to er UNK
erm so russia decides to intervene and at this point erm is especially concern of britain
and the UNK is that in eighteen twenty six britain suggests in essence holding a congress to discuss the er greek revolt
erm britain and france are very concerned about the prospect of russian intervention
erm and in essence a kind of congress is held at st UNK
it's not UNK out in the old history books as one of the conferences or one of the UNK rather
in fact it's more often referred to correctly as a conference
erm it UNK of the UNK of the great of the of the great powers erm er meeting together at st UNK
erm it's there's a certain UNK about all this
as we know erm UNK had to a great extent welcomed the end of the congress system
his famous comment about things are back to as they should be every nation for herself and god for us all
erm but in twenty six he in a sense does a u turn
and he's concerned to get great power co operation to solve the greek er problem
the other UNK is of course that up until at the previous UNK like UNK erm britain hadn't attended
at this one austria doesn't attend
and same well and prussia as well for that matter but they're not so important
at this conference the great powers involved are britain russia and france
of course the other UNK as well is that the powers that meet at the conference at st UNK er the powers decide they will intervene in UNK
and they're intervening of course here on the side of a revolt which is going against the grain of erm of certainly for russia of course of er of the attitudes of the eighteen erm er eighteen teens early eighteen twenties
the idea was basically to produce some kind of semi independent UNK
er of course as we know or we might some of us might know from er UNK
his
that erm from british history that erm in eighteen er erm the UNK refused to co operate in this
and erm in when was it eighteen twenty seven at the battle of UNK the british navy sunk the turkish fleet
erm thus to a great extent erm ending the erm er the prospects of turkish success
what was that battle again
UNK
UNK or UNK bay erm it's more i think it's more technically known as UNK see if they've got a reference to the
oops
oh no it is UNK i'm sorry
i'm confused aren't i
it is UNK
yeah erm again you needn't worry too much about the er erm about the UNK of this UNK died in twenty seven and britain to some extent UNK herself from the greek revolt but the UNK was that in eighteen thirty UNK became an independent state
her independence guaranteed by britain russia and france
okay erm i suppose we ought to mention in this context as well er belgium
i'll probably refer to it again later on
er in belgium of course in eighteen thirty erm a nationalist revolt broke out in response really to the french revolution of that year
which we'll be looking at briefly in a sec
erm this was a direct challenge to the vienna settlement of course
as we know at the vienna settlement belgium was put under er essentially under dutch rule
erm britain and france were prepared to defend UNK independence
the other powers were er at odds with britain and france UNK austria russia prussia
so again we see a split in the er in amongst the great powers
what
i just
it's britain and france were prepared to support UNK independence
erm russia prussia austria not
and we are seeing in eighteen thirty a significant gap between on the one hand erm the western powers and on the other hand the east european or the central and eastern european powers
in eighteen thirty of course the east european powers were unable erm er to intervene
er russia had erm a revolt in poland to face
austria faced UNK in italy
prussia of course couldn't really act by herself
but we are seeing a widening gap
and indeed erm in the eighteen thirties we see the formation in the west of the so called UNK alliance not to be confused with the great UNK alliance of eighteen er thirteen
the UNK alliance UNK of britain france spain and UNK which had by now got sort of liberal constitutional governments
well it's erm it's erm it's about i think it's about eighteen thirty three thirty four
doesn't really matter
it's the earliest er early eighteen thirties
and on the other hand austria russia and er prussia it's UNK isn't it
forgetting me er me UNK yep
in fact they may even have a date for you here
yeah eighteen thirty three UNK
it's an agreement to defend each other against the threat of revolution
yep
erm so we are seeing by er the early eighteen thirties something of a UNK split between the er the powers of er the UNK and then the er UNK erm er alliance
i'm referring obviously to the UNK alliance of eighteen er fifteen
okay perhaps we can er wrap a few things up on the erm on the er vienna er settlement and the congress system itself
what actually happened in belgium
belgium became independent
sorry yeah
belgium became independent
erm it's UNK it's independence was recognized fully by all the major european powers by eighteen thirty nine
it was regarded as erm it was one of UNK one of UNK great UNK wasn't it
isn't it the case that UNK when he was on his death bed had the clause to the UNK treaty read to him to UNK him up
okay erm let's perhaps make a few comments then about the vienna settlement itself
the old er the old kind of UNK question is was it a success or a failure
i i'd say with the with the UNK exam you're not likely you're not likely to get a question like that
was vienna successful
but you're gonna get a much wider question if it comes up on this and erm perhaps in incorporating the congress system but let's approach it from that perspective anyway
i think the best way of looking at this is to kind of take an open ended version of what the vienna settlement is all about
er not just the treaty in eighteen fifteen but the whole congress system erm after eighteen fifteen onwards and into the eighteen twenties and such like
erm i suppose the er the classic interpretation of the er the vienna settlements is that erm in the nineteenth century was that it was a failure and there was a there was a kind of er consensus beginning quite early actually
there's a kind of consensus view that in the language of ten sixty six and all that the vienna settlement was a bad thing
erm and i say this view is in some respects being er erm er expressed relatively early on
erm and you even get it associated with leading UNK or states er UNK of the day
for instance erm somebody like UNK the third
he emerged as president of france as prince UNK in eighteen forty eight and he er he erm UNK power by coup UNK and becomes UNK in eighteen fifty two
UNK the third is someone who's er who sees it as one of his objectives to undo the vienna settlement
erm and you've got other leading figures of the day
count UNK prime minister of UNK in eighteen er fifty
erm and someone who's described as perhaps one of the architects of italian unity
he becomes the prime minister of a relatively united italy erm in eighteen er eighteen sixty
UNK is someone who's er
right
UNK is someone who's hostile er to the vienna settlement
let alone of course large numbers of liberal stroke nationalist erm UNK within europe in the eighteen er twenties thirties and forties
the various national secret societies and various nationalist movements like er young italy and there's even one called young europe which is kind of a pretty much catch all one
but the various nationalist societies or the revolutionary purpose
they're all hostile to the vienna settlement
and that perhaps er having mentioned the nationalist erm societies this perhaps gives us a clue to it
the view was taken that the vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism and nationalism
that was the view taken that the vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism
it was hostile to nationalism
and therefore it was wrong because the argument goes that liberalism and nationalism are the great UNK er UNK of the nineteenth century and the vienna UNK not only wrong but it was historically erm in a sense UNK because it was trying to oppose the growing erm UNK er UNK of er erm of er of europe
by the way erm it's always rather amusing when you see in the old history books the er the idea that erm that to give an example somebody like UNK
you get the old idea that UNK ignored liberalism and nationalism
erm that's a very a very misleading way of putting it
UNK in many ways thought of little else except liberalism and nationalism
the vienna settlement didn't ignore liberalism and nationalism
it tried its best to UNK it
it tried its best to actually er UNK it
and don't forget erm perhaps we ought to say a word on the er on the UNK side here
erm don't forget it's people like UNK and indeed UNK and the other erm er figures at the vienna settlement
they were looking back in eighteen fifteen at twenty odd years of war and revolution
and if that was you know you could i UNK you could argue that the french revolution had been built on UNK of liberalism and it had encouraged nationalism in europe
and therefore you could associate liberalism and nationalism with war terror erm and perhaps therefore it wasn't all that desirable
obviously as well in UNK er in UNK case nationalism would be the end of the UNK empire
because the UNK empire the UNK empire was a UNK of large numbers of different UNK
nationalism affected other great powers as well
erm russia in eighteen fifteen grabbed poland
prussia had still had UNK of polish territory little bits of it
prussia of course more especially more especially prussia UNK a united germany
if you brought if you got a united germany then prussia would simply be a small part of that united germany
so it's important to note that nationalism the prospect of nationalism was seen as UNK by the er major european powers
it didn't nationalism had no erm wouldn't affect france as such
didn't affect britain
well it affected ireland
there was always the problem of ireland
i think it's a bit wrong perhaps to say it didn't affect britain
perhaps it didn't affect britain at this time
but as we know from british history one of the UNK reasons why erm there was a lot of UNK to home rule for ireland in britain was because of the fear of the creation of a hostile state er erm off britain's shore
erm so that's one aspect of vienna
it was seen as being opposed to liberalism as opposed to nationalism and perhaps there were there were er there were there were good reasons er for that
by the way erm are we relatively clear what's meant by liberalism and nationalism within this context
should i perhaps UNK and say a little word erm er about this
perhaps i will
it's perhaps of some interest to us that erm these to great UNK liberalism and nationalism i think we can see them as products of the french revolution
or indeed products of perhaps enlightened attitudes certainly with the case of liberalism
in a sense if we think of the context of say the late eighteenth early nineteenth century perhaps more perhaps more specifically we think of the er of the er erm early nineteenth century
liberalism and nationalism are seen as two sides of the same coin
they were seen as UNK bound up
erm all liberals were nationalists
and to er i suppose by and large vice versa as well
erm as i've said the er the two er known as the two UNK
the two UNK are by and large products of the revolution or in the case of liberalism perhaps of the of enlightened attitudes
by liberalism meant a number of things
it meant primarily constitutional government
it meant primarily constitutional government
written constitutional government
liberalism
oh
it meant by and large UNK it meant it meant primarily rather constitutional government
liberals would look to for instance the con the united UNK constitution
they would look to the er to the constitution of france in say seventeen ninety one or the more UNK amongst them would look erm the more er the more radical liberal if that's not er if that's not a not a contradiction in terms don't think it is
they would look to the constitution of eighteen of seventeen ninety three
others other in nineteenth century europe looked to the UNK granted in eighteen twelve for instance in spain and in UNK
these aren't er they tend to be a bit ignored in history these
but they're of interest
in eighteen in late eighteen twelve erm with the prospect perhaps of UNK rule in difficulties you see in some of UNK some of the client states of UNK europe spain UNK you see UNK being granted which are pretty democratic actually
and th the they're looked to by er european liberals as model UNK
when you get a revolt in spain in the eighteen twenties
what is the revolt in favour of
the revolt is in favour of the constitution of eighteen twelve
so they believe in constitutional governments
erm now obviously in the context of constitutional governments it's not one can imagine having a constitutional form of government without a parliamentary system but erm it's perhaps a bit of a stretch of the imagination
but they mean by erm constitutional government they also er liberals also believed in the notion of parliamentary government
it's very much connected to late UNK that the only valid government would be representative government
other forms of government are in a sense UNK
absolute rule
UNK rule
well not necessarily i mean unless the UNK was er was part of the constitutional set up
but representative government was the only really legitimate form of government
of course there was debate amongst liberals on how much representation there would be
or to put it erm more UNK how many people would have the vote
erm we see this within the context of the reform movement in britain after eighteen fifteen
where you've got UNK ranging from those who want the household UNK er household UNK
a vote to all UNK
across to those who wanted erm a universal male UNK
erm one man one vote
erm european liberalism is based upon is based upon context as well of UNK
or to perhaps er put it more to put it to make it more erm obvious anti UNK
this didn't necessarily mean UNK to religion as such
but the notion of UNK the notion of anti UNK meant that within the liberal states erm the er there would be a separation of church and state
erm the church would have no role within the state as being say in a erm in other words there would be erm the catholic church in erm in say er a state like france er should not be the established church
there would be a separation of church and state
and by and large the activities of church and state would be UNK
the church would play no role in the affairs of state
erm other UNK erm of liberalism of course again which are perhaps pretty obvious freedom of speech and implied in that freedom of religion freedom of expression that kind of thing
but in essence they're the main er the main aspects of er of er what was meant by liberalism in the er in er the nineteenth century
erm it perhaps doesn't strike us as being very revolutionary but of course it depends from the context that you're in erm to perhaps some of the absolute UNK of er of er perhaps this was revolutionary
erm what about nationalism
nationalism we perhaps some of the er some of the erm concepts of nationalism appearing even before the french revolution
you begin to see er in erm in parts of europe in the er later eighteenth century a growing emphasis upon er upon language literature of certain areas
i'm thinking of italy here primarily
erm as it UNK under the impact of the french revolution and UNK rule and then later what nationalism came to be seen as it's the basically the idea that erm that people of a common culture history and language should occupy perhaps that's the wrong word
er should er should have a separate state
should not be ruled by a foreign power
so a people with a common culture history language should live in a separately defined state
and certainly should not live under the rule of a foreign er power
and our classic examples of course there erm of this situation in post eighteen fifteen europe are germany italy poland
now i've suggested that erm in the early nineteenth century liberalism and nationalism are very much bound up
er all nationalists in a sense are liberals or liberals are nationalists
one aspect of this of course one reason er behind this is the french revolution
let's not forget that erm under UNK rule you do see the creation of a so called king of italy
it's northern italy
erm UNK happens to be it's king and it is very much a client of france
we see the creation of the UNK of the UNK
a kind of erm united germany
erm within in these states as well you th the nationalism of them although it's in the french direction
it's associated as well with the ideology of UNK france
erm which does imply an attack on the old feudal UNK er previously existing
erm so after eighteen fifteen there is this link between liberalism and nationalism
i don't wanna go much er further ahead on this for the moment
we do tend to see liberalism and nationalism UNK company
especially after eighteen forty eight
and as ag i will i'll be returning to this obviously in consideration of italy and germany but it is perhaps worth making this point now
you do see liberalism and nationalism UNK company
erm and you do get this growing awareness that not all of that while all liberals might be nationalists
all right thinking liberals in europe from UNK in england you know
all right thinking liberals support nationalist aspirations
UNK a great advocate of italian unity for instance
UNK an advocate of er of UNK nationalism
he wanted turkey out of the UNK er out of south eastern europe
so all good european liberals are nationalists
it starts to become apparent very clear that not all nationalists are good liberals
in fact far from it
erm if the choice is between securing er your er securing your own state
securing the nationalist goal and ignoring the liberal goal many nationalists will go for the nationalist goal
if the price of bringing about your united state is the dumping of liberals then so be it
in that sense nationalism of course er it perhaps becomes a more dynamic and UNK ideology in nineteenth century europe
so i i've UNK er from er considering what erm er what this has got to do with the er erm congress of vienna but i think it's er hopefully er a worthwhile erm er UNK
erm let me turn er briefly to the those who have something good to say about the vienna settlement
it's had it's supporters er one is always reminded that one of it's key supporters the former american er secretary of state and at the moment UNK world expert er henry UNK
UNK erm who began life as a er as professor of history
his first major work was a defence of the vienna settlement
erm and it has been UNK on a number of grounds
it's been argued by it's supporters that it UNK in an era of peace
erm at it's most extreme interpretation there's an argument that erm that the vienna settlement was a factor in maintaining peace in europe between eighteen fifteen and nineteen fourteen
because it's extreme supporters suggest that it wasn't until nineteen fourteen that a war broke out involving all the great european powers
erm one would argue that's er that's er that's an extreme erm er view
erm there are wars in europe after eighteen fifteen
and some people might argue the vienna settlement was a factor in bringing about some of these wars
so it's again unfortunately it's it comes down in one of these erm pays your money takes your choice erm er arguments
but it is worth making the point that for instance if we take a look after eighteen fifteen of at the wars
there's war between russia and turkey in er eighteen er thirty when russia UNK in the turkish revolt
of course there's the war between russia and turkey as well in the in the eighteen seventies
but for the moment i'm just looking perhaps nearer to the vienna settlement itself
erm there's war between er you get the UNK war between russia on the one hand and great britain and france on the other
and it's always worth remembering about the UNK erm UNK that austria in essence UNK on the side er UNK not so much on the side of britain and france but against russia
austria played a UNK though non military role in er in the vienna in the er in the UNK war
erm and then we have the so called nationalist er wars
for instance eighteen sixty four between denmark and prussia and austria
technically prussia and austria here representing the german UNK
it's a war concerning the UNK and famous UNK dispute of course which i'm sure we're all familiar with
the erm eighteen sixty six war between prussia and austria
these are this is the war which essentially brings about german er unity under UNK erm control
prussia is the victor of course of this war
shock win for prussia
shock win for prussia
what a kind of er UNK page headline isn't it yeah
if what you're suggesting is there was an expectation that prussia might not win the war
yeah
and given the fact don't forget it's always worth remembering this and i've made i'll be making the point later on
most of the german states supported prussia in the UNK war
including the states
supported austria sorry
supported austria
not supported prussia
i think
now of course there are the wars for italian erm er UNK
eighteen fifty nine
a war between UNK between austria on the one hand and france and technically UNK on the other
although the UNK army didn't arrive until the battles were over
there was war between on the one hand austria and the other hand france and UNK
erm and then of course in a sense almost bringing these things together the major and perhaps most influential of these er wars
the war between france what is normally referred to as the UNK war
i suppose to be technical it ought to be the er it ought to be referred to as the UNK german war
it ought to be a war between france and a united germany
but as it is it is primarily prussia that's er involved
the war between france and prussia
eighteen seventy to seventy one
the argument is that okay these are that certainly erm we see a number of wars in er nineteenth century europe
but the argument is well they're not very big wars are they
they're short er wars
they range i mean er the er the er UNK war of eighteen sixty six is referred to as what the six weeks war and erm the five weeks of that or whatever were involved in peace negotiations
the war itself was just three days
erm there was only one battle in it you know but that erm that the war between france and erm and austria was fought in june erm essentially in june of er of eighteen er fifty nine
they are short wars the argument is
the same with the dan danish UNK
danish war the wars in denmark and austria and prussia one might imagine a rather short lived er war
how long did it take
well not very long
i suppose it's erm in that sense erm er i can see what you're this i don't think that's a factor in the in the erm in the fact that these wars are short
i think these wars are short because they're fought for limited objectives
they don't tend to UNK
because the because only one or two of the powers are involved in them
or three perhaps in the UNK
erm nevertheless to some extent the wars reflect the breakdown of the vienna settlement
so it's a kind of a strange argument to suggest on the one hand the vienna settlement was a factor in preventing wars between all the great er major war involving all the great powers
erm when at the same time the vienna settlement appears to be UNK like after er erm after eighteen thirty or something
of course erm it's perhaps it's looking slightly to the er historical future it it's er it was bad news in one sense because erm there came to be a view taken in europe that wars between the great powers would be short sharp wars
and hence the feeling in nineteen fourteen when the first world war broke out that it would er all be over by christmas
because it cos people were you know erm as is often said generally of a of a general UNK of UNK
they're always fighting the previous war
there was this view that the first world war would be rather like a re run of some of these wars at the end of the nineteenth century
erm which didn't turn out to be the case
erm so i would say i'll just wrap this up erm on erm on this point the er by making by introducing the fact that some UNK have argued that these wars were short
okay they had limited objectives
they were UNK the vienna settlement
that's in a way how you can perhaps square the circle
you can argue these wars were UNK
erm and the other factor that that's introduced as well is that the powers got into the habit of meeting in UNK
and you do see erm in the nineteenth century erm the powers still meeting together
for instance at the end of the UNK war in eighteen fifty six the peace treaty that's er that's held is actually a congress
all the powers attended the eighteen fifty six treaty of paris
it's not just a peace treaty signed by it's not just er it's not just a direct signing of a peace treaty between say france britain russia
it turns into a congress
the congress of UNK eighteen seventy eight
when it appears that there might be a major UNK in erm in south eastern europe
the powers do perhaps get into the habit of erm of erm of meeting together
okay anyway we'll er leave it at that then for the moment
well one of the things we did do immediately after the er youth consultation is that we erm we UNK a paid for a UNK board UNK at erm one of the youth centres in harlow so you know we creating that facility but erm what you so you your question was more directed at providing more of those kind of facilities
well providing mainly because you see a lot of the youngsters with their UNK boards but they're UNK through the town all over the place
i mean a lot i can say with on the youths i think were doing were walking with young people at the local levels of various places in the town you know we've got we haven't got as many resources as we want yet but were still trying to do that well i actually feel on youth we're doing quite a good job you know expensive job you know that we are and all that concerns you raise were certainly aware of
the problem is solving all the problems providing all the facilities in the situation where it's UNK resources i mean we wouldn't be actually be carrying out this review in the way that were gonna do it if we didn't have the problem with the money we've got you know
right time UNK on we've got five minutes before this meeting closes so if you've got another question i'll take one more question for chris and then she's off the hook
any more questions
i could tell you something about the if you've got the
gordon UNK
norman that erm one of the at the moment
yes
was going to have a facility for young people if you remember it was suggested that the restaurant was used for young people
with still not UNK site of the idea of having a cafe bar coffee for people one of the things that were that gonna look through and explore actually is er setting up some kind of coffee bar facilities at UNK the play barn there next to them
erm but that's really
i know it's one area
one would think one of the things that young people decide was that they wanted facilities in their area
in their area
area you see
that's is what i
could i come in here chris
yeah
at the at the last search at the last highway committee although were not having the full service at the envisage in the first instance a lot is going to be done is going to be some more erm UNK directed there and one or two other facilities and somebody has even suggested that we put a toilet there which is a very good idea
which is a very good idea but what they what the er what the council have done is
can i can i madam please if i may
what is what is happening at the moment is although they can't afford the money for the full for the full treatment they are making an allocation of money to improve matters round that area which will be er cos i told them that some of the pensioners were w walking round by the UNK it's pouring of rain which is perfectly true and that er the engineer should go round and see for himself and plus the fact how many of these people ever travel by bus or do they always go by car no and also i brought up about bus UNK and all those sort of things but any way there will be some improvements for the bus station in the future
right am i let off the hook now
yeah your off the hook
thank you very much thank you chris
i'm sure the i'm sure they'll all go away very when you before you came
they
thanks a lot
well now you know that when i disappear with a UNK sign i don't just appear with a UNK we are doing things behind the scenes
that's right thanks a lot chris
okay
that's great thanks very much
right were now on other reports
any body got any thing else to report with got a few minutes left
yes no any other business you can all go your all off the hook
they'll start arguing now
come on a wednesday but i think i'll come on thursday and friday
i'll shall be there friday pauline i can't make it thursday
are there any people who can come thursday
thursday
anybody thursday
at the market
at the market yeah
you've got one or two there look that come along
you alright in there
don't go over doing it
what about you could you
no good
er one from elizabeth and one from ron
one from ron and one from elizabeth
i've got erm a letter from ron in addition to his apologies
right and you'll be reading that other report will ya
yeah
right
er minutes of the last meeting can we take them as read
yes
thank you matters arising from that meeting which took place on the thirty first july
many of the matters arising will come up in my report of correspondence
mm you might like to when you come around to it UNK say that was on t v that t v and benefits the er our campaign
when's that
we have a few days to go to that looking into it now so if you know
oh soon
are they
oh
yeah we are doing some good
mm
you know the coming home to the it's all coming home to UNK
on page one harlow radio i have written to them and erm with the nomination of pauline and she has already been UNK with
have you had the eh chair have you had any reports on the bus company regarding the hand rails
none what's so ever
safety rails none what's so ever no
that's typical a really UNK eh
i take it you've all read your minutes
yes
are there any further matters arising before we pass onto the next item on the agenda
right could we have correspondence please secretary
er do you want me to stand or can you hear alright
no i think they can hear alright
it's necessary for you to stand
erm the first one is a letter from ron he he's in UNK with his family at the moment on holiday and he will be missing this meeting action tomorrow and unfortunately the september executive erm he's reported on the erm market stall which i'll come to a bit later i ask you for details about that and for the UNK with it erm a statement issued by the association nationally on pensioner's and the poll tax
this is er a UNK of the UNK and threat of UNK of pensioner's for pay failing to pay the poll tax
the government has admitted that forcing the poorest of pensioner's who are on income support to pay twenty per cent of the proposed council tax would be tax would be wrong
it cannot therefore now justify that it was right to cause those same pensioner's to pay twenty per cent of the poll tax
the association cause for the ending of UNK the word of pensioner's who's only fault is their poverty it is confident that the british people will support this cause and that their protest will be UNK bring to an end a situation which is the shame of our country that's signed by the president of the british pensioner's and fred the secretary
that's issued by the general purposes committee
the second does anyone want to say any about that it's just that they probably sent it to the appropriate people
there's another item of news which erm er ron only got on the sixteenth august and it's about the pre congress pensioner's march and rally now the congress is held in glasgow so i think we weren't going to that one anyway but it just giving details of erm the arrangements for the pensioner's march which we usually have we usually attend if it's in the south anywhere but that's just for information
the second item of erm correspondence is from UNK social services if you remember we've got this on going campaign on home helps and along side that we've got erm we did hear of t his home shopping erm campaign that UNK do apparently quite successfully the mp has mentioned that so i thought i'd get some details of that erm it gives the whole procedure for the er shopping and the delivery and the social services pay out for it they pay a charge erm if you'd like this copied i could get copies for the next meeting but meanwhile i'd recommend that erm we take it up with benefits action tomorrow on the campaign
do we agree with that
i agree with that yes
it's just a general procedure of er ordering from it's limited to UNK and erm the general helpful way
they haven't said much about the cost anything about the cost and they haven't said whether well they wouldn't would they whether anyone was UNK cos i understand from my family that they have been met you know they have been raised in the press but it's not a hundred per cent
the erm second is minutes from health action as you know a lot of our members are concerned of health action and they next meeting will be on the thirtieth september with the chief UNK executive kath kathy er who will be speaking
now with regard to that i'd rather feel that were gonna be called on before then because of the UNK about our own hospital
what about
which are quite frightening about opting out erm some of you will remember that we'd attended UNK garden city on a picket a month ago and erm as a result of campaigning there within the hospital with the press and the council they have been turned down so they are not being allowed to opt out
i also understand that UNK has erm got the same fate so you know it looks as if were in for a campaign there
perhaps pauline you've got some news on that
yes erm if i could here i did want to add some cos obviously i think everybody was taken by surprised
come to the front pauline
yeah we'd like to hear about it cos were all very worried huh
well on the issue of what's happening in the er health authority here it's a very much erm a surprise to everybody because those of us who were at the last meeting that we had only a couple of months ago to quite UNK saying that she that she was just not interested in the
and apparently her view now is that because the government ha have said anybody who is interested in becoming a in nineteen ninety three must register an interest on sixteenth this year which is really that's you know there UNK for what they haven't got any power in nineteen ninety three
can't rely on that can't rely on it
they've only been elected to nineteen ninety two so they're really what there doing there forcing people to take some action now because at kathy says she's afraid of being left out if there should be a another tory government so a lot of people are in the same position they will be putting in eh i think they just call it best of interest not a proper application but then if the whole lot hundreds of us come along which is quite likely they will the government will say well this proves that everybody wants to become you see so it's rather clever move erm as far as i'm concerned what's happening with that she is eh here within the hospital the UNK and the UNK in the hospital
also far as i know there is no intention of discussion it with members of the public or UNK or union or anything like that
so as a result to that there erm there is going to be a public meeting on the tenth september which is actually organised by the labour party erm but obviously the who thing very worried about the attendance at that erm the have had to organise it very quickly because he wants to get it in before the sixteenth we'll still trying to get erm a national speaker i'm hoping that julie from the er eh national help federation will be able to come but she's on holiday till monday erm i don't
will go ahead whether we have a national speaker or not
i did wonder whether we ought to call a sort of emergency meeting of harlow health action but i was away myself until last few days so it's difficult to do that so what we've are i've agreed with dave the secretary we've produced a leaflet which is based on one of the UNK leaflet it gives the reason to be against opting out
we just have used a UNK version of that
the one the federation produced is very good but a lot of reading in it so we wanted one we could hand out to people and the intention is that we go on the market next week thursday and friday to hand out that leaflet also to advertise the meeting on the tenth erm so that really is as far and obviously the meetings that UNK just said that kathy 's coming that would be an opportunity to erm you know discuss it further with her
if they do go ahead and put the application in which i think they will then that's the start of the process so that's a good time when we will need to really step up the campaign and we will get national UNK to meetings we will get probably a petition we will go round the area like we did over the er non funding but we had to do something quickly to make it clear you know we don't want this to go ahead
erm hopefully we'll have the same effect that 'em they had in UNK and erm
UNK
UNK
UNK er because that really is a good example
i'm actually also hoping to get someone who was erm concerned at the campaign to come to the meeting cos i think it would be very useful to have someone who's been through it and to say how they tackled it so i think it should an interesting meeting hopefully we'll get a few you know interesting people to come along and we can spend from that meeting campaign
erm there's also i just wanted to say a bit about the ambulance er
what date next week are they
it's the thursday and friday that's the fifth and sixth fifth and sixth
er yes that's right
between ten and two
ah that's also that's also the day the fifth is we will be at eh UNK
yeah
ah
well not all of us
not all of us
only five of us
but eh
right well we'll have to but you know if people have to let me know if they can turn up then
sixth yes i can come on the friday
sixth is the friday
yeah well i mean i think we need to get as many as possible
yeah
to turn up who are not going to UNK
what car they going in
yes well eh
ten till two usual
ten till two yes
thursday and friday
thursday and friday that's right
what time is it
ten till two
the public meeting
the public meeting is on the tenth at here the town hall at eight o'clock
town hall eight o'clock at night
eight o'clock yes
we've already got that haven't we we've already been told that haven't we
well i
erm if i
do you do you want me health action banner for that cos i've got it at home
ooh yeah
the
i think the more things that
only as we've lost the last one i'm hanging on to it's hanging in my wardrobe i'm not making a third one
your hanging onto it yeah
no
erm just if i could say about the there's something next week also about the ambulance
the erm we only just this week discovered that the regional health authority are going to consider the ambulance proposal next wednesday
ah yeah
were hoping to get a mini bus i don't think we ought take a bus because we were very badly treated when we did that we don't to allow ourselves open to that again but i have written to say were hoping to get enough people to take a mini bus
if in the mornings you remember we started to leave quite early about eight o'clock cos the other bus were late
so if anyone's interested in going on that get in touch with me or dave we'll erm say we don't need to many but i think we can take a few and we will take our petition with us on that one the animal petition
when is that one pauline
that's next wednesday were get the
pauline
yeah
they will have to pick us up i'm afraid cos our pass is not valued till nine o'clock
six o'clock i mean it won't be very many people who's been invited so we can probably arrange that
yeah
erm but at the moment were still looking for a driver
and that's next wednesday
that's next wednesday if we don't get enough we'll probably just take a car but anyway there's going to be a lot going on actually on this
could we indicate that if they can go
yeah anybody interested in what on wednesday
about thursday
yeah there's london
eight o'clock in the morning
eight o'clock in the morning
yeah
where's it go
going to london to regional health authority to attend present petition and to see what they do about the animals petition
if in fact where they decide whether to pass it on the
right there's one two three four five six
and the other half you know
well actually that maybe enough because if get say terry from UNK abbey
that's the UNK
and were hoping to get somebody from bishop's stortford i think it's important to have a and i'm also going to ask bob the ambulance driver if he's free to come i think we can use the
so i think that cover so if those people can
what
well i think we can arrange to pick you up as we go at that time you'll of eh because i know that bus passes don't cover that
dave driving is he
well the problem is he has to say he has a licence for you he hasn't so it's possible that terry will be
ah oh terry i see
yeah we'll still getting trying to get in touch with him but we'll find a driver one way or another
there's one from the stow area
yes you can see him tomorrow that's a good idea those who can okay
right
filling up a blank week
thank you pauline very that er very good report on the health service
the next item of correspondence is just the minutes of benefits action and i think you'll mostly up to date on those on that
at the last meeting erm sue gave a drafted an open letter to jerry UNK
this is mainly dealing with the social fund which as you know is erm go UNK changes which means er loss of money and breaking up the UNK to twelve monthly amounts which is creating great difficulties
if you apply to the fund at the beginning of the month you'll likely to get something but hard luck if you apply later on in the month but that she's taken up as an open letter to jerry UNK but so far i haven't seen it in the press
erm the budget increase is for social fund for years eighty seven and eight was two ninety five thousand one hundred and ninety under the new system in the first year it went down to fifty seven thousand one oh seven
as you know because of the activities of UNK action over a couple of years social fund in harlow was quite good because we UNK people to apply and social fund was then based on the year UNK applications but this doesn't apply now
home UNK we like were meeting tomorrow and were hoping that UNK will come along and eh update us on things so that we can campaign again starting in october
erm mm excuse me
now out outside UNK that's all the correspondence
outside correspondence erm the chairman and UNK have dealt with er erm complaint from a member er i don't know the outcome of it but it's a lady that they have seen
i have another query on the world women women's erm work from margaret who isn't here i don't think this afternoon and that was about erm you know the female test and the time taken for the results to come through
well i i've been on to world UNK women's committee and they assure me that they the hospital says these tests should come through in a week at the most three week's but you can phone them so that certainly has improved there doesn't seem to be a back log
we have another in erm on UNK directory we said we were asked if we would like a mention there and that has been put in hand with at the moment the chairman's name and address and telephone number but when we get our office i've no doubt we can change that because we'll have a UNK for the office and probably just morning hours and that can go in another copy
now apart from that we had a phone call from mrs who's here at the moment and she'll probably and i'll tell you what i've got on that
we had a phone call erm a year or two ago mrs did a lot of work on this with UNK and so on about the costs of pensioner's for animal treatment because the p d s a no longer operates in harlow and the nearest one i think is UNK which makes it impossible
at the time we took up the secretary took up the matter and i got him to send us er a copy of the reply and it appears that as you know it's all voluntary and it relies charity for individuals but i noticed i only got this from ron yesterday paragraph here says where the community demonstrates it's active support for such UNK then there is an increase likelihood of the establish of a service although it has to be said that there already exists a waiting list of communities UNK to re receive p d s a support
now i think er and i'm sure that mrs will i've got other information as well that we could i i'd like to recommend that we had an on going petition which could be in welfare rights the town hall the libraries but there's no i don't think there's an opposition to such a thing whereby we ask for a p d s a clinic in harlow i'm sure there's room round where they were sit UNK before and i don't know you know i'd like to know what mrs 's thinks also i've got information er a following lots of phone calls erm there is an organisation called the blue cross they have a clinic in victoria and they're they have a head office in oxford and they will help if they know the name of the vet and have the invoice and i'm afraid it's tested but they will help pensioner's and other low paid people to meet there bill's so that's another outcome while were doing the petition
what do you think of that
UNK
UNK are you
is she here
is mrs in the audience today
yeah
yeah
ah like to see who you are mrs i see thank you
have you got have you got anything you know think we can take it further than that
do you think we can take it further
or shall what do you think of haven't it UNK
well i heard from inspector yesterday
who
inspector
yeah inspector
i phoned him yesterday and er i ask him whether it was right that er what i UNK that the er UNK the private UNK there with a union you will not get the r s p c a they work on there on behalf
they beg you
they have to erm first of all ask er r s p c a funding it which is very much against anyway because i hate being UNK by the this way
so if it's a p d s a clinic you wouldn't have to do that you can just give er
no you just contribute mm
erm you've got that to tend with and erm on top of that erm you can't UNK of if you've got a pass yes i you've then have to er get you know whether though it'll be going to a and at the moment there suppose to be very low so they can't do that any more and then you'll have to the vet will then do the treatment for the animal but again you don't get the vet you'll only get the training UNK to do the job and then they UNK from the r s p c a so it no way that they haven't got any funds
oh see so that they get there full
well there doing this for fund of course funding for everything even church
going down if not stop for the thing
but what do you think about erm demanding er erm a p d s a place in harlow
well i have asked for that i've written to the p d s a i've written to the
well we have too yes
you have also
when we when we first took it up UNK we did that
that's right i've been through over the year's i've been doing this and they say whether it's because they know if the background at the er UNK the private UNK there you know i don't know but the information i get from them that there'd a there not prepared to over
well this was a letter of the granted it was eighty nine but i mean this paragraph just said you know if we does say that you know if we established a demand and i don't see why we shouldn't have a bash at
well then i have the inspector
i mean if we have a petition like they do on the counter in welfare rights in the town hall i don't think there be any opposition to that and the libraries for the setting up of a p d s a branch you know i don't see why we shouldn't give it a try
there is one at the UNK elm still open
pardon
that r s p c a at UNK elm
at UNK elm
i asked the inspector yesterday
yeah only
is it possible that we could have a vet a r s p c a vet and take uses that hut even two days a week would be a great help to the pensioners
but then
and all he said the whole of
mm
i was UNK separate and apart from that they would have to have a operating room and a UNK there you see that's what they would have to have i mean if there gonna have p d s a premises this is what you've got to have cos very often the animal has to be put under and all sorts of things you know what i mean it wouldn't be just an office with say like a UNK and a tenants it would be a case of a surgery and things in that nature which would be required by er quite a number of animals
mm that
so your talking about a big space your not talking about a small office
that's what we've got to take into consideration
mm
yeah
well anyway whatever i tried to get him to erm cos i've written again to the newspaper i've tried to get him to confess that the unions are the biggest because erm even then i said to tell him well supposing that we could get i said erm you know the money to support you i said just UNK i said would be private vet and he said what you dare say they would have to have there
when there when you say a union what do you mean a union in a true sense of the word or do you mean an organisation which is something UNK vastly different because they way your they way your saying this to me this doesn't sound like a union at all
this sounds very much like some er organisation based on the establishment to me that's what it sounds like which eh were one would expect
sorry the only one i eh i eh got this idea was when i first took this up i went into the hut in the town and i picked up the booklets you know that they have on the counter and in one of these booklets it had that the UNK were now i don't know what i'm very lost for everything like this but they've kept and therefore if your animal needed your pet needed treatment it would be done by the private UNK and eh UNK the money would be re would be UNK by the vet from the r s p c a and i think that gave to erm
well what i think i shall do now is i think i should take this a little further about this union business i think i should get in touch with dave the editor of the t u c to find out what the exact position of these this so called union is because it doesn't sound like a union to me it sounds it sounds like an
it sounds like an association
he would be able to find they would be able to find out what they are
i'm talking about the unions
i mean the resources then
yeah the resource UNK
yeah he would be able to find out what type of union this is or whether it's some establishment association we try quite frankly i think it is
from the way this lady spoke it seems to me like a that sort of er organisation from the establishment
another things is
we'll have to make of this because we can't keep
just say we go ahead with the decision
yeah
now that i had to get it to the by taxi and she had seven stitches put in the leg and i had to leave her there for six hours well then it was a taxi back home i couldn't now i am on income support but that cost me fifty four pound ninety five and i am paying that
mm well look what i'm going to say to you know is time UNK on that do you agree that we go ahead with what UNK suggesting
that we try out a petition throughout all the UNK in the town
yeah
yes
all those in agreement raise
right carried so that's what we'll do okay
erm do you have you got erm UNK have you got the blue cross address in oxford
yes i've got plenty
okay well if you've got it that's alright i'll see you afterwards
after the meeting
see her after the meeting next business
erm can i go on now to erm
oh wait i've got a you'll pull yourself a fair enough
erm
we'll move it start weekend speed it up a little
erm due erm there's also as you know we've had the chartered petition on the market and we are going on with that
the it was officially launched in london yesterday at UNK house unfortunately neither of the two officer's could go it was rather short notice but it has been officially launched now as a national thing
erm there's a question of a rally in central hall now in order to organise this pensioner's rally there short of funds erm i think the executive will be discussing this and as before we did give them quite a considerable UNK because it costs a thousand pounds to hire the centre hall and we do want to erm take part in a very big rally like the last one was
erm apart from the meeting last week the last month er one of our UNK one of our members noticed that erm we hadn't got a delegate to age concern and she volunteered that's a mrs would you like to okay that cos the chairman and i speaking to her thought well this was a good idea and i have UNK her name to age concern who've contact her
is that all right
yes
erm we couldn't nominate anyone at the a g m no one was willing to do it
erm oh god the next item is the essex region and erm that was just a report from norfolk on the success of it
erm from the e c were we've decided to hold the usual christmas social and peggy and myself will organise as before with the usual UNK you know the usual team of workers volunteers i mean
that's right
erm unfortunately we can only have this room not the canteen this year
i will be writing to the normal firms as usual to get donations for the raffle er now the other thing i've got to report from is the stall no before that the e c discussed applications by other organisations now sheffield and erm many other areas produce there own excellent publications so i wrote of to greater london pensioner to UNK to senior citizens in sheffield UNK pensioners grey power and erm i i've sent UNK to them and already had some copies back from sheffield
whilst on the market stall i had a liverpool pensioner who hadn't seen a liverpool organisation so when i got home i sent to her a notice of the huge rally there going to hold in september in liverpool with a couple of bishop's and big national speakers i sent that to her and also contacted a liverpool pensioner secretary to get in touch with her and we've also written to erm that's the rally erm we've also i've also written to jim from UNK if you remember er his down our rally so we should have some we decided to buy twelve copies of each publication they produce and one when we get our office will be available there
on file on file
erm dum the market stall as you know we didn't have it in the market we had it on the thank goodness because we parked it in the shade erm during that period we got five hundred and thirty two signatures with three or four more of you it could of been a thousand erm we also got fourteen pounds seventeen in donations all completely UNK for cos as you know we don't take money
erm so two pounds of that went with sale with the sale of the journal and so we can say we had twelve pounds UNK donations erm as peggy would back me up if she was here saying that any time you ask someone to sign the flood gates open with what they thought about the position of pensioners in fact we've probably got a lot more signatures if they hadn't but erm we did pick up we i picked up the news about UNK garden UNK cost of and things like that not going through and erm now our month our monthly our monthly stall will not be on the third thursday this year it will be on the fourth to co inside with the week were celebrating pensioner's week which is a week behind national
erm that means we have a stall on tuesday the twenty fourth wednesday we've got our meeting here with the speaker about were having mike speaking on UNK now and he'll be telling us his experiences over there and his had a long association with UNK and harlow and thursday were having a market stall with a UNK band and norman could probably tell us more about that
do you want to go ahead with the tuesday stall
a the tuesday stall was a bit UNK at the moment because what has happened is i heard from the er from mr stuart that he thought that er could assist us and that i should go over there and see them
i did do that along with ron and er they were speaking in terms of er a UNK at under a pound a time and thing of that nature which should then come to a the pensioner's category at poole so i took it back to stuart and he said oh see what i can do norman and at the present moment it UNK there because i haven't been able to contact stuart at the moment owed to the holiday but i shall be contacting him and hopefully we will also be doing two days which is the tuesday and the thursday also what they er he's promised to do is to come half way with the cost of the UNK band which is a great help
er so you can say that er mr is a friend of pensioner's he said he said he would be prepared to what i approached him and said er what about harlow caring council are they prepared to assist the pensioners in any way or do they wish to join in on this oh yes he said of course norman he said how much are you paying er ron i said well his asking forty pound for the for the morning oh he said i'll go half way with that then he came out and said to me pull me up afterwards and ask me to go to leisure services about the tuesday and so i'm still following that up and hopefully we will have two days on pensioner's week because you want to have as much impact as possible and in a few moments when i nearly finished here i shall be reading you something where you'll see that it is important that we make an impact on the people of harlow
erm one of
it is the twenty fourth of september isn't it
yes twenty fourth
well it'll be the er the twenty fourth and the twenty sixth
with our meeting in between
with our meeting in between
erm one of the things we had on the stall is erm this erm application form for n h s charges now many people including probably people here don't know that erm you don't have to be on supplementary to get help and ann knows actually er if your getting any rent or rate UNK and you fill this in you'll get some help in some cases quite considerable help and i suggested that we had some of these on our store room got some from welfare rights and they went like hot cakes because most people didn't know about this so following that we shall have we shall keep these on our stall and i've more or less suggested that lisa on age concern in the UNK should have them there because she's constantly getting enquiries on that so she is going to do that
erm so it's it has been very useful
on news mobility i had a copy of that last month and i've ordered twenty on each publication
erm during the executive erm mary raised a point from the joint planning team about the erm charter and the remarks made by dr on that would you like to say something on that mary because we want to take some action
i to each other
i would like the association to write to this is from the
members agree that proposal continue on in the ideal although it was UNK to set high standards
dr said it was a matter of trying to make a correct differential between right and whatever that means and that the charter might tend to UNK our views as defenders instead of
that's right
that's right
dr our would like to know what other
i like a reply
pensioner's charter
i gave it i gave it too them
yeah i think i think erm what about this reply
yeah we'll get
on the twenty sixth of this month
twenty sixth of this month
if you could definitely

it's the last friday in er september
the last friday
er that's the twenty seventh friday
well can
pardon
can erm do you think mary we can get together on reply on this
i do hope so UNK terrific on it
yeah i think so
i don't think i could do it i'm a
well how about waiting until
i didn't mean for you to do it but erm
don't leave it too long norman
well yeah i mean your in the second week aren't ya
and you've got plenty of time you've got a fortnight UNK between the two we can come up with ideas like the idea of that
well i think the ideas should come from the members well what do they think about it
i think it's great
would you
i
if it's got to come to the members it's gotta come today
well i've a you know what i've said
i've i'll get dr remarks in the minutes there actually stated in the minutes
yeah well then we can we can add an organisation er state where the charter that it was launched yesterday nationally and the people who were there at there launch which i think
yes it
yeah i think i haven't got details of that but i think erm ron has and also the fact that we've taken remarks and
yeah very much so
i mean what's this small in the daily mail erm yesterday you know it makes it
i read it yeah
oh yeah that's right can i read something out now then
yeah well
now
can we finish this off
right yeah you finish of UNK
i like to independence with economics you don't have your independence without economic independence
that's right
that's what my
that's right year
i
there are people who have a good pension when there in retirement don't there department i'm the only one that's elected
mm

you don't get any er help at all
right have you finished now
can we go ahead or not
can we go ahead
well it's up to you
right
what'll you suggest
i've had a
but we do we were in the
oh jesus christ
we've still got some more
oh go on then
two more things
erm
but keep me out of it
erm the last thing is no we i don't want to stop the chairman cos he's got something else as well
erm mary indicated at the last executive that she wants to retire from c h c and she would like pauline to take her place have you an UNK a UNK from here
yes this er UNK me but again i
so who do we write to change erm
secretary
secretary of whom
i'm
so we write to the secretary of c h c
mrs okay
and did people agree with that nomination
i've done it for seven years
pauline
i think it'll be good for pauline she gets a lot of information
i think it would be a very good for pauline to go on
yeah
and while were doing that we should thank mary for her seven years UNK that she's done on
yeah
we did ask dorothy to do it after i did it for four years but she wasn't keen and i had to go on
right
and that's all i've got to report which has been quite a busy month
i've had a letter from our ken he writes pensioners are now are growing UNK vital contingency including many active gift enable people with other use there often made to feel unwanted there commonly UNK and there needs are seldom frequently met
at last that is being fixed
so i won't go through the rest of it it's a long and er it's just brought us on the same sort of thing but what it proves is that we are getting somewhere and that is what i thought was rather important news which i want to do
yeah
to UNK you know i mean a were alright we've got plenty of local issues but i mean when we think of the big issues these are the big issues that need to be looked into
right madam secretary
that's all
that's all from you so can we have the financial report and you will switch off sir
are we ready have we finished tea
yes
have we been the cups if so
our speaker for this afternoon is a lady who i very much respect her that's UNK mrs or miss chris from the local unit
chris
thank you thank you norman
erm i do recognise some faces i know some of you recognise me and eh cos we've done quite a lot of things together but this afternoon what i'm going to tell you about is how i fit in with council i don't think any of you know that or know what the local government unit is
erm so i'm gonna start off by talking about the local government unit where it fits in the council organisation
were we're not attached to any sort of department like housing or leisure were actually in the organisation were in the general management department and were not alone erm the planning er originally the general manager's department and the winners and equality unit are in that department as well and the general manager has his own erm policy officer and UNK so were in the general manager's department and in other council's that would be known as the chief executive department
other council's like harlow do have central policy units which is what we would be described as because people recognition that it's important that you need to have people who are outside departments looking at the organisation as a whole what it's doing where it's going how it's being influenced by external UNK i e what the health service are doing locally or what the government's doing more significantly erm i think you need people looking around to see how the council's affected and what were doing in and taking an overall view and responding in that way and that's the kind of thing that we do and that's why were here
erm i understand that erm somebody from the unit has had talked to your group before but it's just as well to come and talk to you again because we've changed the local government unit not the same erm unit that it was when we were first introduced we've grown basically
we've grown and erm brought other people integrated other people in with us
the person that is head of our unit is carol and she's known as principal policy co UNK and she UNK directly to the general manager UNK erm then we have three teams within the local government unit we have a policy team and i'm the team leader for the policy team and i'll talk about i'll talk about our work later but it's just to explain who we are
then there's the neighbourhood development team and that team is principally working on implementing the council's UNK and UNK policy opening local officer's setting area committee's some of you maybe familiar erm with that initiative i'm sure you are
that team deals principally with that and then there's the community development team headed by john who worked with particular groups in the town
now the reason why we've come together and this has been a recent change and it's been this year erm is because there are UNK without going into deep detail there are UNK in our work and we were working together as officer's anyway but not as well as we should so what we decided to do was formally integrate the three teams under the same unit and we do have regular er internal meetings management team meetings UNK of john pete me and carol and we so we more co UNK the work for all the teams much more UNK that we know what everybody's doing and that way we believe we can use best use of resources we've got most effectively
then within the UNK in the policy team there were three policy development officer's in the neighbourhood development team there were two development officer's and in the community development team there are one two there are well there are normally six officer's that you could i that you could identify but there are other people that relate to them but then it gets a bit complicated so were keep it at that
the great the one thing about the community development team to point out is that they've got people working on pa particular in particular ways with the community
we've got two officer's for example who are leading on working the young people in the town youth development officer's er we the local government unit has a policy team initiated work on the youth policy and this arose out of erm a member UNK september eighty nine where er the members felt that really the council wasn't doing enough for young people that we as a council not to think about young in the way we deliver our services and it was felt that we needed to go out and talked to young people which we did in the winter of that year erm and find out what they wanted from us and the res as a result of that policy and that consultation exercise has now developed into a front line service where we have two people full time working with young people in the town and that's on various things UNK project the UNK in the town we which have got UNK type i mean i know there not everybody's cup of tea but i mean they way
when we erm er when we were doing those projects we erm we had a comments book and more people were in favour of them and saw them as an improvement to the town and so it needs something that's really interesting actually it's er erm the work's department have said as a result of those UNK projects they can shift two officer's from the UNK team to the UNK team so it's actually cut down on the work of actually clearing up unwanted UNK so it's had a positive effect so we we've got these two people work with the other people and we've got dorothy who's working with black people and ethnic UNK in the town and erm for people who were here when this presentation was last given er robin who used to be in the local the policy team of the local government unit is now actually a community development officer one of the UNK robin use to do video work for the authority erm and we decided we asset whether the need for that kind of k UNK of work to continue and we thought on balance not erm and he now is running the music UNK space over at UNK bush that again is a project for young people to enable it's a place where UNK can practice and that's the problem in harlow erm and er that's really exciting project because it's bringing in a lot of income for the council as well as providing the service that people want and it i mean it is important at this time that we are doing limited projects where we are bringing in income cos at you know we estimate that erm we can get that erm UNK space properly resource that project could be self financing so your providing a service but your also getting paid your getting paid for as well so erm that is who we are now and were er where were located we have an open door policy as people will know
were in the first floor of the town hall erm along the corridor with where the general manager's office is and most of us can be found in there so erm it is i just think it's interesting for you to see how the things link up because those of you that have contact with the community development team will know that over at UNK bush there is a community resource centre er that you can use well that's linked in with us and we provide information for us so it's important that you know that if you go there you also can have a connection with the local government unit as well as a whole like the policy team if you if you want information or anything
so it's just the give you the background to show how were linked so that's who we are and how we organize is that clear has anybody got any questions
yeah what's happen to the steering committee
what's happened to the steering committee
mm
what the local government
erm it doesn't meet
no it doesn't meet any more
not at all
no
it there hasn't i came here in when i came here in february eighty nine it was meeting to and the idea being to discuss particular things to get particular things off the ground but it has i think the reason why it didn't continue to meet was because it wasn't felt necessary basically
the problem is the people from the community the and that's important
yes it's difficult
it means that your you officer are running the whole show now
yeah
and that without input from the community
well except that we do i mean in offence erm we don't get it from that particular forum but i wouldn't say that is how we operate
no
because the local government sub committee does
i mean deliberately the actual community itself was set up so it does have representation from the community
put
mm
i'm certainly as i was going to come on to explain and the way you will see ourselves working is not people who sit in the town hall and just turn out reports i mean the kind of work we do and the way we work means that were actually very much involved in the community groups but i mean if it was if it was thought to be an issue that we needed to have greater community involvement i e to UNK that forum then that's something that you know we may need to address but i never saw it as operating like that anyway i mean i saw it as it's almost like in a cabinet of members mainly
we were disappear
that's right they get on the subject
well i think that how it came
that's right
can't remember them
yeah
what's is was what he was doing at the main committee anyway
well i think that er you know just didn't happen like that though except things like that in one way and
that's right
yeah
well i still miss it
i think the er the sort of looked after her as well especially in the evening times
mm yeah
er we go through old harlow
yeah
the people sort of eight o'clock nine and there just UNK by the health service there anything night and i think a lot of the trouble
that's right
got to do something
that's something we that's what we found and one of the things we have got is this youth bus actually operating in the town and it erm it's running three nights a week we can't cover every bit of the town but it goes to different area's of the town the stow and old harlow i mean we've actually got quite good UNK with the young people in old harlow but erm i mean we can't cover every night i mean there is a problem of erm you know you get from a position where you recognise it you need to start catering for a particular group and it takes a long time getting there
i mean as a the fact is that like providing services for the young people is legally the responsibility for es of essex county council
mm
and you know they've got paid youth officer's working in harlow now they are there are they're over they're over stretched it's true and but we i mean what were doing here is actually UNK there service and were not meeting all we wouldn't of erm meeting all the demands but the important thing i think is that were continuing to erm you know were trying to do something about it and one of the things that were trying to do as officer's in the local government unit is work with leisure services and get them to put more resources into doing things for young people
you see this where we young we've had all the youth organisations which most of us belong to that's all we had in those days
yeah
and if you went to films
that's all the organisations there were
we went to church
that's right well actually one of the documents that we produce i haven't brought it along with me today was a report when we did the consultation we produced erm eh i mean we talked to young people and got their views on a whole range of areas transport housing facilities and we produced it in this news report and it's very rates were very interesting
i use the
erm read it erm that's right
what does the what does the youth bus actually do it except go round on four wheels i mean what's it's function
what's it's functions
when it goes i mean i'm speaking as a resident of the stow and i know there's lot's of complaints and shop keepers and er people in the flats and that round you know the shops there and you do feel a bit UNK if you walk through the stow at night
yep
erm which is a shame because as UNK we all hung around street corners and UNK and things
well actually the function of the youth bus is like in the absence of buildings in area's where people want to go it's fulfilling that function on the bus there are things like videos people can play music they also get erm you know we don't just let them do what they want to do although were you know where quite erm quite progressive with them we actually provide we have information on the bus provide information we've got a UNK we involve local UNK like on aids and stuff like that i mean you have to be quite sensitive when you do something like that you know especially if you know with the age group erm but erm you know you get younger people coming on twelve year olds to thirteen year old and what not
but i mean they are there to provide advice and we do get an awful lot of case work
mm
you know young homeless people we pick up on this bus and er we have we we've sort of ended up pursuing their cases with the housing department and getting temporary accommodation
and do you ask there opinions about what they want
eh yeah
yeah
continually
but i mean we also we i mean we're providing a service for them to allow them to come on off the street use the bus right but at the same time were trying to provide services for them because one of the things that came out in a consultation was young people didn't feel that there was enough information for them in the town
they didn't feel for example they could go into the advice centre they didn't feel it was for them
mm
and so erm the youth bus is trying to fill that gap it's not ideal because what we actually want to do is get the advice centre to provide some information and to look at ways they can open up to young people
yes
yeah this was brought up last night at the meeting at of old harlow and potter street er forum
aha
and it was brought up last time that erm in the potter street area not enough was being done to occupy the minds of the
yeah
and there is nowhere in that area for them to go
no
mm
mm
and it was stressed quite strongly
well that's good i think that's really encouraging because it can't you see this is the sort of an example of the way our work goes right
we in the policy unit say we members raise something and we get onto it and say right this is how we can tackle it
the big step is then getting the rest of the council to take it on board that's the big step you know leisure the neighbourhood UNK i mean the neighbourhood UNK are quite good i mean they've got a they've got a budget a development budget and like in UNK and UNK i know that a large proportion of the development budget there went on projects for young people you know so there are using there money
yeah
so erm i mean that was we thought i came to a discussion about young people which is really good and it really did have people in your age group interesting
we are very interested
but that's er that's
we've all been young
i mean that's what we're doing on the council for but
we've been there
we've all been UNK
but if i can
UNK
if i can i'll be
quite please
general level and talk about the local government unit and what are erm what how i see our main areas of work right
how i would UNK them
erm the first thing you do is a central policy thing a major function is to analyze interpret and develop strategic responses to all major government legislation
when it and the government can produce fifty pieces of legislation affecting local government since nineteen seventy nine i haven't been here since nineteen seventy nine UNK so i have to analyze everything but they always landed our the ma the major ones and so for example erm it was the local government unit that produced the initial response of the poll tax what strategy the council should adopt er the council won't distance approach we wanted to make it clear that the poll tax was a government erm it was a government initiative and it was being UNK on us and that was the way did that effect it that was a guided and then there was the nineteen eight nine local government housing act which i'm sure many of you
familiar with which is basically the piece of legislation which is still in force now and still a major problem for us which is about getting council UNK up to the level of private sector UNK and forcing council's to do that
erm and it was us i mean not only do we i mean we develop her a response that means we work with UNK we work with senior officer's in other departments and we look at the policy angles like for example with that piece of legislation when we first realised what the impact for that legislation was it was gonna mean that we were ten million pound short in our housing money basically that was that was what it looked like on the surface and you think oh my god how you gonna make up for that short fall that would mean an eleven pound a week rise in rent that's what it worked out as so well we can't do that how and then you have to look at the legislation and you say what are the UNK holes here and erm and it involves contacting outside organisations and getting there opinion and finding out what other council's are doing and responding to things like this and we did come up with a way of reducing that deficit but that's the kind of thing we do
at the same time we were organising meeting's to tell local people about it and to get there views and to make it clear again that we were you know we were in a position where we were being forced to do something by this legislation that we didn't want to do and we wanted just the alternative was if we had set a rent rise which have been dramatically higher i mean the four pounds twenty five rent rise that we eventually had to agree to was higher than what the council wanted to put the UNK up by you would think well the council put the UNK up by four pounds twenty five erm and you know that that's why the council does that sort of thing but it's us that gets involved in that kind of work producing information and developing responses and then the UNK d major area is what i've just labelled a strategic policy development and that mainly erm put policies that are like a rise within the council rather than things that come from outside like for example because were the kind of council we are there was a debate amongst officer's and UNK to develop an anti poll strategy and two hundred and eight thousand pounds was found to be linked to that strategy and erm as that's enabled various UNK to get under schemes UNK for children in the town stuff like that er and also erm to provide an overall policy frame work for other council department's
like when there considering how there gonna spend there money every year they should have reference to this policy cos general council policy like how can i spend my money to UNK resources so that we can provide more for people who are in need so it isn't just about projects it's about a policy and we develop those kind of things we've already talked about the unit policy and we developed that
other things we get involved in as a central policy unit
things like it was us who set up the benefits unit in the town centre you know we it was considered that you know we as a neutral policy team are in without departmental buyers rather than political buyers that's a joke erm would be the best people to erm er set up this unit we don't have any less interest the UNK the UNK felt within the housing department with the introduction of poll tax and the poll tax benefit it wasn't clear where that could go so we were the people who had to sort that out
one of the other the other things that we will erm be taking responsibility for is something called the front line review which i want to come back too because it's something that will interest you as a group erm but that's basically again a council learn initiative where the council's want to look at over the next month all of the front line services we provide the services that you come into contact with on a day to day erm level and look at you know are we providing a service as you want are we providing them efficiently how would you like to see them better provided
it's a way of as a council taken the position that we ought to be spending your money effectively right
it's also tied to the fact that were we have less money than we used to because of the introduction of poll tax it is tied to that cos we are constrained but erm that's the kind of thing that we get brought into to support erm and then another area is progressing policy UNK in other council departments
in other authorities you may have whole research and policy sections in the particularly departments like a housing research and policy section
in this council we don't have it's not organised like that
department's tend eh the actual service department are very much what i would call UNK lead you've got just people there doing there job and there've been doing there job for years and that's you know there not the very rare thing today erm thinking of policy sense about the way in which they could change that service you just get on and do what they've always been doing
erm so the given any organisation should always be looking at what it's been it's doing to see whether what it's doing erm it should continue to do you know whether the whether the services is a UNK or whatever or whether we could provide it in a erm in the most up to date way the most progressive way
we as a as a policy unit get involved in that kind of work as well so working with departments looking at new UNK and trying to work with them
now that isn't easy actually because you know the UNK think they know best and they actually quite resent you know the young policy officer's coming in and saying let's do it this way shall we
coming in at all so that's that isn't easy but it eh were it works it's really good i mean for example we d o up the poll tax enforcement policy erm and again it was where the cou i mean if the council had followed the legislation on poll tax collection it's you know erm and it didn't want to do that and so again well it's well it's related to this legislation bit but we looked at we looked at how we could get round that legal procedure and we looked at developing a more sensitive policy and we had to do that with other departments
a more practical initiative which would currently involve them is a self build housing scheme it's at a very early stage but basically erm were working with the housing department economic development unit and er work the work's department there's a there's a corporate project team and were looking erm we've got to identify positively identify a site for it but we're looking at bringing in european social fund funding and erm housing association money to get a self built housing scheme for young people you know where they would be trained in manual skills to build there own house and they live there erm and er so that's quite an exciting scheme
erm the other thing we do is what i would call servicing community groups supported by the council and i'll put servicing in inverted UNK here
erm these kind of group kind of groups i'm talking about here are the west essex self action campaign the UNK groups the homes and jobs campaign school governors for 'em
a it's part of it's linked to the fact that erm the council's quite erm concerned to get you know community groups active in the town and responding to things as well as just the council officer's but it's also linked to the fact that we as council officer's can't be UNK political it's far to say and you know what happens is groups get set up to resist things like last year when the hospital lost the fifty million pounds there's enough people on it now to say that it's you people here that formed the bulk of UNK e groups
erm that there are sufficient people active in the town they will come together and challenge those things
now erm the council can support such groups it can it can got formally decided the body to support such groups and with the west essex health action campaign all political parties on this council decided to support it because they were sad that we lost the fifty million
legally
erm and eh and we if the council also can provide supports for those groups and it's us that will provide the support and we leave it as general as that
but erm you know that's that is er a major part of our work
erm the other area which is it is just production and examination of information through leaflets public meetings and conferences
and that goes back to what i said earlier in that we just don't see ourselves working internally in meetings in negotiations and report binding with erm with other officer's we see ourselves as a UNK point to get in information out to people erm and working with people erm and that's erm again a major part of the work we do and just as an example of something that we provide this is erm this is the hidden divide the UNK of UNK anti poverty strategy group this is the latest edition and it's just an update on erm impact of eh living in britain in nineteen ninety one today the people who are on low income but we we've produced that quarterly erm but there we produce loads of leaflets were always producing leaflets and basically if there's a major piece of legislation there be there be something worth getting use on it
erm and then i just thought i'd finally conclude a bright cos i think it it's like how i see myself at work erm with showing you where our work comes from erm and basically you've got all these arrows coming in and er sometimes you do have a sense of feeling quite UNK with requests for work but the main i mean the main formal source of our work is the local government sub committee which is erm like mary was referring to earlier every department or unit in our in the council have to formally report and get it's work through by a council committee our committee is the local government sub committee and it formally sets our work programme once a year and i our priorities it also comes up with other things it would like us to do by the way during the course of the year so erm that includes mary as well
erm and then we get requests for things from the leader of the council directly that he wants us to respond to the chair of that committee to erm will do the same thing we'll get requests from other departments relating to our work some of which might of been you we erm the council has a group for the finance advisory group which is a small group of UNK and officer's that meet to discuss not in public session key erm financial and other major policy erm issues that and the reason why that group was set up erm was that it felt like with the introduction of poll tax and the local government housing and finance tax that it needed outside the committee cycle to erm review the impact of those legislation to look at it's finances more closely and what and we as a policy team report into that group and get request from work from that group as well
that group does have wider representation than just UNK it has er labour party representation on that group
we also get requests from work from the UNK review working party which is a working party that's erm basically looking to progress to the d m d UNK of UNK initiative
we do get work from individuals i said we have an open policy and people come through with problems that they've got because they know us and some we take up we try and be helpful and take up individual problems and then we have a two way relationship with community groups and last and not least we live across the corridor from the general manager and he's always flying in and giving us work as well
so erm that who we are what we do and how we get our work and i hope that been interesting for you
thank you
very nice
any questions
well actually there's one thing i've missed out which i said i'd come back to and that was the front line review that i referred to
because when i was thinking about trying to talking to you today i thought although we've worked quite a lot with people along this group you might be sitting here and thinking well you don't seem to be doing any specific work for and with old people erm well i think your quite independent and can work out your right that but one of the things this front line review erm it erm it's considering council front line services under various headings one of which is retired services that the council provide as a group now the leader of the council wants to erm get public views on how we look at these services so and that's individuals and groups and one of the things that you might like to think about and i'm that we as a local government unit who are servicing this review can help you with is to consider how you might want to fee in for that review erm and consider this that the re services for retired people that the council provides that you use and basically whether you use that or service we want to hear that the council would need to know that cos were gonna be making decisions about whether or not they should continue in this front line review erm and erm you know or what things you would what are your questions on about those services what other things you would like to see provided things like that and i thing this group could quite easily make a collective representation a collective submission to that process then you could do it as individual's as well so that exercise it should be over by the eleventh of october it starts on the sixth of september
is that the one that's being run upstairs by jean by the way
no
it's a different one is it
oh
this ones by er actually you are the first members of the public to know about it
oh
in fact you know about it ahead of most council staff i would say
i mean the communication strategy for this whole thing has got to be sorted out and you know we want the leader wants staff involvement public involvement in it erm and erm but i'm just telling you advance on what's gonna be told
fair enough
but erm that this is gonna be happening and you ought to have an input
i'm sure we will
if that's not positive chris
there was someone before in alex 's day that's a very long time ago
oh yeah
could easily do it again
it is a long time ago
can i say something about dear i don't know if your aware the against it now you see how much work they do you know keep it
well thank you
there's another thing i another thing i'd like to mention which chris hasn't mentioned this afternoon is that is that a lot of the UNK that you are handed out here generate from 's office copying and things like that all very helpful which would cost us a bomb outside and we get them free so you know they do help the pensioner a great deal that's why i said when she came in that's a lady i admire very much and respect cos she's very good to pensioners
you won't get one done through a government
i don't know
were talking about appreciate pensioners concerned about there pets
well i
now i understand that place making a small in the is that right
i don't know
it's just that next year it's under threat because of the cut backs
right
now i give this quite a strong point to bring up
right okay
what we've just decided chris actually
yep
the r s p c a more or less in this borough is erm
UNK
used to put animals to sleep they don't do much in the way of treatment what we want to do from this is press for erm a p d s a grant
right
which used to function at the stow
yeah
very successfully and we would were gonna petition for that
right that sounds good
well i'm actually gonna be the person servicing this return policy officer this retired services group so if you want to make it either a person to raise you want to get out
laughing
right i'll contact you
i know
yes UNK
UNK
i could UNK the sporting facilities for the pensioners
yeah
UNK
yeah
and i come in contact with people from other parts say erm
yeah
they all the harlow one of the best places they know
well that's useful to know because what important
do need that don't you
in this retire services
is you know is actually erm getting as much information we can about the people who are using the service and erm and making sure it stays making a case for it
also i mean one of the things that the council is considering doing i mean this interest i know that other people from around this area come into harlow one of the things that the council's thinking about is erm is charging or has debated charging different rates for people who are coming in than those who live here
that's right
i agree
as a way of income generating
don't know it's dodgy that
but eh
it's a double edge
you don't want to give people who are using the service as well
because it also brings us in money
er i think that's very dodgy
one does it one of the things that eh i don't know whether it does effect you at all chris but eh chris is the fact that eh these here foreign UNK they've got around the town now i'm dead against these for a number of reasons
for a number of reasons
the first and foremost most people don't like using them but secondly we've already paid for this service in our rates and taxes you know when we pay our rates though we pay for these toilets to be clean and all that sort of thing don't we
and yet they're bringing in these other things that er enormous cost which nobody wants and you've still gotta pay and if you haven't got one if you haven't got the necessary er coin then that could lead to very anti social behaviour
right so i mean this is
listen this is
this is something that's been on my mind for a very long time and i mean i think it's about time we started getting rid of these things and updating our own toilets you know
i mean
pauline said they're are a success
ah
who said there a success
pauline
perhaps i'll be unpopular here but in fact until you think of a way preventing UNK from UNK the toilets as you know i don't think there is nobody has come up with any other way of doing it
and that i mean i can't give you a but they are extremely well used you can tell by the that's been
oh
eh that's different from what i've heard
erm i mean it is a terrible problem
it's different to what i've heard very few i've met have
that that's been the only other way of doing it
perhaps you have to progress to have a toilet pass
no but i mean what i would say
er when we come down
what i would say is this there always there always talking about anti social behaviour around the town and as i say if people haven't got the necessary coin it could lead to anti social behaviour it's as simple as that
you know i mean surely that makes sense doesn't it
or am i talking like an UNK
no you're right
right
the toilet system could be better
yeah much better
all round
yeah and if it's bad lies well then that's the case for the for the body that deals with the police
we have a body that deals with police here and they should be doing there duties no good the local police tell us there's only eight members a shift cos we don't believe it they get on the council and so they someone say what about all these other places that are being UNK of a night time
you know and all old people's things like when they when we old pensioners were being er knocked about on the erm highways and UNK a couple of years back and i went to see the local police officer what did he turn round and say there all domestic affairs they didn't want to know yet the press will print these every week
here
stop right listen
though it's just that one of the things that caroline actually er working on with UNK university is a way of re looking at public services and how there funded right it's basically to help david to make the case with margaret for more money with the local government but erm i mean the sort of things we've been getting into is like when you considering paying for public services should you should you pay like in advance like through the national insurance system or like i mean the french health service for example people pay it for UNK when they use them though they pay on a differential rate but i mean it's an issue to debate it's right and i've just been thinking about UNK while you've been speaking
mm
and the thing is that when of the i haven't seen anywhere any kind of poll system you know i think it's a i've always thought it UNK as a women actually that women have had to pay for toilets and erm i mean if we you know if we might i mean i would be in favour of a system where you know you say a local council issues a pass which you pay for have differential rates but it's like people paying up front for that toilet service
mm
and you have some way of getting in erm and you have some way of controlling access therefore into toilets now i don't know whether that would totally it overcome the UNK system but i mean if your saying a pass wouldn't be any different than a coin you could devise an entrance so that it wasn't you know so that what you would be doing is stopping having like the total open access all the time you know erm
mm
but you know it's just a thought
it could be with modern electronics couldn't it
yeah
yeah
you know add a say a piece of plastic like the bar system they had on you know like a coded system
same as the banks for money
exactly although that don't mention that for goodness sake you'll be in dire trouble there
but i think
money out the same time
i think we shouldn't be having this kind of debate about public services
no but you see what i'm trying to get at eh chris we've already paid once for this service and then asking us to pay again which UNK me you've already paid for the system and there asking you to pay again
that's all part of the poll tax
that's what i said norman women have been doing it for a lot longer
your for ya
your paying twice for the same service
right has anybody got any
any further questions
any more comments about the local government unit
chris is in the hot seat
huh
on that question of the young people who were
this lady here
i only want to mention about the swimming pool and swimming for pensioners and there ever such a lot of people go swimming
yeah
i wanted to point out to you know we don't want it to happen
right okay
anything else
on that question
i've just moved into one of the new housing UNK
yeah
absolutely wonderful
right
it is really nice they need more
right alex
i wanna say on that question we were talking about earlier on about the young people and some facilities for them
yes
there was quite an appealing letter in er one of the local papers this week for a young person on this particular subject
er i saw between the sixteen to twenty year olds there's nowhere in the town where they can go and meet very easily other than the pubs this causes trouble
you see one of the things i've done i've done er i feel we could do quite easily is make our play UNK more accessible to young people you know
but i mean this is something that we
ah they're costly
though we've got to pursue with leisure well i think as part of this front line review we've got to you know throw everything up in the air
yeah
and say you know
it wouldn't be any bother to me if you
mm
wanted me to
well we'll do that i see what see says any rate on monday
but i don't think we should give her too long cos she's got herself into
mm
yes
yes
keep putting up we've had her for about two years haven't we
yes she did say last time one of her friends would like the job
oh god
oh no
she's told them how easy it is
she's told them what to do birds of a UNK
yeah
rose would you consider a man i've got an idea there might still be a possibility of mr
well i don't see why not if he if he did
some men are very good
mm
some men are very good we've got a good one at the church hall
pub next door i mean
mm
toilets and things there
that's right
yes i mean that would be very good
i think
i'll have words with sharon on monday and er oh i can't yes i can on monday i'm having my hair cut later but i can come up about nine o'clock and see if she's here
i bet she won't be
no i bet
she'll be in the penny UNK then
well i will then have to ring her won't i
mm
so will you all get round to your UNK please ladies
thank you all very much
thank you
UNK oh
okay if i could say good evening and welcome to the theatre this evening the reason the meeting has been UNK this evening quite clearly is part of the process and art structure for harlow having undertaken by the council the playhouse is keen as it says quite clearly on the leaflet is to get the UNK view on how best to plan this programme and it's and facilities for the future
it has been some debate er on the board and the management committee about the direction the theatre should be going into the nineteenth century twentieth century and i think and i and i think it's important that this meeting hopefully will be very constructive in the sense that is important that the theatre actually gets the views of people use the building and people actually come along and support the of the theatre
so i hope hopefully this evening will be a very constructive meeting and we'll certainly welcome your views about what you feel should be happening to the theatre or should be taken or should be taken place at the theatre what should be on at the theatre and er things that you feel that aren't happening at the moment
we did if i can give some background we did actually target er twelve thousand five hundred UNK shots for this meeting this evening i'm not sure what the people here are representing percentage for that and we also targeted over about a hundred organisations with mailing shots telling people the meetings on this evening
in my concern as chairman of the board was that er if very few people turned up then perhaps people might say that we didn't go around go about advertising it in the correct way what i think we actually did i'm not sure how many people are here this evening but i should think it's somewhere in the region of about hundred and hundred and fifty so i hope that the meeting this evening sort of cross representation people actually use facilities which the playhouse offers
can i just introduce people on the platform to you this evening
my na UNK tom and i'm chairman of the trust have roy who is chairman of the management committee ron is vice who who's vice chair of the board gordon i'm sure everyone knows is the general manager and john who is the company's secretary
there have been some hand outs as you come in hopefully you've actually picked them up on part of that hand out is a questionnaire towards the end which i hope everybody will find the time to fill in
there's no need to put your name and address if you er choose not to do but i think we will actually value your views on that questionnaire and certainly use those views in the coming months
so if i can open the meeting by saying that we obviously welcome questions this evening and points of view and i would like to open the meeting by asking quite clearly about how you er see best plan for the UNK theatre in future and how it's programme of facilities for the future should be UNK and planned
er mr chairman just a point for clarification the about the
when the previous meeting took place with the consultants
yes
i rather got the impression that they would take him er continue interest in what would happen i've got the impression they have a representative here to give their view of how it was er
this i think the UNK the council commissioned the partnership report and i
right yes
think the council had a time meeting to actually discuss that report with
yeah right yeah
the public
i think from that report there was a there was a requirement or request that perhaps the theatre should actually have a public meeting to talk about which way the theatre was going what things were going on at the theatre and that's what the meeting is for this evening
yeah but i thought they
the meeting sorry the meeting this evening is quite clearly is to talk about get your views on how best to plan the programmes for the facilities for the future
yes but if there is i thought if one of their representatives was gonna be here just to answer questions about their views
no
don't you think that'd be useful
sorry
don't you think that'd be useful
no i think this is board meeting and as a board i think were interested to get your points of view what isn't taken place that you'd liked to take place and what you'd like to see in the future well and that's why the meetings been UNK
yes you do have four other colleagues on the side
because their also board members
oh i see okay
okay
thank you
can i just ask the other question perhaps which is relevant when people do make a contribution if they actually identify themselves so that may be useful if actually know who people are representing themselves or representing an organisation
chair my name's pete from UNK i'm here as a member of the public i'm not here to speak on behalf of the theatre at all
i might have something to say later on in the meeting but i thought that people should be aware that there is a continuing interest from UNK in the UNK of an art structure within harlow and i am here taking notes of people's comments thank you
thank you
okay
can we get into the meeting
sorry go on sorry go on
i'd like to start off by saying i
could i have your name please
sorry
yes kenneth er i've just finished managing relate
i think i just represent myself
i i've been coming here for forty years so far and UNK statement i think in your programme this autumn is the best that you've had for years it's a very good combination of classical and modern plays and i really congratulate you on this programme and i would like to see that standard maintained
well thank you for that that's a very good start to the evening
thank you
jan erm i've just recently started a job as a drama teacher and i must say there isn't actually anything in the programme that's actually on my a level syllabus for drama and i think it might be something er it a help to schools if maybe there was a play put on specifically schools to come and see i think to comment on
i just say that i'm sorry go on don't want to be UNK this evening but i mean minutes will be taken notes will be taken points have been raised i think that's a very valuable point that you've actually have raised
can we can we can we find out from the teacher whether in fact the school actually gets a our information leaflet
UNK is a it isn't actually a erm a new school it's UNK high school it used to be margaret UNK which has been established a few years but UNK just been started for a year erm it has is some information but obviously there haven't been any feedback from the school so i starts there
chair can you ask people to speak up
a lot of people have very soft voices
you haven't bill
john
i wanna put this er question of what this playhouse is about a back to a stage to the platform because i think that's where it belongs er were here to criticize but not to UNK
er many of us remember gordon in the sixties working with a small group to get this place built thirty years on does he feel the playhouse is doing what he then hoped for and if not what are the things that have changed it
none but it's thirty years on
i'm one of the original directors of the theatre and er mr chairman what worries me is this
i think we have to face facts first fact is the priority of the board must at this time be survival
financial survival
er if you couple that with the action of eastern arts who i understand have cut the subsidy er for this er theatre i think that's correct erm as i understand on the grounds that a not enough they mean UNK or progressive which to me means weird play to put on
er couple the two together they don't really make sense because this type of experimental theatre never pays can't pay
er in my opinion at this particular time we must bear in mind the financial constraints that we work under and er would the board agree with me that erm survival comes first yes but it's obvious that the programme that we've er had put forward is a good compromise between preferred in the arts maintaining the theatre as a viable proposition and er entertaining the people of this particular part of the world because as i understand it this theatre was not just the artist also an entertainment centre and it's in this area that er it's quite obvious when you look into the figures on this area the popular area that the majority income comes so you'll have to make a compromise and i will congratulate the board on what i think is pretty reasonable compromise so it's quite obvious in the programme
at the back i can't
tom i'm just a UNK represent nobody
i come to theatre regularly i agree with my friend over there i think you have a very good programme quite mixed not all my taste but it's representative of the UNK of the people who want to come
unfortunately with got to get some of those people who don't want to come and it's all about UNK on seats it's the old saying UNK on seats we've got to get an answer how we don't get to these here at the moment in the audience whether they are people who want to get UNK on seats or how they know how to do it perhaps they should have a meeting like this every month i've never seen so many of
i'll give you my fee later
seriously though we've got to get people into this theatre on a more regular basis
a few years ago i saw a couple of UNK stars come in erm and ross whatever his name forget his name there were two young girls standing in front of me UNK pennies out of their purse to get in though we loved that character they wanted to come that night we've got to get girls like that youngsters like that interested to come on other nights and then come again that's what needs doing
keith
erm representing myself
i think i agree with the gentleman over there i think the youth of this particular town who on average spends somewhere in the region of fifteen and twenty pounds a week going to UNK and going to pubs erm you need the attraction to the theatre
how that's done i don't know how do we reach these people there's a broad sheet that goes to the school's am i right jan
i wouldn't know actually keith at the moment
i'm sure there is though
yes there is to all of them
erm can i ask how that's funded first of all is that funded through is that funded through the council
it's currently funded chair by er b p and we're very grateful for them
okay is that do we know if that funding is going to continue
perhaps we sort through this original question we can pick up on that
okay
about how many copies where they've actually gone that is some that is sent out to all school's and quite considerable numbers are sent out
what's the actual figures on that gordon
published three times a year and a thousand copies and distributed to all school's within a very wide area through the education authority
do we get a feedback from school's at all
yes we do quite considerably through the
and that i presume that the feedback is analyzed and decided from maybe as to the content of what goes on in studio and also on the main stage
sort of a sort of er points jan made
really it would be nice of we to have a level plays so a level student could come and see
but that has been in the past and that was a thing that we had for several years had a level plays actually on the stage am i correct
i think i am
i'm sorry i can't erm
as far as the as far as a level as far as a level plays are concerned i think with had them on the stage before now over the last five ten years as far as i'm concerned
one of the problems is of course is finding the product available
do you not got to the school's for suggestions
well yes of course
you do
we know what we know what plays
mike just a point of information i have been teaching in harlow for twenty years and i've never been asked by anybody at the playhouse what UNK who's like to see in my school
my name is UNK
we used to come to the theatre once a week but since the UNK of the money UNK two for the price of one scheme with only come really twice a season
i think it's great shame that were not able to come more often now but i don't think that the replacement scheme is really a replacement cos it relies on you getting the most expensive seats i would rather see lots of things cheaply rather than just one or two things more UNK it also doesn't include studio theatre many of the UNK i think are excellent and there's no advantage there
here
paul erm involved in a number of erm in a number of amateur companies apparently working as a casual member of staff
i have one question which relates to the article double page article in this weeks harlow star
er that is that at least three of the articles are talking to quoting different organisations er suggested that the playhouse theatre trust had been recommended to do something about their marketing er a at least two years ago if not longer ago erm certainly it's my knowledge er they have not employed specialists to that they have not employed a specialist to that indeed since the last er appointed publicity officer left that person that post has not been er UNK er could i ask the theatre trust why they have chosen not taken that recommendation seriously
i think as far as market is concerned we have sort of taken certain steps as far as the marketing is i mean the UNK of ticket system gives us a much greater insight on marketing now cos you can actually see what people come to see and we can by the ticket that's actually sold and we can actually target people direct
and i think that the last year has actually improved the attendance at the theatre because do that
as far as employment of the ma marketing consultant or marketing persons concerned the actual costing of that has worked out something like between six sixteen and twenty thousand pounds now we've gone through a very difficult financial stage like many other organisations and many other theatres
at particular market in time whilst we agree as the board that we should employ someone and we intend to employ someone we just think at this particular moment in time it is very difficult for us to actually raise that sort of money on a regular basis
as soon as our financial situation has UNK we'll certainly employ someone
but it isn't true to say i'd certainly say it isn't true to say that making the recommendations of our market have been slightly up recommendation in UNK
the one that hasn't been in fact to employ somebody particularly perhaps to go out the market theatre but this particular mark in time it's been very difficult for a theatre to actually find twenty thousand this financial year in fact we had to find seventy thousand pound cuts that was a very difficult exercise so the answer to your question is we accept that recommendation and as soon as the finance is available we intend to employ somebody to take on that task
is now
well if it's a question yeah
