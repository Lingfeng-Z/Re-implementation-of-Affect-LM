hello dennis my name's UNK
yes
now i work as a care assistant in a nursing home at UNK nursing home
th UNK near mansfield
yes
yes
and we are desperate to have a piano
why
well we do lots of activities with our residents and they love sing UNK but unfortunately we haven't our own piano
have you never had one
no
well yo they sa you kn what they say
what you've never had you'll never miss
but we are missing it
are you
we've got a nurse er a trained nurse er she does play the piano and she's quite willing to play for us if only we can get a piano UNK
well i mean you see
erm
lo i've got this big problem really about people like you coming on asking for UNK
very often
what's the matter
why
who's UNK you
nobody
oh
it sounds like you wish they were
mm
no i've got this big problem you see because very often UNK are at the centre of UNK
now if you have an UNK there i could get the blame for this
oh
do you have many UNK there
well
don't put it to the customers don't put it to your clients cos they'll say we want one
well th they might well do
yes
but you know i mean our oldest resident is a hundred and two
makes no difference love
you know so he h
never
might well enjoy a good UNK and a massage
i beg your pardon
but i d i'm not quite sure if UNK
oh hang on hang on
oh my UNK standing up at the back of my neck
i only y well you see the romans did have a word you know they had a phrase have you heard about that roman phrase
no i've not
you're never
i'm sure you'll tell me
you're never too old for an UNK
now
oh

right
it can
it can sort of UNK
yeah
ah but you don't want an UNK there do you
oh i don't know
oh
i could ask
think of the local think of the and what it would say if you had an UNK
oh
well i bet we'd make front page wouldn't we
you would make front page of the
yeah we would
you would indeed
yeah
i don't mean
UNK love are you sure you want a piano
yes we definitely ne need a piano
now the all important thing about a piano is apart from the fact that it t can be at the centre of an UNK the important thing is that are you able to collect it
well yes we could

you know that
erm well i think you'd have to make do with twenty four strong care assistants

it does not matter what says here today you have a job at this moment in time i'm asking them to stay in the pits and fight for the right to work those pits
they're profitable pits and they're well worth keeping open
a nottingham police inspector has been telling an UNK about the last time he saw his teenage daughter alive

earlier the court had been shown a quantity of bricks and stones some of which were said to be UNK and a heavy iron bar

superintendent jim from mansfield mines rescue service says it's a touching gesture
it's what the job's all about er and they are professionals and this is the work they're trained for
but little things like this mean a an awful lot to them
erm it's what it's all about basically
cos presumably they don't expect anything like this they're just doing their work
they don't
and that's what makes it even nicer because er it's recognition from outside of the people that pay their wages of the job they're doing and er they're very grateful for it

mm
then the policeman come on and said is that your dog

tonight business angels the private investors who've made millions by backing risk and innovation in partnership with britain's small UNK
i think i do it because i'm so depressed by the poor performance of professional investment managers in the city and i hope i can do better than they can
then challenge from the north why tough talking yorkshire lawyers believe they can take the UNK legal world by storm
and in UNK popular at home but not abroad
can the british television industry export more
there are some unusual partnerships being struck throughout the length and UNK of the country
the success of these new relationships could affect britain's future prosperity
we have come together to witness the marriage of business angel david pounds sterling and small business
some UNK believe their potential is enormous
david pound sterling will you take to be your wife
as a way of life
of course UNK like this aren't real but the rational behind them is
rich investors UNK up prospective business opportunities are being helped UNK agencies
they've been specially set up to try and ensure a more secure future for britain's small companies
there are a growing number of private investors known as business angels and small businesses
they say the relationship is just like a marriage
now everyone the government the bank of england the c b i and others are investigating business angels as one alternative way of funding small companies
the UNK in interest in how small businesses are funded reflects growing concern that they've been let down by the banks and the realization that they are the most significant source of employment as the country UNK to emerge from the recession
this company began searching for finance four years ago
colin came up with the idea for an environmental action UNK for children's television
they spent four hundred thousand pounds
a further quarter of a million is needed if the company is to survive
colin feels the traditional UNK can't see the future potential of the environment concept
i mean we're a typical case we believe we have something that is UNK innovative and capable of UNK financially in a global market place
it was very difficult to get the venture UNK and the bankers to take it seriously
i think that's a UNK state of affairs and their children and their children's children are going to have to pay the price for the short UNK that's going on now in the UNK towers of the of the city the banking institutions and the financial institutions of the country
the UNK are UNK of the presentation circuit
is just one of band of companies around the country presenting their business plans to private investors
here in UNK business men are UNK waiting to meet the business angels is whom hands the future of their company might rest
they're UNK by experts from one of five government sponsored projects around britain
advise small businesses and link them up with private investors
you're different you're dynamic let it come across a bit more about you and you know what a good team you are and you've cracked it
try and relax a bit you know have a drink at lunchtime even
and just let it come out a bit more
arriving as UNK as you'd expect from the seriously wealthy business angels pump money into private companies in return for shares
angels already invest between two and four billion pounds in britain's small businesses
the potential could be up top three times as much
hi ron how're you doing
i'm okay look big
the directors have developed a UNK routine to hammer home their message
property development scheme that i'm involved with i think you should look at it
well that's interesting but there's a couple of ideas i'd like to run in front of you
fire away old boy seeing as it's you
what do you know about the music industry
no
high risk no money in music colin
i got this great group super song just listen to these UNK
she loves you yeah
she loves you yeah
with a love like that you know it can't be bad
what do you think of it ron
no definitely not that'll never sell
whoever wrote the UNK to that should be locked up for an UNK to the english language
for companies like UNK to investors has become virtually a full time job
that's better
thank you ladies and gentlemen for i hope what was a little bit of humour in this long afternoon er to make a very serious point
we've been developing
they know their survival depends on how well they impress
after a long day of presentations the angels and the businessmen finally get together in the traditional way
after all the hard work the businesses put in were the angels impressed
well we had eight different presentations er i UNK i suppose to two of them erm was a small engineering company in the motor trade which while it will never make a fortune will probably make a living and the people seem to need help
the angels are drawn from all sections of the community
some are UNK educated former merchant bankers others came up from the shop floor but they all have some things in common
they like making money they like being involved in business and they love a challenge
i'm a manufacturer i like to make things i like to hold something at the end of day and say that's something that's been created
er at the same time i'm looking for the chemistry er the feel for those people er the quality of those people and whether i could work with them and whether they could work with me
how britain's small businesses are funded was discussed at a recent national conference of the institute of directors
its director general peter believes that they are vital to britain's prosperity and employment prospects
there are three million companies in britain of which only a thousand employ more than a thousand employees
we all know that job creation comes form the small and medium company sector
it is perhaps not totally UNK that there are three million unemployed and three million companies and er you could do the arithmetic about what would happen if every company took on one person
some thing has to be
the i o d UNK three hundred small companies the results exclusively revealed to the money programme show a severe funding shortage for business start ups
problems too for companies expanding
there's a lack of funding for schemes between fifty and two hundred and fifty thousand pounds or even half a million
people sometimes think that capitalism means stock markets and share holders and what have you
but the most pure expression of capital capitalism is the UNK of private money to start private businesses and a main concern of the institute of course is that there is such a shortage potentially of capital in the system to do that
this UNK country scene is close to the UNK home of sir john a UNK business graduate he's one of britain's most successful business angels
twelve years ago he invested twenty three thousand pounds in a small local company
it's now worth two and a half million
the company sir john bought a fifty percent share in was it's an engineering firm that produces mechanical devices that help to clear storage UNK
in its first year turnover was a modest forty thousand pounds it's now twelve million
but the success story might never have happened if the UNK with the idea UNK had taken the advice of his bank
yeah
did a little business plan cash flow forecasts and all that kind of stuff er basic but erm in hindsight still quite UNK i th i think
and i took it to my bank manager who i'd been with for god knows all my life so nearly twenty years and er he just laughed me straight out of the room
straight off
d don b don't be silly go and get a job you know
er h he didn't even look at it
what do you feel about banks do you think they know enough about business when it comes down to it
oh
i hope my bank manager isn't watching this
no i think they know nothing at all about business
i think they erm kid themselves on that they do because they understand figures and money and that isn't business
is this an are where you agree er sir john or not
yes i do i think the UNK big mistake is their UNK with security cover erm and i think they ought to develop some expertise in judgement of people's management and UNK abilities
and in recognizing the potential of a good business
the midland bank is one of britain's biggest
in the eighties banks fell over themselves to lend money
last year bad debts cost a million pounds a day
UNK chief executive brain UNK the problem
we are risk UNK at the moment because we have suffered as you rightly say er so much from bad debts during the recession
er but in certainly in the case of our bank er we are most anxious to at least get people in through the door and see if we can find solutions to their problems find ways of er developing smaller businesses erm hopefully to reduce the massive unemployment figure that we have in this country
a restaurant in fashionable UNK
is everything alright
it's absolutely excellent
a public relations company is entertaining its clients
there's an old saying that there's not such thing as a free lunch but this is about as close as you can get
no money changes hands here
but there's still a bill to be settle
thank you very much sir did you enjoy your meal
it was absolutely excellent
the company pays using a UNK card
it's an updated version of the ancient trade of UNK goods
this is where that trade is organized the UNK exchange in central london
erm we've got various requests for mobile phones
we need a restaurant for erm a working breakfast
UNK flights to UNK
yes we've got er erm eight economy flights
we're after four colour printers
the organize the exchange of goods
many companies have spare capacity
UNK enables them to swap it for other things they need without paying
UNK cash flow problems facing companies financed by bank UNK
this is a problem that the institute of directors has outlined in its survey
seventy one percent of companies go directly to banks as there first source of financed
but what concerns the i o d is the type of funding the get
sixty four percent of small businesses are on either UNK or short term loans
that says the i o d makes them vulnerable to economic down turns
the key issue that UNK is that many private companies don't actually want what they ought to have which is more long term loans and more private equity and less UNK and their short term loans
i think to an extent the bank have in helped small businesses to make this mistake
it has been much easier to give an UNK than to go through the whole process of studying a plan for the business and coming up with longer term loan financing
okay steve can you talk me through the part of manchester visit in the afternoon
the government is so concerned about the financing of small businesses that anthony economic secretary to the treasury is in charge of a working party examining the issue
he's concerned that banking attitudes may be holding up the recovery
i do believe that one of the best ways we're going to benefit from the new circumstances i hope of economic stability of low inflation and low taxation will be to ensure that the provision of capital is made by the principle institutions namely the banks and the investing institutions
so i expect to see er improvements in confidence backed by greater provision and i like to see that directed at the venture capital risk capital long term capital
rather than the in and out sort of capital which i think is reflected so much by UNK financing
this man john is the managing director of reading based electronics firm
he's got good reason to thank the midland bank
now he makes a point of keeping in touch with his local branch
we're concentrating on the security market place and we've acquired i think three
when his company was in trouble the bank UNK his debt for shares
we are quite keen to look at equity options debt equity UNK er perhaps talk a to the government about an extension of the business expansion scheme specifically into manufacturing industry er and generally look for innovative solutions persuade to customers to take loans out instead of UNK
er fix their interest rates over a longer term period
that's not always attractive cos initially that's more expensive for them but er they ha they have to er come to us with an open mind as well
back at the board of directors are meeting
for sir john and UNK bank funding isn't on the agenda
but sir john is as interested in how the company's money is spent as any bank manager
why are you using an agency rather than advertising in name
cos you've got to pay the agent a fee for finding it for you
as both company chairman and business angel sir john plays an active role
he and UNK are equal partners
the fifty percent share holding has worked well because what it means no one person can impose their will no one has control you have to resolve problems by agreement resolve UNK without coming to UNK
angels don't always work miracles this UNK farm house was where mike n hoped to build a successful UNK business
UNK it for the first time he UNK his high hopes when an angel with marketing skills appeared
but mike was forced to sell out when the angel wasn't up to the job
even though we had explained to him in a small business initially he was going to be the salesman he was going to be the marketing director he was going to be everything
it still hadn't really UNK through to him until he was actually on the ground working and he just really couldn't cope with that
the business that mike began has now transferred to new premises it no longer makes UNK but apple juice
the new owner is lawrence he shares mike 's reservations about business angels
a business relies on a driving personality taking it forward and the confusion about getting somebody on board who is working with you in the business and who is putting money board is that they feel to some extent UNK to that business and you can find that will result in those individuals who have done that UNK apart the business because they are trying to go in different directions
at the moment there are a number of publications such as link capital exchange venture capital report which try to put investors and companies in touch with each other
the government and the banks are considering setting up a national data system of business angels it would probably have to be government funded
who are your
the organization with the longest track record in matching angels to companies is the UNK of venture capital report
b c r executive UNK is sceptical about the UNK sudden UNK of angels
in terms of their they the core business they are UNK on medium size businesses so they need to ensure that in the future that there will be businesses there er t er to be their clients so i think er it's a sort of enlightened self interest
and er as they're not in the business of providing risk capital they have to find er some poor UNK or UNK to do so and i think this is why increased attention is being focused on business angels as a source
are the banks simply though trying to shift responsibility so you think erm i think that the UNK in me would say that they are trying to UNK a certain amount of responsibility
i think their is a problem with the first two or three years of a UNK life
it's the most difficult time it's full of UNK they're growing er they need finance that they haven't quite thought about there are UNK during that period
so there undoubtedly a temptation to think well let's not bother about that let's pick them up when they are two years old and they've survived this particularly UNK first period
but in my view that's quite UNK
what we ha if we don't support them during that period how on earth do we get them to be two years old
UNK bank has carried out its own research into small business
david says funding problems have been over UNK
the real issue he says is skills
well our research has shown that something like eighty percent of all small UNK don't undertake any formal training within their first three years of operation and more than sixty percent do not do any formal business planning or look further ahead than one month from today
the effect is that the survival rate of small businesses is significantly UNK affected by this
nobody's called in
okay
mike now travels the country as a consultant to small companies
the lessons he's learnt he did so the hard way
he agrees that skills inside small companies have to improve
the man is very good at making UNK he makes UNK but he doesn't tell his bank that he's doing well
the bank automatically thinks he's doing badly because they don't hear anything from him
so it's a matter of keeping the bank advised the whole time
perhaps mike business would have survived with a tax incentive to put money in
the idea appeals to his clients
research by UNK bank suggest companies do favour tax breaks
one idea that were quite attracted to er would be the formation of a business tessa
this could operate rather like a personal tessa and would be a er tax free savings account which would allow a small business to save for a perhaps a major piece of machinery in a tax free environment
the i o d also believe that there must be tax incentives to invest in britain's small businesses but they'd like to see them extended to include the general public
we can all go and invest in UNK we can all go and invest in pension plans and all of that gets taken by the institutions and put into the stock market
what we need is equal incentives to take our money and put that money into private companies
so i we would like to see erm tax incentives for investment in the equity of UNK companies and we'd also like to see gains tax incentives for the realization of those investments a when they pay it off
but tax breaks are outside the remit of the governments working party
not surprising considering government's fifty billion pound public borrowing requirement
if you're urging the case for tax breaks again then i think that's all too easy and tha that is not what i am advertising or seeking representations for
of course there will be calls for that
i want to look much more generally at the supply side at the provision of capital
the UNK of capital
this is much more about the structural provision of finance it is about the understanding by financial institution of the businesses they back
i think you'll like this place actually er
whilst there's a lot of talk about how to help small businesses the angels and their advisors are out there doing it
this company of ex roll UNK workers has had five offers of finance and is in the UNK position of choosing the partner that suits them
on the back of their expected thirty thousand pound cash injection they've already taken on extra staff
for this successful local experiment to have national implications there has to be a fundamental shift in attitudes
the small companies themselves have got to understand what they need to grow is long term financing and that's cash in the business
for the finance community what they've got to do too is take a longer term view about projects and give the companies an opportunity to grow and ride the UNK and the UNK and UNK
if the marriage between small businesses and UNK is to have a happy ending the couple need more than a UNK hand from a few UNK dedicated to their cause
the business angels can't do it all themselves
they need the support of the government
the banks too must get involved and everyone needs to work together because if the marriage proves to be a UNK one it will affect the wealth of the nation for generations to come
good morning everyone
i think we have nearly a full house but there may be one or two more people to come
erm taking part within the presentation this morning ah are frank who is the fr managing director of UNK and james er who's the finance director
er we're going to take questions at the end er the camera there is for internal use only and at the end we'll hand out copies of the slides to anyone who wants them
our profits are UNK small in relation to er the er first half of last year er then we had UNK conditions and we made more money than we ever had before
recession had already promised a slow start to this year er but in january when worry about the gulf actually gave way to the war itself erm the trading climate which was already weak erm UNK still further
er consumer confidence fell away and u k consumers kept more of their cash in their pockets er in fact erm they saved over two and a half billion pounds more in the first quarter of ninety one than they had in the same er quarter of last year
one immediate casualty of the change in conditions was advertising
recruitment UNK advertising for example virtually ground to a halt as businesses started to shed er people rather than to look for them
so what happened to our trading profit
in this analysis er if you set aside the effect of our sale of UNK er the variance was forty nine million seventy percent of which relates to the u k the drop in profits from our newspapers was the biggest and probably the most widely expected a substantial proportion of their costs are fixed and er they therefore are particularly sensitive to er changes in volume
fine china and investment banking inevitably er suffered from the economic conditions so did entertainment er which also brought two extra UNK er firstly the er marked reduction in tourism and er for the first time a three and a half million pound er bill for alton UNK loss making winter quarter which i think we we've UNK er quite consistently
after newspapers books showed the largest decline er and the fifteen million variance is shared roughly one fifth by addison wesley and two fifths UNK by penguin and longman
two of the UNK characteristics of these businesses are first that like newspapers a high proportion of their costs are fixed and secondly unlike newspapers er their main selling season is in the second half of the year
outside UNK erm specialists books er markets er book sales have been almost UNK slow there were very high returns as book sellers everywhere UNK to reduced er demand by replacing or winding down their stock
this particularly affected penguin substantially increasing its spec i its expected first half loss
penguin also incurred losses of two million on UNK its american remainder book businesses er before selling it
longman the least UNK biased of the three UNK to break even in the first half and this removed the normal pattern of UNK half year profits helping to offset the first half losses of the other two businesses but before we get too depressed er i point out that addison wesley s sales were up by eleven percent and the size of the first half loss reflects the company's decision to gear up in advance er for what we w believe will be a very strong er second er half performance
er overall i think it's right to say that we're disappointed by these results but we're not UNK
all of our businesses have maintained or improved their market shares as managers we concentrate on the full year rather on either half and because of our seasonal bias er those of you who've been er to our interim presentations before er will remember that without fail i tell you our results at the half way stage are not a clear guide to the outcome of the year as a whole
the major part of our profits are made in the second half er and this year er will certainly be no exception
to underline the point i thought i'd show you this four year average one thing that the exercise shows is that between them our book entertainment and fine china businesses normally account for about seven percent of UNK annual profit in their first half and for about thirty three percent of our profit in the full year
this year their net first half contribution was negative which will strongly UNK the seasonal bias towards the second half er conditions will still be far from ideal but with the gulf factor out of the way and some visible improvement in our overseas markets particularly north america we think the trading environment will be broadly equivalent to that of the second half of last year
now er before i hand over to frank er a word about the dividend er in recent years we've paid an interim dividend which was half the total of the previous year's dividends and so er had a built in increase
this year we thought it right to reserve our judgment er until the end of the year so we matched last year's interim
frank
well as michael says we're not proud of the results er and we're not going to try and dress them up michael hasn't tried to do that and i certainly don't intend to
but nevertheless i do want to er bring home to you the underlying strength of our businesses there's no question we're very UNK very well faced for an UNK
but before doing that er you may reasonably ask what action we've taken er during this year when it's been such a difficult year
do you remember at the announcement of last year's results we erm we mentioned that we were concentrating on four themes one's cost reduction er driving for cash erm improving our market share and investing for the future
starting with cost reduction any cost reduction programme always involves a lot of redundancy and this is no exception and from the slide you'll see that we've er we've had a staff reduction er from the plan for this year of one thousand and thirty three er and that's the that will save us in a full year something like fifteen point nine sixteen million pounds
this year er there's been a negative benefit in the first half of two million and there'll be a positive benefit in the second half of two million
incidentally it doesn't include the disposal of UNK we've also er we've also gone in for other cost reduction exercises for instance at er UNK with a review of UNK and distribution er we should save about a million pounds in a full year and we've been UNK home to our chief executives the need for annual payroll reviews to be geared to the profitability of the company rather than t rather than to the rate of inflation er or even er in even the market place
driving for cash er well an indication of how strongly we we've been driving for cash is that er the reduction i in er operating cash flow is less than the reduction in profit
we've been telling our chief executives that even though you can't get the sales then at least try to work on your working capital try and get your working capital er ratio down
and there's been quite a bit of success in that area both of the newspaper companies er are doing better than last year and er longmans for instance expect er expect their operating cash flow erm their working capital rather to be lower this year than last year by year end
erm improving market share well all of our businesses have improved their market share during this recession and i'll mention them as i go through the individual companies
investing for the future although we've been keen to drive for cash er we really wanted to use the benefit of having a strong balance sheet and so where investment has seemed sensible and sound we've made those investments of course we've put er cash in the b sky b er and we've also invested further in the er spanish group the UNK group taking our stake in expansion adding some cash and getting a stake in the bigger grouping
if we look at the individual businesses there we er see the individual profits
if we start with the financial times well by their standards it's not a good result er but again let's get it in context the UNK trading margin is just under ten percent it's er it's about nine point six percent er and on the circulation front they've done well in market share terms where we've marginally improved our market share in the quality market
er in europe we've gone up six percent in circulation and in japan we're on target there and under budget
in advertisement er in the advertisement volume area again we've increased our market share amongst the qu er quality UNK a marginal increase er but it's nationally we've done very well and for instance in europe we're sixteen percent head ahead of last year in volume and revenue terms
on the cost side apart from the redundancies i mentioned well including the redundancies i mentioned er the non volume related costs are only three percent ahead of the previous year
east india dock is now er virtually fully UNK printing the UNK papers in the daytime and the financial times at night and the observer on saturday night and we've got high hopes of getting the contract to print the japanese er european edition of the japanese daily and that will fill the morning slot so that really will be er great UNK of that er installation
has been affected on the revenue front mainly in the medical publishing but to some extent in the erm in the financial sector although we're still absolutely market dominant in that sector but we've increased the circulation there by ten percent
the f t magazines have all increased their market share and profile our electronic er erm information business has grown in revenue terms by twelve percent
turning to westminster press the cost westminster press in a full year er will amount to three point eight million pounds and er
all of our paid UNK have er done very well this year in circulation terms all but two of them have increased their circulation in the first half despite quite high price rises for instance the york county newspaper the weekly there we have a daily but the weekly there went up by five p and the weekly in bath where again we have a daily that went up by six p
and every single westminster press centre has increased its market share
turning to er books and starting with longman
well there as i mentioned a staff reduction of a hundred and ninety two and significant er staff UNK er cost reduction in other areas we analyze every single er publishing unit and where the erm where they were marginally profitable or less than marginally profitable er we've taken appropriate action
and as i mentioned earlier longman expect the cash flow this year to be better than last year despite the reduction in profits
last year i told you UNK er was receiving the treatment
this year it's on profit on budget at the half way stage and i expect it to be on budget by the end of the year
we mentioned a small acquisition in japan last year UNK on the medical side of longman p s k it cost us about four million pounds and we were UNK on a profit of about half a million a year pleased to say that its er its profit looks like getting to a million pounds by the year end
and english language teaching at longman which is of course the biggest er biggest profit UNK erm their UNK sale is expected to exceed nine hundred thousand this year
addison wesley our american college UNK as michael mentioned th at the half way stage their sales were eleven percent ahead of er last year and you may remember last year they had record sales and record profits and er they're UNK er something like fourteen percent a head by the year end in sales terms and they are expecting to maintain their margins and last year was a very good margin indeed
once again there's been great emphasis on cash maintenance
penguin the staff reduction there doesn't look particularly er high but then we were reducing staff there last year and we've er we've UNK of UNK and the travel guides er the warehouse and distribution system is working very well and we've been adding UNK distribution clients there er the autumn list looks very strong indeed particularly in the u s especially and er we've shipped er over two million of stephen king's latest book and there's another one due in the autumn and we're expecting to ship about two and a half million of er of that one
er in the u k we've held our market position and it's been a pretty desperate market we were one of the few if not the only book UNK who refused to er to yield better discount terms er on the threat of er every book UNK was every er UNK was threatened with erm not being UNK unless we gave bigger discounts
we held our position against that and i'm pleased to say er we will continue we will continue to be UNK
er our distribution system has got great press recently and it's regarded as one of the three best distribution systems in the u k one of the things we're trying to do is to pay less for our books it's very easy to pay very fancy prices for er mid range authors and for them not to earn out so we're looking for much cheaper books
a good example is dances with wolves which cost us four thousand as a and has already sold over a hundred and twenty thousand copies
penguin continues to try and develop its UNK and is quite successful and the latest success is to get the flower UNK adopted by marks and spencers for their UNK range which will also be UNK in the u s a as well
federal and capital is a small er but high quality er new er newsletter business in the states and er it's done very well indeed to improve its profits
on the UNK side er last year of course we had that one off benefit with not having to absorb the first UNK loss and this year the er first quarter was pretty disastrous because we had an er an er amalgamation of a the gulf war b the recession and in london i r a bombing and that really stopped tourists coming to london from overseas and from the rest of the u k but i'm pleased to say that er we we're coming back very strongly and for instance in july at virtually all of our centres attendances were either up to last year very UNK very nearly up to last year or ahead of last year and er at UNK our revenue was thirteen and a half percent up on last year which i think justifies our investment there
some of our competitors in the north have been er really struggling and erm offering four pounds off on a seven pound fifty entrance fee so bearing that in mind we're v very confident that we've im improved our market share in that area too
we opened our amsterdam our new exhibition in amsterdam in june and er up to now audiences have UNK there many weeks they've been thirty percent ahead of er ahead of budget
moving on to b sky b well it's making excellent progress by the end of july we had over two point three million homes connected and over half of those are UNK to one or two movie channels
costs are well down and will continue to fall and i'm more confident than ever that we're on to a winner
if we move to oil well our oil business obviously operates in a cycle different to our publishing businesses and er at the end of the first half it had record sales and profits fifteen percent ahead in dollar terms ten percent ahead in sterling terms which may surprise you slightly but i think james probably will talk about that later
this is a particularly good performance specially in the u s a where there's been a very serious UNK in natural gas
we've increased our market shares virtually everywhere er two very strong er improvements UNK and UNK and the initiative we've taken with the UNK to UNK their wells er should be UNK by the end of the year and we're hoping that may lead to other opportunities er both in russia and er and there's the possibility from that of some business in eastern europe as well
investment banking although this year it's a very different difficult environment for investment banking particularly a house that UNK on corporate finance er there hasn't been a great deal of m and a activity and if there has it hasn't been a very high erm very high ticket
er but there have been a lot of issues and we've done well in that field but of course it doesn't produce the same kind of fee income as the m and a activity
UNK new york managed to maintain their figures of last year in dollar terms and if we take the UNK houses as a whole we're second only to UNK now in the erm in the m and a table internationally and that's on the value of bids on which we've advised
fine china we had a very poor first four months but then in may world sales were nine point nine percent ahead of last year and in the u s a over the last ten weeks we've actually been ahead of nineteen ninety
one factor in this is our exporting the very successful bridal collection that we developed in the u k we've UNK that to canada and the u s and that's gone down very well indeed
we've also had significant growth in our chain store business in this country we've signed a new two year contract with air canada and we're much more optimistic about the rest of the year we've got orders production and sales all nicely in equilibrium ready for the second half
now i'll pass you to er james
i'd just like to make two or three points first of all the exchange factor which frank touched upon when talking about profits you probably all totally familiar but i have forgotten quite how much the dollar has UNK recently beginning of the year it was nearly two dollars and the result of that is that for the erm first half as a whole the impact of er exchange translation was adverse for our profits compared with last year to the tune of about one and a half million pounds
it's not enormous but it's perhaps er not the way people er were thinking
now the consequence of the fact that the dollar end of june er relatively strong at around one sixty of course did UNK on er our er UNK since we do have a considerable percentage of our gross in dollar terms and if we turn to the next slide er we can see er the summary of the balance sheet at thirtieth of june
now you'll be familiar with the fact since we went through it in april that there has been a sharp jump in our known assets brought about by the sale of UNK and the fact that it had a very substantially written down value in our books seventy five million pounds
so you've had a sharp increase in our UNK funds during the six months and a reduction in our net debt which may not be quite as er substantial as you expected but it is the combination of on the one hand the proceeds of UNK less some UNK which frank mentioned we put a little more money in b s b and the minority interests and we do have traditionally in the first half an adverse net movement of funds from operation about ninety five million and then we had thirty two million odd er of simply UNK as a result of UNK our dollar debt at er the one sixty as opposed to the year ending rate
so net debt is two sixty four million er and therefore the pro UNK debt equity UNK from fifty seven percent to twenty eight percent we do of course expect it to be somewhat lower by the year end as our working capital which is coming to its peak season UNK
i'd like to go into a little more the composition of the net debt which again is something that er interests some of you we have er a reduction both on gross debt and equally an increase in cash as you would expect as a result of the UNK sale the increases are not fixed debt fixed term fixed rate debt is a function again of the exchange rate we haven't in issued any more the whole of the reduction of debt therefore is confined to our floating rate or variable debt and that UNK ready to the UNK of the UNK drawings we had under our to hedge or partially to hedge our holding in UNK we have increased our cash UNK and they remain concentrated in sterling as part of our sterling er asset er portfolio which is managed from UNK and which we regard as our UNK funds as and when needed
tell them that at the end of next month for a week to mark australia day this programme will be coming to you live from sydney
now we're looking for two couples to UNK us down under to find out how you can perhaps qualify stay UNK for the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
ten to eight is the time anna from UNK is on the line to me
anna good morning
good morning doug i'm a first time caller
welcome what would you like to talk about
well i'd just like to say about the lady who kept her hat on in the house all the time and if someone called that she didn't like she would say i'm just going out
if someone called that she liked she'd say i've just come in
you've UNK you're erm er referring to the story that we were discussing
yes
earlier we've had a lot of calls on this on er the best way to deal with house guests who UNK themselves on you over christmas have you ever had any horror stories yourself
i guess well not really i erm i try to make people welcome and they usually let me know if they're coming and then i'm prepared
well that's true but there are some people whom you'd rather not have in your house that you really can't do much to avoid coming can you really
well you can say you're going away can't you
i suppose you can really
i mean there're always excuses these days
people do go away for christmas
yes that's it's a lovely er lovely story anna er had a hat on and if she didn't want to see anybody she was just going out
yes
and if she did she was just coming in
that's lovely well yes
well listen can i say something else
please do
about the television licence
that's right this er this proposal by the UNK heritage committee that if you actually want another telly in your house you have to pay twenty quid extra
well i have one and i think that's expensive enough but regarding the licence extra money i think that we shouldn't have to pay any television licence at all with some of the programmes that we're getting on they're all repeated
well er anna and it is er a complaint that is er often er put up on this programme when we discuss television they're repeated and i do agree
there are an awful lot of UNK especially through the summer on the b c especially
but you know a lot of those UNK get huge audiences and th they must have repeated dad's army and UNK about fourteen hundred times but they still get enormous UNK those programmes
erm i suppose it's the sort of humour that er one looks at again and again and still UNK
i know it is with me er with dad's army so er if they're getting huge UNK with those UNK well they're obviously gonna put them on aren't they
david from UNK good morning
good morning douglas
erm this is story a that goes back about twenty one years ago
er i was only about twelve thirteen at the time
erm we had a erm i had an aunt and uncle they lived in southend and they used to like to come up and perform em he had a UNK and she used to play the piano and my erm father didn't really care for the music but they liked sort of opera and stuff like that
so we saw them er saw them actually because we live in a flat and we saw them coming from the station er one saturday morning
yes
so we decided to pretend we weren't in
now at the time we had my grandmother living with us so we had to tell her shut up erm and when they rang er on the door she wasn't to sort of call out and you know to tell us that the door was ringing
yes
so erm they rang and they rang and they rang for a good twenty to twenty five minutes and we just erm we all UNK together in the living room and erm anyway about half an hour went past and then they finally went we saw them we live in a flat and we saw them from the window we saw them going back to the station you see
so my dad says oh thank goodness for that anyway erm we sort of relaxed after that
about two three hours later after lunch there was another ring on the UNK i went to answer it and of course you can guess
there they were they they'd gone for a walk round london and er come back
they'd come all the way from er southend as i said and erm
oh
i didn't know what to say and they said well where were you well er i said we were all standing on the UNK and we didn't hear you erm it was ab i mean looking back now it's funny but it was ludicrous at the time
well indeed and er having got in i suppose they proceeded to entertain your father with the music he didn't particularly want to hear in the first place
that's lovely
i feel a bit sorry for them having come all the way from southend to your place and er being left ringing the UNK for half an hour
i suppose a lot of people would say he got his just UNK they did in that family because they all came back for three hours later and er gained entry
UNK from UNK good morning to you
oh hello doug yeah i wonder why you're so jolly in the morning
i mean when i get up in the morning it takes me four hours before i come to you're always so jolly
well i think you know i'm a naturally optimistic sort of person and i i'm not er sort of blowing my own trumpet here i erm look on life with a great deal of optimism er touch wood i've been fairly lucky in my life
i've got a job that i love doing and er i also take the view that if i came and did this programme and UNK away at everybody and er UNK away about everything nobody would ring me up and nobody would listen
so you know i don't want to be too jolly because er that that's er as bad as being UNK isn't it and miserable but i try and strike er a happy balance
okay can i talk to you about the UNK
yeah
well i've got one in my bedroom in c cos when i was in ill you know erm it's er nice to but i've got one downstairs that's two that's two
now for a long time because my children have grown up and i don't see them being young men when the young men get married you mothers don't see them so i'm on my own and it's erm i can't rely on that for company at all
l b c is on day and all night but
wonderful
the thing is erm i don't think that the standard is good enough to warrant paying eighty two pounds for a licence
oh so far from paying any extra for a another television set you are not happy at paying what we're paying at the moment
i'm going a step further doug
and i've got some friends who are very UNK i'm not UNK at all
mhm
er you go in their home it's black and white because they refuse they don't think it UNK the eighty two pound licence and i'm gonna get er black and white and er that's what i'm gonna do
okay UNK well far from paying another twenty quid for her extra television set UNK is very annoyed she's got to pay eighty three quid for a colour licence and she's gonna now go to black and white
i forget what black and white is it's considerably cheaper isn't it really
but erm a lot a people are now saying that the quality of er the programmes on the telly isn't very good
er if you want to er develop that part of the argument then by all means let's do so after the eight o'clock news
it's now three minutes to
right exactly sixty seconds to go then i'll bring you the eight o'clock news then after that we'll continue our conversation on the main topics of the morning according to you
families with more than one telly could soon be paying twenty pounds extra for their licence
it's to UNK the burden on hard up UNK but most of you this morning feel that to pay the existing licence fee is far too much so i'd like to hear more views on that please and also i'd like to hear from UNK fans especially and football fans in general your memories your UNK to the late great danny blanchflower
right the eight o'clock news coming up on this radio station
right i'm sure that er many people will know by now but i'm gonna say it anyway that at the end of january we will be on the breakfast call broadcasting to you live from sydney to celebrate australia day
now here's the interesting bit in the next few minutes i'll be telling you how you can win the chance to travel with me on an all expenses paid trip
stay UNK for the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
the time now is nine and a half minutes past eight
if you've just joined us for the eight o'clock news as many people do welcome
we're discussing this morning and i'll run briefly through the subjects that we have been discussing this morning for the er new listeners
families with two UNK could soon be paying twenty pounds extra for their licences to UNK the burden on hard up UNK
that is the proposal from mps on the UNK heritage committee do you think it's fair
that if you have a second telly in the house you should pay twenty pounds extra in licence money for it
and it may be that if you have three UNK in the house you'll have to pay forty pounds extra
i wonder if that is fair even if it is going to ease the burden on hard up UNK
a lot of people are saying this morning that er the existing licence fee of eighty three quid is far too high given that we er get UNK from the b c for most of the summer
well a lot of er UNK there and er if you'd like to give me a ring it's
we've been discussing the release of the three british hostages
saddam UNK has made the most of it hasn't he really
getting himself photographed shaking the hands of our UNK and UNK sir edward heath
i wonder if that erm really did UNK you seeing a leading british politician shaking UNK hand
do you feel a deal has been done there
and er if indeed a deal has been done is it worth it to get those three british people out
we've been discussing guests coming to stay at your place over christmas
and there's a fascinating article in this the current edition the january edition it is now because they go so far in advance of she magazine which says that er it's a desperate plight sometimes when you have people coming for christmas who fall into several categories like lazy UNK who do absolutely nothing and UNK who turn up with a UNK box of UNK and never take you out for a meal in return for your UNK and the UNK couples who er UNK you by er UNK retiring to their bedroom if i may put it that way and then the guests who turn up in mid row and UNK over the whole of the UNK period
so how do you get rid of or avoid coming of the unwanted guest
and i'd like to hear your tribute perhaps your memory of the great danny blanchflower who so sadly left us yesterday
one of the great footballers of er his age or perhaps any other age and it's sad isn't it that in the same year we've lost two bobby UNK and then danny
there's also another story i'd like to er throw into the conversation if i may
the residents of UNK wells in kent are th the UNK of british telecom at the moment because about thirty five percent of b t's sixty thousand customers in UNK wells are not in the book
well that may surprise you
keeping out of the book in fact has become increasingly popular with the national average of twenty five percent being one of the highest in the world
in london believe it or not b t tell us that forty three percent of their customers are not listed while in south west essex the average is forty percent and in west UNK and north west kent it's thirty five percent
now er i don't know er why you might want to be UNK ex directory not in the book
if you are then give me a ring and tell me why
UNK from UNK
good morning UNK
good morning douglas
i'd like to pay my tribute to danny blanchflower
yes
er he in my view was a rare spirit
a spirit that it seems to me has virtually gone from em certainly english football nowadays and i think in many ways english sport in general
he was not only a fine UNK he was also a gentleman to the UNK degree and he told the story i remember he started his erm professional football career in this country with UNK and he was transferred from UNK to aston villa and at the time there was some UNK over the fee and er he was taken by the chairman of UNK to meet the chairman of aston villa in the chairman's rolls UNK
they went down to birmingham and while the er two UNK negotiated in the dining room over a an extremely UNK lunch danny blanchflower was em pushed into the kitchen to sit with the servants if you like
that was the way of things in those days
yes it was yes
he was erm UNK for that time indeed UNK for now a university graduate
he graduated from st andrew's university and to in many ways he was UNK better educated and more intelligent than those who ran football around him but nevertheless erm he never showed that in erm a sense of being superior
never he was a remarkable UNK
he gave tottenham UNK the title i think of the greatest club side ever in erm british football and they won erm the double as everyone knows in nineteen sixty one the first english team to have won it this century
he led them to the er first british title for a european UNK and erm eventually er he also was a member of the northern ireland team that actually reached the quarter UNK in the nineteen fifty eight world cup
and northern UNK a very small country against all of the others
yes
i d i know that there's that phrase you know we will never see his like again i think we probably will but it will be a very long time and i cannot tell you the infinite feeling of sadness erm that i felt when i heard of his passing
it seemed to me an age had gone
UNK thank you very much indeed for your UNK
jeff of UNK
good morning
good morning douglas
first of all the best next week
oh thank you
er secondly the hostages
yes
you know the ones being released today
mhm
erm i er like everybody else are very glad to see they're gonna get their release but do you know dougie erm i for the life of me cannot understand and we don't know the full circumstances how these people wander into a country like iraq which has a terrible reputation and they don't like us very much you know how does this happen
wouldn't you stay about five UNK at least five miles away from the place if you were if you were if you er wandering out there
i certainly would jeff i couldn't agree more
i mean i can't understand yes
i'd stay about five hundred miles away from the border if i was them yes
that's right yes me too
erm you know this is what i can't understand we haven't heard this
an interesting point
thank you for raising it and er we might get some er UNK on that one
er it's all very well saying er these people were UNK what a bit of bad luck but what in god's name were they doing UNK around the border of a country like iraq
cos i say i'd steer well clear of that place
there are many other places i'd like to visit sydney is one of them
i'll be telling you more about that in mo
do you know i'm getting quite attached to that tune
in five minutes it'll be the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
we'll be bringing the show to you live from sydney australia at the end of january to mark australia day and we're looking for two couples they can be husband and wife mother and daughter father and son any combination you like even a couple of friends we're looking for two couples to come to australia with the show and to act as UNK
we want you to travel round the country at our expense all expenses paid needless to say and we want you to tell us by phone live on the programme in sydney what you're seeing and what you're doing

UNK of UNK
hello
good morning
good morning
what would you like to talk about
well it's about why i've been ex directory for the last er twenty years
oh right why then
well because i'm a single parent
mhm
a single mum an you know started off with two small babies living very fast and er it's sort of safer
i think you know a woman living alone
mhm
in this day and age erm is sort of erm not a good thing to sort of advertise your name in a phone directory
mhm and you don't find that gives you any difficulty at all er with people who genuinely want to find your number
er well erm they could sort of do it erm i mean when i leave er a place that house that i used to live in i leave a forwarding address but no i make sure with the people that erm take over the house but they don't actually give out my phone number
mm
but they can if they're serious they can do it by writing you know
mhm so you're ex directory UNK and you've found that it's er a great benefit as a single mum
for security reasons yes
UNK thank you for your call
UNK from chalk farm
good morning UNK
hello doug how are you
i'm very well and i know er that it's your birthday today and said
no
that's right isn't it are we right
no you're not
my birthday is february the tenth
oh
and in fact you're probably going to be invited because everybody seems to want to give me an UNK birthday party
an UNK birthday party
is it are you eighty in february
yes february the tenth
oh right i thought
now th
it was december the tenth
we got er the wrong dates we've got you down in our list as december the tenth
that's very odd no i'm going to give you a list of parties you can choose your party
i would if i were you i'd take the one in george studio
alright that's you're on then in february
right okay well a happy birthday when it comes and er welcome to the show
now the reason i called was that i have always been out of the phone directory ever since my name got well known in UNK
you get
sure
an awful lot of pressure if your name is in it but i got a special pleasure when i organized the reading from UNK book
oh yes well i suppose it would be
i organized that at UNK hall now in most reference books my UNK name is listed and my agent got a call saying the minute i began to read from that book i would die
oh
well my agent got terrified and she closed up her office that day and they all went home
you're still here
i'm still here
they did get me and i don't know how they got my number
they called me and they said again if i read the book i would be killed
and i said look why don't you meet me in front of UNK hall and kill me then it would save so much time
UNK of course with er w being a famous personality as you are i mean er if you were in the book it would be awful wouldn't it cos people would just have to er look up UNK l and they
yes
they'd get you wouldn't they really
well you see you get of every kind of a charity application begging letters and so forth and it sounds cruel rather
yes i can understand that
to say that you don't want to read all those letters
you cannot get interested in so many things
UNK thank you very much indeed and erm well have an extra birthday on us
happy birthday for december the tenth as well
eight twenty five
right time for the dougie down under competition thanks to quantas australia's national airline
two couples must win an all expenses paid trip to australia with me when the show comes live from sydney at the end of january
hope i'm back for UNK party
we've had four questions already this week if you missed any of them we will be repeating them next week but now here is the final question
i think it's the most difficult actually that we've er brought you this week
what is a baby UNK called
what's a baby UNK called
now as soon as you have the five answers and if you haven't heard the other four questions then there will be a chance as i said to hear them again next week when you've got the five answers i'd like you to send me them on a christmas card please this is very important send them on a christmas card please to the following address
answers on a christmas card to and the christmas cards please with your answers to be in by first post next friday the seventeenth
then we'll keep you posted as to what happens next
eight twenty seven
right the search is on for the person in the team who told me that UNK birthday was today and not february the tenth
anyway er that apart for your views on the news
the news coming up
and when i talked to derek UNK an hour ago he's been in good form has UNK
he's er three winners out of four days and a second and er he's going for a couple at cheltenham today in the twelve thirty five number four book of music and in the two fifty five number two flashing steel
twelve thirty five cheltenham number four book of music two fifty five number two flashing steel
pam most of the morning papers of course have had er UNK quite rightly so to danny blanchflower we've had a lot of people on this morning saying that we'll never see his like again
er it's dreadful isn't it that we've lost two of the outstanding footballers of this or any other age in one year
bobby UNK and now danny
mm
bobby UNK yes and of course er you know it has been a very sad year you know if you couple it together with arthur UNK the UNK champion and
of course mm
of course erm james hunt but er yes it's rather sad as well that you know the last few years of erm UNK life were he was so UNK with UNK and really not er shade of the sort of happy er person that he had been
but i think that's how we will remember him of course when you know the sadness er passes away
well one of the great gentlemen of football wasn't he
now maybe there's no place for gentlemen in football now i don't know but er
absolutely well it does seem it does seem a football of a of another era certainly but erm i mean i think he brought a breath of fresh air into football at the time
i mean even myself as a young girl i'm not i'm not th you know that erm that young yet but i can remember him the er you know UNK of er UNK across the old black and white screen
but erm
mm yes
indeed he he's been UNK as an intellectual player erm he a thinking player a shining example and of course that shows up in statistics when you read about what he's achieved and you think you know fifty six UNK for northern ireland
mm
he got northern ireland into the quarter UNK of the world cup in fifty eight and again at club level
cup double cup and league double in sixty one f a cup the following year and erm the first british club UNK in nineteen sixty three to win er to win the european UNK the cup UNK cup a five one er victory against UNK i mean that is tremendous that all speaks for himself and i gather he's a very great UNK and a much loved er man sadly missed
mhm mm oh yes indeed yes indeed a great after dinner speaker too tremendous er tremendous irish wit
well he UNK northern ireland the republic of ireland of course well placed for the world cup draw aren't they
yes quite interesting because er they've been named er in group two er of the UNK which have been er released today
the draw will er be er a UNK affair in UNK with er various UNK stars and rock stars next week elton john and rod stewart will be turning out and UNK
mhm i can imagine well they know a bit about they know oh the well UNK of course used to keep goal didn't he
for er a club side in spain wasn't it
yes i can't imagine it and again of course rod steward and elton john we all know how er well connected they are er with the game absolutely so
and they're very good footballers or they were mm
there's gonna so we'll need quite er quite a turn up there but erm republic of ireland are UNK er in group two and in fact above holland who are in group three and norway in group four
if you think they were they were two who did better than england
sure
but i mean poor old england erm it's r i p i'm afraid
yes poor
er group one UNK just to let you know united states who're in that UNK group as UNK anyway germany as the holders and then former winners UNK italy brazil and belgium and it's all based on their results of the last three competitions
so
right rugby union more concern about er rough play bath accused of foul play
yes
getting a bit much isn't it
it is a bit much when you think you know hot on the UNK of will UNK erm you know UNK about the all UNK and what they're er alleged to have got up to on their tour of england and scotland
er now erm UNK have complained to bath there've been allegations er during last UNK er courage league match which bath won incidentally of UNK and UNK er and bath officials now have agreed that they will look at a video recording and take appropriate action in quotes if anything erm needs to be done
i mean UNK actually erm alleged that it wasn't just an UNK boot or a punch this was quite er yeah
calculated stuff yeah and er talking of UNK a lucky escape for UNK in his disciplinary hearing in paris
yes he he's erm escaped with a two race suspended ban this was for erm his UNK meeting the face of er irish driver eddie
er at er so
nice way of putting it
this was er the er japanese grand UNK in october
erm he didn't actually admit at the hearing that he had hit erm but erm the disciplinary panel agreed that he had perhaps been UNK er rather more than er had been necessary
so the UNK of it all is he's banned for two races but this is a UNK suspended erm ban over two months er over six months rather so it means that if he's a good boy over the next six months he won't miss any races at all so he has had a lucky escape
he has he has
well known for his temper
yes indeed so i believe
pam thank you very much indeed
er pam UNK er step stepping in for er UNK is the er UNK man back on monday
no i gather he has taken a long weekend i don't know where he's UNK himself off to but i'm afraid i won't be here er next week i don't know quite know who will be but er UNK taking er a well needed rest
right yes i might say that right pam thanks very much indeed it's twenty minutes to nine
seventeen minutes to nine
gerald has rung me from east UNK
good morning gerald
good morning mr UNK and er many happy birthday returns for er UNK
yes in february
no doubt he will er re UNK because it's mine on monday
oh is it
twenty s i'm not sure whether it's twenty six or twenty seven
no comment please
never mind happy returns many happy returns er for monday
anyway th thank you very much and i hope you do well when you go into hospital on monday
oh thanks nothing to very minor thing on monday
well it is it's still it always causes some concern though for those around you
anyway it er this business of erm twenty pound increase on the t v
yes
quite my goodness me we er surely the people must be sick and tired of this lot
all they seem to do is target the ones at the hospitals the police the fire brigade everything
even the heating and now they're targeting invalidity benefit yes mm
well when you say this lot actually it it's not er actually a government body this in fact er the UNK heritage committee er these are the people who are UNK this price rise in the proposals yesterday they're actually led by gerald UNK who's never been a conservative in his life
i know he hasn't i know he hasn't
but even so the government are still the people in charge and they're the people who should er make a final decision or not er isn't it
i mean it's t
oh they will yes indeed er it will be up to the government
i mean i mean they are they're they really are you know we're so UNK in this country mr UNK i don't know do you know they're just hitting us in every direction my goodness me you know you'll be afraid to breathe without they'll want to target that
okay gerald thank you very much indeed
gerald obviously feeling er very bad about er this scheme to make us all pay twenty pounds extra if we have a second t v set in the house
it's a proposal nothing more than that at the moment derek from UNK good morning
mr UNK i'd like to pay UNK tribute to danny blanchflower
yes
er because i saw him play actually in the nineteen sixty two final against UNK
oh yes
and er and my father actually looked up the year before and found he knew the s h m an old school UNK and he sent us a ticket
so i've only been the once
yes
and he really was a marvellous player
er he never any you know against him and his skill and his performance was absolutely UNK
i wonder how he would have done in today's game do you think there would have been room for him today
yes absolutely i think so mr UNK
you see he's got such skill his UNK and he's always in the right position and he really was i can't pay a higher tribute
it's very sad the news of course
mind you he'd of probably been UNK down wouldn't he today before that's the problem nowadays
er well that's the point what a marvellous draw UNK got mr UNK against UNK in the cup
oh yes that's right of course you're a great UNK supporter just an ex
absolutely i went to see at we had to trouble at not of our supporters
well the way UNK are playing at the moment you've got a very good chance of winning
well we've got this runner you see younger brother carl he does a lovely job at and of there's a bit of UNK added to it
derek thank you very much indeed for your call
thank you mr UNK bye
we must move on because we've got to have a commercial break and then we want to check on the traffic
it's fourteen minutes to nine
UNK to the stars here he is mr UNK
good morning
good morning how are you douglas
not bad at all sir thank you and you
has it stopped raining
not yet just a well that's it i don't know it's pretty UNK
horrible isn't it but i hear it's gonna be a bit better this afternoon
yes i think it a little bit better but much UNK at the weekend with a touch of UNK by sunday evening we're told mm
oh UNK on sunday oh dear
never mind you can all warm us up with your programme this morning
well we start with the morning UNK and the hour between ten and eleven er it's erm and the UNK guidance association helping people to find the job they really want
er between eleven and eleven thirty mike and mark will be joining me they're the authors of the official politically incorrect handbook
and between eleven thirty and twelve UNK who's the author of london under london
we'll be talking
some fascinating things happen under
yes i'm sure
and then between twelve and one it's sport back on UNK with tony
mm right
that's it
right i think you'll get a lot of calls on er danny blanchflower this morning a lot of people ringing up remembering him with er great UNK
yes i'm sure we will
a terrible thing that he had UNK disease for so long i mean he was only you know sixty seven when he died terrible
mhm yes yeah but a wonderful player
and one of the most intelligent er footballers i've ever met right
yes mm yes yeah
well i think we'll get a lot of calls and people remember him with great UNK
pete thank you very much indeed
pete UNK between nine and one
nine minutes to nine is the time now
on we go to the UNK
saw dennis law on t v and he says that when he first played against danny he kicked him all round all over the park
dennis did
dennis said that yeah he said that
dennis was a fairly let's put it er as UNK as we can a fairly competitive player wasn't he
i think he was
i think that's er perhaps er enough to be said about dennis law's game
a brilliant player played many great games but erm very competitive
i must say he said that he UNK it now
but he was young probably
it was the first game he played against
but erm and the other thing is er going back before er danny blanchflower we had a goalkeeper
yes ted
you remember him
i do the cat they used to call him mm
that's right and i believe well i think he was the first goalkeeper to throw the ball out
i never saw a goalkeeper before him throw a ball out to erm you know a player
no i don't know alf i can't remember if he was the first goalkeeper ever to throw a ball out to a player but er if you want to ring up tell you what you want to do you want to ring up if you're around between twelve and one and discuss that with pete UNK and tony UNK for when they have the sport back on UNK and er that of course is the specialist UNK hour and er they may be able to throw a bit of light on that
but i can remember ted very well indeed
the cat yeah he was one of the er first UNK to er make a habit of catching the ball rather than UNK it
anyway alf thank you very much indeed er for your call
UNK of UNK
sadly the last call i think we'll be able to squeeze in this morning on our programme
UNK good morning
good morning doug
it's in regards about the television licences
yes
well i'm eighty four years old
mhm
and i pay full price eighty three
i heard a while ago on the radio that they were gonna put it up to eighty four fifty
now in regards about that what i don't understand people who live in sheltered accommodation some pay five pound a year some pay nothing
so i say if it's good for one pensioner to that why don't they allow other pensioners to pay it
yes
or even make it a little cheaper
well i would have thought so and i think that's what the
i don't mind paying for it if they could even reduce it a bit
yes i think perhaps that is what may happen
i don't want to raise your hopes too much UNK but i think what er the idea behind this i er thing is families with two UNK paying twenty pounds extra for the second set and perhaps for the third set another twenty pounds it's to try and UNK the burden on UNK who genuinely can't afford the existing licence fee as it is now and UNK i would have thought that you would've fallen into that category
so er help may be at hand in the future
and er on that message er it seems er good enough time to say that's er all we have time for as far as the phone calls are concerned on the breakfast call this morning
it's three minutes to nine we'll have a break then we'll have rob back with the latest traffic
a very good morning to you
jonathan UNK with the final hour of tuesday morning's breakfast programme your opportunity to have your say on just about everything as long as it's legal and decent and honest and in your own opinion you can call me now on york six four one six four one
things we think you might be interested or i think you might be interested in talking about this morning
erm UNK woods this er this great big erm dump of coal waste that's gonna be er left in the selby area a mile long UNK of millions of tons of spoil from the tip
local people very angry about it how do you feel on the subject
o nine o four six four one six four one
we're gonna to be speaking to one or two er expert voices or er deeply interested parties in a moment or twos time
your contribution is more than welcome york six four one six four one
quick call that's all it will take and then er we ring you back and bear the burden of the telephone bill
erm life UNK should no longer be the automatic penalty for murder that's according to the committee UNK by the former er lord er former lord chief justice lord lane
it says it's wrong that a judge should have to pass the same sentence on an abused wife who kills a UNK husband as it does on a UNK armed with a shotgun who kills in cold blood
the committee recommends that life should remain the maximum sentence but the judges should be given the freedom to impose whatever penalty they see fit
can you agree with that
that life UNK should no longer be the automatic penalty for murder and that judges should be free to impose whatever penalty they seem fit
your thoughts on that one would be interesting
erm the sun claims this morning that the archbishop of canterbury dr george UNK believes that the prince of wales should not be allowed to become the king of england because of his friendship with UNK
do you this that's fair
six four one six four one is the number to call and erm the whole business about er these people lloyds of london you know the er the investors the names at lloyds who stake everything they have in order to UNK in enormous profits
well they had a particularly bad time many of them lost absolutely everything and now they're UNK cos the lloyds people are only coming up with a nine hundred million pound rescue package that might give them some of them back half of what they invested
can you work up any sympathy for them
o nine o four six four one six four one and perhaps on a lighter note according to speculation in the yorkshire post newspaper this morning UNK could be heading towards alan UNK
the paper says paul UNK could be coming to leeds united after his career in italian football where he plays of course for UNK the rome based club
erm i stress it is just speculation but what do you think
is UNK just what leeds united needs or even wants
york six four one six four one is the number to call
could we bear to see him UNK across the border there in west yorkshire
it's ten minutes past nine and joining us on the line this morning is er judy in york good morning judy
good morning jonathan
we were talking on the subject of erm divorce in yesterday morning's programme and this idea that erm the whole procedure of getting a divorce som er would be UNK up and there'd be something called no UNK divorce so that people wouldn't have to point UNK fingers at one another
what was your erm wha what was your opinion of these new suggestions
right well erm i believe er that we should make every effort to preserve UNK erm and thinking especially of the suffering that's involved UNK for children
i really feel very much for the children
and i'd i do think it's possible erm with help for people both sides have a partnership to change you know if we take an honest look at ourselves
they'd start er you know one man gen mentioned er that when we get married in church erm we are making sacred UNK you know we start with god but then we get busy with our living and our jobs and having our families and then somehow we forget about god and we try to go on without him
but er i do UNK i've we go to a church in york and er i believe in the saying the family that UNK together stays together and a christian foundation for marriage i gives stability in your relationship
i mean we have to work very hard in our own er relationship we've had our ups and downs we've gone through many difficult times like unemployment and even homelessness and you know we we've gone through it but when you make your promises you say you'll stay together for UNK for poorer in sickness and in health and so on
but sometimes they're taking lightly and we have found the help and encouragement that our christian friends and our vicar have given to us in our difficult times have he helped keep us together
i'm sure the word divorce has come into my mind er several times at the crisis points but by god's strength you keep going and you grow
but f for many people judy i mean th people will look to you with some degree of er of UNK and maybe some degree of envy that you do have that strong faith that's helped you through those times
but for many people isn't it the case that the church wedding is an and the promises made the UNK made before god and er before the congregation for many people they're just a sort of rather erm oh dear how can i put it rather a UNK erm that they just feel it's essential to have so that they can have the nice pictures and look back on a church wedding
doesn't it make a nonsense of the whole thing
well i agree i mean it is a bit UNK really just to want all the show and everything you know if you're not really UNK in those promises you're making
i mean the money that some people spend on a wedding i mean it it's just one day and then you got yo it's your life afterwards that really counts
erm i think money is another issue a actually very strong issue that causes er people to think of divorce because of disagreement of h how to use money people go into debt
we're coming up to christmas of course and that was touched on yesterday how much people spend at christmas
erm there's tremendous pressures i think for a mother particularly erm at the early stage in the marriage when she has young children at home
i found that quite a hard time erm and especially if you don't have any family near
m my parents live quite a long way away and erm y you've got to you need the support of others
a friend and i in our church we've started erm a mother and UNK service and that seemed to really help a lot of the young mums they really look forward and they said could we have it more often
you know we had it once a month and they really wanted this kind of support and help and er for the ch children to have a christian foundation
i'm sure if people will perhaps they look at the church and think oh it's out of touch but it isn't there are churches that are alive and have something very relevant to say today
as a as a UNK and a committed christian i mean i quoted earlier on this morning from the sun newspaper this morning which is UNK and UNK this morning on the subject of erm well it claims that the archbishop of canterbury er dr UNK is saying that erm charles could never be king of this country erm because erm he had an affair with UNK
mhm
wha what's what would your opinion be as a church UNK would you be as we don't know whether the archbishop really said it cos it's printed in the sun for UNK sake
mm i bet it's been twisted i've had experience of things i've said being in the paper and not coming out as i've said them
but wha what's y what's your UNK opinion i mean you're talking about erm the er marriage from er spiritual UNK from a christian UNK and here we have the man who erm if he became king would be head of the church of england assuming it hasn't become UNK by then
mm
erm how would you feel about him being the kind and defender of the faith
well not very happy really
erm you know i mean i wi the queen i think has given a wonderful example and her family life and i feel very sorry for the way her children have you know the stresses of modern life ha have caused all these things and i feel for charles an and diana deeply
erm i think it's really very sad that i it's just the society we live in has put these kind of pressures on UNK and you know we're all human and we can all be tempted to look at other people and be UNK but in those times of er you know temptation you just i well i i've found that that's where my faith comes in you're sort of helped through those times
erm i'm not really UNK answering the question but i didn't really want to get on to that one it's just
all right
could i just erm mention one thing if
yep
if there are people who are going through a crisis just now there is a wonderful organization called care for the family
they have many caring initiatives and erm they've been to york and they've erm had marriage seminars er and they do an UNK help with UNK er i just wonder if i could give the address of this so if anyone is interested
well
they could get in touch
i'll tell you i'll tell you what w we you give the address to someone o off air because people won't have pen and paper now and then if any
right and then anyone can phone in
then anyone who wants it can call us
thanks judy
okay
bye now have a good day bye
bye thank you
bye
erm here's a here's something from the sun this morning just on the subject of who's going to be king
erm UNK yesterday UNK odds on prince william becoming the next king because of an exclusive sun story i don't think
erm we revealed the queen wants the crown to skip a generation
william hill the other william immediately cut their price on wills being UNK by january the first in the year two thousand from twenty five to one to ten to one
not such good odds
do you think the crown ought to skip a generation like that
o nine of four six four one six four one if you'd like to comment on something in the news at the moment something on er UNK just said or er on this business of life UNK no longer to be the automatic penalty for murder judges to be given the freedom to impose whatever penalty they see fit
would you trust the UNK of this country with that sort of er level of responsibility
people are already UNK from time to time the de decision judges make
i can't begin to imagine the sort of UNK that might break out if er judges started to hand out the sort of UNK that they saw fit in particular cases
and er you might have heard what er the department of education john UNK the education secretary was saying yesterday about erm sex education
i've got all the er the official details in front of me here
in a statement mr UNK set out the place of sex education in society and the vital importance of teaching the teaching of moral values
he called for UNK action by governors head teachers and teachers to erm make sure that er young people appreciate the importance of having a set of values recognize the values held by others from whom they can learn
this whole business of sex education and teaching morality in schools do you think it is the school's responsibility or do you think mum and dad ought to play more of a part
york six four one six four one is the number to call
erm moving on and talking about the subject of the UNK wood pits or the er proposed tip at the UNK wood pits in just a couple of moments time
hello to tell you what's on today's afternoon show
UNK f m UNK to december nineteen eighty three from three meet former radio four today UNK john UNK with another of his UNK books which takes him all over the country looking at the unusual including some of the things you never knew existed in north yorkshire
UNK and UNK is the story of army UNK wives continues and after four anything could happen when the UNK and the UNK meet head on
david leonard and martin UNK are in UNK once again at york theatre royal they pop in straight from UNK
and our class of the week today come from king james school in knaresborough
UNK afternoon show with between two and five i hope you'll join me
it's nineteen minutes past nine
if it goes ahead it'll cover nearly three hundred and fifty acres and consist of thirty million tons of coal
british UNK plans to build a huge coal tip at UNK wood could get approval later today
an official from the inspectorate of pollution had expressed worries that the scheme would cause more pollution but today those criticisms have been withdrawn
well local people UNK in the area say they'll fight the scheme and they plan to lobby the meeting of county planners at ten thirty in northallerton this morning which has been called to discuss the scheme
well joining me on the line is the minerals planning consultant from the UNK group that's er peter and in our northallerton studio is john who's the county planning officer
first er but i've been UNK i'm sorry i'm i haven't realized UNK was joining us on the line
good morning and he's with us as well
good morning mr
good morning
erm well i don't really know what to ask you because i was prepared to erm
well shall i tell you what you were going to ask
yeah go on you tell what you were going to ask me
no the position is that er given that this is a fourth stage er planning process
you've got the district council the county council then the national government may intervene by calling in the application
but there is a fall back position and that is that the european community have a directive called the environmental impact assessment directive that requires that before a major project of this type is put through there must be the UNK public consultation
in my view a although there's a current debate about this there has not been the UNK public consultation and i would er myself be minded to UNK the er e c directive on this er in order to try and er to make sure that the public feel they are fully aware of what the proposals are
so you wouldn't be necessarily satisfied then with discussion purely at a local level and a decision here
no i th the public inquiry that should take place in my view would of course be conducted locally would involve all local interest and would have the benefit of independent views by experts on the environmental impact of this er proposal
so what i'm really asking for is full democracy and not the rather closed democracy that we've been used to in this country er for too long
mr that you very much indeed for joining us on the programme this morning
took me by UNK er by er by surprise
let me go to er where i expected to go now to john the county planning officer
what do you think to erm what erm you've just heard the north yorkshire euro mp edward have to say there about his erm UNK to see a public inquiry
well the county council is quite clear on this
we are an experienced planning authority
county councillors have been dealing with british coal in relation to UNK wood and selby complex for twenty years
in that limited area where we UNK expertise we have employed outside consultants to advise the council
i believe that we have wi will be fulfilling all our statutory and moral responsibilities in the way that we have dealt with the application
we've dealt with it fully in compliance with the law including an environmental statement
mr refers to european law and environmental statements that was passed into british legislation we have fully UNK with that
an environmental statement was required from the company it has been given full publicity i believe that the planning committee and county planning committee today have sufficient information to come to a decision an informed decision
well le let's just hear what er peter has to say about that
he's the mineral planning consultant from the UNK protest group
good morning mr
good morning
what would your comment be
my comment is that i don't accept what john is saying
i cannot for the life of me see why the county council as the statutory authority and supposedly an independent er body to british coal is so UNK to a full public inquiry when only the clear er proposals of british coal will come out
i cannot for the life of me see why they're so UNK to it
mr
we're UNK to it not for any UNK reason but we don't feel that local democracy is necessarily improved by the county council d UNK it's decision
we are the responsible authority if members and it's their decision this morning believe that they have all the relevant information then they will stand up and be counted
but the local people are clearly very concerned about it
the er the joint villages action committee wants a public discussion to take place in a in a public forum with the set rules of a public inquiry
why shouldn't they have that
i mean this coal tip is isn't going to be based on what i said a moment or two ago with it's thirty million tons of coal covering nearly three hundred and fifty acres a bit of a monster
well you say that but i mean there are plenty of other coal disposal facilities in the country
what eventually is proposed would be very similar to hambleton and bath in terms of its impact in the local environment
there are few people i'm very concerned for those people and we will be imposing conditions if members wish to approve it to protect the interests of the few people in close UNK many of the objectors er they must be heard and their point of view is report in the committee papers but they do live at er a couple of miles from the site
er i would say that the impact of the development if it goes ahead must be limited at that distance
i don't believe there will be problems at that distance of noise of dust and the visual impact of this hill must be limited at that distance
is it horrible
yes can i come back on one or two points there
w the county council have a duty to er consider this application so it's not a question of them UNK their responsibilities they're not capable of in law of UNK their responsibilities
but what they have done is something quite UNK in my view and that is to actually write to the secretary of state and say to him do not exercise your rights to call this matter in to consider beside or above th the county planning authority
and that is in the teeth of the UNK of three thousand four hundred signatures from local people and urgent requests from those communities that the county council allow the secretary of state full discretion in this matter to call the matter in
there has been a positive attempt at UNK of local democracy
why have you why have you done that mr
well we've not done that at all
what we have said and we will be referring my recommendation to the planning committee today is if they're minded to approve it and subject to a legal agreement and subject to conditions we will refer it as a departure to the secretary of state
what we have said what members have already resolved is that they do not believe that it is necessary for him to intervene
this is not a unique case the planning committee at its last meeting made a similar recommendation on a different mineral site
i don't believe that the secretary of state has need to call it in and indeed mr UNK has written to the local member of parliament saying his mind is still open but on the information he had in october he does not think that these that this application raises issues of more than local importance
that is the definition as to why an application should be called in
does it raise issues of more than local importance
the view of the county council is that it does not raise those issues
i'll let peter come back to you in just a moment erm and there are more question i would ask you as well but erm now we must take a short break with time at nine twenty six
we'll get the latest on north UNK roads from a UNK
and starting firstly in york city centre
things starting to ease off following a busy rush hour this morning
it's still a bit busy coming in down there on tadcaster road and the usual busy traffic for this time of the day on the junction of UNK and UNK
but elsewhere things certainly UNK off now
also an early UNK start to the day to the north of the county that seems to be UNK off as well
a bit UNK but again starting to lift
on the a sixty four east of york the outside lane closures are still in place this morning between UNK and UNK
also the UNK roundabout itself is being UNK right through the day which again is adding to the usual delays for this time of a tuesday
in york work continues at the junction of UNK lane and UNK and finally on the a one six eight between UNK and UNK there's a UNK on the UNK bypass
UNK a UNK
two rail delays to tell you about
the nine thirty six london kings cross service that one is delayed at the moment as is the nine forty two UNK service out of platform five
apart from that everything else running to time through until the ten o'clock london kings cross service out of platform three
peter you wanted to come back
yes indeed i do
mr claims that this is merely of local importance and at the end of the day twenty years from now or twenty five years from now whenever this the application is UNK is implemented and completed that it would be no more than a UNK of er natural features within the vale of york
those two points are absolutely nonsense
it is not merely of local importance it is going to be a huge UNK feature for twenty years of working and in UNK thereafter within a natural rural area and a natural landscape
it is going to be nine and a half times the UNK of hambleton three and a half times the UNK of UNK bath it will tower in its mass beside them and it is totally unreasonable and wrong for anybody to describe it as merely of local concern
john
well the i have to disagree with mr on this
the height of the UNK will be lower than UNK bath it will be lower than hambleton
i'm not UNK the impact on the environment during working we are still negotiating the details of restoration with british coal in the event that members er accept the recommendation in principle today
we are seeking to ensure that the er first area to be built up gives protection to the village of hambleton and can be restored very quickly
but nevertheless it is an application which is necessary british coal at the end of the day would have been delighted not to make it after all
this is going to be a very er difficult and expensive application for them but we have a successful coal industry the jobs associated with it we've got to balance economic interests and environmental interests and i believe we can do so
a reminder to you if you're listening to the programme this morning and er you are concerned about the creation of this tip at the UNK wood mine in selby that you can call us and put your question to york six four one six four one is the number to call
can i ask you mr we reported on this programme yesterday morning that an official from the inspectorate of pollution had expressed worries that the scheme could cause more pollution
but today we learn that those criticisms have been withdrawn
why
why's he changed his mind
there was an overlap in terms of certain areas of responsibility between her majesty's inspectorate of pollution letter which was one of objection and the national rivers authority
we said to both of them look you are UNK government organizations who are sponsored by government departments there can only be one technical view
you're not expressing opinions you're expressing technical er situation
wasn't really a technical situation i thought i was told yesterday that the erm letter from the UNK the pollution inspectorate was a matter of opinion
it wasn't a technical statement at all it was it was an opinion from an inspector
he said that there was a risk of pollution
now that is a technical issue
i asked both bodies to get together if they needed further information from british coal they should secure it
that's what h m i p did they got further information from british coal they met er on friday er with their colleagues at the national rivers authority and it's from that greater understanding of the application that h m i p have now said that they are prepared to withdraw their objection subject to the UNK of the conditions at the n r a request
peter what
to do that
peter why do you think the erm the her majesty's inspectorate of pollution have changed their mind
because they've been UNK into an opinion on one particular aspect of their letter
but don't forget that their letter really addressed three fundamental issues
it addressed air quality they criticize the threat to air quality in their letter and that hasn't been addressed by the n r a it's beyond the n r a's permit to do that
and then we have the third issue which is site selection and here they are at one with the local communities when they say this particular er selected site has been driven by economic consideration and not environmental consideration
and that is against the advice of government in its circular advice to the coal industry and indeed to the county council
so they might well have had convenient discussions with the n r a as late as friday even though their letter UNK the UNK letter was written on the eighth of september and friday of course was the day after this letter had been released to us on our request and was two days after the selby committee had met on wednesday
UNK it's all too convenient and it's all too easy we have a perfect example of bureaucratic UNK
UNK it between enough parties for long enough and the issues will get lost
john
no
bureaucratic UNK
certainly not i mean the other issues as mr quite rightly says are air quality and the letter from the inspectorate now says i understand that the measures taken by british coal and they've moved on since september the measures taken by british coal are now to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority which for air quality is the district council
and on site selection well that is not why i consult er h m i p i want their technical views
site selection has been dealt with and is a UNK straight forward planning issue
no it isn't
i think it's a it's a question that they are perfectly right under the environmental protection legislation where the h m i p are given wider powers
i think it is a perfectly legitimate area of comment for them
but can i answer specifically john's point john 's point on the matter of agreement between h m i p now and the selby district council on the matter of air quality
the latest report from the environmental health department of selby district council which was made available to the selby district council planning committee last wednesday clearly UNK the issue of air quality based on the british coal proposals as they stand
they say that there are going to be dust clouds issuing from this site comparable to the dust clouds that used to issue from the p f a UNK at UNK
and that's almost a straight quotation from that report
so if the h m i p are now at one with selby then they must still stand by their view that there is a considerable risk to air quality as outlined in point one of their letter of the eighth of september
now it is for these reasons all of these different views and these conflicting opinions coming from UNK sources and the concern the locals have that this issue has been UNK through on a political ticket is the very reason why it should go to an inspector appointed by the secretary of state at least some UNK of independence and that issues brought out in full public consideration
john well let john let john answer that
it's not been UNK through on a political basis
my report to the planning committee is a sound professional technical planning report and i believe that on the information that i've been supplied with i can recommend to the planning committee to approve the application
you've got three thousand people locally who've their signatures to a petition who don't want this thing on their doorstep because they're worried that they've tha that there're going to be things wrong with it's going to affect the quality of the lives of people in selby
that's what all boils down to doesn't it at the end of the day and you haven't succeeded as far as i can see in convincing people those three thousand UNK that erm it's not going to affect their lives and the quality of their lives and their environment UNK
no but i think it is interesting that some of the parish councils for instance who initially were opposed to the application and very strongly as they have been supplied with further and better information have modified their position and are now saying subject to UNK planning controls they are no longer opposed UNK to the application
things have moved on application details have been supplied and will continue to be
i mean we will be working with british coal to work it out further in fine detail
we're go entering proposing to enter into legal agreements as well as planning conditions if it is to go ahead
let's hear from some erm local people on the subject of er of the proposed er tip site at UNK wood near selby
UNK that you can call in as well on six four one six four one on the york exchange if you've a point you'd like to make
terry we've been keeping him waiting on the line a long time good morning terry
good morning
erm you i understand live erm quite near to the proposed development
yes it's within six hundred and fifty meters
and what's your wha what's your feelings
well obviously we're against the proposals er because of the noise element and obviously the dust
as it's been noted in the previous conversation there is er a possibility of obviously dust from the i it's spoil by the way not coal
yes sorry that was my mistake
coal can be moved spoil is there for ever
we've got this on our doorstep for twenty thirty forty years and longer
er because of the problems the stock piles of coal at various pits i think there is about forty five million tons UNK at various pits they'll still be using coal from UNK and so that there's no necessity to mine coal in such er vast amount
obviously the affect of the change in the pit review procedure has changed a lot
this was UNK well before the pit review body decided to sort of close pits down
but a away from the politics and the necessity to mine coal yeah or nay your personal worry is that you live close to the proposed site and it's going to somehow UNK affect the quality of your and your family's life
yes
okay let's put that to john what er what UNK can you to er to terry living six hundred and fifty meters away from this planned development
he doesn't believe the UNK he's heard so far
well i believe that we i am confident in fact that we can impose conditions and more importantly place conditions that will minimize the dust
we're proposing codes of practice to operate it
it's not coming completely new to us this type of operation
we have experience at common and at UNK with disposal of power station ash
slightly different material but substantially the same n nature same scale of development i believe that we have a track record that shows that we were are tough and will continue to be tough i
terry do those UNK that the county council planners are going to be tough do they erm lay some of the er the fears that you have
in a word no
why not
we've had assurances before we we've had no dialogue with the county council
we wouldn't have had no dialogue with british coal or very little dialogue
i have a quick phone call i think it was june or july just stating what they wanted to do and i in my opinion it was passed then and it is political
terry thank you very much indeed
peter if you're still with us
yes indeed
wh erm terry's feelings there do they you've obviously been speaking to large numbers of UNK do they marry with the other opinions that you hear
oh absolutely so
i er first of all can i correct you
there are not three thousand four hundred signatures say this thing should be refused
that might well be the result at the end of the day when all issues are properly balanced
what the three thousand four hundred are saying is that the county council and british coal do not know where they're going with this thing the full implications of it have either not been properly assessed or indeed not been released to the to the local communities
they feel that as it's their heritage they should have a say in the matter and a proper consideration and therefore there are thousands of signatures saying please can we have a public inquiry
that is what they're saying and i think that can only be seen as UNK reasonable and i think that edward has hit the nail right on the head when he says look if this issue is not properly considered locally there can be no alternative if government fails in its duty to call it in the in the interests of the local communities and the region at large then it will have to go to brussels
and i would welcome that initiative right now
john can you really press ahead with this recommendation in the light of the fact that there is clearly such mass local feeling about it such UNK on a grand scale of the UNK that you and fellow planners have made
well i'm disappointed that there is this lack of reassurance
i mean we have handled it professionally and con and con
i don't i don't i don't i don't think i don't think anybody is denying that but it's clearly not worked
well er it will be for elected members of course to decide but i mean county councillors are elected by local people to represent local people but also take decisions on behalf of the community
i don't think that anyone would expect them to UNK that if we haven't
no but again it does but when the but when the local community rises up like this and UNK such a heart felt opinion on something elected representatives or not surely they ought to listen when a specific issue like this is obviously causing such concern
yes well they are listening
i mean the committee report er and appendices that are going to members today run to thirty plus sides
at the end of the day in any event the county planning committee if they accept my recommendation will be sending it off to the department of the environment
if the department of the environment think that there are issues of more than local importance they will call it in but their preliminary view expressed to the local mp mr is that they don't believe that's the case
that i stress is a preliminary view they could not and would not wish to make a final decision until they have all the information
but i think that we can persuade them that it is something that parliament has said a planning application that deals with local issues can be determined locally
peter
can i there are there are several issues in what john has said
he says there's been proper consultation with the local communities and the local authorities including the parish councils
i'd i would UNK that
for example there has been a recent change in the proposals of british coal in the manner of transportation of this material onto the tip and the manner in which it is tipped and handled
the very core of the issue in environmental terms
those details have not been sent out to the parish councils for further consultation and i refer there john to circular fifteen of ninety two publicity for planning applications where at paragraph twenty five there is clear government advice that where the changes are p are where the proposed changes are significant and these are UNK significant there should be reconciliation
there has been none
the local communities have been ignored in these issues and these discussions that are going on between british coal and the county council
john then goes on to say well of course we're going to refer this to the secretary of state
well of course he is because he is obliged to do it
he's obliged to do it because it is a departure a very significant departure from his own development plan the plan that he UNK through to tell people exactly what the policies of north yorkshire county council were to be
and now he's running against that plan and under the law section fifty four over ninety one that er of the ninety act he is now obliged to refer it to the secretary of state
but what have the county council done
they've already written to the secretary of state and said dear secretary of state we're going to send this to you because it is a departure but please secretary of state do not call it in do not exercise your powers
and that is in the teeth of the stated wish of these communities
i cannot for the life of me see this is a reasonable attitude on the part of the county council
UNK
it is not responsive to the local communities and it is totally lacking in democracy
stewart joins us on the line now good morning mr
good morning
you live in south UNK i understand one of the
i do
the villages concerned
the point you'd like to make
well er the first one is that er the mr says that it those people with two mile away from this er tip er will not be affected
now most of this tip is in the parish of south UNK er so i take it he means he doesn't count those people
and the majority of those have objected are in the area of that two miles
we'll let his answer that
no i'm not ignoring them but what i'm saying is that problems that people are genuinely concerned about of dust or noise are unlikely to have an impact at a distance of two miles
very unlikely if it is properly controlled in terms of UNK of materials on site then certainly at two miles i don't believe there will be a problem
er ha i can imagine what you would say if it was in two miles of your property as to whether these UNK would affect you or not
but apart from that er this area is a flat plane
there's practically nothing between the residence of south UNK and the horizon with the exception of this hundred foot UNK that will exist
and i do erm support peter that in my view the er district council and yourselves have not listened and i don't believe the county council are going to listen to the objections of the local community
john what can you do in the face of such UNK
well i'm very disappointed about that i mean we're listening to the local community we're reporting the local communities views but at the end of day south UNK parish council have in fact UNK their views
they it's always argued that the parish councils are closest to local people they had an out and out objection from the parish council initially they have subsequently written to me twice in november UNK that position and saying subject to UNK they no longer have an UNK objection
well UNK on the parish council aren't you stewart
yes i am
er yes well that is so this did come through er very late indeed er in the and the parish council of course are in the situation where they have to cover all UNK and what er mr is referring to is a suggestion of using a one o six agreement to protect as far as possible the local communities when the tip is UNK
it didn't change the actual view of the people in the village
it was the parish council themselves who had to consider things very quickly and go for what they could best endeavour but you c er i can't see how that can be used to UNK the general view of the public of south UNK and the other parishes
well i mean i quote from the nineteenth of november letter from the parish council the parish council fully support the environmental recommendations from the district council
now we all know what the district council view is
the district council view is quite clearly support the application but be tough on the details
to me that means that the parish council have moved qu a long way from their UNK objection lodged in the summer
point there because the environmental er considerations of the district council are of course those of the environmental health officer and those that is the report which raises considerable er concern about the dust blow problem and the UNK content of the material to be delivered into this tip
and that is where the parish council were coming from
if i can just endorse what stewart was saying the parish council talked to me as their consultant for a while and said look it seems that with the with the actions of the er county council writing to the secretary of state to UNK the call in procedures and the attitude of the district council that this thing might well get local planning permission
can we in the alternative put our case if that is a UNK then there must be something for the local communities to be derived from this and therefore we went for protection under one o six agreement as stewart quite rightly refers to and we also went for the dedication of large areas of the UNK heap for UNK and for public open space
but that was purely in the alternative to a public inquiry in the first instance with the possibility of alternative means of disposal coming forward and being accepted
and i don't think the parish council's case has been UNK in that instance
it is a perfectly reasonable attitude to adopt in the light of all of the circumstances
john
well er as i say the position of the parish council the fact that there have been so many objections are fully reported in the committee papers today
members will take them into account when they come to a decision
but at the end of the day er my view is that on balance there is a case for this application to go forward
peter one final question probably to you
where can you take your campaign if today's meeting at county hall in about forty minutes which i know you've got to dash off and get ready for erm where can you take your campaign the joint villages action committee's campaign if erm the meeting today gives the tip at UNK woods approval
well we've heard what edward has had to say and the local communities i'm certain draw great comfort from that and we wait and see whether brussels will exercise its powers quite legitimately in my view and call this in
er in the alternative of course er the local communities have available er the high court action which i've referred to during several discussions with yourselves over the last week or two
erm those are the issues which will have to be very carefully balanced
i would hope however that the committee members at north yorkshire will see that the local feeling is so deep that the project itself cannot be UNK by a public inquiry and they will make er they will take the decisions which will put this application in that direction and send that message very clearly to the secretary of state
john and so far so far as you're concerned the local people are not going to get that public inquiry are they
well no that's a UNK that's a member decision
why
er but i UNK that the county council is UNK to local concerns
we have got to balance environmental issues and economic issues we've got a coal field that is a successful coal field it has a severe problem
we're trying to work to resolve that problem with minimal impact in the environment and that's what my recommendations are leading to that's what if it is approved my officers will be ensuring happens if it last twenty years
how do you feel about the possible threat of intervention from europe or even a high court action
well i don't believe that they would succeed because i think that we have taken account of all the views expressed and that members will be making an informed decision today
certainly to the best of my knowledge we have fully UNK with all the legislation
can you give us any idea of the time scale of when we might learn that decision
well it will be sent off to the secretary of state in theory he has twenty one days in practice i suspect it will be mid january at least before we learn
we shall UNK it with interest
john thank you very much indeed for answering er everybody's questions this morning
nice to talk to you bye
thank you good bye
that's john the county planning officer for north yorkshire and before that the minerals plan er planning consultant from the UNK group peter
one final comment comes from er frank from er south UNK
good morning mr
good morning
the point you'd like to make
er following on er what er stewart said as a member of the parish council i think the feeling er was given by john that the parish council were now against this scheme
i would just like to quote from a circular that was sent round to every resident in south UNK by the parish council
and it says message to local residents from the parish council
the county planning committee meet on the seventh of december to cons to consider british coal application for colliery waste at UNK wood
south UNK parish council whilst being totally opposed to the scheme decided in the best interests of their residents to make the following observations to county and that is where they've built in the UNK but they are totally opposed to the scheme
what will your action be from a local point of view
erm i've asked erm your expert who's representing the village the UNK interests peter
whereabouts will you take erm your action personally at a local
well obvious
local level
obviously we will be guided by our consultants but this er view of is er meeting with er great success in the villages because obviously er we feel that if there is a public inquiry then we stand a better chance of british coal sticking to the promises made when they had the original planning application and removing all waste by train to suitable sites and there's one at UNK which is waiting for the material
and
thank
and that's what we want to happen
frank thank you very much indeed for joining us on the programme this morning
thank you good morning
thank you t good morning to you sir
formal just how it should be on the b c thank you very much indeed to everybody erm joining in that debate
and i'm not sure that personally i'm put my hands up and say that i'd understand all the issues but i understand some of the basic principles and i'm beginning to understand er some of the UNK of a planning issue like this
i hope you enjoyed that discussion i mean well first of all if you live in the selby area it's been of relevance to you and you've managed to hear what both sides are saying but i hope even if you don't live in the selby area it's er you've er found it as fascinating as i have to hear the UNK and cons of such a complex issue
erm a reminder to you that the lines will open at a quarter to nine on erm york six four one six four one tomorrow morning if er you have points you'd like to make
we've still got er a couple of calls i think to come before the end of er this morning's programme on the subject of erm i don't know whether it's life UNK or er on er on divorce
we'll find out in a moment or twos time
there's a moment before the traffic and travel news now for me to remind you that erm if you're the chairman or the secretary or whatever it happens to be of a particular group whether it be erm the local amateur UNK society or er a north yorkshire charity and you'd like the opportunity to have some prime time publicity for what you're doing particularly in the run up to the christmas period
michael heseltine the president of the board of trade has found another industry in which to intervene
next wednesday a score of television UNK will meet him at a special seminar at the department of trade and industry part of the d t i's efforts to boost british exports
british television is almost as widely UNK abroad as it is at home
its reputation UNK on UNK programmes often made as international co UNK like david UNK natural history series
britain used to have a comfortable trade surplus in television programmes
twenty four million pounds in nineteen eighty five
but by nineteen ninety one that had turned in to a deficit of a hundred million and one prediction suggests the deficit would have UNK dramatically to six hundred and forty million pounds by the end of the decade
largely because of satellite television with its high number of feature films and u s and australian programmes
but many british programmes especially UNK don't travel well in the opposite direction
british UNK fighting a UNK battle at home want shows guaranteed to appeal to british audiences
british producers have little choice but to go for the home market because the lion share of their budgets comes from the b c i t v or channel four who commission the programmes in the first place
the bias erm of british producers towards producing for a british market is likely to persist erm historically it's been very difficult for all but er select minority to achieve significant sells sales overseas
erm and again i doubt whether that will disappear over night
it's a cultural as much as a commercial problem
no amount of government intervention will change it
but UNK meeting could suggest ways to stop things getting worse
the government might offer tax breaks to britain's UNK film industry
feature films do have export potential even if television programmes don't
and the i t v companies won't miss an opportunity to push for a relaxation of the rules which prevent one large i t v company UNK with another
as it is they say british UNK are far too small to compete effectively in export markets or to resist overseas UNK
and the UNK threat doesn't just come from foreign television companies but from cable companies and even phone companies as well
thanks to the much talked about convergence of broadcasting UNK and computing
american UNK like bell atlantic are quite open about their global ambitions
we absolutely have plans
and we are absolutely having conversations with carriers throughout the world
not just in england but throughout the world about taking the technology we're developing and the UNK services and UNK them on their systems
and the whole business of convergence raises the UNK question of who ought to regulate this UNK new industry
in britain neither the independent television commission nor the telephone UNK seems entirely appropriate
a single body UNK on the u s federal communications commission would make more sense
and a british f c would fit much more naturally into the department of UNK portfolio than into that of the department of national heritage which currently looks after broadcasting
perhaps mr UNK sudden interest in television is motivated by more than a simple desire to boost british exports
bright intervals are possible and apart from the chance of a light shower it should stay dry UNK than of late with a top temperature of eleven celsius fifty two fahrenheit in a moderate south UNK wind
UNK and UNK fog will form tonight and UNK is likely in places too
the overnight low eight celsius that's forty six degrees fahrenheit
good afternoon from the county's favourite station it's half past twelve
radio nottingham news headlines with alison ford
calverton colliery is to close in just three weeks' time
the proposed closure was confirmed just twenty four hours after british coal announced the pit was to go into the review procedure and revealed that it's lost more than six million pounds in the last six months
british UNK midlands group director john UNK has recommended that calverton should cease production by november the nineteenth

a member of staff has been suspended from a centre for the handicapped in nottinghamshire pending an internal investigation
the probe at UNK training centre in UNK follows a police investigation at UNK lane residential unit in mansfield
nottinghamshire county council won't confirm what the latest allegations are

a nottingham car salesman who went with two UNK aged fourteen and fifteen has been UNK for three years
forty seven year old john house of UNK drive in UNK denied having unlawful sexual UNK with the girls but was found guilty at nottingham crown court
recorded crime in england and wales rose by three point eight per cent in the year to june
home office figures put the total of offences at a record five point seven million but the rate of increase showed a sharp drop on the two previous years and more than half the recorded crime was either theft of or from vehicles
and nottinghamshire's business leaders are the least confident in the east midlands about the prospects of increased sales according to a survey by the accountants price waterhouse
the survey also says that ten per cent of the county's companies think the market will actually contract in the next six months

now it's erm twelve thirty four let's go back to the news this lunchtime
as we've just heard in the headlines nottinghamshire police have taken the unusual step of UNK a recording of a girl they believe has made at least a dozen calls claiming she's given birth
the initial call was made to the UNK hospital in UNK in ashfield on saturday night
since then she's contact nottinghamshire and lincolnshire police and the lincoln county hospital

acting detective superintendent mick UNK is leading the enquiry he's been talking to nigel bell and telling him they're convinced that the same girl has made all the phone calls
we sent er our er receptionist to lincoln to listen to the tape recording
er she'd held the girl in conversation at mansfield er for quite a while and she's listened to the tape and she's convinced it's the same girl
given the amount of calls and the fact that they're UNK in different areas it seems a lot of trouble to go through if it was a UNK
yes exactly and er you've heard the tape er she sounds very UNK er and we're concerned for her welfare
when was the last telephone call made
on monday evening we had all these calls over a three day period
what's come out in the in the telephone call which you recorded was that er the father baby she is UNK is actually her own father what do you think do you think that puts her in any danger the fact that you're making this public that the father may hear this
that's a possibility but this has been talked through with both the social services and the hospital and er we've decided to take that chance
in terms of your inquiries where have you been trying to get information from
what about local schools in the area
we've been in touch with all the local schools in the in the mansfield area er we've followed up inquiries of girls that have not been at school and so on and er these er have led to er to nothing
she says that she lives in a on the estate on the UNK of mansfield have you been checking around that area
yes but of course we've got a number of estates er around the mansfield er but we have made inquiries we've er we've made appeals through the press and the radio as you well know
are there any leads at the moment
none at all only the er the tape recorded message that she er left with the er police at lincoln
given the prospect that her father is actually the father of this child do you that she'll still be at home
i've no idea i can't er i can't say whether she would be at home or not
what about assurances then she's obviously UNK she thinks that she's going to be in trouble if she come to the police
well i'm bothered about her health and that and that's what i must emphasize to her if she's listening that er as far as we're concerned we would want to just give her some sympathy advice and support in relation to this matter
well what about family ties family ties are strong if she's worried her father's going to get into trouble as well
yes i can appreciate that but at this moment i'm not worried or bothered about any UNK in relation to this matter i'm bothered about the ch the child's er health
she can contact the hospital or the social services where who've agreed to er to talk to her and give her all the advice and comfort that she needs
from your point of view apart from waiting for further calls from her what can the police do
well we're still continuing to monitor the situation we're still carrying on inquiries at er at schools we're going further UNK now in case there is some suggestion that she might be living further UNK er towards UNK or even in towards derbyshire

now would i geoff do you think i really would do you then
well i would hope not actually that's a relief so er so tell us what we're talking about today
well i'm going to suggest going back to education
returning to learning is not easy for everyone especially if you've had time out to bring up your kids
you may need a lot of confidence a lot of support and you might even need some help looking after your children if they're quite young
well if you live in UNK towns then i've got details of an organization that can help out with all those things and help you get back onto the learning ladder and maybe into a job
all right then tell us who they are and what they do
okay well there's something we talk about a lot on the action line they're called fast forward and they're a training agency
they run courses especially for people who might find it difficult to do a course at their local college because of things like language difficulties and the fact that you might have children to look after
david is an education and training development worker for fast forward
here he is to explain what fast forward do and why they're needed
there are a lot of barriers that exist between people and training some of them could be things like they don't have access to child care it could be they lack confidence so we go for support and we can offer training which is local we can offer language support
basically we try to break down any barriers that might exist between local people and the training opportunities that do exist
that was david who works for fast forward
it sounds really good because as david said you choose the course and they'll help you out with all the practical things like child care and travel expenses
what about the actual courses though what kind of courses can you do
well they've got er links with six colleges so they can offer you more or less anything from management to catering to UNK
they've got erm an adult literacy course if you want to brush up on your reading and your writing they've got computer courses they've got a course in sound engineering and a works skills for women course which is what sarah did
well it involved a lot of things a bit of everything
typing and word processing everything really
it was very good very good for women that have been home for a long time and want to get their confidence back
at the end you know what you want and you get your child care and your travel care
i go to college now i'm doing my g c s es and i'm enjoying them very much and i'm glad i went onto that course first
that was sarah who did the works skills for women course at fast forward and that's now helped her to get on to some g c s e courses at college
can anyone go along to fast forward then is it open to all UNK
yep erm well anyone can go along but you do have to live in UNK or st UNK
you don't need any qualifications or anything like that
if this is you and you'd like to get back into education and get on a course why not go along to fast forward
they can help you with your training needs your child care and your travel and they can also provide the support you need if you're not confident about going back to learning
here's sarah again
i didn't want to stay at home i wanted to get back into education and i didn't know how to the easiest way i suppose
it was so scary coming you know all them years staying at home you lose all your confidence and it's a very good way and i recommend all women to do that who are like me children and have been home that long
my family was very supportive my mum was very happy that i was doing something for myself later on in my life it will help me very much and my husband was very good
that was sarah talking about her course at fast forward
now if this sounds like it could be the kind of course you need call action line and they'll put you in touch with the people at fast forward and once you've got the training and the qualifications the next thing is the application form isn't it and you've got details as well today of someone who can help with that haven't you
that's right trying to find work these days can be demanding and extremely frustrating so you want to make sure that you give yourself the best chance of getting a job and one way to help is to do a good application form and know how to handle yourself in an interview
well there's an organization in UNK who can help out with both of these things they're called a t o training and they can tell you all you need to know about things like application forms and interview techniques as well as advice about further education and wan t what to do if you want to start your own business
now fast forward was for everyone wasn't it this one isn't
no it isn't
first of all you have to be unemployed and you have to be black or asian
now it's especially for people who are black or asian because a lot of the time they miss out on the opportunities that are available to a lot of other people because of things like language barriers and although you might think it's unfair it's not actually illegal
the race relations act says that you can do this you can have courses especially for black or asian people so as i said you have to be unemployed you have to be black or asian and you have to live in either UNK green st UNK or UNK
i'll just say those again it's UNK green st UNK or UNK
if this is you and you'd like some help or advice about interviews and application forms then call us on nottingham four double one two double two and we'll put in touch with a t o training and if this isn't you if you're not black or asian and you would like some help then you can call us as well and we'll try and find something for you
all right four double one two double two to call radio nottingham's action line if you want to know any more about fast forward and the courses available there and how you can get on them or if you want to know about a t o training as well four double one two double two and try and call action line before four o'clock this afternoon if you can

good afternoon from nottinghamshire's favourite radio station
at one o'clock it's the headlines this lunchtime it's announced that calverton UNK to close before the end of the month
the police appeal for the UNK help in identifying the voice of a girl who rung a nottinghamshire hospital claiming she'd had a baby and a member of staff is suspended from a centre for the handicapped in nottinghamshire pending an internal investigation
they're the headlines today the details from alison ford
calverton colliery is to close in just over two weeks' time
the closure has been confirmed twenty four hours after british coal announced the pit was to go into the review procedure and revealed that it's lost more than six million pounds in the last six months
union leaders at the pit say they'll challenge the closure by taking legal action
sarah UNK reports
british UNK midlands group director john UNK has recommended that calverton should cease production by november the nineteenth
he says continuing heavy losses and falling markets have given him no option but to propose that the six hundred and forty man pit should close
the union leaders he met today at calverton miners welfare say they'll challenge the closure through the pit review procedure
but even if that lasts the full nine months british coal has the final say on whether the pit should be shut down
nottinghamshire police have released a recording of a girl they believed called the UNK hospital at UNK in ashfield claiming she'd had a baby
they think it's the same UNK who's made at least a dozen calls to the police and a hospital in lincolnshire since reporting the birth at the weekend
this report from nigel bell
i was the one that killed it and i didn't
he was the one that got me pregnant
this is the voice of the girl that sometimes uses the name UNK and sometimes linda
she says she's fourteen and that the father of the child is her own dad
acting detective superintendent mick UNK says they realize the girl could be in danger but believe it's necessary to UNK the recording
this has been talked through but with both the social services and the hospital and er we decided to take that chance
they've checked schools and housing estates in the mansfield area but say they've no leads
half a dozen officers are investigating the case but police forces across the east midlands are on standby
mick UNK is urging anyone who recognizes this voice to contact the police
there's a free phone number o eight hundred six two six nine
every time i've run away from home and then every time you lot have took me back home and then i end up getting pregnant
at the james UNK murder trial in preston the jury has been told how two the two eleven year old defendants UNK an elderly woman shortly before they allegedly UNK james UNK
they've denied UNK and murdering james also attempting to UNK another child
kevin bucket reports
the court has been today hearing evidence from witnesses building up a picture of what the who defendants were doing in the hours before the alleged UNK of james UNK
a qualified nurse UNK said that she and two other woman had been running a stall in the UNK strand shopping centre
at one point an elderly woman was looking at the display when the two defendants starting UNK her
miss UNK said the defendants were in some way UNK the woman from behind she UNK round as if to hit the children with her bag and they ran off
another witness mrs angela UNK said she saw the defendants shouting and behaving UNK
she said one of them spoke to her own four year old child
it's alleged that later in the day the defendants UNK james UNK took him to a railway UNK and murdered him
the case is continuing
a member of staff has been suspended from a centre for the handicapped in nottinghamshire pending an internal investigation
the probe by the county council at UNK training centre in UNK follows a police investigation at stone cross lane residential unit in mansfield
rob UNK reports
nottinghamshire county council won't confirm what the latest allegations are about but it's been reported that they centre on fraud and sexual harassment at UNK
an inquiry is being conducted internally at the council run centre and police have not been called in
however two weeks ago they were called in to investigate claims of physical abuse at stone cross lane residential unit in mansfield a warden run complex for mentally handicapped adults
