throughout my political life i've received UNK sustained help from the g m b in a very real sense the union has been my political family
now i've UNK for a moment on my own experience because i think it UNK that of the labour party as a whole from to john the g m b has been a tower of strength always there to assist not only with money and resources but also with advice and support and on behalf of my parliamentary colleagues i want to thank the union for all it is it has done for the labour party
and i want to stress this morning how essential it is that the link between the labour party and the unions be maintained
now there have been some allegations flying around that there are people in the parliamentary labour party who want to get rid of that link and i want to UNK say that there is no serious figure in the labour party who shares that opinion there's no one in the g m b group who takes that view there's no one in the shadow cabinet and what is more i know from my own personal experience and my dealings with him over thirty years that there is no greater supporter of the trades union link than john smith himself
it was UNK who said that the labour party grew out of the bowels of the trades union movement
but it isn't just a matter of history
there are strong practical arguments for the link today for the trades unions trades union involvement in the party ensures that trades union interests are represented in parliament
in addition unions have wider social and political concerns and objectives beyond collective bargaining which are best represented through the labour party
for their part for the for the part of the labour party trades unionists provide a solid and substantial electoral base which will hopefully increase during the nineteen nineties
and there is also the crucial issue of political financing which we've heard about already this morning and which is such a UNK question in french spanish and italian politics now everybody wants to see more money coming from an expanded er political membership
there is also the case for state financing which is the position of the party but for the UNK future the labour party will need trades union money and as steve said even our UNK critics have to admit that the money the union gives to the party is open and above board and that's more than can be said of the money that's used to finance the conservative party
the tories don't publish proper accounts
there are UNK stories of donations from dubious sources including communist china and UNK
indeed UNK the only reliable evidence of who has given money to the tory party is the UNK list which is published twice a year
but as important as our joint interests are our shared values and i think a very good example of this is our common approach er to the question of the social chapter for which the labour opposition led i may say by two leading g m b UNK jack and george the labour opposition has fought long and hard for this in parliament indeed we have secured a vote on the question er after the queen's UNK and last month i myself as a guest of the danish social democrats took the argument to the continent in the danish referendum in the second danish UNK referendum which i'm very glad to say was won
all of us in the european socialist movement in the european trades union movement UNK that employees are not just units of production but are entitled to rights at work across the european community
so the real question facing us at the moment is not whether there should be a relationship or whether there should be a link but in what way we should UNK it and arrange it today
our constitutional arrangements were established as long ago as nineteen eighteen though it's true of course that they were amended in nineteen eighty one
but i think it's fair to say that the changes in the n nine early nineteen eighties particularly those which gave the unions a UNK position in choosing the leader were not of the UNK making certainly not of the g m b's making as i know from personal experience at the time
i think that in the nineteen nineties there is agreement that some reform is need is needed that there should be a better balance between the different groups at conference and that decision making in the parties should be seen to be democratic open and based on one person one vote
but it's no secret however and er we've heard UNK of that this morning that there is a lively debate as to the pre precise details of what a reform package should be
john smith the leader of our party has put forward his own personal preference for one member one vote for the selection of candidates with a special cut rate for trades unionists who pay the political levy
now his view obviously has to be seriously considered put forward as it is by a leader who has the support when he was elected of ninety percent of the party including ninety percent of the unions
so we will have to consider it
now speaking to you as chairman of the g m b parliamentary group i can tell you that we have met twice over the last few weeks on this issue of UNK and we are agreed on the need to avoid a damaging public row from which everybody yes including the unions will lose
what is clearly required is a constructive solution which provides a proper basis for UNK our joint relationships
and i think it is we would all agree that it is essential that an agreement which is acceptable to all sides is reached and i'm sure that it's going to be because let us not forget that we're not in business to remain in UNK opposition if we are to achieve proper rights for employees which have been so reduced by the conservatives if we are to save the welfare state which is now so under threat if we are to obtain decent health and education services which are also under threat if we are to create a strong economy and a strong recovery which provides the jobs which we so desperately need then we must win power
and with your help a UNK labour party will be in a very strong position to turn out this disastrous government working together we shall win we can win and we shall
thank you very much indeed
thank you very much indeed giles for that address
er colleagues before we turn to a period of er rule amendments and general motions could i just advise congress that a pair of UNK have been handed in er vision express look like well they could be ladies or gents multi sexual these days colleagues
very nice pair and a very nice brown case
i understand they were they're better than the general secretary's anyway
yours colleague
insert one row and copy and then insert another row and copy
you mean insert
insert
formulae
that's right
over on the other side erm you're given a range name
you got a formula
you see a range name erm average exchange let's say
so you same address divided by average exchange
if you copy that formula down to the cell below what would you see
erm
then whatever cell was below average exchange
erm it would jump down one unless you adding
that cell address divided by average exchange
the cell below
you copy it down
it down erm it would come down a different the wrong figure
so let's suppose you had c twenty six divided by average exchange
copy it down you see
e three divided by average exchange
that's getting on to the right
yes not an absolute
no
okay over to the other side
erm how do you check whether ho how do you check how much how big your disk is
what do you type precisely
c h two b s blank
right
okay
how do you find out what memory you've got
to develop into your spreadsheet
sorry
where's your systems
data
data status
no
changed your mind on that
right
check disk
no that's on the disk
it's you go into status
another unanimous
what the unanimous decision of the team
UNK status
UNK status
are you happy with that
yeah
happy with that
yeah
happy with that
yeah
yeah i'll give you that
don't put you off
right erm how does memory get used in one two three release two
rapidly
it may be true not the answer we need
is it column blocks
column blocks
okay
bit more
one
what's the key thing about memory how it's used
it uses up all the gaps in between the gaps
the gaps in between
that's what i was after
right
okay how does release three and want to check the windows differ
it doesn't use the gap it doesn't use up the gaps between erm the distance working
big distances
what defines what's a big distance
that's right is it
when he fills up the gaps within the five hundred and twelve row blocks he gets
okay
er why can't you use all of your expanded memory
yeah
out the room
i think it's because it can't address it
i went out next
no you were all in here at the time
on the phone
oh were you
oh you might have been
i but most of you were certainly here
got as far as you could only use five hundred and forty odd or something was it
saying you could probably only use practically only five hundred k
why
because your main memory won't take all the expanded memory anyway
will it
it will only expand take something
er i'm not with you sorry
i'll pass it across
could you UNK some
yes
when your conventional memory runs up you can't put more into expanded memory
what wh feeling slightly bigger you get three and a half but er what goes into UNK what goes into conventional memory
what uses up the conventional memory
spreadsheet
well i can't deny that
like erm all the extras
the additional things
er it wasn't what i was after
certain things to go
yes
okay
yes
like formulae and things
so what doesn't go into expanded memory then
data
it is the actual text the input bit
that's supposed to go into the expanded memory
oh
what did i say doesn't go into expanded memory
numbers
well
labels
it's partly true but
labels
no
no i think you're on the wrong track
is your conventional memory
what does what only goes into conventional memory not into expanded
erm i'd better tell you
it's the sixteen bytes block
that's the minimum amount of memory that gets used
that is used solely out of conventional
i'll give you half anyway
right er same again
erm
if you find yourself running out of memory and you're working on a spreadsheet for a while what should you do
save it and retrieve it
save it and retrieve it that's the one yes
right why's that
the other side
why should what does it do if you save and retrieve
or what i want to know is but the question is
you take anything that you've in that you've UNK on it and then put it back in
yes when you erase something it doesn't free up the memory straight away
okay
erm when you erm erase a cell with range erase
what do you get rid of
everything
just typing with any erm
you get rid of the format
you get rid of when you do range erase
no you don't no you don't
range erase you just get rid of what's in the cell
you don't get rid of the format
memory in
right
yes that's right
you don't get rid of the format
okay fine very generous there
er erm right
how do you get rid of what's the best what did i say was the best way of getting rid of everything out of the cell
copy it all in to
blank cell
copy a blank cell
that's blank in what way is it blank
no formula
no formula and what else is not
not protected
no protect
no labels
no
no protect is that what you mean
whatever
top there
there's no what at the top
no us or
no u that be UNK
right and no format
right okay
i'll give you that
erm
how do you get rid of deadwood
you chop
what's that
i'll take a guess at you want and then it deadwood
exact part of the spreadsheet
can do
that's one way
how exactly do you do the extract
or what menu options do you choose
slash range
so the other question enter extract
file name extract it all in one go
file name
formulae or
oh values or formula
values
which of the two
well formulae will take the labels and everything
values will just take the figures
there's no formulae i know that
so which one you want then
formula
formula
right
okey doke
alright i'll give you that
that's one way of doing it
er what's an another way
getting rid of deadwood
clearing columns and rows
if you've done a UNK
you should be able to clear all columns the rows to the right of your
oh right erase
coming down yeah
all those different ranges
yeah
would you say
right
okey UNK
erm i can't think of any questions there
er how can you have eight k more memory than most of you seem to have
rather than print the erm
yeah
without getting the print wrong
how do you
one two three
right that's it
good
right
okey doke
that's the end of the competition
picked the right one on that one as well didn't i
most of them were wrong on this one right
i missed some questions out right
linking files copying data from one file to another in various ways
erm so there's various methods we'll go into specific methods in a minute but er when you are passing data from one file to another you ought to use passing and receiving areas
this is the same in the same way that we had passing and receiving areas of passing data from one part of a spreadsheet to another part of a spreadsheet
erm so you bring all the data down passing over the simple formulae and then do one copy
so file combine is the method
you've had a look at that before
combine at range try and arrange all the files into another file
you only need to one file combine that's one advantage instead of three so it's about three times quicker
but er there's also an advantage of passing and receiving areas as there is before
er all to keep in clear order where information was going to and from
erm instead of you can combine directly a range from one file into another file
you can also er another method you could while you're working on this file use extract to save that range of that file to a separate file and then when you retrieve this file you can com you combine this file here
this small file to there
so you can either go that way or you go direct
erm the advantage of this way is it tends to confuse most of the time but it's a lot quicker
it only takes half a second to save that relatively small range
that small file and it only takes half a second to combine that relatively small file to there
but it might take half a minute to combine this range from this relatively large file
so in terms of overall computer speed that method could be quicker but i don't recommend you use it actually because it's risky
it's risky in the sense that you change this file
you save it but you forget to extract that range to a separate file
and then go to this file and then you combine in this file here to there and you don't realize it's an old copy
that's a risk that's where you get the wrong answers
when you when you expect that takes the copy back in the old file
oh it does
when you do file extract just er saving part it's not removing it from this
its copying it though
just copying it yes
like you do a file save
when you do a file save
your file doesn't disappear
right now the specific methods file combine is one method
er file combine has its problems though
anybody had any problems with file combine
yeah
what's the problem you had
the that sometimes you can get combine figures with file display but it doesn't combine correctly or edit properly or edit formulae
formulae
right that's the problem
formulae
er let's look at this spreadsheet here
i've got an input number there
a number on the grid
in that cell i've got a formula just multiply the number above by the number of the left
then got a label and then got another formula in a cell
i want to copy those four numbers into another file
so you each give those four cells a range name which i have already done
range name create data
it's not my normal name if you notice but the name those four cells data okey doke
and er i'll save the file and er i want to copy that data let's say to here
put the cell point in there
if i do a file combine and then copy and then just part of the file so it's name you'll specify the range
what range
it's the range the range name data
so i'll type that in
now what's the name of the file
well the file is called f c v press enter and there's the hundred that's fine but this should have a thirty in it it's got a zero in it
the reason being is that it's copied for formula across see at the top f eight time e nine and that formula has gone and UNK straight away
it's multiplied a hundred above by a blank cell on the left and you get zero
so that's why it's copied the formulas across
i didn't want the formulae
i was just wanted the numbers
menu
there isn't an option unfortunately erm er one potential solution er which may well work is to use file combine add instead of copy let's have a go with that one
add main range data file f c v and ah there we've got the right numbers a hundred and a thirty
look in the top left there's no formulae
not that we want it just the number that's fine
er what we haven't got though is a label there
there was a label in that cell er file combine add doesn't copy labels
it doesn't copy formulae it doesn't copy labels either
but if you don't need labels then file combine add is an acceptable way of coping the data across
i just want to tell you time i done that done that on a number of spreadsheets compared with the same label on one on one
yeah that had a label in the cell if i had a b c in that cell
if i was to do a file combine add again
file combine add take range
take f c v it doesn't know i've written the a b c
right
so it any whenever i have a cell put a label in
oh
it or a formula in it
what it also does as you see is it adds what you combine combining two of what's on the spreadsheet
so it's got two hundred there now
so before you do a file combine add you need to erase first and then do the file combine add
so that it doesn't add the numbers to what's on the screen
now if you do want labels as well as the numbers
what you doing to do
well this is the solution
you set UNK to manual first
you put a slash UNK global UNK and manual and then you do your file combine copy again
file
combine
copy
name range
data and f c v then file
right so there's all the right numbers and the label
still copy the formulas across you notice
but the formulas haven't calculated yet
sorted out in your calculator as soon as you combine them
what i need to do therefore is get rid of the formulae just leave the numbers there
how do you do that
er how do i get rid of these formulae that one and that one but leave the numbers there
or some value
something value yes
erm
range value
range value yes that's it
you do slash range value
it works just like copy does
with one difference
what's the difference
exactly the same as copy but there's one difference
the way copy works
copy
anything said at the back
yes it is
it doesn't copy the formulae
it doesn't copy the formulae
yes that's the difference between copy and range value
so erm highlight what you want to copy which is that and then ask where do you want to copy to
so where should i copy to
same place
the same place that's it
normally when you copy you copy somewhere different er which i could do but er i'm gonna copy it to the same place
so i just press enter
if you copy it to a different place does it leave the blank formulas
in the original place yes
somewhere else
use the second one just with the numbers that's right yes
but i've copied over to the same place what it seems to be doing provided the cell pointed out you're looking at the top left
you don't see the formulae any more just the number if there's one there
so that's the solution
you set UNK to manual do the file from my own copy and then use range value to remove formulae so that's the file combining method
getting data across we'll go on to another way of getting data across from one file to another is with a special type of formula
like this one at the top
if i type that formula in a cell on a spreadsheet
what's the two the name of the file two greater than the cell address and it er gets to the data from that cell and that other file
have you ever done used these formulae
anybody used them
by linking formulae
you've used them
linking files together
for linking files together
right and there's various UNK and cons to be aware of
so that's rather good
so let's demonstrate first of all how they work
i've got a file named sales one
here it is and erm leave these er on this row er twenty five i've got a total sales figures and it's that total sales figure there that i want to pass across into another file
let me save this file
that's the cell c twenty five that bears the total
i've got a file called income two and let me just erase what's here first of all
right so we'll type a formula into this cell this is where i want the total sales figure to be
so type plus two less UNK the name of the file which is sales one two greater UNK and a cell address c twenty five and then enter and that number one five four is you got from that file sales one in cell c twenty five and i can copy that formula to the right just like any other formula i can copy it
erm there we go and er we copy right c twenty five e twenty five that's it
let me save this file
letting me go back to the sales file
have to change some of the numbers
right let's save the file
let's retrieve the er other file back again and as soon as you retrieve it updated it data from the other file
so as you retrieve it it's updated the file
that sounds very good
you didn't have to press any buttons it just did it
shouldn't that be a range name instead of a cell address
er well yes we'll come to that
wh why might you want to do that
of spreadsheets are
sorry
well a group of spreadsheets
you put re you would want to put range names on the cell
instead of c twenty five you have a range name
is that what you mean
yeah well i UNK combine at the moment the range names
a number of range names from a number of
you file combine
yeah
oh i think what you're trying to say is can you combine a whole range and not just one cell
right
well i'll come back to that
let me go back to er the UNK er the sales file
let's say we're gonna research a number of products
the product er f write numbers
here we go
save it away
let's retrieve the other one back again the numbers
absolute type
that's right erm i can save it with the row on the other files but the total is now on row twenty six but this is still referring to the same cells c twenty five
oh
the row twenty five is no now contains a dash blind
erm so that's not very good
erm at least i spotted it here and i can rea realize what the problem is
change that to a twenty six and then copy this er right
but er you might not have spotted it and furthermore you might have er referred to another row that contains numbers
here it was obvious that something was wrong because you saw a dash
but you could have er be er could now be referring to a different row that happens to have the same numbers in
might not seen obviously wrong
so therefore you get wrong answers
so this is a big risk with these highlighted formulas if you do it this way
of course we're always going to be UNK and UNK and moving things about so er the risk of this happening will be very high
but there is a solution and that's to use range names
so let's go back to the file again
er i could name that cell with a range name that cell there the first cell
range name create erm in fact i've already done it
th this cell erm c twenty six i've named cell zero one
that cell there
name cell zero one
cell zero two
name that one
e twenty six i've named zero three and so on
that's my normal naming convention my normal naming convention is use the first two letters w l w i've explained and l stands for linking
so you have to create a range name for each cell that you're going to link
let's go back to the other file er i'm going to put a range name in cell zero one on that one
cell zero two on that one
right so i i've put got the range names on the first two but not on the others
let's save this file and then retrieve the er other one back again
let's insert yet another product
type in the numbers save it retrieve the other one back again
so at least the first two cells are still picking up the right two numbers because we used the range names we've inserted a row on the other file but er we're still about range names found where those cells are
whereas here and in that range name it's still referring to row twenty six
so that's the solution
use the range names when you file formulae
sorry
i want to erm go ahead and put files formulae information three files one point one down
yes
can i do that
yes you can have UNK different opening formulae with a different part name in it
yes but no not into the one cell
you have to bring the two separate cells into
fourth cell total number
yeah
erm
you can't link a whole range to a whole range you can only have to one cell
so this a thing you won't like about it is that if you've got er thirteen columns and ten rows that means you have to create hundred and thirty range names which you won't enjoy doing
erm but you really need to do it cos the risk of things going wrong are very high you don't right let's file i wanted to say a fe a few things about one two three release three cos there are some differences on the windows products
when you retrieve the linked file one two three release three of four it doesn't automatically update itself and it does here
so what do you need to do in order to release three or four
one thing you can do is do file admin link and that goes and gets the data from the file on the disk
it takes it then
but i don't use it er because it's incredibly slow
it can measure it and wait hours
if you've got a if you're linked to a big file and you got a lot of linking formulae you can wait hours for it to finish
so you want to avoid it at all costs in release three of four
so what should you do
well in release three of four you can have more than one file open at the same time
let me show you
here's the first file that i've got this is the sales file and to bring the second file into memory in this one two three release three you do file open
that leaves this file in memory but brings another one into memory
er might as well move the next one in and that UNK got a file linking formulae which is updated cos of the files in the memory
let's just create a window so we can see both files on the screen at the same time
right so in the lower window we've got the sales file and the upper window we've got the income file
the linking formulae in that cell
if i change a number here you'll notice si since i change that number here it UNK through to the other file
the two files are in memory
when you change one the other automatically UNK through
so if you need to pass data across from one file to another in release three or four they don't convert the files and then they data transfers across virtually easy any questions on that
right er we got tea or coffee or a soft drink
ten fifteen minutes
how long do you need
well a little bit about managing your files
is there a tape recorder in here somewhere
has got it
by the wall here
oh right
that's why you're quiet over there is it
so a bit about managing your files
er you shouldn't put too many files in one directory cos then you can't find them when you're looking for a file
you see a whole list of files you can't retrieve you get a whole list of appearing
and er you probably retrieve half a dozen files before you find the one that you want
has this happened to you from time to time
you can't remember what you called a certain file and
yeah
it looks like it might be that one got to try that one
not the one
er is it this one
no
no it's not that one
you can retrieve quite a few wa waste a lot of time anyway
erm what you want to do is to create lots of directories and put different sets of files in different directories
are you familiar with directories
yeah
dos
making directories
erm the analogy is the filing cabinets
er you wouldn't have a great big stack of paper in the corner of the room
well er if you did then if you were looking for something you couldn't find where it was you know you'd have to UNK in and you take ages to find whatever you're looking for
but er if you file everything away in filing cabinets then er you can go to the right filing cabinet open the right UNK maybe there's some folders in there
pick out the right folder if it's got a tab on it
then maybe between various other pieces of paper you find the one that you're after
and find thing quickly
erm
so
erm you want to put your own computer files in directories in the same way
you ever created a directory
how do you do it
erm you have created a sub with dos
created a sub directory right
in erm dos do you do m d
m d that's right
space back slash
what does m d stand for
main directory
you if you get the c prompt
you've seen the c prompt have you
mhm
and you wanted to create a sub directory off the root directories known as root directories you would type m d space suppose you wanted to create a directory named put your budgets in
keep them in press enter
so that creates a sub directory off your root directory called put
you may have a list of directories as well off the root directory and then you've got a directory called one two three one two three programs in
mhm
and you may have some other directories
then if you've got one called dos
put the dos programs in there
all that all i can do is pick a file out of my come under one two three but if you do that in lotus you have to do the one two three first
no you can create a separate sub directory
i've got one two three and a black slash
but if you put two three
and i put in the sub directory
yeah that's what i mean you have to do it on one two three
no
no when you do make directories you just put you wouldn't save it into
oh i think it
saving it into one two three
yes but once you once you automatically
yeah
how do you get into dos
if you're in one two three of that suppose you wanted to make a directory
use it
how do you get into dos
we have to go out
i'd exit out
yeah
you could UNK
yeah
you could do but then you have to UNK one two three and re retrieve your spreadsheet and all the rest of it
if you choose system from the top menu that puts you into dos but it leaves one two three there
so you quickly get back so it's pointing at my one two three directory so if i do m d
yeah
if i do m d space put here it will create a sub directory below the one two three directory but if i want as a sub directory from the roots directory i have to type m d back slash put
that would make it off the root directory
erm
you can also point well you start you can point at the root directory if you wanted to
do you know how to do that
at the moment it's pointing at this one two three directory back slash p back slash one two three now you point at the root directory
you directory
you use
you do c d sorry i should have said m d if you want to make a directory off the root directory you type m d to make directory
if you want to point at another directory you do c d change directory and that's pointing at the root directory there
er so when i want to create a directory called put off the root directory
i can do m d space put
i've got a directory here now
you may want to put further sub directories below that maybe for different years ninety three ninety four ninety five
how do you how do you do that
back slash one two
don't you do
do the and then the back slash and then the
yes you can do er you can m d
put
put m d i can do back slash got a lot of space put here back slash ninety three
or you could you could point to that directory called put first of all
you do c d space put so you're pointing at that directory and then if you do m d ninety three m d space ninety three and then i've created a sub directory in ninety three below this directory
you do m d space ninety four and create that one and so on
and you can go further down under the ninety three and you may want to create further sub directories
so the put is like your filing cabinets
and these directories are like UNK in your filing cabinets and then you've got further sub directories still below that then er they're like folders within your er filing cabinet UNK
so you put your files in these different directories and then when you're looking for something er you'll find it more easily
if you're looking for a budget file for a particular year and you know where to look
how do you erm well to get back into lotus type exit and then enter hang on right back to the spreadsheet
how do i erm change it so that when i do file retrieve it lists directories in put ninety three
it lists files
if i do file retrieve it lists the files in put ninety three
that's the directory here
how do you do that
well you could type it all
what i do and then i could
sub directories er yes you could type er back slash
back slash put and then press enter and it lists the sub directories and you highlight that and press enter and then it would list where the files are in that directory of course i haven't got any we've just created those directories
erm but then ev every time i wanted to retrieve a file from that directory i'd have to type in that put and the ninety three and all the rest of it
how can i set it so that soon as i do file retrieve it lists the files from that directory
UNK file directory
put the name of the directory
erm
not files yeah the
well
UNK directory
you're almost right
UNK directory
erm
the file directory
yeah
you do file
directory
directory
yeah
here
so the UNK change the current directories
the current directories gotta be this one
if i wanted to point at the put directory
put ninety three
i type that in press enter
and then if i do file retrieve
bring that up and
it's listing files from that directory
yeah
straight away
sorry
what i've done in the past is erm for file retrieve and then erm on top of the original do a slash put and then enter and that then gives me a sub file
basically it lists the files on that directory yes
you have to type put every time
not like saying if you do this file directory type the put in then er you wouldn't have to type put in every time you retrieve the file from the directory
mm
right
let me just put the directory back to where it was
file directory right
erm
so the advantage of pu putting your files in different directories is you find things easily
one of the advantages
probably some others as well here
as regards to various er other UNK like UNK a set of files or copying a set of files if you don't want the ninety three files any more you just delete all the files in the directory
you don't have to pick out the ones that are ninety three cos th they're all ninety three in that particular directory
er another thing that's useful to do is to name your files in a particular way
have a convention for how you name your files
so the maximum length of the file name is what
eight
eight characters that's right
so you could use different characters of the file name to mean different things
er for example the e a year as part of the file name like eighty seven
erm you may well have got different directories for the different years
it's not a good idea to include the year as part of the file name as well because you might accidentally copy some files into the wrong directory
you might copy the ninety three file by accident into the ninety four directory
and if you've got the same file names and you're doing a copy in dos you just UNK them and you UNK the ninety four file with ninety three file there
but if each file has got a unique name then that can't happen so er if you copy the all the files in that directory have got nine four as part of the file name then if it's got nine three then er you won't be able to UNK any files you have two sets of files in there and you can sort it out later on
erm in this particular spreadsheet system there's a number of different files for different departments
so i've got the department number
just the two UNK number in this example
there's the second and the third character of the file name
if it was a s single UNK er department like department number six
i'd enter that as zero six
it always takes up the same number of positions in the file name and that's useful as you shall see
erm i may have budget files actual files forecast files
there's a letter to indicate er what that er is b for budget a for actual and f for forecasts
er the different types of files perhaps there's a maybe a payroll file i have a p there and i have a access file i have an a there
so when you're looking for a file you know you want oh yes it's for er department er thirty six er it's er payroll file it's for nineteen ninety four and it's budget
before you start looking for the file you know what the file name is
so when yo you get a list of the file you do a file retrieve they're all listed in UNK order
you can you UNK can very quickly focus in on the one you're after and you'd be sure that was the one and you retrieve it and it's there
very quickly
you don't have to retrieve any different files
go searching through long lists of file names to find what you're after
so that's one advantage of having a naming convention
you find what you're looking for quickly
erm another advantage is erm with various er UNK which is copying or UNK files
if i wanted to copy all of the department twenty two files to the a disk the floppy disk
in dos i could type copy space d twenty two star dot star to a you familiar with these er the UNK
what these mean
what does an UNK mean
the whole file
the whole whatever's on that erm
would be all d twenty two
it would have to begin d twenty two and anything that follows erm suppose you wanted to delete all the nineteen eighty seven files
what would you type in
in dos
you type UNK i'll give you that
then what
star dot
eighty seven
eighty seven
eighty seven
sorry
wh what eighty seven
whatever it is the department number whatever
well it's all UNK all different departments
erm eighty seven then what
dot star dot star
star dot star
you've delete your column eighty seven
erm
well it says are you sure
what do you say
no
that's an honest answer
it's not what you normally do is it
er most people when they see a question like are you sure they say course i'm sure yes
and er that does delete all the nineteen eighty seven files that's true
in fact though it UNK everything
it's the same as typing star dot star
which you probably recognize as being everything
says are you sure
mm
say yes it UNK everything
so save yourself a bit of time like that
and so that's not quite right
it UNK star dot eighty seven
star dot eighty seven
now as soon as you put the dot what you're saying is erm that's the extension
these are the last three characters and then into the extension the they're probably going to be w k one
ta take the UNK out
er in erm you need to use another UNK
do you know any other UNK other than an UNK
question mark
question mark
that's the one
now what would you type then
down
one two three four questions marks eighty seven
four question marks eighty seven
question mark
can do a question mark i suppose
i suppose in the year i needn't do a star a star if you wanted to
er so what that question mark means is
i'd had er strange life really
yes
but very
very interesting
but what
but what i find so interesting is because people talk nowadays as if it's only recently women have had jobs erm
yes
and careers
but you obviously had one
i've had one all my life
all your life
all my life you see
yes
that's what i find so interesting
yes mostly of course well
mm
it's all office work
yes
and er you see and anyway i finished up my holiday and the sergeant said he kept his promise and er sent me a report over the newspaper you see and er and of course and i liked the isle of man you know i went for trips around the island and various places and er and i did see a UNK cat
yes
no tail oh dear oh dear but you see then of course and i was still not married but you see i as i say then i went to cambridge and that's when i met my husband and all his family were so kind to me er he had erm two sisters living in a flat round the backs you've heard of round the backs
mm
haven't you
the back of kings college
i spent hours and hours around the flat back of kings college cambridge and er you see and we went sometimes for a service
his mother died when she was sixty unfortunately
or sixty two rather but his father lived until he was eighty six and his father was the district goods and passenger manager at cambridge and er later on of course er when he was old enough he was in the same office as his father was but not the same position you see but he was a clerk a railway clerk and his brother was UNK of colchester and his grandfather was also a UNK and that would be in queen UNK when railways first began and then again you see in those first days you see when there were UNK and that sort of thing erm UNK were issued with a UNK for their own safety you see and i've got one
really
yes
with
but i don't want er many people to know
no
about it because you see i don't want anyone breaking my door down and UNK in you don't know who's who these days do you and er but you see they that's how
so that i married into what you call a railway family
you did didn't you
i did yes
and er and so and er as i say er i've had a most wonderful life and i've been a widow now for ten years
it's ten years ago since i lost hugh but er i don't feel lonely er not really
well you've got so many friends and sisters haven't you
well i've got so many happy memories you see well then of course when hugh and i married you see er we had a UNK down at
oh really
yes and we u
that was that was divided into flats then was it then
oh no well there's an old lady lived there named mrs and her husband was a UNK
they called him father
at one time he lived at they lived at but er she was a widow and she was ninety but she was very good to us and but we had er we had UNK but there was a lock on both sides of the door you know what i mean we were quite self contained and we had er a narrow stairs and because of the war i couldn't you couldn't er i used to scrub the stairs down because you couldn't buy carpet in those days you see because of the war and to the shortage of stuff and so i used to keep those stairs nice and we had a we went as we went up these stairs erm it i suppose originally you see it would have been back stairs for the servants you see in the hall and this old lady used to go in and if ever she had the doctor she used to ask me if i would go and sit with her and hold her hand while the doctor came you see
she had other daughters in the town but she always wanted me and if ever she wanted anything to do with her papers and books and financial things she used to ask my husband to go in you see the day after we got there she brought us a huge dish like that with UNK which er grew f er well there are houses built there now but er at that time they had a big UNK there sort of a UNK er in it with a bunch of trees and you see and all these UNK grew you see and they were you know they're nice you see
we paid rent to be there and er and of course either hugh or me or both of us came up to see my mother every day you see unless we knew she was going to have a visitor and then we used to take a day off
mm
and we'd go off to felixstowe or somewhere but you see we still went away because he had four first class passes a year
mm
being on the railway and er you see er and of course i went then under his pass i suppose mr and mrs then and er and then of course we started to er when my parents first died we started to get around
yes
you see and so we went to oh UNK aberdeen and across to the isle of UNK and down the UNK and back across the water to UNK you see and er then we stayed one time at UNK william and because i love scotland so did he and erm and then and all r and then and another thing erm this is before i married erm i went down oh no both of us that's right we went down to stay at erm not portsmouth er UNK er there there's a place near there next door
UNK
no not UNK erm
UNK
UNK
don't know
UNK anyway it's quite near portsmouth and we heard that the first queen elizabeth ship they don't say it's the first but they call this one the q e two but there was a q e one you see at one time and so we took a coach from there to southampton because we heard that she was in dock there and so we went and there were crowds of people and all in a queue waiting to go in
well we took our turn and we waited to go in but once we got in we broke away from the crowd and when they all came out and went to lunch in the town we didn't
we stayed on board and we went up on to every deck and there was even a gentleman he showed us up on the bridge on that er on that and of course there was the little shop and i bought i thought i must buy something on the queen elizabeth and i bought a pen
one of these er i suppose it'd be a UNK or whatever you call it and this i've still got it says on the queen elizabeth see and er you see we said we said well never mind very much we can have something a UNK afterwards and so we stayed on there from eleven o'clock in the morning until three in the afternoon you see and er and we were wandering around and we saw the dining room we saw the UNK table and er you know it was and then we looked along one deck we were high up and down below there were rows of rows of UNK in case you see
there was an accident
of an accident
yes
you see but oh i enjoyed we had some lovely holidays
yes sounds like you did
i did and then of course as i say er you know with my husband well i had lovely holidays before but when you've got a UNK it's all too different isn't it
it is
i really that's what i live on now memories of the happy holidays i've had with him and even to this day i keep in touch
janet posted a letter for me last week to a friend who i worked with at ipswich she was one of the girls behind the counter and at the moment they her and her husband he was on the he finished up but he started as a lad in the kitchen but he finished up as a UNK on the dining cars and they married and er and they've got er two children erm they're married to and we kept we've kept in touch with each other for sixty years
yes
sixty years i wrote to her last week and i had a letter from her the week before
yes
and we've kept in touch and they live up er witton UNK
oh yes
you know where that is
yes i do
yes
that's right and we've kept in touch all those years
that is nice isn't it
well its wonderful really you see
yes
and she we were good friends you see
mm
when er we've kept friends you see they don't come here often like me they're getting old
mm
and she's got arthritis well in her knees same as i have but not quite so bad because er well up to now but then again she's younger than i am er several years younger than me and but she's getting on and so is jack you see and er and er so erm i've had a as i say i've had i've had a wonderful life really
you have haven't you
you know you say you lived in at ipswich station
yes
erm didn't at needham market didn't people live in there or main entrance
where
at needham market station
oh well n i don't know what it's like now but because the booking office is closed
yes th that used to be through the main entrance isn't it the booking office
you go through the main door up the steps
you go up the steps in the main door
mm
and the booking office was on the left
mm
and the UNK office faced the platform but there is another door that to get into as soon as you got in the main door to the left you see and with a flap and that's the door that we used to take in the parcels you see and very often we used to go in that door or sometimes we would go through o on to the platform and go in the UNK door you see and then there again if i took messages to the UNK on the single telegraph er i had to go down the steps because th more often than not that they were in the basement
it was there's the basement and then a large room above where they used to have meetings er you see and er and er well they did they had friends from UNK go and visit them you see
didn't the UNK and the clerk live on the premises
er oh yes they lived in the station next you see
that's the bit that joins on one side of the main entrance area
yes
they've got there are two little doors aren't there which are probably their front doors
well th yes well that's it they are going facing the station and it used to be so much UNK than it is now
mm
pretty the UNK and things and the UNK lived that side
which side what on the left hand side as you face
as you face the station he lived that side you see and er there the room where they used to entertain their friends was just the other side of the wall the booking office you see and er he was such a kind man his name was mr
mm
and his er son was one of the lads who worked in the office doing the middle turn you see and er i don't know if he's still alive
he must be eighty because i mean there wasn't all that much difference in our ages
you don't know where he went to when he left
well i he lived at UNK for years but then i heard not so long ago that they had moved to ipswich but where i don't know but they must be whether he's than i have now i don't know either
on the other side was th the chief clerk would live
no he no i think it was er i can't remember who lived there
i think it was one of the UNK or
aha
i can't remember exactly who lived on the right hand side i've forgotten but th i know the chief clerk lived just a little way down you see er
in one of those little red brick cottages
yes that's right down there down there down and as i say who i took early and late turns with and er why i same as at cambridge
there were twenty five staff
was this at needham
ca no not needham
oh
no i had nothing to do with the staff at the
no that was at ipswich
he were a UNK you see er he was exceptionally nice man
you never heard him say a bad word or anything like that
well he was quite he was a good man
he used to
oh i cried when i left there i really did it upset me
yes
but and when we all quite shock
how many were working there how many girls were working there then at needham
only me
so you yes
only me in the office
yes
you see and er the UNK did the er cleaned the waiting room and UNK you see
well there was a UNK there called UNK and he was eighteen and er of course you know well i was as i said sixteen so he was a bit older than me but he whilst he was at needham he said well when i'm eighteen i'll get my calling up papers
cos that's during the first world war you see and erm he did and so he said goodbye to us all and he said i'm going up now to say goodbye to your mother and he ran up the street here to say goodbye to my mother
she made some tea she told me afterwards and stayed and stayed and stayed and he lived at UNK and his mother was very deaf and my mother got worried because he was going away the next day and she said to him UNK don't you think you ought to spend the evening with your mother and he said yes i'll go now and he ran off and he ran back again and he said you don't mind if i write to UNK do you
she said no you write and he'll she'll write back you see but and he went out to france and he was killed in three months and his name so they told me was on the er on the board at er
do you know i often wonder what happened to the honour board at needham market
there used to be an honour board and i was on it and so was miss 's brother er UNK because er who whoever won the scholarship you see their name went on the honour
oh i see
board over the door
in the church
no in the school er in the er no it wouldn't be in the church no
in the school oh
and of course i'm talking now about the old school
mm
because i don't know anything about these new schools
no
no i don't know what's happened to that
no i wondered because er it was quite an honour to have your name
yes
put on the honour board
yes
you see and my name was on there as i say and miss was the top
no i don't know whether hers was on but i know her brother's was you see i he died of course
yes
so how many worked there was a lot of people worked at needham station then
there were what two UNK
er yes there would be two UNK yes
then there was you
yes
and two clerks
and two t these two lads er
so there'd be two clerks and two lads
no one clerk
one
chief clerk
chief clerk two lads
and i took early and late turns with him
yes
but the other one went on the district
oh i see yes
as i said before as a relief clerk
yes
for holidays and sickness and so on and then later on relief UNK
yes
and you see eventually he got a station of his own at UNK le UNK
yes
you see down on the
yes
so that's how many
and then the UNK
of course the UNK
how many UNK just the one
well no cos he had actually
so there'd be two UNK would there
yes
that's nine people worked at needham station
yes i
no one works there now you see
they don't work there
no the signal box is closed
oh now is it really
yes
well i heard not so long ago that they were going to either pull it down or
well i think they want to keep it either there or move it somewhere
oh well i think that'll be a shame
it would be a UNK i think they've re they don't want to lose it
no
i hope not
but as i say they might
they have how things have deteriorated since
it's amazing that there was nine people who worked there at the time of the war
yes
you see and of course when i was at cambridge you see and that was during the second world war well of course you see i remember seeing a plane because of course the station was a prime target
yes
and somehow i don't know how but somehow they always knew when the train was being loaded up with tanks and then that was the night we would get a raid and of course you see they all ra tried for the station
well you know it you see time were i don't know i suppose i don't know but i never seemed to be afraid and i used to have my or something round my waist a belt with the keys hanging on and they supplied me with a as well one of these i don't know what they're made of they weren't all that heavy but still they were heavy enough to keep on
i mean they weren't aluminium so they blew off i used to wear one of those and er you know for safety you see but er anyway i survived the survived the war and but wh it's amazing really when i look back how we d how we managed because we had such nice people in there as i say and like these actors jack UNK
they all came down and used to come in our rooms and all sorts of other and i met some very ni and of course all UNK you see and no matter what they were well of course cambridge has always been noted for different UNK hasn't it
mm
and of course i loved the town and although the station was about a mile from the town centre people used to come from the town centre in their cars they had lunch at our place er at cambridge you see and there were two UNK and one of them took part time cellar work you see and er they were two brothers and er their name's
the younger one they call tiny because he was the yo smaller than his brother but the other one you see and we did enormous business especially during the war
mm
but er
yes
you see and i'm glad i didn't miss it i'm glad i went through all what i did and this particular raid you see the UNK went and they said a telegraph office read you see an and then i thought i'll go to the back door and i went to the well it was actually on the front of the station and i went to the front of the station and there was this plane UNK down like that and of course you see the bombs didn't fall down straight like that but they went as the plane went and they knocked down a row of houses at the end of the road
yes a row of houses and of course when i saw i looked out the door and there was this plane UNK down like that and it seemed so low because they were aiming an and the bomb fell in the cattle market and i threw myself on to the stone floor you see and er and presently one of the ambulance men came round to my office door and he said are you alright
i said yes thanks
i sat by the fire knitting and er he said i can see
well you took all this sort of things in your UNK but the next day we heard about these houses being knocked down you see and i think that's the nearest i've been to be killed but one day one saturday and that was in a daylight raid one saturday afternoon because you see i was off every afternoon but i worked till ten every night you see and er so erm but of course hugh worked during the day and he was off in the evening that's why he used to come down to see to see us and er he used to come in er you see and leave his UNK and oh be about nine o'clock and he spent the last day up there perhaps with his friends have a chat and er you see and but er and i was walking along it was called and suddenly a plane came over and i thought oh i expect it's one of ours
when all of a sudden they dropped a bomb and i thought there wasn't at all you see and no UNK had gone nothing you see and there was broad daylight
mm
you see of course we heard about it afterwards you see
yeah yes
but er i don't know perhaps we were UNK than these days perhaps you were UNK when you're young
mm yes perhaps that's true yes
when you worked at needham you must have seen all the UNK and UNK on station yard and a lot of cattle coming and going
well no er we no we didn't the only cattle we saw was when they were on the train cos i don't remember they seemed to
i don't know whether they dealt with cattle
aha
it was mostly seeds and stuff like that
yes but you know russell
i know he he's older than me
yeah well he's i interviewed him er last year and he was telling me that he remembers going up into the loft in 's erm the whole of the station yard was full of cattle
oh
so loaded off of the train
oh i didn't know that i perhaps that was perhaps that was
i think they were all going to market because obviously had a farm
oh yes they did
so it's possibly one market day i think he said
yes well that might be the time you see when perhaps i was at cambridge
yes
it might have been later than er when you worked there
yeah y
he was saying people going on the trains is it when you worked there rather than animals
oh i no animals
no
you see no animals were er only in the in the trucks you see
mm
passed through because they didn't stop at needham and er but i always thought you see there were i don't know several clerks in that office as i remember but i can't remember who they were anyway i didn't have we didn't have much to do with them
no
you see they were just more or less sort of i thought they were just sea merchants
mm
yes that's probably to do with farm
er yes
no not the mill really
aha yes
i imagine
i don't remember any cattle
no it may have been later
yes
or being older he may have remembered times before that
yes that's true yes because how
old would he be now then
oh he must about ninety
i tried to remember when you said he was born
oh
i can't remember maybe he must be about ninety
yes well i was er you see born in eighteen ninety nine
yes
so of course i go as the years go
yes
you see and like eighty six now this year i shall be eighty seven but you see when it comes to the end of the year the turn of the year i'll still be eighty seven
yeah yes
you see until my next birthday that is you see but i well each year you see i always say well to my friends i am so UNK for my friends who drop in and each year i say well i don't suppose i will be here much longer but i shall be here i hope while i can walk
mm
but when i can't walk well i shall call in the doctor
cos i n i don't have a doctor year in hardly ever
i'm UNK for my good health you see because apart from arthritis you see i'm as well as anything and i hope i'm still in my right mind you see but i now and again i forget names
mm but then i forget names my husband is dreadful with names
well er
he would even sometimes recognize
yes
with people he knows quite well
oh i see
i think it's just some people are a bit like that and some are
i forget people i forget but then you see as i never go out
well i went out once last year you see and i was lucky enough but and for years and years and years i took UNK salts and which is supposed to be good for UNK
matter of fact this last couple of days i've started again but you see er of course that was before UNK came on the scene
mm
and i have tablets from the doctor and you see as i say from the waist upwards i'm
yes
i feel well and th and i try er and my husband's UNK they often ring me up er well i was on the phone to one of them when you came yesterday
er and she said i'll ring you ag i said oh dear someone now coming to the door she said never mind i'll ring you on saturday so i said alright and er and she lives at UNK norfolk my husband's UNK and erm you see and then there's the other one and she said auntie you're always so UNK i said well i try to be UNK because like everybody else i get a little depressed sometimes because you see i have no sisters and brothers i have three elderly cousins who live away and who i who i see one was here a fortnight ago er my cousin and his wife er you see it will be on a wednesday a fortnight today no thursday yes you see a fortnight ago and they said we'll come again an we've always bought you a bunch of UNK so we shall come again when the UNK are and er and they bring me over bits and pieces because er she was a cook and they bring me something nice to eat
that's nice isn't it
isn't it nice but i haven't any er
close relatives
no and of course being UNK at forty four er no family
mm
you see you haven't got any family
no not yet
i'm married but i haven't got any family yet
oh that's what i mean er and you'll have to make UNK won't you
oh i don't know i don't know whether it'll be like mark and jenny and perhaps never get round to it
no i know well i mean what is there for young people to look forward to these days and i feel really sorry for them and i mean all i hope is that jenny will get a job
oh yes
when she's finished
yes
er but i don't know whether there's any prospect do you think she
don't know don't know
when y you know you said your father was a UNK
yes
whereabouts in needham did he have his shoe
well it's where the bomb where it was bombed out
aha out yeah
quite near the united reform church
i knew there was a UNK there
yes mr
yes and my father and mr
what was your maiden name again
and he worked for mr
i didn't
no did your father work for mr
yes that was his name you see well my father as i say he had a stroke and er he was in bed in the front room for seven years you see
he er hugh and i used to come up every day do what we could you see in those days if you had a stroke you had to lay there till you died
mm
er but nowadays i suppose they take you up to ipswich and you'd have er
physiotherapy or something like that
that's right
to make you to get you going again
yes that's right
yeah they do so much more nowadays

oh yes i've interviewed his widow
mrs er mrs er
she is
isn't she nice
yes
oh i knew her years ago
yes
and of course well she was er i haven't seen her for years and years
but she's
but you see i am told that she's going to live next door to the where she used to live the doctor's house er unless
that's pulled down you know almost opposite the united reform church
which house is that
well there you i don't know what it's like now but they u
it's not quite opposite is it
er
it's more or less opposite where your father's shoe shop was
oh is it
oh
you mean the big red brick one next door to the doctor's surgery
er i er yes the doctor just there
yeah that's it i how
mrs 's father in law
i am going back to old dr
oh old dr oh yes
you see and he was he probably brought me into the world you see but er you see and mrs erm you see she was married to doctor and he used to come up to see my father and we had a different door then door being that's got a UNK lock on now but he he'd say hello frank you know always so you got oh he was so nice and it was such a shame that he died
he was very young when he died
he was and i forget how old he was
i think he was only in his forties
was that so oh
yes
dear he was so nice
yeah everyone said how nice he was and old dr was quite a character
yes he was you see and he used to come down you know and everybody's family waiting to go into that tiny little surgery but i don't know if it's the same now and the door half open in er well anyway still er he used to put something in a bottle and fill it up with water some liquid
mm
you see i'm talking about his father but i liked er mrs 's first husband you see and er i hear that her second husband isn't all that good
no he wasn't well i went to see her er i think he may have had a stroke and he can't get about very well at all
oh dear
and i think he finds it difficult to speak
yes
as well
an and is he is he at home
last ti when i saw her he was yes
oh he was
but
because he's had a spell or two at UNK
yes
he had er new place there er what's his name they've got a they opened a new nursing home didn't they
oh did they
er works for er there's only oh i can't remember his christian name david and his wife you see and i think he david still works and of course
he lives along the road from me
oh you know mr
yes
and erm so on
mrs was very kind she sent me a box of UNK pies and barley water and UNK all sorts you know
christmas time and she did last year
mm
er and of course i've known walter for years but i don't know his wife i've never met his wife and of course not being able to get out into the street now i should get out for about two years after i lost my husband and then i got this er awful pain nobody knows unless they have it er this arthritis in my knees you see and erm and then i found that it was too much for me to er otherwise i used to walk up to the post box road and i used to count the steps three hundred and something steps there and three hundred and something back you see and to the front door you see but i can't do it now but i have with help and i went out last year with er mrs and er twice we went to UNK which i enjoyed and so did she and the last time we went to and er we had our lunch and we went to see my cousins at west suffolk and then came home again you see and that's the only time i went out last year and usually i used to go to for a day and i am hoping that if i am hoping well you can only hope that i might perhaps go so out one sunday once just once in the you see because er th that's when you're old you've got to keep you've got to hope for something
mm
yes
and you've got to keep busy and you see now my sight has gone i now not long distance i can sit here and see television
mm
you see i moved a bit more now but and i i've still got good hearing er apart from this ear here this ear i can't hear so well quite so well this side you see so i always have to say excuse me while i hang on while i turn off the television you see and then they have to wait a minute till i turn it off and then what i do is because i have this phone extension put in
yes
you see i've got one in the front room and i had this one put in so then i say if i am in the kitchen i say i lift up the receiver hello and hear who it is and then i say hang on while i get round the chair and then you see i sit on the arm of this chair and talk because er it's difficult to stand too long
mm
you see but er otherwise you see er
you know i get on well really by
you do yes
and i have a meal on the friday and er brought to me
mm
and they're such nice people
mm
do you know mrs and mr
oh yes they live up in UNK yes
and mrs
yes
now er her husband came down one day and i said to him what's your name and he said mr
we regret the use of the word UNK in the motion since it is quite out of proportion erm as well as being offensive to many
motion three eight calls for full implementation of the content and intention of the european directives
congress g m b has been to the forefront of the campaign to ensure that the laws of this country are brought into line with european legislation
it is UNK that a government that talks so UNK about law and order should UNK the rule of law by UNK its obligations under international UNK
this government is UNK in the true sense of that word
g m b has brought cases under the equal pay directive and the UNK acquired rights directive
we are lobbying hard both here and in europe to ensure that directives are fully implemented but any UNK to existing directives do not UNK their impact
and that new directives are as strong and effect effective as is possible
we have UNK the t u c and european commission to the danger to workers in UNK enterprises if the acquired rights directive is UNK down
we have done more than any other union to help prepare the t u c's complaint to the european commission that the abolition of the wages council is a breach of the u k's obligations under european law and london region has recently won a test case on the application of the acquired rights directive to the opting out of schools and potentially of sixth form colleges and hospitals
the c e c also wi wish to make a statement on motion thee five two
a widespread myth among personal personnel managers is that they can change terms and conditions by simply giving notice of intent
in fact they have no UNK right to do so any more than we can give twelve weeks' notice to increase the pay of our members
unless the contractor UNK says otherwise employers need the consent of workers or their union to any change in terms and conditions
our difficulty is that the UNK position is clearer than unfair dismissal law so employers can sometimes though by no means always achieve the same result by issuing notices of dismissal and offering new contracts of employment
however the new trade union act applying a european directive will require employers to consult with trade unions before issuing dismissal notices in such cases
such consultation will have to be with a view to reaching agreement
a requirement which will strengthen our hand in erm holding employers to their contracts
they may not find it they may not find it impossible to change contracts but it will become increasingly harder for them to do so
congress please accept motions three eight three fifty three five two three five three and three six five and accept the motion three two three with a qualification thank you

please be on time conference stands adjourned till nine thirty tomorrow morning
have a good night thank you
i've got your form here somewhere
right
and erm i it tells me what you wanted to talk about
yes
erm oh that's right
you're third year english aren't you
yeah that's right
yeah
okay
and er oh you er it's social work you're interested in is it
yes
yes
erm okay
yeah
can i get on a UNK two year course next year
mm
you mean to apply now for autumn
yes
i think that's very optimistic really
well and what experience have you got
not very much
i mean i took er a gap year out in birmingham working for a church
oh i see
er
and what did you actually do
well it was called a UNK training course erm
yes
so a lot of it was teaching
erm but the relevant
yeah
bits to this would be erm i ran er a youth group in UNK which was er central birmingham
oh yes
and er we did a couple of weeks erm teaching in schools and we helped run a erm a UNK club for old people
oh yes
but the probably the relevant thing would be the youth the youth work
erm
yes
y what did you do on the youth work side
well we it was run from a local church but erm
mm
the fairly elderly couple which who started
mm
the work up erm
mm
he was ill or something or going away and erm er the church we were working for was invited to take it over
oh i see yes
and er so we were the kind of erm the team who were there the at the time so
and
a couple of us took it on
did you sort of play table tennis with them or what did you do
well that i mean that t to get them in yeah that's the sort of thing we started with erm playing pool and er table tennis and that
mm
erm
mm
and then we went up to more UNK things
we had i mean you couldn't do that much but it was
no
you know a ten fifteen minute discussion and stuff like that
on what sort of topics
on r on religious topics mostly
oh i see yes
i mean we did you know stuff like erm er what's the one i did
are christians boring
erm
you know sort of thing like that
i see
so you weren't really doing anything on their sort of personal development or their social problems or you know could they get jobs or could they get work or what were the pressures on them how
no
how did they sort of cope with their relationships or anything like that
no
i mean th we did er
no
we talked informally about erm their
oh
relationships and things like that cos that was
oh right yeah
the sort of thing that UNK up
yeah
i mean there was nothing on a on a formal level or anything
no
like that welfare
no
or jobs or anything like that
no
so i mean it doesn't i mean i mean the point about social work erm you know doing er some experience is i think so that you actually experience the erm sort of so the group dynamics of people who are in trouble and can't cope
mm
and i that's why i was wondering er how much you did on that front really
yeah i mean that par apart from the youth and i've done some at home as well erm
yeah
the only other relevant
not much
thing would be
yeah
erm er holiday schools work
oh yes
yeah
which i've done since i was sixteen
mm
erm but that was just group leader stuff really
erm but no i ne i need erm to get on a voluntary placement next year probably
i think you probably
but
do yeah
yeah
but erm i don't know what sort of thing wou would get me the best experience
well the thi one thing you could do is go and talk to one or two admissions tutors of the social work courses
i mean there is one here of course
right yeah
and you could go over to erm the social work department in and try and you know get an interview with the admissions person
mm
erm and say you know what sort of idea you know what would you think would be good experience
i mean i think it might be good if before you did that you could try and explore a bit on your own and have some idea but i mean
yeah sure
in a sense when you've done that er it's a good thing to check it out
mm
erm
well i've got a couple of applications on the go
i mean i've got erm seven well
but there's one
yeah
er erm it was in the church of england newspaper of erm
mm
mm
er there's a place in UNK which UNK be a residential thing for a year
ah
erm
that sounds what sort of er people have they got there
that's erm adults with erm learning disabilities
oh i see yes
erm or there's there'll be the other one er
mm
i've got contacts with is
mm
UNK erm working in london with erm a placement with someone with a disability working
oh yes
forty eight hours on with them and then forty eight hours off
oh i see
and that's
now what's UNK
that's single
erm i can't remember what
no
the exact UNK is
no
what sort of people are there
i mean er
erm well there're all sorts of er range groups but
yeah
erm it's mostly physically handicapped people
oh i see
yes
erm
well it might be good
erm er is er now does that have a religious basis UNK or
UNK doesn't no
no
erm the one in UNK does
does yes
but it's not erm
er it was it's welfare based rather than
yes i see
i mean i don't know how you feel about it but it might be a good thing to do something that was not religious based erm
yes definitely
y you know just to get in with er a different sort of group of people with different sort of UNK and so on
yeah
erm to show you know you have the broader erm experience
i mean hav have you looked at our alternative opportunities section out there or
erm
that's the yellow files
that's the yellow files
yeah
yeah i did i did go through it
yeah
i've taken a
yeah
f erm a couple
yeah
of addresses down
yeah
but there wasn't mm well there was nothing that seemed immediately er relevant i must say but
no
i mean you've not looked at er a lot of the mental health stuff
i mean er people like the richmond fellowship or did you didn't find them
no
maybe you don't actually don't want to do mental
i don't
health or
well i don't know
erm but
mm
i'm not really sure what i'm looking for
no
what do you have any idea what sort of social work you would want to do in the end or not really
erm well i had a look at probation which is a different
oh yes
but similar avenue i suppose
yeah
mm
mm
erm but there are elements of that which come into social work i would have thought
mm
erm er young off w work with young offenders or something like that
erm
yes
yes
i mean there are broad categories you see in a sense
i mean certainly the social services now divide up a bit
i mean er you know the erm training is supposed to be a UNK training so that you learn the various erm ways of coping with clients you know and it
mm
doesn't matter whether they're ninety five or you know sixteen there are
yeah
certain sort of listening skills and er erm the idea that you you've got to get erm people to look at the things maybe they don't want to look at
mm
but in a positive way and those sorts of things will obviously apply whatever group you're dealing with
but on the other hand i think the erm social work is now going back again to a situation where it's really rather more specialized
mm
certainly i know somebody i know who works with north yorkshire they seem to have divided up into the old and the young
yeah
erm so you've either got you know the sort of or the old people or you've got the young people and that reaches back down the age range into things like child abuse which is now you know very er much er on the agenda
erm so i mean i think you know it might be useful well in some ways it would be very useful for you to have erm two sort of six month UNK in rather different environments so that then you'd sort of keep your options open a bit
mm
erm if you were interested in probation then maybe you could get work in a probation UNK er you know as some sort of er assistant
UNK or something
right
erm which would give you some contact with erm er you know people who'd er just come out of prison or you know had been serving some sort of sentence or other you know maybe not a UNK one or something
erm but that might be interesting
i mean i'm sure if you asked erm you know the probation service people in york i'm sure they could well i mean if you're thinking about probation you probably ought to go in and look unless you've already
yeah sure
done so i mean and as part of that you could ask questions about whether you know there might be some longer term placement you could do or something
right
erm so i mean that might be worth it
would you do this erm i suppose if you well i don't know it depends whether it's residential or not
you you'd be erm quite happy to do residential
yes
would you
mm
i think that's good because i think most of it probably is residential
mm
erm and of course you get erm you know a rather more intense sort of experience i think if you do that
mm
erm i mean it's not what everybody wants but erm i think it is quite er interesting
i mean the richmond fellowship things are quite interesting
they've got sort of mind you they have their own training sort of regime as well which in some ways is means it's quite good experience because it is structured in a in a way to give you some training whereas of course if you just go in to do a job then erm how much sort of training you get varies a bit
i mean one would hope you got some wherever you went you know
mm sure
er but sometimes you don't get very much
erm and if there is erm a sort of definite regime then that may be quite good
i mean it depends er whether you're in a fearful hurry to start the training you know t and get
erm
qualified
i mean erm
no i don't think no i'm not in a fearful hurry
it's just i've done three years at university now and i
yes
and it's a subject which i've enjoyed doing a lot english
right
yeah
erm but it's had n you know no UNK direction whatsoever
right
yeah
and erm er i now er now i want to i don't mind training again but it it's got to be UNK
right
yes
and so erm the experience in w the work experience i get now i want to be with a definite view to get to get in training
right
yes
in order to get
yes
a job
yes i see
yes what i really meant was i'm i forget exactly but we could look it up in you know the richmond fellowship file out there
mm
and they've got quite a big place at harrogate where you could go for a day or two to observe what was going on and so on
now i think if i remember rightly they had a sort of two year sort of training pattern
right
which you do and then you're er you know in their eyes you're sort of trained to some sort of level for their sort of work
now that's n not the same thing as the erm study year you know the
mm
social work qualification but erm on the other hand you know it's a structured sort of and therefore you get you know there'd be reviews and all this sort of thing and therefore you'd get something out of it
erm it's just that er and i don't suppose you need to stay two years if you don't want to
i mean if it was working well then maybe you'd stay an extra year and sort of finish it off but
mm
erm if you know you felt you wanted to go off and do th start the professional social work training well that would probably be alright
erm i think too of course the thing about probation to go back to that
mm
is that you have to be accepted by the home office as well as the erm you know particular institution running the course
i d i don't mean that's er a terribly difficult thing but it is just that does have to happen
right
er that
erm
whe what sort of thing are you talking about
i about past criminal offences and stuff
oh no
no i think it's well i mean yes presumably
i mean i
well
don't think they like
well i haven't got well i got stopped
no
for not having my lights
yes
on my bike once but er
well no i don't i don't think that's too serious
no it wasn't really that i it was erm although i'm sure they do check that
mm
but well i think they check that sort of thing for social workers don't they
yeah they do yeah i read that yeah
cos they have to be very careful especially with this abuse
mm
business you see that er anyway erm no i think it's more that the home office want to be satisfied that you're the sort of person who will make a good probation officer
right
erm pardon
right
w er yeah
i mean er they don't i think it's more like an interview you know er really where they w they will be trying to assess your UNK as well as the actual institution that's going to give you the course
right
so you've got two of these sort of sessions er to go through that's really the only point
right
erm and i mean i'm not too sure you'd probably need to ask the probation people what specific things they were looking for but i suppose the probation service i mean you are an officer of the court
mm
erm which means there is a sort of er disciplinary er sort of element in it
i mean i suppose there is in all social work in a sense that if you go in to look at a family and you're trying to assess you know whether the children should be taken into care well you're exercising a sort of statutory erm er sort of responsibility and as far as the clients are concerned er if you like that can sort of get in the way of er a more human sort of relationship if you see what i mean because
mm
you know in the one case you're the representative of court the probation erm officer and they know that if they break the probation or you sort of erm do a bad report on them maybe they've got a suspended or something and they'll so you know there's a and you somehow have to handle that
mm
so that it doesn't UNK the person and they regard you as a you know and that's actually probably quite tricky except of course that you can't just let them off because you are actually an officer of the court
mm
you see what i mean
and er probably they'd be interested to know how you would sort of handle that
right
erm and er the i suspect i mean there are probably as many answers to that as there are probation officers
er but it's a particular problem for probation you know
mm
erm and the social work thing has also something of that
you know if the erm that if the family think you're going to actually take the child off them because they're not looking after it properly then i mean obviously they're not perhaps going to be as frank with you as they might otherwise
mm
and you know that may UNK you in really reaching a decision about erm the real nature of the relationship they've got with the child
so you know there are some quite interesting sort of angles
mm
erm mm
but basically i think most courses now not sure there's actually a legal requirement i don't think it is but most of them want a at least a year's sort of full time experience in erm you know d dealing with UNK people really and their problems and people who can't cope for one reason or another and how er y you can er sort of help them and what sort of relationship you can build with them and so on and how
mm
you feel about it and all that
and then you can talk about all that in the interview about your motivation as to why you want to do the job you see
mm
and probably you pick up some of the language used to describe this you know
yeah
but erm
mm
er york apparently ask for two years' experience in
do they
the UNK course
oh do they
yeah well you could go and talk to them and see what they what they thought you ought to be doing in that two years
mm
i mean erm well i don't know would you want to stay here or er
erm i don't know
i mean is it i shouldn't think so
if i if i was t two
mm
years erm
yeah
training in between
as well as two years' placement or something
yeah
i mean i've very
mm
much enjoyed my three years here but
yeah
i think it would be nice to go somewhere new
mm
mm
mm
erm
i think one of the things is of course to try and use the placement to sort of check out for yourself erm perhaps what sort of group you want to be working with in
mm
in general terms you know
i mean one of the problems with probation i think to a certain extent is that er obviously if you get these people who keep going into prison and coming out again er it's really pretty difficult to erm er influence their behaviour positively probably
mm
and that can be a bit depressing i think
erm whereas you know maybe with the younger people you feel well at least there's you know more chance
erm
i think you feel that you've put in more a more positive input
yes
what if y well that's right yes
yes you know there is a chance still to er get them on a er a route which will give them a sort of positive er relationship to society maybe rather than a negative one
mm
but on the other hand of course you've often got to deal with not just them but their parents or people around them or the people they relate to and
mm
you know er e so even that can be quite difficult but on the other hand you know there's probably more chance of creating something positive
mm
but i mean it depends
i mean some people actually erm depends what you think of as positive
i mean i you know some people actually erm quite like looking after the older people where
mm
really i mean what you're almost sort of UNK over is a sort of steady decline really but on the other hand i think some people think if you can make that as erm as sort of UNK as you can and actually give them sort of support when they actually need it
mm
then erm that's actually quite a worthwhile you know some people get quite a lot of satisfaction from doing that
yeah
so it's a very personal sort of thing really you know which area you want to go into
and i suppose it's not necessarily always the one that you've had experience in so far you know
yeah
that's true
but i mean the
mm
i suppose the sort of things that made me think i might be suitable for social work have been coming from working with the young
right yes
yes
erm but you see i haven't i don't know
i suppose in interview especially with er a c v like mine that i might come over as quite erm naive
yes
and i ha i've had a privileged background
you know even
mm
the very fact that i'm sitting at university
yes
would UNK that
erm but i want to and i'm not sure where to go from here i'm not sure
no
where to get the contact that i would need
erm
well it may it may be that
you will it'll be a sort of growing thing you know
mm
what whatever you start with that'll give you another erm er sort of experience
i mean i think that's why in way it would be good to go outside the religious context because then you'll come up er y you er you know you'll meet people who have a er a rather different motivation
yeah
to your own but you'll be you'll understand it you know and you'll erm er get to understand what their motivation is which
mm
i UNK be very important because
mm
probably er the majority of your colleagues are not going to be religious
yeah
i mean unless you actually do go and work for a specifically religious charity
mm
which of course you might be able to do
mm
but erm that would er y you know limit you er very much and even if you did er you would almost certainly be erm having to relate to other professionals in the er area who were not religious so it would be a very good thing to
mm
do that i think and see another side
and i mean in that way you might sort of really want to go and look at one of these erm er sort of er rather awful inner city areas
but i suppose birmingham is not er
marvellous is it really from that point of view
that's right
er where i was working erm in the
yeah
last er half of that year
mm
erm w in UNK erm er
mm
oh right
erm the people who came to the youth group they
yeah
erm they were erm UNK
yes
i mean the schools they went to weren't er weren't really what i was used to you know
no
yes
yes
erm but to be honest i think you're right about the christian angle because i do think that erm although i enjoyed that year
yeah
erm if
yeah
if i had er if i could do it again i'd do something erm really different from that
yes
erm a lot
yes
more practically minded than it was
right yes
yes
erm because it was a sort of a student thing as well
mm
and there was there
mm
were there was bible teaching and all sorts but i don't know
i don't
mm
mm
i should think you're right i would get
yes
er UNK in
well i think it would you know you th there there's i mean that's not to er deny the importance of erm er you know christian motivation
no sure mm
it's ju it's just to get a look at the other side so that you can see that erm
mm
and erm i think too you if you can think perhaps for yourself try and think out what you want to get out of this experience
you know what you want to get out of it
mm
er in terms of UNK yourself for erm er you know being er erm er well better able i suppose to work out where you could make er a real contribution you know
mm
mm
now what do you need to know you know about yourself or about how you relate to particular groups of UNK erm or er you know inadequate people i mean people who can't cope in various ways particular erm areas i mean age groups or particular forms of erm er maybe disability er or handicap or whatever
mm
which you know maybe you you'd like to erm sort of er see how you related to those sort of people
mm
erm er it's a huge area of course
yeah
erm and i think in a way you y you know you may start the exploration and then that may lead you on to do something else and you may spend actually a bit of time before you actually want to start the training
sure
you know before you're sure whether it's cos you know if you get into probation you see that's quite a specialized area and it may i think actually it might be it's quite difficult to get into
mm
erm er so er you know it may be that you would need to work and i'm sure they would probably expect you to have worked with offenders erm
mm
or ex offenders or something in some category o or other or er perhaps amongst young erm you know UNK groups who provide a lot of the erm juvenile criminals
mm
you know so that you are trying to do that
er and also it's not always easy i mean there's all this youth work business and sort of detached youth work and so on in erm er you know in the very UNK areas but actually i think people say that the erm er the UNK teenagers are actually some of the most difficult people to relate to at all
i mean some people have a UNK
mm
you know
but they really are quite difficult you know and almost you want your sort of most skilled people er doing that really erm
mm
and er it's sort of a question of erm how much challenge you want to undertake both during the placement period and immediately afterwards
but that's one of the strengths i suppose of the social work qualification that it is a UNK one so
mm
you can move about afterwards
mm
and so on
but
and the and the training
mm
er i mean er especially
yeah
er with it changing i mean that's er it's very much
yeah
placement based isn't it
oh yeah
but you see the thing
yeah
er that would be erm structured in a way that y the people who are er training are making sure you've got the best out of it and are making
mm
sure you were
oh yes
erm examining what you
yeah
were learning as you went along
yes
yeah
and erm
yeah
you know that's exactly what i want
mm
but i need
mm
this experience to get on the course
mm
and i need to ensure that this experience erm well i need to make sure that i will be evaluating it in a similar way as i went along
yes
i think that's right
i think if you can now it may be that you could find a sort of semi structured thing like the richmond fellowship
now i've no brief for the richmond fellowship
you know
no
j it just happens to be one that i know about
mm
there may be lots of others which do very similar things but i think this is a question of you working out the criteria for your placement that you want you know
mm
and what you're trying to do and what you hope to get out of it
mm
erm and er then you know you'll have a bit more of a shopping list as it were and that may help you to erm actually define where you want to go within this huge range of er you know possibilities
mm
erm i mean there are erm it's very interesting
cos there's also another th area i know a bit about is and don't take these as being the only areas it's just it's easier if you actually discuss a sort of case you know
mm
erm there's this erm UNK community which is part of the camp hill village trust
they actually set up villages which are in erm you know usually in rural er UNK and erm er they have erm usually i mean they're mentally disabled people there and erm er they set up the village so that there are able UNK people in there and yet they live with the er mentally disabled people you know they have houses and they the erm in inverted commas normal people have erm children and all this sort of thing erm and yet they have erm er some of these mentally UNK people living with them in the house
mm
and they have to you know let their children get used to them and so on and
mm
erm er it's very interesting because of course the children grow up probably much more comfortable around people who've got mental problems than you or i would be
mm
because they just know they're different and they learn a way of coping you know
and now that's a very interesting thing to see i mean
mm
erm now those sort of villages there's one at UNK village near UNK which is out near scarborough
and you could go to that for a weekend if
mm
you wanted to see what was going on
and i'm sure you could have great discussions with the people there and so on about all sorts of things
i mean i mean there are er there are i mean they probably i think a lot of them probably are not social work qualified
mm
now i don't know what training they've had actually
erm i mean maybe they haven't had very much but erm but in a sense there's a sort of huge commitment on their part to that because they actually i remember some chap came over to do the talk and i think he's got four kids and he said well you know i didn't know how my kids were going to react to people fine you know
mm
i mean you have to watch things a bit but you know basically it's a good experience for them
and erm he said i've got no erm pension or anything you know i cos they don't they pool the money you see they and i mean they do things like erm oh i don't know have cows and make cheese and ice
mm
cream and grow potatoes and all this and probably they have UNK and sell honey and you know they eat er they really try to be self sufficient sort of community as much as they can
obviously some things they probably have to buy shoes and
mm
mm
that sort of thing so they make some things and sell them
erm and er but he's worked at that you see but he doesn't get any money for it i don't think
i don't know what they do about must have some sort of spending money but
mm
you know it doesn't they don't erm sort of exist in the social security system like the rest of us do
mm
and therefore that UNK going to have to look after him when he's old
and of course i don't know how long don't know how long that one's been going for but obviously that's another sort of problem in some way
mm
but i mean there are huge ways of er you know very different ways of giving service really
mm
and you might find out some sort of interesting things about that
er the social work UNK a good one because it is a sort of base for all sorts of things and you know you might learn specialist erm i don't know sort of UNK therapy techniques of various sorts but probably the social work qualification would be a good starting point to build from
mm
you know so erm
good starting point the social work qualification
okay
okay well you know
yeah
mm
and then you see where it goes on from there
mm
but what if
yes
if erm
well where do i go from here really
i mean if i want
well i th i think you i would erm er go and have another look at this alternative thing
the
and obviously there are some of them which relate locally to organizations which are national
mm
and you could go and look at the local one and talk to the people there and see what they're doing and
yeah
all this sort of thing
erm and i'd try and go and see the admissions person on the c q s w here
right
erm and ask them you know and say and if they want two years say well you know i'm pretty keen on this now what you know i necessarily expect you to have me
when i come back and apply but i mean
you know what sort of things do you think i should be doing
and try and tell them briefly what you've done in that sort of area you know and see wh see what they say
and erm maybe have a look through erm some of the erm well there's a file on social work isn't there and all the stuff about the qualifications and get some of the UNK and so and
mm
erm maybe go and see one or two others if you can get to see them
erm and er you also try so really it's a question of developing your own ideas about what you think you want to explore and the sort of skills and things that you want to try and develop
mm
erm and also checking with them that you know you're not going one way and no they'd want you to do something else
mm
erm and trying to er both satisfy yourself and them that you know you're getting the right sort of experience
yeah
okay
mm
and er yeah
i suppose i wanna be a bit careful that the experience i get isn't too specialist as well
well erm
do you think that matters or not
mm
i think a lot of it is about erm how these er people you know how really a lot of the problems for people are in their relationships with the people around them
right
and if those are bad or not supportive enough or actually destructive
mm
then n you know they can't cope with it
and it's getting the idea of how that works is very important
now you can do that in all sorts of ways
mm
erm and er i think i think that's one of the most important things
and also how erm if you are a UNK what sort of pressures that puts on you
you know what sort of emotional stuff they try and dump on you
mm
and what do you do about it you know whe when they er y you know i mean i mean i think one of the things is you can start off erm you know very open and so on but if you're not careful y you actually take on responsibility for them you know in a in a way which is actually not helpful to them and is probably very bad for you
mm
because you've just taken on too much
and you but you of course you have to take on something
there's only if the person you're talking to thinks you don't care well i mean they're not you know they're not going to think very much of you are they
mm
but if they discover that you know they can really get you erm er to er do all their worrying for them
mm
er then maybe they will try and do that
and that's not very good you know
i mean your own aim is really to make yourself UNK in the end
i mean you may have to support them through a sort of bad patch but the idea is to erm get them so that they can look after themselves you know
and they don't really want to go on using you as a sort of prop because i mean you can't afford that because you've got lots of other clients and you know really the aim is to try and get them back to self sufficiency
mm
but there is a lot of er sort of emotional interaction going on and you'll have to get used to that
and i mean part of the point of doing the training of course is to get the hang of how to handle that
yeah sure
erm
but yeah and then but er in the context of the training
right yes
i'll be given structures in which to evaluate that and people will be continuously assessing me i suppose
oh yes and seeing whether you'd yes how you were coping with it and whether you got too involved or whether you didn't get involved enough or whether you actually were able to sort of get this balance between erm the sort of emotional support you give and the actual practical help which maybe they need in some sort of way you know because i mean
mm
i mean erm and sometimes of course you can't give them the practical help they need you know
mm
because there isn't a grant or there isn't whatever it is and you know and how you actually manage to er cope with that yourself
because you know you don't have UNK resources
in any helping profession you've usually got this problem you haven't got enough resources
mm
you know
er i mean you obviously have to make erm decisions about that and so on
and the nature of caring is changing to the caring UNK
i mean now the erm the social workers erm are care managers in a lot of cases in other words it may be contracted out to somebody else to do the actual caring and you look at the package which the client is getting you know it might be i dunno some old dear who needs meals on wheels and visits every week or something
mm
and maybe it isn't you that do the visit it's somebody else who's being paid to do it but you may be responsible for exercising professional judgment about whether that's the appropriate thing that should be happening and perhaps assessing whether they're doing it properly
mm
now that's a comparatively new development but it's coming in now
erm
mm
but i think you're right i think if you can get qualified that's the thing and then you can begin to look thereafter
except that you do need to have an idea of i think which area cos that will determine your placements and things you see
yeah
well i mean all i know in that at the moment is that i i'd i would be most naturally drawn to youth i would have thought
okay well i should start there you know erm and er see what options there are for getting involved with erm you know young people erm
mm
and but they are the UNK that's the only other thing i think
yeah
except it may be easier for you cos you're nearer in age you see
but that causes its own problems because erm you know do you just become one of them or what do you do and
mm
erm ho well anyway
er but if that's what you're drawn to i should start there
mm
and see but try and see what sort of various experiences there are
of course there's also you can use one of the agencies like community service volunteers to
mm
try and get a placement
you know they're a erm placements agency basically
i mean they don't charge you anything and er i don't think they charge the employers anything but their UNK is to get volunteers into appropriate places
oh that sounds
erm but even although that's their UNK they've also only got so many places so many
sure
volunteers and they try and match them so
right
the clearer you are about what you want er the better you know the more likely you are to get w er you know what's appropriate for you really
mm
so i think you probably need to sit down and try and think out some criteria for yourself about what you want
mm
yeah
i mean i'm sure you're right but i just i just don't know with the information i've got how to make those sort of decisions
is it a case
of UNK through files or
well erm er yes
can you only get those sort of erm those sort of
ideas through the er placements themselves
i mean i
yes i see what you mean
well to a certain extent i suppose it's true erm but i suppose if you said well erm you know can i think of skills that i need to develop
erm and er if i can what are they
and erm er what er you know how might that be developed you know
and what opportunities would i have for that in these various er situations
you know
mm
i mean i think there is a danger quite a number of the c erm community service volunteer placements involve things like looking after very severely handicapped people who are erm in higher education or something
mm
i mean really severely handicapped so they really need sort of helpers with them for you know at least fifty percent of the day or something
mm
well now i'm not sure that that's actually a very useful sort of thing to do
mm
i mean i mean i'm sure it's useful in the sense that it gets one person through er doing a degree who couldn't have done it otherwise but whether it would actually give you the sort of experience you want i'm much more doubtful
mm
and maybe you would know about that
erm y i mean if you read er or somebody suggested that to you might
mm
mm
have a view about that
mm
but i think if y if you read some of the stuff and you said well could i do that
would that be what i wanted to do
and then you thought well no it wouldn't because and why wouldn't it er but on the other hand there might be some good things about it and what were they
mm
and sort of write them down you know
er i mean i don't think you want to spend hours and hours and hours doing it but
well i can't i've got a degree to get
yeah
well you know if you spent an afternoon looking through some of the files and what the opportunities were
mm
er and i think also it should be helpful to go to er a tutor an admissions tutor and say well you know what sort of skills do i need to get
what are you actually looking for
i'll certainly get that fixed up
yeah
mm
and if you get stuck with it well come back and we'll have another discussion you know
okay
i th i think the most suitable placement i've found was that one in UNK but there then there's the erm the christian motivation
yes
i mean i wouldn't want to labour that too much
mm
er what was it there
you
it was er it's a residential place for
yeah
erm adults with learning disability
i mean it you know that would give you the sort working in a team and working with people and erm
mm
mm
mm
i dunno
it depends though
if you want to work with young people
yeah that's true yeah
maybe you should try you know and it may not be possible to get the absolutely perfect answer either
mm
erm but i mean on the other hand if you start trying to develop your criteria and i'd go out and look at UNK village and look at the richmond fellowship or something
mm
and you know talk to people who do it and so on
now say there's a social work contact we've got in york who's
i've read that yeah
well go and talk to them about it
mm
and try and find out what they want and what's happening to the social services and y you know what they think about er what they'd what skills they'd like you to have and the sort of experience you need and so on
i think the more people you talk about it to about it the better especially people who are in it
mm
or doing the selecting for courses or for jobs and so on
so maybe if you had a chat to the admissions person and a chat to the social work contact we've got in york
mm
and try and get out of them what skills you know and chuck in a few ideas of your own you know
yeah
maybe that would that would be good
okay
does that sound alright
yeah that's very helpful
good
okay erm fine
well i should think that's probably about it then
right
erm
is there anything else
erm
er i'll make er other appointment another appointment as and when i
yeah that would be fine
you know i mean we're here well are you going down at the end of the week or something
or
erm no i've got too much
yeah
i'm gonna stay here through easter
oh right
well we're here except for easter
well you've probably seen we've put a notice up on the front door to say when we're open and when we're shut over
the easter UNK you know but it's really basically a week we have at easter and
mm
sometimes there are odd days in the UNK when we do other things and we shut you
mm
know but erm
yeah
and you can always catch me if making an interview is difficult in the time
mm
then you can catch me or one of the other careers advisors out
mm
in the information two till four every day
mm
erm during term that is unfortunately
right
well of course i should have done all this last year you know
yeah
oh well
never mind
it's at least you're doing it now and
yeah
erm getting it UNK important
mm
but i think you do need to plan a bit you know in spite of the fact you've got the degree to do if you can spend time going to see these people
you know you don't need to spend ages doing it but just take a bit of time to do it and
mm
to have a look at the opportunities in the files thinking about what you actually might want to do and so on and what's on offer
mm
right
okay
right er thanks a lot
right
jolly good
oh now i've got to stop this thing haven't i
oh
er what happens er i stop
colleagues just before we er commence with today's business one or two announcements to make
the first one is that i i've received a number of complaints about colleagues smoking in the in conference
are you taking that line because you're in favour or opposed to it
anyway it's not a matter for us i know that er depending on where you sit in conference you can have difficulty seeing the no smoking signs but i've every confidence you're gonna take my word for this
normally when it's switched on there's a sign up there
it's not switched on yet so can somebody switch it on
and equally colleagues there is also it's true believe me and normally there's another one up there a no smoking sign so please be UNK if only to help me to get through the week with my voice which is usually very bad
er the other thing is of course colleagues that the doors at the side are open for very good reasons and i mentioned yesterday from time to time that once we get er we get talking there's a that goes and colleagues at the side of congress have a great deal of difficulty in hearing and listening to the debate
so please if you feel the need that you need to speak to somebody please go out of the conference
discipline has been very good indeed so far
thanks very much
now just another couple of things colleagues
you'll remember yesterday that we had the collection for the crawley strikers and that the general secretary rather i was gonna say UNK then UNK er said that we would double whatever was collected
of course after he made that statement he didn't realize that the london region were gonna put a thousand pound in the bucket
yes but such is the life of mice and men
anyway the collection realized six hundred and thirteen pound plus the thousand from london
that came to six hundred sixteen hundred and thirteen and that will be doubled by the c e c thank you very much
colleagues i've had a message from the strikers at crawley and they've had to return
they want to place on record the generous support that they've had from you and for the yes in a moment the seconder of the emergency motion for er moving her support
they've been out a long time colleagues seventeen weeks
i spoke to them yesterday afternoon after we broke
they appeared to me to be as committed as ever to winning that particular dispute and i'm sure you would wish to send your further best wishes to them colleagues
one other matter before i ask the general secretary i think our colleague might want to say something after the general secretary
erm colleagues who attended the blackpool conference last year will recall that there was that we had a visit from a young boy called who was the son of one of our officers and that er was suffering from i think i recall a very severe form of UNK
i know that some colleagues are aware of this but sadly recently passed away and i must by the colleagues in the midland and east coast region er to thank everybody who put into the er the collection on behalf of the
very sad colleagues but thank you very much indeed for that
can i now ask the general secretary to say a few words
well just colleagues about the UNK dispute erm er clearly and i'm just anticipating the views of congress that since we adopted a particularly way of making up the er dispute fund i think we should certainly adopt exactly the same practice in relation
the point of information president UNK lancashire region president conference
i see on the agenda this morning that an invitation has been extended for to come along and speak to us
can the general secretary give this conference assurances that a speaker from UNK can come along and address this conference before the end of closing
thank you
yes colleagues what i will do is this erm no one will be in this congress for the last three days without knowing the strong feelings on the UNK issue
i refer to it in my speech and many others have referred to the terrible situation at UNK
if there is an approach for the UNK workers to come through the proper channels i will recommend on behalf of the executive for the standing orders committee that we hear a UNK worker before the end of the conference
if the UNK worker wants to regard that as a right of reply to neil 's speech so be it
right colleagues er on with the business
can i announce that the c e c has informed me that motion eighty four lancashire region due for debate on wednesday afternoon has been withdrawn
motion eighty four has been withdrawn
i'll now turn colleagues to the section secretary's report mick apex partnership pages twenty nine to thirty four
mick
thank you president
good morning congress
mick national office
i can just remember in the so called UNK days of the early nineteen eighties the then prime minister saying that you would make britain a great trading and a great economic nation once again
but she also said it'd be a nation which did not need a manufacturing industry nor an industrial base
the britain of the nineteen nineties and beyond according to her would be based on a service sector
thousands of jobs created foreign investment would be forthcoming and what happened
the mines the UNK the UNK all killed off and with them communities killed off
but all would be okay according to thatcher
new jobs would be created in the service sector
in retail in finance in recreation and in leisure
yes many jobs were created
part time jobs low paid jobs temporary contract jobs non UNK jobs
but all the gains that we had made out of labour movement improvements in working time improvements in health and safety equality issues legal rights all went out of the window and what has happened to the vast majority of those service jobs
they've gone
the same way as the steel workers the coal miners and the skilled UNK people
gone and never to return unless we have a government elected which is committed to education to training to investment and to the future
it's UNK in the nineteen nineties at a time of three million plus unemployed that we've still have a skill shortage in this country
we all know that britain will only become a world class economy if we have a strong well balanced manufacturing base employing skilled trained workforce a workforce which has decent conditions of employment and has legal protection but we do still have some members within the service sector and within the professional rank and what has happened in the last five or six years to those members
they've seen the introduction of new macho management techniques
they've seen the introduction of performance related pay personal contracts new working practices pay UNK pay cuts and always the fear of redundancy and all of this has been going on at a time when increasingly companies are UNK from national collective agreements are establishing separate bargaining arrangements restricting the activities of trade union officials and increasingly de recognizing trade unions
increasingly we see UNK and well used recognition of procedure agreements torn up
we've seen new and UNK disciplinary procedures introduced safety measures ignored and UNK increases in the number of cases of racial and sexual harassment
we need to ensure that our white collar members have the help and the support and the advice available to them but that help and that advice needs to be at the right time and at the right place
as more and more decisions are being taken by management at local level we need to ensure our local representatives have the necessary skills to cope with the new macho management techniques
we need to ensure that our representatives are trained in human resource management how to combat human resource management
we need to offer advice on performance related pay on health and safety issues on environmental issues
it's been particularly bleak for many workers
many white collar workers thought they were immune to the recession but congress there are thousands of white collar professional technical workers out there who need a trade union
a professional trade union with the new knowledge the skills and the services appropriate to their needs
that is the effective partnership
i commend my report
twenty nine
yes
anybody else who's coming up between twenty nine and thirty four if you could come down to the rostrum colleagues
well that's me morning UNK
morning conference you all awake
hope you enjoyed yourselves last night
conference thank you mick apex is going places there's no doubt about that
i heard what er john had to say yesterday about the apex membership must accept the conditions of the merger
well we fully accept that john and the reason i get up here under UNK report is under the item number two apex partnership national conference
i tell you why i get up i get up because i came back from that conference
it was a bit of a disaster in some respects but in other respects it was a lively UNK conference
membership expressing real views real concerns and john if you listen very carefully it was also about wanting to see a delivery of the promises that were made about the merger
that's what it was about
but there was a brave paper presented to apex conference a paper on UNK
that conference discussed it discussed it in great detail
they put a lot of effort into it but i tell you what if i read access i would never have believed i was at the same conference
there wasn't a single word mentioned about that particular paper and the very fact that conference rejected it because they failed to consult properly with those who were involved in that section and they were very unhappy about the way apex was being UNK
i was very disappointed that there's no comment in here at all
let's be honest i didn't wanna see good sections i wanna see strong sections i wanna see UNK sections but i also want to see the truth in those documents when it comes back afterwards so i'm disappointed on this issue and er i hope something in future will be done about to report the real things that we discussed at conference as well
thank you conference
bill london region
mick we took a decision at erm apex conference two years ago erm whereby we decided that er anywhere where we had g m b members we would attempt to ensure that we have recognition with the private security firms used
here we are at er portsmouth g m b congress we've got we're using that well the UNK are using erm out front
i'd just been talking to the guard twelve hour shifts sixty hours a week and he can't even have any time off for tea breaks or meal breaks
erm can we look into that
i do know that we've been trying to get er recognition for about fifteen years with that company but can we pursue that issue
erm on page thirty you talk about the erm employer's federation in the er minimum terms and conditions well i'm only hoping that my own firm UNK don't have any er input into that because er as you know they UNK reduced all the terms and conditions UNK guarding and cleaning recently erm i'd like to know when we intend meeting with UNK cleaner i do know you've written to them on a number of occasions and their refusal to meet with us
i also know that you're attempting to get a memorandum of agreement and a recognition agreement with them
erm i'd like to know an update if possible on the branch secretary's erm restructuring
i know that we're meeting with the company next week but whether or not UNK come forward on that and also erm in reference to the pensions section erm just correct your deliberate mistake and part UNK can't enter the UNK pension scheme
page thirty one thirty two
yes
ron UNK yorkshire region
er page thirty two about er the guarding company
i mean i don't want anybody to get the wrong idea what it says we've resolved eighty percent of the outstanding UNK
i mean these people have had a pay freeze since november nineteen ninety and these UNK were as a result of a new pay structure last year that actually UNK the terms and conditions since nineteen ninety but till then we've been making steady progress in getting better improvements and we've gone backwards
UNK have joined the UNK on the contract guarding and really i mean you must be getting sick of us getting up every time about security guards but it's an important problem and you must know that a lot of you must work at places where you've got guards on the gate and we all should take a bit of interest in going to see these guards find out that they're working for two pound or two pound forty an hour they're working as many hours a week as they'll actually work with no overtime rate no night rate no benefits worth having and i mean really i wish you'd go to your companies and try and arrange site allowances cos that's the only way we'll get any improvements but when we talk about UNK we just took in yorkshire region someone to a tribunal for constructive dismissal
well the UNK deserved on that but we're hoping we're gonna win it and we're hoping that is a beneficial thing to the other guards but i wouldn't put any money on it
the final thing is that a review of paying conditions will take place in may nineteen ninety three
we've actually had a delegates conference in april and we meet the company in july and i don't expect any sold the bread waiting for a massive increase in pay
thanks conference
thank you very much
thirty three and thirty four
mick
thank you president
with response to kevin yes the national committee paper on the future structure and organization of the apex partnership was rejected by the conference
there was a full and detailed report put by the central executive committee on that point and as you are well aware there are motions for debate this morning in respect of er that particular point
the from london region yes UNK is a UNK outfit
we've been UNK to get recognition nationally and locally for fifteen years
yeah UNK pay UNK hours UNK conditions
yet another example of why we need regulation and licensing within the industry
unfortunately at long last we are making some progress along that line
bill also makes the comment about UNK
yeah you're dead right bill
UNK were at one time UNK with quality for they have paid to be UNK with quality
they tried to take the UNK on at their own game
a world leader with the security industry is actually going down to the levels of the one man and a dog outfit
we're meeting in july on the pay and as ron and bill know we are seeking full restoration of the losses in respect of base rates working time and premium payments
the then secretaries yes negotiations are ongoing in respect of the company's proposals on restructuring
all the then secretaries have been kept fully involved in those negotiations
the regional secretaries have been advised of the position and regularly updated on the position
i'd made a commitment to the branch secretaries and to the representatives that there will be a full representatives conference of which those proposals will be debated and discussed
i accept the point bill about the error in respect of pensions
i think that covers the points president
thank you
thanks very much mick
colleagues i now propose to take motions one hundred and fifty eight UNK motion one hundred and sixty six the apex merger
er and then we'll ask for mick to respond on behalf of the c e c because the c e c are opposing one five eight and accepting one six with the qualification
so first of all m motion one five eight south western region to move
good morning congress president visitors in the UNK
denise representing bristol and district staff branch and the south west region
could i firstly start by thanking those delegates who after congress yesterday have expressed support about the two rule changes that we lost and to give some encouragement to new delegates here that even if you get up here and you lose it there's some one hell of a lot of support out there on the floor
thank you
motion one five eight
i note that the c e c is opposing this but i feel that maybe they've missed the points and the branch should actually take some responsibility for this because the wording could be better we concede that point
the motion isn't actually asking for each individual member to be sent a questionnaire and to say where would you like to be because obviously that is totally ridiculous
people who are in one particular workplace and that workplace makes up the branch then it's clear from the sort of jobs that they do which section they should be in
but if you're in a general branch such as i am which is made up from people of all sorts of industries that have come together because none of us are large enough to have a branch within our own industry on our own then which section do we go to
it's not always necessarily obvious
and who makes that decision where we should go
delegates in this room from apex may recognize me as someone that used to get up and say i was representing apex public service and management branch
it might automatically be assumed that because that was the name of our branch we should be in the public service section and that it why we've changed the name of the branch to bristol and district staff because we are an odds and UNK branch
we didn't want there to be any confusion so that people would automatically put us all into public services because the majority of our members shouldn't be in that section
surely the best way for members needs to be attended to is for them to actually make the decisions on which UNK relevant to them
we're not talking about individual members saying i wanna go here or i wanna go there we're talking about groups of UNK within these sorts of branches
surely the needs of the members should come before the administrative UNK of putting people into sections for the union and as i've said who better to judge where they need to go and what their needs are than the members themselves
congress has already discussed the fact that we're very concerned about the drop in membership
providing a service to our members is absolutely UNK and we need to show them that we are considering their needs in which section we put them in
as i've already said we agree that the wording could have been better
the c e c when they're talking about motions sometimes say that they accept them with the qualification and i'd like to say to congress this morning will you accept a qualification from the branch moving this to say that we are talking about groups of members and their needs not individuals
the members' case must come first otherwise everyone is gonna be put into the odds and UNK section which is apex because it hasn't got a subject such as public services or energy and utilities
we want apex as kevin has already said to be a real section not where everyone gets pushed because the name of their branch or there's nowhere else to put them
i urge you to support this motion
one five eight seconded
one five eight seconded
formally seconded
thank you very much
motion one six apex merger liverpool region
formally moved and you've formally seconded
thank you very much
you did that twice peter you can do that
i call mick to put the c e c point of view
thank you president
congress the central executive asks you to the central executive accepts motion one six with a qualification
however the c e c is asking you to vote against motion one five eight
the qualification to motion one six is that the c e c believe we should prepare a paper on relationship between apex partnership and all other sections of the union not just the public services section
in other words we should examine the whole subject not just one important part of it
in respect of motion one five eight the c e c is opposed because it is based upon a misunderstanding of the purposes of UNK
this union faces strong competition in almost every sector in which it UNK
in order that we can respond we must organize ourselves industry and by sector
that means making what might have to be some very difficult decisions affecting UNK practices and even UNK that have developed over many years
we cannot leave it to the of individual members that would produce chaos and could leave to destructive UNK
the membership of each section is clearly defined by rule
the c e c and the regional committees have ample discretion to fine tune in certain areas
so we are urging you to vote against one five eight and accept one six with the qualification outlined
i don't go anywhere without a fight congress
you've heard my explanation of the fact that it was poorly worded and i think that is a great shame
i'll be talking later on in congress about the fact that we could perhaps bring amendments and that would help the wording on things
please think of our membership think of what their needs are
yes we're in competition and we want to be able to say to our members don't go to that trade union because they will put you all in one lump go to this one because we've got sections because we look at our members with individual needs and please support this motion
thank you
colleagues i propose to take the vote one five eight as UNK indication is being opposed by the c e c all those in favour of one five eight against that's lost
motion one six has been accepted
all those in favour against that's carried
colleagues we're now going to the transport debate and there are five motions listed here
motion three one four london region to move
composite eighteen g m b scotland and london to second
motion three one six birmingham region to move
motion three one eight midland region to move
motion three one nine midland region to move again
so colleagues if the moves of motion three one four er would come down and move their motion and with other colleagues if they would come down to the rostrum please it would save time
president congress dave southend branch london region moving motion three one four british rail privatization
congress this country gave the world football cricket and railways
we are now in the second division of world football and world cricket
the railways are now in division three and the government's plan is to take them into the non league
at the moment we have old and dirty trains which are expensive to use with many rural towns without a railway at all through years and years of UNK
so what is this crazy useless government's answer extra funding
no
UNK what is the first thing the government do to make b r more attractive to the private sector
UNK a huge redundancy programme that will lead erm which will result in a lot more UNK stations and a hell of a lot less maintenance
now let's look at some facts that the lying tories won't tell you
our rail network is the lowest funded the lowest UNK and has the lowest investment programme in europe with the poorest quality service and the UNK declining level of safety but b r has the highest fares
since nineteen eighty three the government has reduced financial support by over two billion pound and reduced staff by seventy thousand resulting in less maintenance and falling safety standards and with as i said higher fares but fewer services
now i ask you do you think that a UNK network that has to pay a divided to investors will lead to a better safer cleaner cheaper railway
of course not in fact it will probably be the reverse with even higher fares less if any off peak services and maybe closures of UNK lines
the government plan to help private operators by UNK the UNK pension fund of millions of pounds to UNK their operations for passenger and freight on a scale that b r have never ever known
this has got to be UNK if not illegal
it is obvious the way the railway should move forward not privatization but a UNK of the UNK and a move to a total commitment of higher financial support
if richard branson wants to run trains let him build a network and compete against a properly funded british rail
congress the vote in the house of commons was lost unfortunately but our sponsored mps must ensure that the opposition in the house of lords UNK this ridiculous legislation as vigorously as possible and we must support our brothers and sisters in b r with their fight
congress i move
thank you
dave london region seconding the motion on rail privatization
colleagues once again we see the tories operating an example of what i call UNK packet policies
policies driven not by UNK or efficiency but based on dogs simply on UNK
they make them up as they go along
it's very difficult to find any support at all for rail privatization outside a handful of ministers
even tory mps are against it and have to be UNK into line to get it through parliament
the effect of privatization will have a wide range of effects
for the staff it will mean job losses as lines are cut and worse conditions as more and more work goes out to contract
today we learn of nine hundred job losses at what used to be b r e l in the engineering section
for us the customers it will mean higher fares and fewer services as UNK and social services are cut and this is only if we are left a train service at all
i come from norfolk and with privatization many rural lines will be cut as the private sector being as UNK and UNK
transport organizations predict that only the three main lines to london will be left and only those with a peak service
services which provide trains for both rural villages and UNK will be cut
the lines under threat ipswich to UNK norwich UNK the north norfolk link they may all go
train spotting in east anglia will take on a whole new meaning
cuts have already begun to as the british rail cow has UNK up
in king's lynn where i live the freight line to the docks has now been closed
this has forced fifty thousand tons of coal traffic and ten thousand tons of toxic chemical traffic onto east UNK already UNK roads
chemicals that in the common market are not allowed to travel by road they're forced on to rail
when the minister of the environment was contacted to help in putting pressure on b r the council were told why were they contacting him it was not a matter that he was interested in
the department of transport they were very little help we contacted them and after initial propaganda visits we were told that sixty thousand tons of traffic wasn't worth UNK about it wasn't large enough to warrant any help or subsidy
this is this is the way it will go and will continue to go
the people in rural areas train lines are an essential way to move around communities
for many people without that they will simply be isolated in their own small communities
colleagues i urge you to reject the UNK look at the practical integrated policy and support the motion
composite eighteen floods of convenience g m b scotland to move
mr chairman colleagues david g m b scotland composite motion eighteen floods of convenience
colleagues the parliament of the european community and of the united kingdom have seriously considered the consequences of the UNK of eighty five thousand tons of oil from oil UNK which ran UNK on the coast of the shetland islands on the fifth of january nineteen ninety three and for a considerable time UNK of the european parliament have been complaining UNK for greater safety at sea
although they have gained the support of the majority of mps but when the submission reached the council of ministers they unfortunately find that their representations have been UNK
quite recently the european parliament have been calling for oil ships which do not meet e c standards to be UNK from community waters
also ships carrying dangerous UNK in sensitive waters for example an area similar to where the went ashore or perhaps the UNK where cargo UNK have been reduced by eighty percent since UNK was introduced
colleagues great credibility should go to john UNK shadow transport secretary who has demanded that all foreign registered UNK should provide details of routes when they set off from port so that all operators can be dealt with
not surprisingly however john UNK the transport secretary although he did not oppose john UNK submissions made it quite clear that this would be extremely expensive
colleagues action of this nature should not be measured in terms of money
only last week we saw a UNK in the channel at a real cost eight UNK lives
chair colleagues i ask conference to support composite motion eighteen
thank you
don london region seconding composite eighteen
president congress brothers and sisters the issue here is very really very simple
we want the e c to enforce laws at least along the lines imposed by the u s a after the UNK disaster
these are not perfect they're only a starting point
they include a greater control of shipping and the use of double skin UNK for dangerous UNK
there's a certain UNK here in the fact that the world leader in free market philosophy should be the one to try and bring some regulation into this area because that's the problem here almost complete deregulation the use of convenient ships low skilled low paid er UNK often third world workers used and abused by ship owners the world over to increase their profit margins with a subsequent lack of concern over both the environment and people's lives
as my UNK from scotland says john UNK has done a good job here but i have to say it's not up against very much
after both the disaster and the UNK in the channel last week the government will lord did you know he's the shipping minister
hardly is
after every question on oil UNK he talked about how they started to put passenger UNK safer
if ever there was an example which helped the case for the abolition of the house of lords then he is it but that's another resolution for another day
we talked yesterday about a lot about europe about the importance of workers' rights in europe but here we can expand upon this
use the e c's political and financial muscle to bring about proper registered and regulated bulk carriers
maybe our UNK could help here
support this motion it's important that free UNK aren't given licences to destroy our environment
aye seconds
motion three one six single european market birmingham region to move
congress fellow delegates president
UNK birmingham region
moving motion three one six single european market
it is with regret and concern that i find myself moving to this resolution since the members as members of the european community want would like to have been possible to travel freely between members states
however this is not the case as some of our partners are operating tours for UNK coaches passing through their borders
this motion was UNK by a particular case which happened within the birmingham region on the first of january nineteen ninety three which should have been a start of the european market the people's europe
twenty five coaches with one thousand three hundred passengers returning from christmas break in austria were met with UNK piece of discrimination which broke communities laws
when entering germany you are supposed to pay a toll which is only charged to non german coach operators
a UNK based european holiday coach company were supposed to pay seven thousand four hundred and fifty pounds as a toll which in itself was an illegal act of discrimination
now it is now this matter has been taken up on behalf of the company by the UNK european member of parliament john UNK and colleagues
i have here correspondence that has been exchanged between mr UNK and the european commission and german president
anybody wants some copies i have a few copies here
however it seems that as far as i can make out from the correspondence the UNK are split in their opinion as to the UNK of action of the german government
colleagues this is simply not acceptable and i call on congress to support this resolution and instruct the e c to raise the matter in the proper government departments
i understand that c e c's accepting this motion and asking for UNK for further consultation
i agree
i move the motion
thank you
er it's not quite correct that that's a new one accepting er and then referring
we're actually gonna be asking for reference but we're gonna have a look at it and the c e c's people will make that clear
okay
er is that seconded three one six
formally seconded
thank you very much
motion three one eight full car licence new drivers midland region to move
john midlands and east coast region moving motion three one eight
brothers and colleagues statistics show that the majority of car accidents are mainly within the first year of people passing their driving test
at present a person can take a few driving lessons and pass a driving test and he is then free to purchase any type of car they can afford regardless of how powerful that car is
it doesn't matter that they have very little experience driving cars on our road
as soon as they pass their driving test they can get out of the UNK test car and hop into a two or three litre car and off they go down the road to possibly death and destruction
some of them are capable and sensible drivers but as the records show there are those who not only put their own lives at risk but that of others as well
at present there are people who choose to display a green UNK plate for a period of time after they have passed their test but this is only optional and may lead to other coloured UNK plates being sold which then may not be taken seriously
i believe that we should support the principle of a universal sign which identifies the status of the driver as an important step forward to ensuring safety on our roads
this union has always been at the forefront of health and safety issues within the many industries that we represent
health and safety also applies on our roads and bearing in mind we may be UNK a large transport section we should be seen to take an interest in not only our members' safety but the safety of others as well
in the interest of road safety colleagues i ask that you support the motion
thank you
president conference ken midlands and east coast region seconding motion three one eight
conference if you think back to all those times that you have sat at home watching the news after a day's work like i have and listen carefully to what is being said you may well have been horrified and UNK to hear the many stories UNK to people who have had accidents or died due to the fact that the machine they have been driving has been too powerful
by obtaining the full car licence you are able to buy a vehicle which is and can be a lethal weapon in the hands of wrong people but this motion calls for constraints to be placed upon people when they obtain that full licence and at twelve hundred c you can have enough power as well as enjoy the driving for the future
we should be looking to educate and train all people a lot more than we do at the moment where driving is concerned so that from the very moment you pass your test you can feel confident other people can feel confident and we can all have confidence on the road
conference to have a sign in the front and rear of your car may help all new drivers to understand that as a new driver you are entering a system that we are not aware of speed which is associated with many other items causes the very things that we work in our day to day lives under health and safety to stop
accidents
conference please support i second
motion three one nine
president congress and the delegates guests
owen midland and east coast region
moving motion three one nine
congress it's against the law in this country to ride a bicycle without lights during the hours of darkness
so why are they not fitted to all new UNK cycles during manufacturing
the law has not been UNK to in the recent years as it was in the past and every night when you're out you usually see more than one UNK driving without lights often on the pavement
this causes an hazard to the UNK
the modern cycle has enormous UNK and other UNK for riding on all types of roads and usually no fitted lights
i stopped a UNK recently he weren't very big by the way who was showing no lights
when i asked him why he said it would spoil the looks of his bicycle to have them fitted now
that's a cycle that cost him over two hundred pounds and it would cost him more money to have lights fitted now as an extra
if lights were fitted as a standard requirement during manufacturing of UNK cyclists they could be made to UNK in with the colour scheme of the cycle
a major campaign was launched regarding the wearing of cycle UNK and there has been a great response favourable response to this cutting down enormously under a number of fatal accidents involving UNK cyclists
so it's now up to congress to UNK the manufacturing of cyclists of cycles to fit rare and rear lights
sorry to i'll say that again to fit front and rear lights during production thus cutting down the number of accidents involving cyclists not showing lights during the hours of darkness even farther
in the meantime congress we call upon the police to enforce their powers on cycles cyclists riding without lights during the hours of darkness
now i urge you to support
thank you very much
i'll try not to be as UNK this morning
UNK national race committee south western region
yesterday i handed you a message regarding er the request renewed to make a statement over the phrase black wednesday a phrase that was UNK by john smith two days after the event
you have not made that statement
there are four members of the national race committee here today and i tell you now
UNK
if you do not make the statement
UNK
we will walk out of conference
UNK
thank you aye
er UNK it's not a point of order because the point of order has no relevance to this particular debate
it has no relevance to this debate but it has
UNK
plenty of relevance to the black membership of this union
UNK
UNK
the point of order has no relevance to this particular debate
i will make the statement at the appropriate time to congress
we've got the statement here
don't come back
the statement is here the statement will be made
second the resolution list
midlands and east coast region
with the increase in public transport costs road tax and insurance more and more people are changing to the humble bike as an alternative form of transport
in nineteen seventy nine their sales UNK the one and a half million mark
in nineteen ninety two this has risen to two point two million and the indications are the ninety three figures are going to be much higher
in fact told me this is an expanding market
as the favour UNK cannot be beaten the cost of the average bike is between ninety nine pounds and one hundred and ninety nine pounds
if you compare that cost with the average cost of public transport you will realize you can soon UNK your initial UNK within six months and unlike cars there are no parking problems
on the UNK side UNK can be positively dangerous that is why in nineteen eighty nine congress passed a motion calling for the provision of UNK
i move that resolution and on i've yet to see any evidence of them
delegates i ride a motorbike so i am familiar with the UNK faced by cyclists i am also too well aware of the lack of road sense of some cyclists
i'm aware of most of the crazy things they do
they could give UNK pilots some lessons
so i tend to give them a wide UNK wherever possible
however much harder to anticipate is their sudden appearance in front of you from nowhere in the dark with lights on and it's not just kids it's adults who should know better
it's no good depending as owen said waiting for people to fit lights themselves they won't because they don't think accidents can happen to them
one accident is one too many
please support this resolution
conference wish to put a point of view on several of these motions and i call frank
frank responding for the c e c and motions three one four three one six three one eight three one nine and composite eighteen
congress the c e c has asked me to accept motion three one four and composite eighteen to refer motions three one six and three one eight and to accept motion three one nine
on motion three one four british rail privatization
this government has got to be really be joking with its proposals for example the west coast line from north to south is estimated to require in the region of eight hundred million to cover track repairs and UNK as well as UNK rolling stock and signal UNK
all the speeds will have to be reduced for all rolling stock used on that line which will increase the cost for uses of the of that service
because of privatization plans british rail hasn't got any rolling stock on order
if they won't order the stock do they really expect a new UNK to do it
i don't think they will
at least not when i'm passing on that cost to you the users and as any cost increase will decrease the use of further track closures will follow
another example is from region rail which is a totally independent system but over the years the five local authorities have UNK millions of pounds of investment into improving a system the stations the track and the rolling stock which in accordance with the rail bill will be put out of franchise next year but will anyone have to buy it
no
the company that requires us to pay out the smallest subsidy will be given the franchise and allow to use or probably allow to UNK a facility that's been established over the years while it takes its profit and UNK them to its shareholders
on composite eighteen what more needs to be said
this system is used to reduce wages increase company profits and totally undermine training and health and safety procedures for crews and provide UNK for all the countries around whose coast they sail with the death and environmental problems that follow from accidents such as occurred in the past week
lives should be and are more important than profits through exploitation
motion three one six refers to UNK on passengers
it appears that german states are opposing a vat like tax on in an inconsistent way UNK by a failure to warn of any increase in the tax in january nineteen ninety three
i would ask you to refer this motion so we can investigate the background more closely
in the view of the c e c motion three one eight has wide implications for a transport industry as a whole and UNK safety measures need to be examined
however we have no difficulty with the idea that cycles should be fitted with lights
should many cyclists ignore this law or are hurt as a result it's always possible for lights to be removed if necessary
colleagues the c e c is asking you to accept motion three one four and composite eighteen to refer motion three one six and three one eight and to accept motion three one nine
thank you
thanks frank

colleagues we now turn to the special report a new concept of trade unionism g m b cooperation with the t g i propose that the general secretary should move this we'll have it formally seconded
we'll then take motion two five t g w u motion two eight changing employment patterns moved and seconded i will then invite speakers from each of the regions on the special report
general secretary to move
john general secretary moving the special report and you may have noticed that the television cameras have gone
this is only about the possible er partnership of two of the largest unions in britain
an organization which if it ever came to be formed will be representing nearly two million people
pity our media showed a different sense of priorities
but colleagues five years ago i looked forward to the merger between g m b and apex and predicted by the year two thousand there would be only four major unions in britain call them the four super unions
in fact as you know the world has moved a good deal faster than any of us expected
last year the a w u was formed and next month unison comes into existence
this debate is about how we will respond and in a very real sense it's about the future of the whole trade union movement in britain
in the mid eighties we decided that if we were going to be one of the super unions we had to be amalgamation friendly
we've been UNK successful in the amalgamation UNK
textiles workers greater london staff association apex UNK and garment workers they were all UNK by other unions but they all had the good sense to merge into the g m b in the next few months we'll be joined by members of e f t a t i am delighted that the special e f t a t conference voted in favour of the g m b i welcome that decision and i pay tribute to the many colleagues who worked so hard to achieve that victory
we'll be seeing the e f t a t colleagues on thursday i hope you'll give them a very warm welcome
that's the good news
the bad news is of course that our successful amalgamation policy has been made against the background of falling union membership
we've done better than most but our membership levels have suffered as well
high unemployment anti trade union laws macho management they've all had their damaging effect
we all know people who want trade union protection but dare not join because they fear UNK
because of political UNK trade union membership in britain is being held at an artificially low level
if we have the same legal system even as continental europe trade union membership in britain will be at least two million higher than it is today but let's not UNK ourselves
political spite has done us enormous damage but it's not the whole story
during the last ten years britain has changed very often for the worse the nature of work has changed and we the trade union movement have not changed fast enough to keep up with the pace
think about it for a moment
what are the three pillars that support trade unionism in britain
recognition by employers check off agreements reliable shop stewards and activists
our problem is that one by one these three pillars are UNK away
many of you know john here today
he's a distinguished delegate to many UNK and was london region secretary before paul
the point of mentioning john is that he used to work at the massive UNK plant in west london
it closed a few years ago they couldn't knock it down because it was meant to be a prime example of nineteen thirties architecture
john always said that they spent more money UNK the UNK than they ever spent on the thousands of workers who worked inside the plant but then when it closed they couldn't knock it down so they turned it into a UNK
that seems to me to be a UNK from UNK britain
from manufacturing to retail from workshop to shop work from full time to part time
if you look around the towns and cities of britain you will find the same story be it steel plants those vast chemical plants the big engineering works they UNK exist any more and if they still are there they've UNK to a tiny part of their earlier size
the old industrial UNK are disappearing
instead we have what i'll call a bits and pieces economy
service industries small workplaces short term employment and more and more employers who don't know anything about trade unions and don't want to know
in workplace after workplace we find UNK workers frightened workers vulnerable workers but little chance of recognition no hope of check off and no one brave enough to come forward as a steward
our problem our central problem in the british trade union movement is that we have a trade union movement that operates very UNK in one world while over half the people of britain work in an entirely different world a world where trade unionism is UNK ever mentioned and if it is mentioned it's mentioned with a hint of fear
the challenge set out in the introduction to our report the first page it was very carefully written is to build a new trade unionism on a model to fit this new world
a new concept of trade unionism that offers a vital and effective support system for everyone at work everyone at work not just the ones in the big workplaces but everyone
a new concept that doesn't depend on recognition doesn't depend of check off and doesn't depend on representation by shop stewards in every workplace
where we've got those conditions great but we've also got to find a trade unionism for the rest and the growing majority of employees in britain
now of course we've got some experience in these things and we can put together some sort of picture of what that trade unionism for a new world might look like
the first thing you've go to do is you've got to provide services that mean something to everyone at work
legal representation very important maybe also pension schemes that can provide real pension protection
quick fire advice down the phone or face to face on work related issues
then of course you have to ensure that you can offer representation whenever it is needed but most of all we've somehow got to create the feeling of lifetime loyalty to the trade union movement and to a particular trade union
not just a situation where you work in one place and when you leave you leave the union as well
with fast changing employment there's no future in that
somehow we've got to say to people we will provide this valuable service to you from your first job until your last breath wherever you work
if we get recognition we'll bargain for you but if you don't we'll protect and support you in any job you fill
well that's just an outline but it's an outline to meet a need that no other union at the moment is even trying to meet and what a need and what a demand
do you know that nearly nine hundred thousand people walked off the streets of britain into citizen advice UNK last year to ask for their help on employment issues because they had no trade union
we could offer a service that no cab can match
so how do we do it
and this is where i come to the point of cooperation and maybe more with other unions
we don't start from scratch a plug for the t g they started down this track with their own link up campaign and in the g m b we've pushed forward the UNK of trade unionism into professional small businesses legal offices and of course other commercial services
but how do we give a new UNK to that development
well we've got somehow to think our way out of the current difficulties
the best chance of success for working people no doubt would be if the two great general unions the t g w u and the g m b found a way of doing it together found a way of creating the most powerful union that has ever existed in britain
calling our resources UNK our activists achieving by cooperation what we've never achieved by UNK competition but then of course that's a vision
and then the UNK come in and that's why your executive is being very cautious in this report
maybe the task is too ambitious
maybe a hundred years of history and tradition will defeat us
maybe the t g doesn't want a partnership of equals maybe it wants a UNK
that wouldn't do for us
the g m b won't be a UNK on anyone's UNK
so that's why we move carefully
in all honesty the difficulties are UNK but i tell you this for too many years trade unionism has been in the UNK and with such a prize however difficult to achieve it would be a UNK of our heritage and a UNK of our members if we don't give it a good hard try
so the report is about the possibility of a grand enterprise
the industrial cooperation between our unions should continue of course
our members wanted it and in many industries it makes sense but the bigger task the main event is to see whether by a more formal relationship a more formal partnership we can build a union which is better than the t g better than the g m b and better suited for modern conditions than any trade union so far created in britain
now it's important to understand what the executive is looking for
this is not an amalgamation for its own sake it is not an amalgamation to manage a continuing and more comfortable decline it's not UNK together two super unions into one UNK union and just hoping for the best
what we should try to create is a UNK of the labour movement
modern relevant and as successful in recruitment of the workforce of the nineties as we used to be in recruiting the workforce of the sixties and seventies
the UNK of the british labour movement nothing less that's the vision that's what we want to try and create and that's what we want to come back to you and tell you about the prospects next year
that's our vision
the UNK of the labour movement and our task now if you pass this report is to find out whether that UNK can be built
think about it carefully
i move
we have the report formally UNK
thank you very much indeed
i now call motion two five t g w u london region to move
president congress roy london region moving motion two five on the t g colleagues let's make it clear this motion is not opposed to a merger of the t g what it seeks to do is put forward another idea which is to continue to work closely with the t g on a wide range of jointly agreed
for we desperately need a common approach in such areas as the t u c on the general council on the general committee and congress and more importantly joint roles in the labour party
we need to jointly work together in public services if we are to combat the problems faced by the
all that work is positive and in the interests of all our members a slow and measured approach are coming together by general consent building trust and commitment to a new big union
colleagues i believe the building of a trust is the most important fact in the whole of this debate
we shouldn't kid ourselves for in factories and workplaces around the country g m b and t g are at each other 's UNK
that trust will take some building especially in the liverpool area region sorry
this motion calls upon the c e c to seek a structure which would keep both unions UNK keeping their structures their conferences their regional government etcetera
let the two unions come together by building the links in the common ground
colleagues the c e c statement report told er considered trade unions and its conclusions recommended that preliminary discussions for transport and general on the feasibility of a merger with a report back on next year's congress
the danger with that we believe could be that we would set a date for the merger and take all the important issues and discussions how many regions will it have will we have the those regions and a hundred and one other problems raised by that merger into a tight timescale
this will only cause problems with consultation with the members and they're the most important the bloody members but it could lead to and a UNK for jobs
it could also tie up members of the c e c the general secretary the regional secretary the president officers and many others in internal UNK new union just at the time when we need to look outward in the next two or three years
the danger is it could damage the very relations we tend we need to build
a structure as i've said previously will give us the vital time and for the detailed discussions and consultations we need if we are to build the trust for the merger we all wish to see
colleagues please support the motion
seconder colleagues for two five
yes london region er group four security have you noticed we've lost another prisoner last night and he nicked me trousers
we er we concur with the general secretary's er when he said two years ago there will be four super unions by the year two thousand obviously that's gonna be a reality
er it's something that will be welcomed by the trade union movement a new forward a new beginning to join once again the fruits of our labour with partnership with other unions and the labour party which was what we all need but it must be done with careful planning and the brains at the top of the union must be telling the of the union the members on the shop floor the right direction in which to walk
clearly at the state of the talks with the t g we still have a long way to go to reach this new goal and there's a strong UNK that there has been discussions between sir john UNK and lord bill morris the name of the new union already and i think an UNK title for the union at the moment would be yugoslavia because we're in ethnic groups we are sections we've got the boiler makers who are still claiming things they lost ten years ago when they UNK
we've got apex who've been brought in to bring in the new the white collar worker unions to form another concept of trade unionism
lovely now me i'm an ex m a t s a member i'm in the security industry at the moment i haven't got a section so what am i a UNK a UNK or a UNK i don't know
so surely we got to tidy up our own act before we go further forward and as a trade union surely we are to fight unemployment
now surely will this merger cause er unemployment amongst our staff
will we need two general secretaries two presidents two vice presidents
and then again look at congress
obviously if we're gonna be two big unions obviously portsmouth is no longer going to fit the bill and i think that's a shame because several UNK i've been to and this is the UNK weather i've ever enjoyed
can't argue with that
and what a lovely place portsmouth is i must say went to the UNK on the toilet at the UNK last night and as i left i looked at the sign that said er please adjust your dress before you leave
that's equality for you
and then what are we gonna have
are we gonna have an annual congress a bi annual congress a UNK annual congress
when are we gonna have rules UNK there's a long way to go and as the er general secretary said be careful because i've been to talks with on from the regional committee with the t g yes we got on lovely with them they're fine they gave us a nice big er UNK of the UNK strike and it's got my granddad and my great granddad on it cos they was there in the other union mind you while we've done all the striking and that they stood by but nevertheless they're not bad lads anyway and as john said we must be careful that we are not the ones that are gonna be taken over because i remember that old song of the fifties never smile at a UNK
don't be taken in by his welcome UNK he's UNK how well you'll fit beneath his skin
brothers sisters president we've still got a long way to go
general secretary you may be ready to UNK in now but we but we want to wait till the time is right
i second
goodness me keep taking the tablets
motion two eight midland region to move
can't follow that
president congress bob midlands and east coast region moving motion two eight
changing employment patterns
many of the points that i make in this speech have already been covered by john but they are important and deserve to be repeated
the matters of employing people is changing and in the main those changes fly in the face of traditional g m b organization and make recruitment and retention of membership more difficult
whatever the reasons for these changes be they because of a hostile government new technology or the european dimension we must respond and change if we are to survive as a UNK organization
the employment situation described in the motion are no longer the exception they are the rule and as such we must UNK up our recruitment act
that is not to say we should adopt the hard sell or abandon our traditional value but we must seriously examine how we can appeal to more desperate scattered membership
we must seriously examine how we can involve such membership in the decision making of the union and carry them with us through change
we must seriously examine the relevance and method of delivery of our range of benefits
how can we appeal to part time workers and convince them that we can change things for the better many of whom are home workers who are working in appalling conditions and often for less than fifty pence an hour
what can we do for members in small workplaces where even basic health and safety standards are exempt by law
how shall we respond to the loss of check off as the proposed legislation means we surely will
how can we react to the loss of local authority standards of paying conditions and negotiation practices
how can we service and maintain our appeal to members opting to work in europe and how can we recruit europeans working here
clearly this is a wide ranging motion designed to UNK thought and debate with no easy answers
i welcome the decision of the c e c to examine the issues involved in greater detail
i move
liz midlands and east coast
the speaker from the northern region will get on very well with my three year old UNK she don't like UNK either
however in the interest of UNK i will my remarks to points a and b since nineteen seventy nine there's been a major shift away from our industrial base towards service industries
consequently part time work and casual work is now a significant feature of our economy
effectively we've become a low UNK low skilled economy with virtually no protection for many of our fellow workers
at the same time home working is on the increase it's been estimated one million people do paid work at home seventy three percent of which are women
they take on this work not for pin money but to provide for their family's basic needs
they are forced into accepting low paid jobs exposed to health UNK with no job protection because of family responsibilities or affordable child care
you know delegates when most people think about home working they really think beyond the traditional jobs associated with this group of workers
i recently read the a b c of UNK it was quite never mind i can't say the damn word i could see very clearly the potential for injury and exposure to other UNK is frightening
i fear the element is the growth of white collar working
it's my guess and it's an educated guess within the next decade this growth will speed up partly because of new technology and the employer's needs to cut costs and UNK profits
you know delegates this resolution is about recruitment and retention but it's also about the ideals on which this movement of ours was founded
if as a union we are to meet the challenges that lie ahead then please support this resolution
if not we can stand here like and get our feet wet because that's what's gonna happen
please support
thanks very much indeed liz
colleagues i now come back to the special report and will take speakers from the regions
liverpool region
if colleagues from the back of congress are intending to speak if they could come forward
alan liverpool region
president congress liverpool region support the document
we do need closer links not only with the t g but also with other unions but let's not forget that other unions are organizing to build up their membership at the expense of the g m b we need to make up our minds do we want an amalgamation or not
if we do we must act quickly because our members in the health service local authorities and all public services are in danger of being approached by the creation of unison
our craft members are in danger of being approached by the a w e u
alan i'm sorry to interrupt you i do apologize
colleagues this is a very important matter
i'm sure we're all agreed about that
so let's have the best of order for the speakers please
right alan
thank you president
our craft members are in danger of being UNK by the a w e u an amalgamation may not be some people's ideal but it will take away a lot of the friction between the two unions
we will only have one set of policies and one set of rules
there would also be another benefit in amalgamation
we would get back the two and a half thousand members the t g UNK in liverpool city council
one final point the liverpool regional council strongly recommended that amalgamation talks should start as soon as possible
scotland
president colleagues geoff g m b scotland
supporting the c e c report
colleagues g m b scotland UNK and UNK the central UNK initiative in bringing forward the of this congress the big important debate of this congress between ourselves and the transport and general workers' union at some time in the future
the paper quite rightly says and i quote the relationship between the t g w u and the g m b has all been marked by a UNK of competition and co operation
it then goes on to detail a number of joint initiatives covering the country and all the g m b regions
to be fair the c e c have not tried to say that everything in the garden is UNK they've also highlighted a number of problem areas that still exist
indeed all look at the recent decision by the and allied trade union to the members who have amalgamated themselves transport and general workers
it's only dirty tricks and UNK tactics used by the t g during the approach of the workers' union so must realize congress to be more positive one of the major benefits or more the major benefit from future amalgamation with the t g would be the free help of officials from both unions and negotiations both national regional and even at times individual company level where both unions help members
colleagues the time gained by having only one and recruitment and on negotiations rather at least two could be much better UNK than the certain the day to day needs of membership
colleagues g m b scotland UNK to review that the benefits from the future amalgamation between the two great general unions within the united kingdom would by far any possible UNK
congress g m b scotland supports
london region
congress president
ed westminster trade union political UNK branch london region
congress i'm a labour councillor and whenever i sit on the council i also ask conservative members to declare their interest before they speak on an issue so i better declare mine
when i first went to work i went and joined the union there wasn't one in the factory i was working in and so i went to the nearest er trade union office and joined
that union supported me as i recruited the whole of the workforce and er i was then sacked after four weeks
some things don't change
the union then supported me further when i got another job and was a steward there a branch secretary a district committee member and then on the regional committee and they also helped to put me through UNK and into the job that i did looking at UNK at the university of UNK
that union was the transport and general workers' union
that's my interest
having looked at UNK then from both sides i've seen the prejudices that go into any debate that takes place between any unions coming together
obviously unions have their own traditions and their own ways of doing things in their own UNK structures
clearly in any merger between the g m b and the t g there are big UNK to overcome
there are and i know because i've seen both sets of prejudices from both sides
the t g traditionally have looked at the g m b as er look down at sometimes at the g m b i've heard them described before as the UNK up union and various other things
UNK terms
i came into the g m b and heard exactly the same kind of UNK comments about the transport and general workers' union
comrades we must put to one side these kind of this kind of fighting
we must i think look to go forward together
the union movement is under attack we cannot afford ever to waste our resources on fighting each other we should look to always work together
however in doing so it is important that we take time because time allows people to come together in a sensible way not to be forced together
we don't need to see er leaflets and so on urging us into merger before they're actually ready to take place from the membership itself
go UNK forward work towards the merger but don't force it too quickly
i support the document
midland region
president conference alan midland and east coast region opposing the c e c document
conference my region isn't against UNK with other unions
the g m b's got a long record of joining forces with others which has proved to be successful but if we're gonna be honest it's always been recognized that we would be the UNK union and yes apex members we should have been honest with you at the time of merger because it's quite clear you was gonna lose your identity to at least to some extent and we should have been honest about that
the only thing i would say delegates is that the we will also swallow the UNK and there's a message in that for all of us
a merger with the transport and general workers' union will be like any other previous arrangements
the problems that are gonna manifest themselves will any possible advantages
consider for example what's gonna happen to the UNK and to our structures
let's think about the number of regions we have the t g have got seven we've got ten
perhaps we'll lose a region or three
how regional councils and the c e c operate
what i do know we'll to get everyone in
how are we going to organize congress
perhaps president we could solve the problem by the t g having theirs one year and us the next
i suppose that's that kind of bi annual arrangement
what's going to happen to the regional committees to officers and staff
these will be the issues that'll concentrate but more importantly what's in the best interest of our members
will their concerns be at the forefront of people's minds once the UNK starts and blood will be UNK you know
ask the t g officers what they think to the way they were when the redundancy notices were handed out so full time officers in the
in the audience be careful cos you're going don't be under any illusion when your region your job or your elected position is under threat it's human nature to protect your back and when this happens it's the members who end up being the casualties
conference the document quite rightly identifies the common ground between our two unions
it points to the cooperation which already exists
so why do we need to UNK these arrangements why rock the boat at time when the political climate is
you don't believe for a minute that this government will stand by while the two biggest general unions get together no way they'll attack us in any way they can and i warn ya they haven't run out of ideas yet
i'm all in favour of fighting the tories to protect our members' interest but we won't be doing much fighting because we'll be using all our efforts sorting out internal UNK
we can also expect de recognition by employers who are frightened to death by the t g it it's already happening
i tell you another year of feasibility studies will take us to the point of no return
bill the and john started holding hands about a year ago and it's already resulted in their engagement and it's clear that they're planning their big day for the summer of next year
we should tell them to forget about having their UNK read and advise them stay just good friends
colleagues we have an opportunity today to vote this document down to vote against it because the future of our union and the interests of our members is at risk
let's take it and prevent a constructive
good morning hope you all UNK hope you all enjoyed the meeting last night and er just by way of a change today we've got er resolutions and debates on the labour party and from one socialist party to another can i extend the UNK congratulations of the g m b labour party conference to our comrades in spain who've been successful in winning a fourth general election
all against the odds they've come through
congratulations to phil UNK
er colleagues can i start the today's business by extending a very warm welcome indeed to councillor dr alan leader of the city of portsmouth council
councillor was born in carlisle and he's lived in portsmouth since nineteen sixty six
attended three universities durham UNK and southampton
UNK by the way is not in britain
he is currently the principal lecturer in UNK in er in UNK of environmental studies at portsmouth UNK and in nineteen seventy nine he was appointed a justice of the peace
councillor 's political background started in nineteen sixty two when he joined the labour party
he's been a candidate on six occasions in portsmouth UNK elections and in nineteen eighty six was elected to the UNK ward
from eighty six to eighty nine he was planning UNK for portsmouth city council and in nineteen eighty nine he was a candidate for the euro election fo for and east UNK coming second with fifty one thousand votes
in nineteen ninety councillor was re elected for the UNK ward and in nineteen ninety nineteen ninety one he became leader of the opposition for portsmouth city council
colleagues would you extend a very warm welcome to alan
erm chair delegates thank you for the welcome and thank you for the invitation to speak to you
i think i've got five minutes which is probably more than some of you delegates have got so i'll keep it fairly short and sweet
i'm we're very proud that the g m b has come to portsmouth at last er and er that your flag is flying in the UNK square
last week we had the co op congress and the week before that we had the UNK flag flying from socialist spain because of our new links with UNK the UNK service there
i asked my neighbour er i'm not a member of the g m b unlike the deputy lord mayor who spoke to you yesterday
give him a
er
you can collect your application form on the way out
if i could i would have been i assure you
er i'm a member of n a t f e one of those funny educational unions
but erm one of my neighbours works for a c a s and i asked him er his opinion of the g m b and he said good UNK hard UNK but very good at getting better conditions for their members and i think he and certainly i knew before that the g m b is one of the most progressive trade unions in this country and we're very pleased to have them in portsmouth
er delegates i think sometimes conferences are held in a bit of a UNK you know here you are in the hall in the UNK er outside in the city of portsmouth so can i say just a few words about portsmouth
it's a real place in many ways if you if you walk round the small terraced houses certainly in the area that i represent in UNK it looks a bit like a northern city
neat terraced houses UNK it doesn't vote like a northern city unfortunately
very dependent on defence and i know some delegates here work in our local defence industries or in the UNK always been attached to defence and vulnerable now because of defence cuts
we have a an unemployment rate officially of twelve thousand probably the real figure as you well know is up probably sixteen thousand in a city of less than two hundred thousand
we have some new industries i b m for example but i b m are UNK labour at a very fast rate something like seven hundred people are going in the next year so we have our problems in portsmouth
don't let anyone suggest that it's all UNK on the south coast not so
we have a labour led council which i'm proud to be the leader
we have only fourteen labour councillors out of thirty nine and you'll be wondering how we manage to lead the council
well rightly or wrongly we've come to arrangements with the liberals not because we like the liberals not because we wanted to but we were fed up with be being in opposition to tell you the truth
year after year watching the tories make a mess of it so we we've done we've come to this temporary arrangement and it's worked i think
most of the time comrades as you well know it's damage UNK
in local councils in trade union movement it's damage UNK it it's stopping the worst of tory legislation and policies in particular c UNK
i'm proud that in the last two years under my administration we have not had one compulsory redundancy and it's not easy i can assure you
we've had to make a million pounds savings this last year
we've got our UNK port very proud of our UNK owned UNK port i hope some of you will use it or if you haven't done so already
a huge success the government have said next year we can only borrow one million pounds to invest
nowhere near enough they're trying to get us to sell it off by the back door and we will resist that
a lot of employment there and important to the local economy and we've managed to take some important initiatives in terms of helping the pensioners in the city crime prevention and other issues so we think we've done a reasonable job
at the moment we're also trying to move our football club er rather a difficult exercise you can imagine
anyone from leicester here
where are the midlands
i think i'll erm pass on er issues relating to the labour party leadership and er labour trade union links
i i've got my views i'm sure you've got yours and i shall listen later in the morning to the debate but i would finally say delegates that i hope you enjoy your stay in portsmouth in particular UNK where most of you are staying if you have a chance go to the rose gardens have a walk along the sea front there it's magnificent this time of year and a tribute to our staff in our direct works organization for their hard work
the heritage area also i'm sure jim said to us yesterday is well worth a visit if you have the time to see the mary rose and the victory and we have a very good selection of indian UNK i recommend the UNK in
anyway welcome to portsmouth we're delighted to have you here and we hope you come again
thank you
colleagues to mark the occasion i'd like to present on your behalf er a copy of john 's UNK bright and also a suitably UNK to alan
thank you very much
thanks very much alan before we move on to the agenda colleagues er could i announce that the collection yesterday for the UNK strikers realized a magnificent sum of five hundred and forty nine pounds
and could i extend a very warm welcome colleagues on your behalf to a representative of one of the german trade unions i g which our union is working very closely with in the chemical industry throughout UNK europe
UNK
welcome

thank you very much
colleagues i now call the section secretary's report donald to ask to give his report
donald
donald national secretary
president delegates the events of last october and the coal crisis dramatically showed at once the strength and the weakness of the trade union movement today
our strengths are obvious that of compassion support and feeling for our people when in trouble
the higher feelings of human nature of concern for another human being
the basic qualities that come from our socialist tradition
it was these strengths that brought thousands upon thousands of people UNK to the UNK on that wonderful wet sunday in UNK park
many not all but many were trade unionists who UNK with the plight of the miners
that sense of right and wrong preventing those in power walking all over those UNK than themselves
a UNK and a proud day
but we also remember how that wasn't sustained and the cynical political fix of the tories a few months later that for the moment has coped with the government's political crisis and temporarily has bought a little time for a few pits
it's done nothing to tackle the short term nature of the market in energy
it's done nothing to tackle the desperate need for a balanced energy policy that looks at the long term needs of the country
that problem won't go away
the coal crisis exposed vividly the type of market in energy the tories had introduced through electricity privatization
this is no natural market it's a market that UNK encourages the burning of UNK resources of natural gas for the production of base load electricity
it's a market that despite our rich coal reserves is fixed in such a way that it ensures that before the end of the century will be a net UNK of energy
how ridiculous and all because a politically created market is UNK against coal
it's a market as well that's created a few UNK of its own
it's created companies that are more concerned with their future international profits as global energy companies than in expanding their home base
it's created senior executives in water gas and electricity who have made a killing through massive pay rises but they UNK into UNK when you look at the scandal of the share allocations and what's been going on there
in the water companies alone if you there are thousands and thousands and thousands of pounds have been made by one or two people as directors or chief executives of these companies
severn trent which held the record for UNK last year the chief executive UNK sold one hundred and thirty seven thousand shares at four hundred and eighty eight p under a share options scheme and that was after buying them the same day for two hundred and sixty two p
it's one of the UNK of the system one of the little UNK of the job that he has therefore been able to make erm a rather quick killing of three hundred and ten thousand five hundred and thirty five pounds
john who was in actual fact the chairman of the company when it was a public service he in actual fact made a killing of a quarter of a million
northumberland UNK water the chief executive david UNK one hundred and fifty nine thousand and the former manage managing director robert a hundred and eighty six thousand
all from little deals that pass away quite quietly unless we can bring it to the attention of the public
we know a bit more about their massive pay increases but not so much is known about the beautiful profits about the wonderful conditions that they've allocated to themselves
it's a scandal and it's got to be stopped it's these same senior directors of these same utility companies who are UNK our members about the problems facing their industries
the problems facing their industries and the need for them to show restraint
it's our members who've the problems to face in these industries
the UNK of water and electricity industries further privatization of water and electricity in northern ireland and water in scotland market testing in the national rivers authority changes in british gas with four reports to come from the UNK and UNK commission in july
the government review of the nuclear industry brought forward to ninety three
privatization in nuclear and atomic energy industries on the agenda
it's our members in these industries who've been given a UNK since privatization and who need as much support as possible to give them the confidence to face further difficult years ahead
far from being UNK by those who're making millions out of privatization
we must take heart from our experience in UNK park we must UNK that support and build up the confidence of our members
it will take time i've detected as i'm sure you have too delegates a feeling of confidence in our debates so far at this conference a confidence that hasn't been there recently
it's our job to transfer that confidence from the conference hall to the workplace
it won't be easy but we must take the first steps now
leading and promoting the debate on energy policy that the government wants to UNK that presents us with just such an opportunity if we don't begin to take the fight to the enemy the future is clear
more of the same more privatization more UNK more job losses and more UNK with our membership
the debate on energy policy is a vital one and one which the g m b as the only union with a UNK membership in all of the industries concerned is well placed to lead
it will be a debate an argument and a fight we must win
not just for our members in the coal industry and their communities not just for our members in the coal fired power stations not just for all of the rest of our membership whose industries depend on a secure supply of cheap energy but for our children and the generations to come after us whose very prosperity will depend heavily on our success in that campaign
the fight back begins now i commend my report
here
thanks very much indeed donald page seventy six seventy seven seventy eight
yes
okay colleague come and wait at the front alright
er dave london region
just a question for donald and just er an observation on our negotiation pay conditions from last year the v i s council and the minimum acceptable performance levels
many of us in the industry feel that british gas have broken the agreement by altering er the review dates now put on a three monthly basis rather than a six monthly
some of our members have lost their UNK rate and it's now become a bit of a running sore on the pay negotiations from last year it needs to be sorted out if confidence is to remain in last year's pay deal
president congress les midlands and east coast region
very pleased to hear donald er make comments on the rig UNK market er energy market
it's quite clear that heseltine and co will not implement the committee's findings
in the east midlands region national power applied to build a gas fired power station all the regional authorities rejected the planning application
they went ahead and applied to UNK heseltine who agreed to let them build the power station
building of this not only closes the thirty one pits but also UNK four further pits in the notts area
not only does it close four more pits but it UNK five power stations in the area
five power stations with fifteen hundred jobs mostly g m b members
UNK to the committee's reports and also public opinion
british coal paid out less in ninety one ninety two four hundred and ninety two million pound in wages alone
this has been taken out of the local economy in notts
thanks
seventy nine eighty and eighty one
donald
er first of all on the comment from dave in relation to british gas and the minimum achieved performance level or m a p l er the initials that i've come to er know and love over the past few months never having heard of them before
erm i couldn't agree more er with er what dave was saying erm that er the whole operation of that bonus scheme needs to be thoroughly examined with british gas
i have informally UNK to british gas that we'll be taking it up with them not as a mere procedural matter through the joint secretary's machinery but as a negotiating matter with the negotiating committee
there are a number of UNK in that scheme not least british UNK delightful decision to interpret the er scheme in a way which they hadn't interpreted six months ago
i'll be delighted to hear from british gas as to how they can actually turn round and change a national agreement without having any formal discussions with the trade union side at any time at all
so it's absolutely essential that we do go forward formally and take up all the issues in relation to the minimum achieved performance levels and the scheme arising from the UNK of the effects of last year's pay settlement but as er most of the delegates from british gas will know i've been er ensuring that we first of all get all of the reports in from the regional joint UNK regional joint trade union secretaries to ensure that we have as much information for once as british gas has about what's going on within the company and secondly we've had er full debates on the trade union side to ensure we were well aware of just exactly what our UNK were of what happened last year and to ensure we're going forward in a clear and a positive way
so i couldn't agree more and that will be taken up in the fairly near future following the information that i've been gathering in the various meetings that i've been having round the country on this
i had a most interesting meeting in scotland with all of our lay delegates there erm on friday and some of you within british gas will know that in scotland they've even more problems with the m a p l than any of the other regions because they were operating a different system to start with in the first place
so we've major problems and they need to be taken up
you're quite right
les on the UNK markets and i think this go goes to the heart of the problem in relation to the difficulties that we have in relation to coal the problems in relation to pits and everything in relation to the whole campaign and what we need to campaign in relation to erm er energy policy and this is absolutely crucial not only for our members within the energy and utility section but for our membership and for their families throughout er throughout the country
it's absolutely essential that there we make the government recognize that the debate on energy policy is not going to go away
they want to UNK it well and truly
there was a problem during the er evidence to the various committees that were looking at the coal crisis and the problems in relation to coal in that very often people were UNK it into UNK and the number of pits etcetera whereas the argument needed to be that the rules of the game had been UNK in the first place at the privatization of electricity and the rules of the game need to be changed if we're gonna succeed
and that must be the way we go ahead
i give you this UNK on behalf of the
membership within the energy and utilities section erm who recently debated this issue at their conference that we will pursue the question of er the policy in relation to energy policy
we will pursue it vigorously and we will campaign to get changed the basic rules which ensure that a country which is rich in coal resources ensures that it makes the most of the use of these coal resources and changes the rules automatically excluding coal from being used from sensible base burning for electricity laws
thank you
right colleagues we're now going to the energy and utilities debate and er i'd like to propose that we do it in the following fashion
we'll take composite fifteen erm motion three o eight motion three o nine composite sixteen and composite seventeen
now the c e c have got various different positions on all these motions so i'll then call john to put the c e c position on those motions at the end of the debate
so composite fifteen energy policy to be moved by southern region midlands region to second and again colleagues if supporting speakers could come down the front i'd be very much obliged
thank you chair charlie southern region moving composite fifteen energy policy
delegates some years ago i attended an international energy conference in UNK
at this conference one of the african delegates described energy as the UNK of the nation but the problem that he had coming from africa was that the country he lived in they had no coal they had no oil they had no gas and they didn't have the technology for nuclear
yet here in the u k we actually have every one of these
it is important that er we actually develop these for the use of the nation
we have coal which we're leaving now under the ground or we're UNK it
we have oil in the north sea which we are just wasting we have gas which we get from the north sea which we don't quite know what to do with it
it used to be regarded as a premium fuel for domestic and commercial use now we just send it up the UNK of power stations
and we have the technology for nuclear power yet again we don't know what to do with it we haven't developed it we've just left it and we're creating nuclear power stations and we still haven't even decided what to do with the waste
and we've got technology there that we could perhaps use and export but we just leave it alone
we also have technology on UNK this country is one of the most advanced UNK advanced in UNK in the generation of electricity yet we don't put money into investment and resources of it
what do we have
we have a policy called market forces
this leaves coal in the ground it burns power in power stations to generate to generate electricity from gas waste of a premium fuel
