i've had many students who've done this in front of me who've started off by saying my client is not a criminal
he's just been convicted
so erm remember what it is you're trying to achieve
with plea in UNK you're trying to minimize the sentence within realistic boundaries
argument is concise and to the point
one of the other things about those two that were wrong was that they UNK they were all over the place there was no UNK no clarity to them
main points are effective
again those two that were wrong were all over the place and not an effective sequence
UNK good eye contact
both the ones where they did it right they maintained good eye contact with the person they were trying to persuade
they didn't UNK at them but had good eye contact
you're doing it wrong if you're not looking at the person that you're trying to persuade
speaks clearly
you can do all this beautifully but if you can't be heard it's a waste of time
it doesn't mean you've got to should doesn't mean you've got to have a loud voice it just means you've got to speak clearly and slowly enough to be clear
you know yourself whether you tend to go quickly or whatever
practise these things
actually in the next few days stand up at home speak it say it record it if you want to
see what you sound like
but speak when you start to speak if you know that when you're nervous that you will UNK on you'll go quickly remember that so that as you start remember to slow down
if you can't slow down then deliberately pause so that the person who's listening to you has an opportunity to mentally catch up on what you're saying
so if your voice is quick make sure you put in UNK or find some other method of coping with it in that way
overall is confident and persuasive
you can be as nervous as anything inside if what you're saying comes over UNK and UNK that's what matters
so good preparation
all UNK
the one thing that really marks them out is good preparation so that when they stand up in court they haven't got to think much about the content cos it's at their finger tips they know it they know mrs UNK age they know how many children she's got they haven't got to think about it
they just concentrate on presenting that information
right let's summarize where we've got to and what you're going to be doing
when you're preparing prepare well
the relevant law you will need to know and the relevant law you will find in the manual you've got you won't need to look anywhere other than the UNK it's all going to be in there
so you won't need to be searching through anywhere else
remember when you're given your fact UNK to take out of those UNK the information that you think is relevant and structure it
if you simply UNK word for word what's in the fact scenario that's not going to be persuasive
you need to structure it in a way that fits in with the argument that you're go the line of argument you're going to be putting before the magistrate
and develop a persuasive argument
practise out loud
practise it standing up
practise in front of a mirror
but if you practise it sitting down your UNK be very different the speed of your voice will be different and if you don't practise it out loud you won't be able to get any idea of whether it's going to take three minutes or not
the only way to really gauge how long a pr presentation will take when you say it out loud is to practise it out loud
because you will be kept strictly to time
you've got three minutes a few seconds over and then you'll be asked to stop
it can be shorter than three minutes
don't worry if it's shorter
most people when they practise out loud speak more slowly
they're in a relaxed situation in their own home
stand them up in front of somebody tutor and they'll speak more quickly
if you're three minutes at home then you're fine most likely that will mean you're up slightly under the three minutes when you do it before your tutor
but that's the way to get your guide that's the way to practise
and concentrate on those points that are in the advocacy criteria guide in making your UNK
you'll all be given the instructions for the small group sessions for bail today
if you've got any questions you can ask your tutor then or you can come and see me
are there any questions at this stage
any points that you immediately know you want to ask
no
right
thank you all very much
good afternoon and welcome to on the record
another seven people murdered in northern ireland a dreadful end to a dreadful week and yet on friday there had been at least a little optimism in the air john major and albert UNK getting together in brussels for what were UNK as substantive talks where does all that go now
i'll be talking to john UNK the leader of the s d l p according to mr major his talks with gerry addams are at the end of the road
i'll also be talking to john UNK about the privatization of british rail has he really given in to his UNK who want b r to be able to bid for the franchises or is it all a clever UNK trick
have UNK run into the UNK
i'll be talking to arch UNK and john UNK takes a sideways look at the chancellor's dilemma as he UNK his first budget
but first to northern ireland
it's difficult impossible perhaps for those of us who don't live their to fully understand the sheer horror of it
on a crude UNK basis if the same proportion of UNK were carried out on the mainland of britain in relation to the population we'd have had a thousand dead in the past eight days
UNK no government could allow it to continue and expect to survive
so what is happening to find a political solution
well john UNK meetings with gerry addams have been UNK by that meeting between the prime ministers of great britain and the irish republic UNK and UNK according to mr major i talked about that to john UNK a little earlier this morning but i began by asking for his reaction to the latest UNK
well just another appalling slaughter of very innocent people and it really is quite incredible that the people who carried out these terrible UNK said they were doing so as UNK for similar slaughter of people in the UNK road last week
the people murdered last week were every bit as innocent as were the people in the UNK road and i would be certain that the families of the people in the UNK road would be horrified that the murder of their loved ones would be used as an excuse as an excuse to do exactly the same to other innocent people
you'll have known that pub of course
oh aye i know that pub well it's just outside my constituency but it's in the district where it's in the north west and we all know one another very well there
i haven't heard the names yet of the people who have lost their lives but i'd be i would be certain that i would know some of them personally
where do we go from here
well of course i've been saying for some time now for some time and i want to underline that and i hope the government are listening that we've had twenty thousand troops on our streets we've twelve thousand armed policemen on our streets we have the UNK security laws in western europe and none of these things have solved our problem
the number of people who have died on our streets is equivalent to a hundred thousand people dying in the streets of britain if that were happening then the house of commons would be packed to the doors everyday until they got it sorted out
if the government keeps telling us in every statement they make that we're an integral part of the
i think i'm making my point i have been saying for some time now that given the fact that all that security hasn't produced the results the logic of that is dialogue and when i see the opportunity as i saw it of dialogue direct dialogue with mr addams that could lead to a total UNK of this violence i felt it was my duty to do so
that dialogue has lead me to the point of issuing a joint statement with mr addams
now remember i am the leader of a party that has been in the front line against his violence for twenty years and have been at many risks as have been members of my party but when i say that dialogue is the best hope they've seen for peace for twenty years
and in tha in our statement we say that we are talking about a process which involves both governments all parties and what we're talking about is agreement among the divided people to which all sections can give their loyalty
the least i would expect would be an immediate invitation from the prime minister come and see me because if it was happening on the streets of any city in britain and the mp stood up and said what i've said i think he would be in UNK street within the night
and you've not had that invitation
no
are you awaiting for it
well i would expect that the prime minister would i think this nonsense that is behind all this is that because i am talking to gerry adams they don't want to be seen to be talking to me because it looks this UNK argument
your hands are dirty
i'm talking about saving human life governments over the last twenty years troops over the last twenty years policemen over the last twenty years laws over the last twenty years and politicians including myself have all failed in all the efforts that we've made including UNK of violence everything but i am now saying that this dialogue is the best hope i've seen or surely i'm entitled to say to the prime minister alright given that i have said that why don't you put me to the test
but have you not already briefed mr major have you not already briefed UNK street about those talks and given that you have what else is there what else can you offer mr major that you haven't already offered
well er i think that both governments have said er in their and both prime ministers er and i'm glad they met er that the
that's mr UNK i assume
yes that they are beginning a process involving both governments and er naturally er i welcome that very much because i think the attention of both governments would have to be concentrated on this terrible problem and of course if they take the trouble to read the statement that mr addams and i issued that's precisely what we said that the two governments should begin a process involving all parties
so what else do you have to offer then
i think that both governments are aware of the proposals that emerged from th my dialogue with mr addams and the process that has emerged that i have said and he has said is substantial progress towards lasting peace
i want the governments to act on it and act quickly on it
but act on what do you see this is what we don't understand
sorry i know you don't understand and you're not going to understand on this program
why not
because er it's a that's just the way it has to be for the present at the end of the
but does the government
sorry
at the end of the day the whole community has to know what this is all about but let me stress there is no threat in this process that is being proposed to bring about a total UNK of violence there is no threat to any section of our community none what so ever
does the government does mr major
know precisely what went on in your talks with mr addams and does mr major approve of what you had agreed or discussed with mr adams
well i have no evidence of any description of mr UNK approval or UNK
but does he know
what he has said is that he it's a matter for myself to talk to whoever i wish and that he respects my judgement in these matters er according to the joint statement issued mr UNK briefed him on his discussions with me on that on that
right he does know
well i er it i am only reading what er their joint statement said
and he has said mr
but i am available
but mr major has said quite clearly that process that dialogue between you and gerry adams has run it's course
yes he has said that and i am saying i am saying as somebody who has been in the front line against this violence and with due respect to mr major knows a little more about it than he does
so mr UNK wrong
i am saying mr major as prime minister if someone in my position is saying i believe i believe there is the best opportunity here for lasting peace by which i mean a total UNK of violence the least i expect is that you should listen to what i have to say
so he mr major is wrong when he says he believes that dialogue that process that you began with gerry adams has run its course do you
well
believe that there is further that can go and that it should be UNK by mr major or mr UNK or by mr major
well when i say that it's the best opportunity for peace i've seen in twenty years
if er mr major is not going to look at why i say that then i hope that he i assume from that he has a better hope of peace an
but he's looked at it hasn't he
i'm sorry and i'm waiting to hear what it is
but he's looked at it because you have told albert UNK
well what why
albert UNK has told the prime minister mr major mr major has taken on board has considered presumably what it is that you've done with gerry adams and concluded that it can go no further
well i i'm not aware of how far he has taken anything on board what i would expect as a member of parliament and the house of commons and as the leader of a party in the house of commons i would expect that he would want to hear what i would have to say face to face and tell me face to face what's wrong with what i have said
given that he doesn't want to see you and your suspicion is that he doesn't want to see you because you have as it were the fingerprints of gerry adams on you now you're UNK because of your relationship with gerry adams what do you now do
do you have more meetings with gerry adams do you try and to push it forward UNK
i am an elected representative of the people of northern ireland three thousand three hundred of our people have been murdered that's the equivalent of a hundred thousand people in britain it is the responsibility of every elected representative to do everything in their power everything in their power to stop that the least responsibility that they have the least they can do is enter into dialogue directly with the people involved and i apologize to no one for that and if anybody is telling me that i'm UNK because i do that you know i don't know what sort of minds they've got because i think it's our responsibility to do everything in our power to bring this violence to an end and what's more what i'm doing has massive support of ordinary people on both sections of our community because i have never in my twenty years experienced the nature of the support and the way that it's being expressed to me by people in the streets by telephone and in particular by
you
families of those who have lost loved ones who don't want to see other families going through the suffering that they have gone through
you say that but aren't isn't it th the case that the UNK the UNK in northern ireland are terrified of any kind of deal that might involve gerry adams because that would be as far as they are concerned the ultimate sell out and hence there is the danger of growing UNK violence because of fear
well in the first place i have made clear throughout and i have a record their of over twenty years that people can have a look at but i made clear throughout as has mr adams that we are not engaged in secret deals secret deals don't solve problems
what we have said we are involved in a process which must involve both governments and all parties whose objective is agreement among our divided people an agreement which all our traditions must give their UNK and agreement and an agreement which must express which must respect our diversity now i have kept repeating that statement since we made it and i asked anyone to tell me what they disagree with it now the loyalist UNK some weeks ago said that if the i r a were to k their impression they've given all along is that they're just a reaction to the i r a and if the i r a were to stop they would cease immediately i immediately put out a statement welcoming that statement by them i also offered to talk directly to them but they have refused er given the nature of their campaign particularly at the moment i begin to wonder do they want the i r a to stop
have they some other reason for their resistance but are able to use the i r a as their excuse
whatever mr major's motives may be for having concluded that your that the process is at an end that your involvement effectively with gerry adams is at an end what about mr UNK motives
what possible reason might he have for agreeing with mr major that the UNK adams initiative is dead
well i have no evidence from either of them you know er that er they are UNK the door on my initiative other than the statement that was issued which if you read it there's very little in it that you can object to or that i could object to which UNK them the two governments to an initiative and indeed that's what er the last statement that mr adams and i issued asked them to do the only er they also in their statements say that my actions have been both UNK and UNK
but that th the
er but that the that the they're not paying attention to what's coming out of it
but you clearly don't believe that statement the UNK major statement goes far enough
well er n well oh f i'm not saying that er i i'm available
john UNK
that's what i'm saying
john UNK
tomorrow the transport secretary john UNK the bill to UNK british rail to the house of commons it had a rough journey through the house of lords and until late last week it looked set for a UNK passage through the commons too but then mr UNK introduced a series of amendments that everyone assumes will satisfy the UNK tory mp s but as michael gold reports there are still UNK for mr UNK to UNK
train now approaching platform two is the twelve fifty three service from glasgow central
it's been a UNK ride but the bill to UNK british rail is almost at the end of its long parliamentary journey but the battle isn't over yet earlier this week hundreds of UNK from a variety of UNK gave up a day and travelled from the north to carry their UNK message to transport secretary john UNK
it was railway workers who were in the UNK of the protest worried about job losses and safety but middle england was also on the march concerned that services might suffer polls indicate that four out of five voters oppose the sell off
it's ridiculous i don't think they really realize what they're doing
you cannot UNK british rail it cannot be done
it's only a few people at this moment in this country that does believe in railway privatization and that is the department of transport
leave the railways with british rail and put the money in that they would spend on privatization to improve the service for all of us and keep it as a national railway please
why is the government UNK on such an apparently unpopular privatization
some tories think it's a UNK to the right from a UNK the government insist that the sell off is the best way to attract investment from the private sector into the railways but there are signs that the break up of b r isn't proving as attractive to outside investors as the government hoped
UNK park lane hotel art UNK for UNK deal makers
would you like coffee sir
coffee sir
er white please
this week it was the venue for a gathering of bankers managers and UNK exploring the future of transport
few at this conference were a UNK at the prospect of bidding for the UNK to southend line
among the experts who were there was professor bill UNK
my name's UNK
good morning
the professor was advisor to the tory dominated transport committee and he's convinced the sell off will be a turn off
the private sector cannot invest in the circumstances set out in the bill because they need very long franchises with control of all the means of production the track the trains the stations the total business
that is not provided in the bill the private sector will not invest and our railways will go on getting more UNK
the business men and UNK here have made money moving people from a to b across the UNK but very few of the governments they've advised have ever tried to UNK their railways and none have tried in quite the manner mr UNK proposes
one man who is used to spending millions helping finance transport projects is frank UNK he's helped UNK in the u s but from his perspective the b r sell off doesn't look attractive
what you need to do is to be able to provide a private sector a certain level of certainty that the UNK will be er granted long enough so that one can recover both your costs an and certainly be able to make a profit and so er to the extent that the franchises that are being considered are short UNK seven years er that becomes rather UNK and UNK er concessions of twenty and thirty and forty years and really thirty to forty year period er do make it in fact make it very attractive for private sector involvement
that might seem to leave the government in the dark but they're confident they know where there going
british rail employees and managers will borrow cash so the government hopes in order to buy profitable services like the east coast UNK from their employers
getting their hands on their own trains might seem attractive but any manager tempted would be taking a big risk
the prospects for management buy outs are really very bleak the reason for that is that the franchises which we're hearing about are likely to be very short the UNK will own no assets no land no rolling stock nothing with which to go to the bank as security for loan
at the end of the franchise period he will have nothing to sell so i cannot see how people could go away and borrow the working capital with which to run a business
the profitability of UNK lines like the gatwick express UNK the government's belief there will be management buy outs
few managers would think of UNK on such a course if they faced competition from b r itself that's why the government originally UNK b r from bidding
however when the bill reached the upper house lord UNK amended it to let b r bid for two reasons
first because it er offers the government quite a good reason for dropping the bill altogether er a er and UNK to parliamentary opinion in doing so that's not a UNK thing to do er if it had been able to do that on the other hand it would have the benefit of in incorporating in its own proposals a measure of continuity and experience which are no there already
the lord's vote had UNK along the corridor at westminster a number of mp s UNK quietly concerned about privatization now went public they thought the lords vote would take the UNK out of the sell off because b r would win most of the bids ministers UNK to UNK the UNK but just before the bill left the lords the government seemed to UNK in
your lordships will be aware that the government has been giving careful consideration to the issue of whether b r should be a UNK in the light of the noble lord UNK amendment agreed at committee stage
clearly my right honourable friend the secretary of state will want to hear the views of another place but i can say that he will not be recommending that the amendment should be UNK
even as lord UNK seemed to UNK the government were UNK their own amendments to fix the odds against b r bids a UNK but the UNK bought it
i want to see the er possibility of british rail being able to say well you know we could improve our act we could do things differently and er we wou we have experience of running a railway and therefore you know please let us bid
that's why i thought it was wrong that er british rail should not be allowed to bid and i think that the government's compromise is a very sensible one
it was passengers who were supposed to benefit from lord UNK amendment the UNK think they've UNK the spirit of that vote but experts disagree
the amendment the government has put forward does not hold out much real hope for b r managers about remaining in the medium or long term in charge of viable business to that extent the amendment does not carry out what i believe was the intention of lord UNK in moving the amendment
so mr UNK hard work may yet come to grief even if he sorts that problem out there's another UNK to privatization running UNK many on the railways think the private sector will need a generous subsidy before they'd be interested if their not attracted the state will have to spend more to make the new structure work a lot more
on the UNK obtained a paper prepared by a committee including senior civil servants and the treasury and transport department called the restructuring working group the report forecasts an increase in the amount of UNK money UNK the railways this year it will be eight hundred and fifty million pounds after privatization the paper says the central government grant requirement would total some two billion pounds in nineteen ninety four ninety five
by UNK the track and UNK the trains the government can UNK some money but will that calm tories who see millions spent on privatization while other budgets are cut
mr UNK avoided one UNK with his back UNK but when they realize the bills cost and consider how b r 's been dealt with the question is will they think again
well will they mr UNK
have you or have you not please accepted the UNK amendment
well firstly the bill didn't have that rough a passage in the house of lords because there are only two basic amendments er that we're dealing with in the house of commons that matter and one of them is the one you've just mentioned the answer to it is this er i've had a lot of criticisms of giving b r the UNK right to bid er right from the outset their criticisms to do with the danger that you wouldn't get competition for the franchises the private sector would be afraid and incidentally this is not a sell off it's a way of getting the private sector into british rail with all the advantages that brings they would be afraid that they would face subsidized and unfair competition above all perhaps british rail ge management would feel if they were bidding against their employer that would be a real UNK to bid and we've a lot of evidence er that they feel that and that there are many who do wish to bid in management employee buy outs so what we've done in the amendment is we've preserved the right for british rail to bid but we've dealt with those criticisms and worries which have come from a lot of quarters not least from within british rail itself
so have you accepted the UNK amendment
i have accepted part of it and i've amended it to ensure that we can overcome the criticisms er that would have been involved if we'd left it er as it was er and above all and i think this is the most important thing we've made sure that it will work er and that it will meet our objectives of getting competition into the franchises if we'd just ended up with one great UNK british rail after all each franchise remember will be coming gradually they won't be doing them all at once there will be one next year several the year after and so on if british rail had been able to go around and pick them off and say well we can run this now in the future much better than we've done it in the past so we'll bid and we'll bid a low bid that really wouldn't have been getting fair and proper competition into the system so what i what i've done is UNK as i've done all the way through in this bill in accepting amendments that we make sure we achieve our objectives and that above all it's UNK the as it was it wouldn't as it was the UNK amendment wouldn't have been UNK because there would have been total chaos and confusion
alright but
within british rail itself
the reality is that you've said to british rail you can bid for those franchises that nobody else wants
the
which is the situation anyway because if people if nobody had bid british rail would have continued to
well
run them anyway
of course that is a point that we've made all the way through it's not if nobody would bid it's if the UNK director was not satisfied with the quality or the long term viability of the bids he'd received
yes
or didn't think they were
comes down to the same thing in the end
or they weren't or you see the other important point here is that british rail will be restructuring all the twenty five potential passenger franchises they're starting on this now
they've just finished one restructuring
they will then they will they've just started actually
but they've finished one
no well the key point is the key point is that they have to have a period during which they have a track record of running those separate businesses so that UNK will know the basis on which their bidding now if the UNK director it's entirely his decision decides that er he's not getting competitive enough bids or good enough bids then yes british rail would carry on and this was clear right from the outset would carry on running that particular
right so you actually
franchise so the difference the difference now is that they will be able er in some certain circumstances to come in and bid directly at the outset
but only if the franchise director decides that there is not a viable bid from the private sector or from b r management
only if he feels that a private sector or b r management would be er frightened off bidding and he knew that there were viable bids in play
yes precisely
and if he feels it would not
but
lead to proper competition that's correct
so let so nothing in reality has changed has it
oh i'm quite sure there will be situations in which er british rail will bid and will well it's up to the UNK director but is likely to get the franchise there will be situations
but then even if they do that and even if they get the franchise they're not going to be able to say we can now hold on to it for five or seven years however long the franchise is going to be because if another bidder comes along in the meantime and says we rather like this ourselves they'll be thrown off
no if they bid for the franchise then and get it obviously that franchise runs for the period and by the way a lot of the criticisms in the film i think were based on a misunderstanding that all the franchises are going to be short they're not those where there's a substantial investment going in can be quite a bit longer
well how long how long
oh ou we haven't it would depend on the market place on the reaction
but i mean are we talking about really
we could be talking of ten years and beyond er beyond ten years
what twenty years
i doubt it we no we wouldn't wish to go to i don't think to twenty years er but it would depend on the level
tha that's interesting
it will it will depend on the level of investment that the bidder is prepared to put in we're being very flexible responding to the market forces
so that it might be then
but
fifteen years let's say where we've
yes
been talking until now about seven years we might be talking about fifteen years
well some people have been talking about five to seven years i've been saying all the way through that we're very flexible on this and clearly if erm a bidder whether it's a management buy out with other people in the bid others in the consortium or an UNK bid from a private sector consortium er if they get the franchise and make clear that that's on the basis that they're going to put a lot of money into the capital investment then clearly they will want a longer period and we have made that clear
well i may have missed something you've said but i haven't heard you say fifteen years before
i've said quite often that ga it could be
i mean
flexible to a certainly to ten and in the right circumstances beyond that
so i can take it as gospel this morning that some of these franchises will be fifteen years how many might be fifteen years might they all be fifteen years
if they are prepared if they're prepared to put sufficient funding in er into the capital investment side
so if they all come along with lots and lots of money they'll all have fifteen years
well now you see i don't think they'll do that because another
i'm sure they won't from what we've been told
another mistake in the film was to suggest that in a short franchise say of seven years they would need a great deal of working capital but they won't need a great deal of working capital or share capital they will actually be running a business where they get subsidy because if er they're involving socially necessary lines like UNK lines or rural lines then we've made it very clear er that the UNK subsidy will continue because these are loss making businesses they will be bid they will bid for subsidy and they will continue to get that subsidy so they will have the flow of whatever income they can increase in the passenger franchise plus the subsidy plus and this is a very important point in what we're doing in the restructuring of british rail you see nobody up till now has said that british rail is perfect everyone UNK that there are big improvements to be made the way we're UNK it will get those improvements because the smaller franchises not the great big UNK nationalized industry the smaller units ha will be able to identify much more clearly where they can make the savings and where they can increase the revenue
but they won't be able to deal with their main sources of production as er professor UNK said there they're going to have absolutely you've got no control over the track on which they operate and they ar going to have to hire their UNK from and rolling stock from a separate UNK company so their room for manoeuvre is limited to say the least
that's in a very small er short franchise which is very similar to operators in other
what so they
UNK in other in other transport areas
so that if it's a fifteen year
but you see it i me
franchise they may actually get i'm
they
i'm very puzzled by this now so i ask for clarification if it's a long franchise then if it's a fifteen year franchise are you saying that the UNK will have control over the track
and over the rolling stock
they may let me just explain the track then in those situations they may well be investing in the depots maintenance and so on but let me just
and the track
let me just go beyond
so but just answer that bit first so i'm clear
not on the track as not on
right so
the track as such can i just explain the position on the
alright
track because it no other transport business er has er does has to have a business which op owns both the track it's operating on and the operating er facilities themselves so the we're not doing anything new here what we are actually doing and incidentally the german government and other governments are going down the same route now because it's not true to say that others aren't UNK what we're doing is saying that we are having a separate track authority and there are a variety of reasons for that er but the an and that means actually less investment by the UNK himself but he will have control over the th the track operations because he will have a contract with rail track to deliver certain services and if rail track doesn't deliver them then he's able to claim UNK so
but he
he will have the same relationship as so many other companies have er in relationship to other services they need to operate their business
let's just consider the political problem though you have still got a problem selling it to a lot of mp s if they're listening to this interview and they are UNK maybe rightly maybe wrongly that actually things aren't changing very much and they may think they've been sold a UNK with these amendments indeed i hear that some of them have had to be bought off well is it true that one of them was sent off to UNK on an on an election er supervision mission in order that he might not be around when the bill came up
he's actually going to be there to vote for the bill vote for the amendment
but was he was sent off to UNK as a UNK was he
well there are no because he's going to be there to vote but on
yes
can i deal with your main point er and UNK very important er to understand this er the vast majority of the parliamentary party supports strongly what we're doing because they believe it will improve passenger services it will deal with getting freight on more freight on to rail now they backed it throughout the party conference backed it almost unanimously
alright n
what we're dealing with is a small group of mp s who thought there were some advantages in the UNK amendment i've discussed it very thoroughly with them for some time and they agree that there were real difficulties about the UNK amendment which i've now addressed
okay let me talk about money then do
so there are an awful lot of people let me say there is th it is a complete UNK to suggest that the parliamentary party isn't behind the bill
okay money
we had a meeting earlier this week were i got huge support indeed some were urging me not to give way at all on the UNK amendment
money
two billion pounds it's going to cost you going to cost us the UNK
i that there have been endless position papers in the department and i haven't actually seen that one
well here it is
the i don't
you haven't seen it
it's a committee that you set up the restructuring working group that your department set up
but they do loads of that way down in preparing all these things and loads and loads of different views expressed at different times i deal with actually the recommendations er as we get to the point of decision but on the on the investment point
well is it true or is it not true that it is going to cost an extra tw total i'm sorry not an extra total of two billion pounds
no i don't recognize that figure although it er it what matters is that we continue
well that's not quite the same as saying it isn't true if i can just push you on that a little bit you
well
say you don't recognize it is it true
now that i know that
for ninety four ninety five
and i've told you where it's come from can you say that is too much
it is not necessary to have it on that scale er in nineteen ninety four ninety five
that's not the same as saying it isn't true is it
it isn't necessary well it is the same as saying it isn't true it isn't necessary er because this will be built up over a period and it will be for er the government in all the normal ways in the public expenditure round to decide how much goes into the passenger franchises and through that therefore into the UNK the rail track investment
either way it's going to be an awful
but
lot more than eight
but
hundred and fifty million pounds isn't it
but can i just make the point that we have been investing a great deal in british rail and the idea that er all over the piece we're talking about non UNK railways simply not true
eight hundred million on the east coast main line four hundred million for rolling stock announced this week four hundred million in new contracts there's a lot of money going in right now
the ex the extra cost of privatization is going to be one heck of a lot more than without any privatization in that year we're talking about immediately is it not
no it's certainly not in nineteen ninety four ninety five certainly not
not going to be more than eight hundred and fifty
because were on not going to be of the scale that you were suggesting
well
for the very simple reason that we will at most have one franchise in er nineteen ninety four ninety five
well
and so there will only be one franchise this will build up gradually
well let me quote to you what your own document says on
i
the best view we have at the moment transfer of service from b r to franchises is likely to increase the subsidy requirement for the service in question a large upward leap in nineteen ninety four ninety five now this is your own document and attending these on er on
i
on this restructuring group it's british rail it's the treasury it's the department of transport it's the franchise director
it is that is a paper from somebody i know not who but can i just explain if we're having one franchise passenger service next year which is pretty well all you can do because you do need to have that record track record the business operating as a separate business before UNK can bid if we're having one next year to suggest as i think the quote was that the that would cost about one point two billion pounds is ridiculous it's ridiculous a single a single
what your group's quote not mine well must tell them then will you go in tomorrow morning and say UNK this working paper
a single passenger service costing that amount of money absolutely not
well where did they suck it from then i mean i
don't ask me
know it's not something that i've put together
but it isn't actually the real point the real point is that we will continue well it
oh it's a very important point isn't it if it's going to cost a great deal more to push privatization through when you've got a fifty billion overspend anyway i'd have thought people who were worried about v a t on fuel would say that is a very significant point
but it isn't because i've just said to you several times that one point two billion for a single franchise is absolutely ridiculous
well give me a figure then
it will be it will depend on the bidding but it
alright
for and we will continue the subsidies to the passenger service
right
individual franchises will vary depending on how successful they are and what the bids are
final very
but it won't be that scale
final very quick question reports in the paper this morning that UNK the channel tunnel the high speed link and the tunnel itself are going to be delayed because the treasury basically saying we've run out of money you can't do it is that true
delayed until two thousand and five maybe
the point about two thousand and five is complete speculation
so is the main report true only got a few seconds i'm sorry
let me tell let me tell you exactly UNK line is going ahead er very large sums of money in the next three years
yes lets talk about talk about channel tunnel high
we
speed link
the cross rail and channel tunnel high speed link are at nothing like the state of UNK of UNK line that's going ahead now after a lot of work er th it will not be the case er it that you can do either of those very quickly cross UNK only just started going through the house of commons
so there is going to be a delay
so we can't tell what the final deadline date will be because there are so many pro processes to go through
john UNK thank you very much indeed
yesterday the labour coordinating committee met for its annual get together now this is the body that has set itself the task of UNK the labour party a difficult task at the best of times made more difficult now because there is a growing shortage of volunteers for the cause they can't even raise enough members to fill their own executive
earlier this morning i suggested to arch UNK that she and her UNK colleagues had run into the UNK
absolutely not i think there's a strong sense in the party that moving forward with our traditional values that what we have to do is to apply those traditional values to a very changed world things are very different now from when the labour party was formed or even from when the labour party was last in government so that we keep our sense of values they are what grounds us but what makes us an effective government in the future is the fact that we are moving forward with the times and the increasing representation of women is one of the things which is about moving us forward and moving with the times
talk about the increasing representation of women there were meant to be more women in the shadow cabinet with the elections for the shadow cabinet produced a disaster for women didn't it
they were UNK
a disaster for you
they were absolutely not a disaster for women obviously i would have preferred to stay on the shadow cabinet but we have three women in the shadow cabinet and we have a number of women in senior positions outside the shadow cabinet
you'd like to have more
well the trend though over all is absolutely clear that the labour party is committed to increasing women's representation and is absolutely on that path we've more labour women mp s and increasing numbers of women in the shadow cabinet it's only in the end of the nineteen eighties as recently as then that we had no women in the shadow cabinet now everybody agrees that it would look quite wrong not to have women in the shadow cabinet we've got a woman deputy leader three women in the shadow cabinet and therefore we're definitely moving forward
you say the labour party is agreed that there should be more women in the shadow cabinet but which is this labour party then the parliamentary labour party certainly isn't there was a UNK to keep women out
i don't think there was a UNK to keep
well anne UNK does
well i don't
lots of other people do
no i think that we would have liked to have seen more women i would have liked to have stayed on the shadow cabinet and i would have liked to have seen more women in the shadow cabinet but to say it's a disaster and somehow we've moved away from the path we've set UNK is simply not the case
alright let me substitute UNK for disaster then how about that
well i think it's a UNK nothing more but i think the trend is clearly established and it's very much agreed it's recognized in the labour party that the world outside has changed women are now half the workforce women are now half the college and university graduates women's work now represents forty percent of our g d p so we have to increase women's representation to recognize the world has changed
why isn't that message getting across to the p l p then
or to the er to the gentlemen in the p l p
well i think that message is getting across to the p l p and we've seen more women coming into the house of commons sitting on the labour benches at the last general election but there also is a sense that the progress although it's being made needs to be UNK up because when you have profound social changes outside the house of commons with a change in women's role in society a change in women's role in the labour force and a change in women's role in the family as well you can't allow your parliament to UNK behind
so bearing all that in mind then you sent exactly the wrong signal didn't you with the elections to the shadow cabinet
well i think that it is possible that as a result of the reporting of the shadow cabinet elections that the sense was out in the public that somehow this was a UNK for women and that labour
it was wasn't it
no because the point is that labour has not changed it's course which is recognizing that at the heart of it's policies we have to show that we know the world has changed and we've got a message to women which is that we know that you are essential in your role in the family but we know you're also essential in the economy
but
and as bread winners for your family and the way we do that is making sure that we have a parliamentary labour party of men and women and that we're a party of men and women at all levels and all
but it's what
and all labour mp s would agree with that
but it's what well would they
i mean it's one thing
yes i think they would
to have a course but if the crew on that particular ship UNK as they did during the last er shadow cabinet then you're in trouble aren't you
i mean look for forgetting the women but just look at who else did well in those elections and who did less well you had the UNK doing less well the tony UNK and the gordon UNK and you had the UNK or the perceived UNK if you prefer er the john UNK for instance and the frank UNK doing extremely well
well i think it's not helpful to look at it with such UNK divisions i think everybody's clear
but those are the UNK
no they're not the UNK because what we're saying is that we have to UNK the policies of the labour party but the policies are absolutely based in our traditional concerns i mean let me give you an example when UNK was talking about unemployment and the life long need for people to work he was talking about a male workforce where it was a man supported by a non working wife now we still have at the absolute heart of our concerns in the labour party peoples need to work but we're now talking about a situation where women are sharing with their husbands the role of bed UNK and in many families the woman is the sole UNK and therefore our policies about employment and the economy recognize that the world has changed our principles are the same but the world to which we're applying it is very different and again on that you see there would be no distinction between the so called UNK and the so called UNK
well then what explains the er the rise and rise of the so called UNK and the falling back of the so called UNK
well i just think it's not helpful to look at it in those terms you don't actually if you pick
well it may not be helpful but it is the reality isn't it
well no it isn't no
you can't close your eyes and say it isn't there if i don't look it'll go away
no it's not because it simply UNK labels to the people and doesn't understand what's going on
ah but
and
the real politics of it is that those labels are attached and you know that as well as i do
no what we have to look at is not the labels which are attached to each individuals but say do we have
mhm
a good team of people in the shadow cabinet do we have an excellent team i people in the parliamentary labour party do we know where we've come from and do no we know where we're going and we do
right now will let m l let me ask you where you are going then as far as the party's own constitution is concerned we saw a development a significant development that i no doubt you would say at the labour party conference er down in brighton but not UNK o m o b the trade unions still have one third of the votes in the selection of the leader of the party seventy percent say on policy matters at conference there is still a trade union block vote
that isn't a modern party is it
well it certainly is and we think that we've had an UNK of our co examination of the constitution we've made a number of changes but the task for labour now is to press on with the issues of looking at our policies and making sure that our economic policy and our social policy a actually meets the changes that are out their in the world
so that's it that's so that's it then for the UNK of the party's constitution we what happened at brighton was the end of the process was it
what we've got now is what we're going to have in another ten years time
well i think people think that a certain amount of time and attention has to be devoted to the party's constitution and there are two things that arose out of the conference in brighton
one member one vote for the selection of labour members of parliament but also increasing the representation of women now people want to move on from that they want a
in what direction
well they want us to move on to developing the policies which have addressed the changed world
ah so that's it for the party though is it
well
that the change to the constitution has ch that's it all done
well i think people are settled on the changes that have been made and want to move on and i don't think
right so the answer to my question of i may just th clarify this the answer to my question is yes that is it now we have finished with the UNK of the party itself lets forget about policies for one moment we'll come back to that but we have finished with the UNK of the party
i think that people don't want to see any more constitutional changes but there are many more changes in the culture in the way the party operates at local regional and national level which we will be addressing but what we're not going to have is more constitutional changes because people feel that we've made changes we have moved the party forward we're clear the direction we're going in and now the party at all levels wants to address itself not only to building our membership but also to showing how the policies we've got meet the changed world outside
so it's okay in a modern labour party for the trades unions to have what is effectively still a block vote
well certainly people are satisfied with where we've got to and want to draw a line underneath it and move on from there and i think the prospect of going back to the constitution er issues and they m once again being a key focus i don't think anyone in the party or outside the party sees the labour party wanting to UNK itself to that at this time
alright policies then the economy
erm gordon brown is giving in is he not to pressure from the UNK when it comes to UNK the rich or UNK the middle class he's now saying well maybe there will be a bit of UNK the rich or UNK the middle class whereas he wanted to say and you wanted him to say no we're not going to do that we moved away from that
no what we're saying is two things firstly that we are not in favour of taxation for UNK sake
well no party is
it's not a UNK action that the labour party somehow UNK in but there are things that we need to UNK raise revenue for such as investment in the economy like our social policies and that the way that we will raise revenue is that we will have a fair taxation system that is very straightforward and agreed by the party unlike the conservatives who firstly don't recognize there is any purpose in investment in the economy public investment or investment in social policies they don't agree with and secondly when they do have to raise money they do it in the UNK possible way UNK most those who can least
let
afford it
let me just suggest to you that you are sending all the wrong signals on women on party constitution on economic matters on policy matters the UNK have lost the UNK they're sending the wrong signals
the party is sending the wrong signals
i think it's absolutely not the case to say that we're sending the wrong signals i think there's a recognition in the country that the economy has been UNK and the price that's being UNK by people is too high levels of unemployment low levels of growth and social services undermined and people recognize that labour is setting out a new way forward
UNK
and now john UNK on the options facing the chancellor in his first budget one month from now
this year's battle of the budget is generating more UNK than any for years john major's cabinet now realize what a parliamentary mess december might turn into with week long debates on both the queen's speech and the budget to pack in and worse to come in the spring a budget combining taxes with public spending seemed a good idea at the time norman UNK announced it but with november the thirtieth just a month away the political down side is appearing of course with a fifty billion pound deficit in the government's accounts this years spending round would have been hard UNK anyhow but the usual noisy UNK over the available cash among departments is now UNK by UNK of tory UNK trying to head off this or that tax increase and there's an incentive to keep that up right through the finance bill after christmas since most new taxes would not come in until april
a phrase from the UNK manifesto last year we are the only party that understands the need for low taxation has now returned to UNK them for an mp in a marginal constituency this UNK the electoral ghost of george bush so he firmly rules out increases in income tax but wouldn't mind putting v a t on newspapers and books
but would it be within the spirit of the manifesto to UNK read my UNK no more direct taxes
really he says people don't notice v a t so much others believe income tax will have to take some of the strain but not by putting up the rates that would be too UNK
the best bet is that the chancellor will UNK higher allowances against tax to the lowest grade thus asking the better off to pay a bit more
on the spending side with the total fixed the game this year is UNK peter to pay paul or rather to pay malcolm
defence secretary UNK is reported to be grateful for support from the fourteen military minded conservatives whose confidential letter to the prime minister was somehow left lying on a copying machine for a labour researcher to find but he is UNK by the UNK an UNK that UNK up black marks for the future
peter UNK as a right UNK has to combine his reputation as a UNK cutter of the state sector with a departmental budget that eats up to forty percent of the hole one mp UNK rather UNK a weeks social security payments would buy a UNK even kenneth UNK and michael UNK their axes have to admit that UNK did not exactly invent unemployment personally but the UNK budget for invalidity benefit together with much UNK evidence suggest that somebody in whitehall well before his time decided to cut the unemployment figures artificially by allowing even encouraging people with little hope of jobs to remember that UNK pain in their backs and in the process get better benefits
but cutting this benefit will throw up hard cases what worries a tory elder is the way younger mp s approach the decision whether to support the government on a pick and mix principle he says they no longer see the need to take the rough with smooth to vote for the things they UNK as well as those they like
according to one loyalist thirties thirty or so of his colleagues think it's more fun to vote against the government a smaller number go further they think a spell in opposition might enhance their own careers
but a member of the cynical tendency UNK that after all this UNK a prime minister who's obsessed with political safety will only allow minor pain though back UNK will be encouraged to UNK so as to impress the markets
but what he demands about the panic when interest rates go up to fund the deficit and the city begins to think that labour will win
a former senior minister who has been through many spending rounds says we take them all much too seriously they are merely a mating ritual he says adding and a UNK one at that no offspring
well you can tell that to the treasury or to the UNK
john UNK
that's it for this week until next week at the same time good afternoon
i think we'll got another minute or so
i think i'll start
well welcome everybody and welcome to some pearson results that er ar maybe rather better than some of you were expecting
er taking part in our presentation this morning is frank the chief executive of pearson er james our finance director and david who is er our resident as pearson executive director resident in the u s and he is also chairman of our oil services division
profits are lower and earnings are lower than last year but cash generation which we've been working particularly hard on er for the past couple of years er and which we will be talking about further in a minute has come through extremely well er and we produced higher levels of cash this year than at any time in the company's history
with this in mind we are er recommending a small increase in the net dividend
a number of things have changed since er we reported rather UNK six months ago
one of the major changes is that the trading environment in which u k companies operate has been improved by lower interest rates and the lower value of the pound which is also helpful to the translation of our overseas profits and to our exports
particularly as we are a company whose sales as you know is split roughly a third a third a third er that is a third in the u k a third in north america and a third in the rest of the world
the media and entertainment business brought in excellent results collectively up twenty five percent and as you can see the book businesses performed particularly strongly even better now
erm investment banking and fine china in the market circumstances er performed well erm although they're down on the previous year
er the disappointment obviously is oil services so to begin i'm gonna ask david who as i said is chairman of our oil services division camco to address this straight away
just better ah that's fine
thank you michael for that introduction which er could be UNK to a UNK i suppose
erm you probably all know UNK law that what can go wrong will go wrong when i looked at the oil service industry in last year i rather think that UNK was a bit of an UNK myself
er obviously on a more serious note er it was very disappointing that we had such a severe er UNK in profitability last year after several years of UNK rising profits and so what i want to do this morning was tell you a little bit about what happened in the last part of the year since we met at the time of the interim results presentation last september tell you the actions that have been taken and give you a little bit of insight as to where we stand at the present time
you may remember that we were talking last autumn about gas prices hopefully continuing to rise natural gas by to rise during the rest of the year and in fact that did take place and it did have some impact on the domestic rig count in the united states which went up quite strongly in the last part of the year
although i should warn you that about two hundred of those nine hundred UNK were probably UNK active as a result of special tax breaks which were ended at the end of nineteen ninety two and won't be repeated
the biggest problem and disappointment was that the international rig count continued downwards and that was where we had been hoping for increased sales and increased market share looking into this year and into the last part of last year
as a result overall our sales were down roughly in line with our competitors in the oil service industry but there was continuing pressure on margins and profitability and there had obviously been some build up on the international side in UNK of higher sales
with an uncertain outlook for nineteen ninety three from our point of view it's absolutely crucial to get costs in line we had obviously done cost cutting during the previous two years but we really needed to be sure that if UNK were not going to increase we shouldn't wait for a recovery to bail us out
this led to restructuring costs including redundancies and closures and other one time charges totalling approximately twenty million dollars of which approximately eighteen million dollars came in the second half and a very large portion of that in the last quarter of the year
the areas where we put in most effort were reed tool the drill bit company where there were redundancies earlier in the year and in particular the u s operations of UNK and also the u s operations of camco products where in fact in the u s part of it there are now thirty eight percent less people employed than there were a year ago
in doing all of this we were in good or maybe bad company depending upon how you view it for example UNK had special charges last year of a hundred and eighty seven million dollars which compared with a hundred and eighty two million dollars of special charges the previous year and baker hughes similarly had charges of eighty million dollars and sixty million dollars
at the same time we reduced capital expenditure from forty two million dollars to twenty four million dollars but we did keep up our r and d efforts and had several rather successful new product introductions during the year
as a result with good control of working capital our cash flow overall was virtually the same as in the previous year in spite of the significant profit collapse and although there may be some further redundancies this year i don't expect them to be in any way on the same scale as during nineteen ninety two and the important thing is that we now have costs in line with the lower level of revenue as we look into nineteen ninety three
to take a quick look now at the current conditions and in fact you'll see the extension of gas prices rig counts etcetera into this year on the charts that you'll be given with a pack after this meeting
gas prices in the first quarter of this year have continued firm
the u s rig count is down both because of those UNK i told you about for tax reasons and also because there's always a seasonal UNK in the first quarter of this year
there is some indication that the seasonal UNK may be UNK out a little bit earlier this year than usual
the canadian market has been very strong which is important for reed tool which has a big market share up there for its drill bits
the international market however does still remain weak
there may have been some weather impact in the last two months but basically it looks like the major u s oil companies that were going overseas are still spending money on buying UNK and building up infrastructure
the national companies such as UNK and UNK are still re organizing themselves and obviously a lot of time effort and nervous energy is being spent by people on UNK out what to do in the c i s where there are obviously great opportunities but great risks as well
so the trading environment still remains er somewhat weak but the better news is that the medicine we've applied does seem to be working
the newly appointed c e o gary who took over at the end of the year when gill retired has been very involved in these restructuring efforts and has been working very effectively and is on top of the situation and although three swallows may not make a summer i can at least tell you that camco has traded UNK in each of the first three months of nineteen ninety three and now i'd like to hand you over to frank who will talk about the rest of our business
thank you david
good morning everyone
last year in the er annual report er michael and wrote we will continue to concentrate our efforts on cash generation and so obviously this is the er this has been the most important of our management actions
we've continued to focus on cash
we've concentrated on market share we've been exercising cost reductions and we've been continuing with investment
now how did we focus on cash
well we er have programmes designed to encourage chief executives to er concentrate on cash generation
we've er added extra staff in er credit control departments where it's been necessary and by a process of education at every pearson seminar we rang home the message of the importance of cash and james provides examples of different methods of operating and the effect it has on cash and what happened to market share
well we've er we've gained in many areas and held in all
cost reductions there are many actions we've taken and so lots of the cost reduction is the UNK of er of rather smaller ones but the main ones are redundancy sadly more redundancy and we'll give you the numbers in a second er we've asked our suppliers for greater discounts or better discounts and been successful here
we control the pay round the pay round increase in pearson was less than three percent a and we've continued with capital expenditure designed to reduce costs
good example would be penguin u s a er where we've er put up a new building er in which to house a press to be by UNK which will allow much shorter print runs of our trade books and this should reduce the number of and as you know that's one of the biggest problems facing the trade book industry
another example would be the UNK system and the financial times which will provide full page make up and is already UNK benefits and will continue to do so in ninety three and ninety four
but we've continued with investment to develop our business as well er and so we acquired UNK which UNK the er spot er books
we really in paris and we invested th five point seven million in the toy ride at alton towers er one point six million in the roller UNK we've authorized three point six five million to be used at er UNK castle to develop the king maker exhibition and we spent ten million on a new ride underground at UNK in UNK road the spirit of london
we've launched the series of six UNK potter videos the first two have been very successful the first one sold three hundred and fifty thousand copies and is er i think it's number three in the best UNK list and we'll give you one of these to take home and er and watch to your leisure
er we er launched the medical daily in spain with our spanish associates and we've introduced UNK videos that our er natural sciences division have addison wesley and elsewhere
we move to redundancies well there you will see that er newspapers that is to say westminster press and camco have borne the UNK er and i will say no more other than that the reduction in payroll year on year will be thirty million pounds
moving to fine china there was a very considerable overseas sales decline particularly in canada where there were lots of major retailers going bankrupt but despite that sales were over two hundred million for the fourth year in succession and we had a record december
this was achieved by altering the mix and concentrating more on the lower priced er china such as erm chain stores and hotel and airline UNK
in the u s we continued with our expansion by opening sixteen shops and our bridal wear in america was a market leader
newspapers
well there you'll see a summary
the f t newspaper which includes magazines electronic publishing and was up a bit
the f t associates which is er includes the UNK in spain was up a lot and westminster press was er was down but of course westminster press took a major redundancy charge they were also bringing on a new plant at brighton and therefore running two plants UNK which is very costly er and they launched on sunday
again they charged against revenue but er i can assure you that er westminster press will increase its cash generation during this year
the financial times itself the er trading profit was up ten percent despite having to cope with an advertisement volume which is now higher than during the er seventy four recession
cost cutting went on and as i say will continue in ninety three and ninety four
circulation just about held its own in u k but was up six point three percent in europe and is now one hundred and thirteen thousand five hundred and the electronic publishing was up eighty one percent
there's echo there's echo goes from strength to strength to the extent that one of its competitors the main competitor UNK was obliged to merge with UNK i mentioned earlier that ensure was re launched and er it achieved a circulation of a hundred and five thousand
in circulation of les UNK was up four percent year on year
the UNK circulation is now five hundred and twenty five thousand each week and although their er year is out of UNK with ours i expect the profits for the year to be at or near record levels once again
UNK our spanish investment paid off UNK profits more than doubled and marker is er the seven day a week sports paper is now the er second biggest paper in spain and has a higher UNK than the first paper
UNK the financial daily excuse me also increased its circulation once again and its profits
moving to books and of course the books division er was the star this year i am pleased to stay
starting off with penguin
with record sales record profit and record cash generation they managed to reduce their UNK by thirty percent during the year and had the most ever number of best sellers on the new york times best UNK list and that's continued into ninety three in january we had eight on the new york times best UNK list
at longman here again best ever sales profits and cash generation
in spain we took UNK from a loss to a profit and the award of the UNK prize by the spanish government and this is an award given to the best new text book in the spanish educational system each year
in japan our small but beautiful medical information business increased its profits by forty five percent and UNK er we had a swing from a loss to a profit margin of ten percent
addison wesley er had a yet again another year of progress
i am pleased to say we've taken the trading margin there from five percent to fourteen point two percent in the last four years
this was achieved with a higher erm educational higher education perform the industry in the year say and that was a major UNK and our natural sciences division had its best ever sales
entertainment and media er the UNK group had the highest ever attendances at alton towers at UNK castle er and at rock circus
UNK in holland performed above budget
alton towers in fact was a record turnover and profit and i think it justifies our marketing of goods i mentioned the two investments on new UNK earlier and that was designed to move the audience from the white socks brigade to family unions it seems to be working very well
UNK continues to UNK operational profits there are now well over a million a week and i think it's worth remembering that one UNK may have three subscriptions say to two movie channels and one sports channels and if you count these individually it means that we now have four point nine million subscriptions achieved during the second worst recession this century
the UNK rate is now down to eleven percent the result of positive action that we've taken there and we expect to add a million homes during this year and the cable audience i am pleased to say is growing still very slowly er but that should help as well
now lastly er just to er just to indicate that virtue has its own reward there's the record operating cash generation for you to see and on that note i'll pass you over to james
james
thank you frank
i don't know whether i'm virtue or the reward but never mind
er back to the profit and analysis er remind you so far there's three which er you're all very i'm sure already familiar with but we have to explain to some of our less sophisticated audiences
six sectors down ten percent that of course included investment banking which we haven't touched on but er the UNK houses profits were down a little less than ten percent which is rather good going given their erm heavy specialist skills in m and a which were a little bit in short supply last year
er looking at the rest of the p and l you will see that we have split out a profit on sale of fixed assets which is our UNK erm UNK and the UNK shares er which is why the corporate expenses for this other income has turned a way round it's gonna be negative nowadays so we thought it'd look a little silly saying other income less expenses
erm operating profit therefore down eleven percent that's er the ongoing businesses plus of course the impact of the erm er the sale of er UNK are holding in the first erm up to ten weeks of ninety one
therefore although the interest charge is well down profit before tax was down sixteen percent it's down sixteen percent er because of course the old UNK the UNK we had below the line in ninety one the eight million you see net profit on UNK are back above the line in under f r s three that's the UNK profit less the smith UNK losses very broadly speaking
continuing down the and p and l account the erm tax charge you've seen a note in the erm preliminary results present erm handout is not in fact up as a percentage if you look at the operating er if you look at it in operating terms there was a tax credit in UNK last year this therefore had reduced the nineteen ninety one tax charge comparatively strip it out and tax UNK share was around twenty nine percent
primary earnings under f r s three including everything down twenty one percent but taking out the non operating items that's the erm fixed assets er profit sales on the one hand and the old UNK on the other and you have i think a more meaningful guide to our performance a reduction in any nine percent
there were some significant erm factors that im UNK on profits i in nineteen ninety two and we've listed here the most important ones
to an extent tha they er offset each other as you can see since the erm underlying operating performance although less than the total in operating profit er was quite varied
the i i'll run through them rather quickly
on the negatives there was the er UNK of a s a p twenty four charge for u k pensions a little less than we expected we had a strong UNK in mid year the UNK redundancy costs that frank has already touched upon and er the er dis er the UNK profits not in ninety two
UNK that with the smith mark losses and the one time provision for the penguin u s UNK that was all taken care of in nineteen ninety one and the benefit from our fully benefit from our ninety one acquisitions and little bit in ninety two
if i turn from the p and l account to the operating cash flow er you've got the f r s one cash flow in your er in your pack in the preliminary announcement obviously but we er don't find it terribly helpful it's not the way we manage the business so i thought you erm would forgive us if we present it in the way we think it's a little easier to follow
now this slide really takes the behind takes us behind the first figure on the on the UNK f r s one cash flow table and it really UNK hard despite the reduction in profits the very strong performance in working capital that frank UNK to earlier means that er we actually end up with a net cash flow for operating activities more than thirty five million pounds higher
i'd just like to UNK to the er positive string on exchange we take our profits in during the year at an average rate but the cash benefit obviously er year on year is better than that er to the extent that the erm dollar has UNK throughout the year or by the year end against the pound and we get the full benefit of that in our cash flow
reduction in capital expenditure er broadly offset the reduced erm income from partnerships and associates which is basically our UNK income that's so the very good er contribution we got in ninety one reflected the nineteen ninety er profits they were earning
operating cash flow as we look on it well up
the reduction in interest broadly matched the increase in tax paid between the two years so the net movement of funds from operations are a critical parameter for whether we're really generating cash for new initiatives significantly better at forty five point six million and this UNK the proceeds of fixed asset UNK so all in all we had pretty nearly sixty million cash free and clear
not a lot was spent on acquisitions er and not really any material UNK other than the ones already referred to
the change in net debt er worth referring worth mentioning minus three point three million that much worse would have been significantly lower thirty five million or so lower if we'd had the same year end exchange rate as we did in nineteen ninety one
i turn from this rather UNK erm aspect of cash flow back to the balance sheet
balance sheets really haven't changed either er formally the way we publish them to you or the way we look at it them ourselves
er really no great change here small improvement in capital and small increase in capital employed and of course with little change in net debt and the UNK funds have gone up
if you look at the net debt in greater detail it is still the difference between erm substantial gross debt and substantial amounts of cash each of which have gone up somewhat during the year
the significant change i think is in the balance of debt between fixed and variable rate where we took a conscious decision and been working it through to take more advantage of the prospective and er decline it was prospective earlier in the year er in selling interest rates and the continued low er short term rates in the united states
the UNK of the erm the year of course has been rather a healthy lot of financial ratios
we've er we're showing the dividend cover in a variety of ways because it's i think not clear that any one measure is only er the way of calculating it
under f r s three which is the erm everything above the line earnings a covers down earnings down from two one to one six not much change on the adjusted earnings which we think is perhaps more meaningful and if you look at the cash generation the test of whether you can pay it a very significant improvement from one two to one point seven times
interest cover er has improved accordingly you saw the interest charge was UNK down and erm the ratio is low and has remained low
so on that healthy note i'd like to hand you back to michael to summarize
i'm optimistic about nineteen ninety three
i can't of course UNK er what's gonna happen in eastern europe but looking UNK er at the lower interest rates and the er more competitive value of the pound and internally at the improved cash flow and the actions that we've been taking over for the past couple of years and i can say that there's now generally a more optimistic feeling in the air amongst our group companies
as you've heard we've been cutting costs pretty significantly over the last couple of years erm what we're talking about is three thousand people having been er made redundant over the two and a half years and as we were saying earlier substantial redundancy costs have had to be borne
nineteen ninety three is gonna be the first year in which the full benefits of this cost cutting are gonna come through and whilst it's always a continuing process and there will be some further redundancies i am glad to say that we believe that the bulk of the redundancies are now behind us
we've re UNK our cost space which makes us more profitable at the existing levels of demand and potentially very profitable indeed er when you consider that we have the capacity to respond to any UNK in demand without increasing our costs
the underlying point i'd just like to give an example er of how the f t would benefit er if a recovery takes place
for every extra hundred fee of advertising revenue we add seventy five p to operate in profit
any UNK in demand also produces a substantial improvement in profit in several other of our businesses for instance westminster press les echo UNK and i'd like to remind people that we're a very second half UNK company and that in the first half of nineteen ninety two we had some major one off contributions to profits which very much helped the figures but nonetheless we're pleased at the way the trading profits of the operating companies are moving
it's early days er to make predictions but we're off to a positive start for the year
thank you very much and we'd like now to answer any questions that you may have
yes
we have UNK
do you want to say who we are
sorry
do you want to say who we are
no i think we know
okay
erm the financial times you showed er i think including the f t group and les echo er in the profit analysis but you did say that their operating profit was up ten percent th the f t group which i take it to mean they made fourteen point three leaving i think four point two to les echo you did also say that les echo had gone from strength to strength but f from my figures i think it's a third UNK decline in their profit
would you like to explain what from strength to strength means or whether i've got my figures wrong erm a and perhaps give an idea of what from strength to strength will mean in coming years
er i think in this context strength to strength is talking about market share erm frank er was saying how we've made considerable gains in relation to the opposition and er such an extent that in fact er it had to join up with the er with the other financial newspaper but frank would you would you like to add
yes
the circulation is erm is has grown every year we've had it and that's very important because erm a lot of the UNK a lot of the circulation of les echo is in fact a subscription in advance such it's cash generating qualities are high even when the profits are down
now the profits are down erm mainly because of the er the recession in france which started later than u k and secondly because we've er we've er re launched UNK and so we have the re UNK re launch cost there
er james would you like to
well i think UNK er i mean UNK always a good guide on these matters i mean the f
the f t
the f t itself as it were profits were up erm about up to about fourteen million and erm les echo was just over four
yes
i'm er
sorry
i'm curious about the oil services
the profit was down thirty million or so and if we look at the UNK breakdown of profit er the u s a was up er and yet if er addison wesley was about the same penguin was up ten so where did this thirty million drop in profits at oil services arise was it in the u k and UNK as opposed to the u s or was there something different about penguin u s compared with penguin u k
david would you like to
well i think if i could ask james to help on the UNK spread of the profits overall and then i could perhaps supplement that afterwards on the oil services
the erm yes UNK profits were down in the u s but penguin north america was substantially up erm and addison wesley of course was up in erm dollar terms
th this er the small increase in sterling of er addison wesley in fact under er i mean it didn't do them justice in dollar terms they were up fourteen percent
erm th that's the main er so overall you had a net gain in fact to erm u s profits er camco erm i think less than that erm UNK profits to were spread fairly broadly geographically er as you do know it does operate as you do rightly point out erm pretty much everywhere else and it's erm UNK both in south america and UNK decline and africa but not in europe
it was up in europe but down in the u k
yes
erm can i just clarify that the thirty million of erm savings was that actual redundancy costs which took place in ninety two or was that redundancy costs plus the UNK savings which will then benefit ninety three er or was it just the savings
frank would you
erm i think what i said was that as a result of these actions the payroll would be thirty million less in ninety three than ninety two
that's what i was meaning
so that doesn't include any redundancy costs
well the redundancy costs erm er taken in ninety two so
but does the thirty million include the redundancy costs or is that just the savings
the redundancy costs are part of the savings
no the
no listen the redundancy cost is taken in ninety two an and therefore the payroll is better is less by thirty million in ninety three so that's the benefit there
costs are in ninety two and therefore there was a cha there was a charge there was a net charge in ninety two and in ninety three the payroll will be thirty million less than it would have been
in ninety two there were redundancy costs to some extent offset by some er savings in payroll there'll by no redundancy cost relating to those previous redundancies in ninety three but there will be the full saving on the payroll
so anyway
yes we can
thirteen million
is that thirteen or thirty million
thirteen one figures one three
that's the gross cost actual cost of redundancies
obviously there's some depending when they depending on what time of the year you will get some of the savings
michael can i add something
yes
i'd just like to add that included in the numbers that i gave you for camco were not just redundancy costs but costs of closures of sales offices distribution networks and some other special one time charges so it's not pure redundancy when you look at the numbers that i gave you earlier on
sorry we had a question
over here go on
the erm on the cash flow numbers exchange and other erm can you split out what the er what the figures actually were how much they and
james
erm yes i mean they're i'm UNK for my briefing papers a complicated one this
er it's mainly er the change in foreign currency debt erm and erm the year end debt er erm the point is we had rather more dollars at the beginning of the year than at the end of the year erm and erm which UNK matters but if you look at our year end debt in dollar terms th erm there was a thirty nine million pound erm adverse movement year on year as a result of that
the rest of provision the rest of the of the movement are things like provisions which increased during the year much smaller number
that brings you up to the
yes
erm over the last three years
is that right
sorry the
profits
oh yes
they will not occur in ninety three
i thought you said camco from UNK sorry yeah
other way round
yes
big difference
big difference
involved in that UNK
well th the profits of the sale fixed assets that the shares and would be if there were any the sale profits on the sale of any other pieces of land at UNK or indeed elsewhere in the group and we sold a site not in ninety two it was ninety one at UNK i think you'll remember that so small profits
correct
therefore what is now called corporate this other income is the erm basically head office cost there's things like profits on from our UNK insurance er dividends which we didn't have it in fact last year we did the year before from blackpool land small profits from the sale of some shares at fair and other odds and ends which i erm really don't make up a great deal
yeah any other current assets sales
that's basically it current asset and investment sales
okay ken
twelve months ago you sorry twelve months ago you possibility that the falling out of the capital and accounts profits might be replaced by er taking some credit for the obvious major UNK of b sky b and i wonder whether you could UNK on the prospects of that
mm
well i would i would i would just comment that there er in profits have er have it doesn't mean to say that we won't have some profits from our estate at UNK because there are other areas of land involved but they won't be so substantial and for b sky b i would turn to frank
er well erm pearson is always er rather cautious of these things but i think have are very cautious and might take the view if things progress as they are er in the second half of this year that we will er take some credit
james
we've got erm yes we've got quite a lot of land stock interest we might have accrued er and haven't erm thirty million pounds in fact but erm it hasn't been accrued because in our view it's some years off for being paid but we think er or so i'm informed by the chairman of b sky b er that things are going quite well
and erm therefore this year er there is a case for saying we shall start to accrue some of the backlog er to the extent but only to the extent we will expected to be paid shortly UNK
we don't want to accrue er interest even if it's being expenses by b sky b if it's not going to actually be paid for many years but to the extent that it's er likely to turn into cash in the relatively near future then i think we would erm think it's now time to start addressing that issue and the result would be that we should probably erm accrue some reasonable and not very substantial amount of back interest er in the current financial year
we have two questions robert would you like to address
yes
first of all the interest er it ranks higher up the hierarchy
to this year's figures when reported next year
don't think so
no
no it would just bring it up to date the stuff we haven't accrued
of the accrued guarantee
yes if you'll give me a moment to find them
and while we're waiting
yes
frank
i i'm not sure what you mean by the costs
excluded the double running of er redundancy costs and the other items we just mentioned
erm i think that would that would add about erm say about f four and a half million to the profit and the second part of the question ken
well we told westminster press to introduce a budget on the basis that even if there was no revenue increase er we would achieve a respectable trading margin erm and so that will happen
now that the only thing to offset th that this year will be the continuing development losses of on sunday
current trading is erm current trading is improving and i would say that er that the last three weeks have been the strongest weeks this year
it's improving as the year goes on
er i think there's er one problem of course is that regional newspapers do depend on situations vacant quite a bit and the situations vacant market isn't improving dramatically
can i just answer the question i UNK
eleven million erm but they're some way down the track they're not at the top of the hierarchy
erm the cash as and when it does start coming through from er from b sky b and the fact that you've actually er promised some of that to read in UNK of the increased er erm equity stake indirect equity stake
how can you actually account for that because either you could er increase your profits by the accrued amounts and then somewhere else balance sheet and should pay for your acquisition
yes well we haven't promised that amount we've promised an amount equivalent to what we were gonna get carefully
i e we're not er we're not the erm the interest and dividend we will be making cash amounts cash payments to read equal to the amounts we actually get from b sky b as and when we get them but we will therefore accrue them as income and the payments we've made will be payments that will be part of the cost of the investment
okay and you said you'd start UNK the er erm the interest as and when the er time you were gonna receive the cash became er reasonably clear
thank you
so that the UNK only the UNK erm in respect of the UNK er percentage
you're quite right
yes
at the erm at the meeting recently they made it clear that er the deal has not yet been UNK
can you can you give us any idea when it'll close
this week
friday
sorry
david and i
yes
do you wanna do you wanna start
i'll let you start
you want me to start
i well let me start first of all like most companies this has been erm er concentrated UNK in er UNK the plans and this means that quite seriously that erm er the cost cannot be precisely in the accounts because there's a UNK
it's a bit of oh my god i didn't realize we let ourselves in for that much and i don't think that's quite fair of us although i think we had a but some operating companies were have certainly realized that they had erm material potential UNK down the track led to UNK
erm the i think er two comments for david is close to this and the one that we don't expect the p and l charge starting in ninety three and going onwards to be quotes material i e it's getting quite modest it's not sort of UNK
it is relating obviously not entirely but UNK to u s employers
secondly there would be a one time hit for UNK and that would buy a UNK adjustment er we're not gonna spread it forward
did everybody hear the question
yes
well i if i the on one of the comments i'd make is that it's the only time i've ever known the accounting profession to do businessmen a favour by forcing them to face up to what the costs of the consequences of their actions are and this has as james said led to looking quite carefully and i think it's difficult to quantify the cost at the moment for a variety of reasons
we have UNK the plans in some of the companies we've considered changes that should be done to erm make them more actually more cost effective for the employee there's an element of shifting the cost to the employee while still providing them with coverage and i think the other thing is that erm given the redundancies that have gone on in camco and other parts of the group and cost cutting generally it's very difficult at this stage to predict you have all sorts of things like actuarial assumptions erm cost inflation of medical costs
i mean i don't wanna make it sound like it's i it's an impossible thing but it's very difficult at this stage to forecast but UNK basic assertion that it isn't a very material number is correct
yes charles
er sorry
a question on the er oil service operations
i think at one point that the cash flow figure of fourteen point three million appeared
can you say how much was taken out of working capital at the er oil services operations last year and a supplementary point assuming that about seventy percent of oil service UNK were international last year er how significant would the north sea be within that international figure and t to what degree have the budget changes UNK there or will impact there because we're already starting to hear some er fairly nasty noises aren't we from
perhaps david might like to deal with north sea first and then james
with the financial question
yeah i think on the north sea it obviously would have erm an effect on parts of our business some parts more than others erm it's very early to say exactly what effect it obviously in fact to the extent that it encourages the further development of existing fields that clearly benefits parts of our business that are to do with completion equipment and development equipment
er the worst side obviously will be the drill bit side where UNK is not very significant in the north sea UNK on the other hand has a very strong market presence here er and UNK being UNK pumps and base based in enhanced recovery i would say the effect would be relatively neutral though they do a lot of business with companies like b p who are said to be one of the beneficiaries
i mean i think the i think it can effect this but not that UNK erm there are many as you know different UNK round the world and what happens in the c i s is obviously very important for the middle east and so erm it will have an impact
perhaps a erm perhaps a lesser impact than on the economy of great britain in the long run as to as to whether those resources are developed effectively
working capital reduction of by camco
yes
the six million erm u k pension cost isn't ongoing level and just going back to that er post retirement medical benefits it wouldn't be material i mean definition material can be er something less than five percent of profits
are we talking about a figure that could be approaching that sort of level or substantially lower
er one question less than five percent it will not be but i don't want to go and indeed i for reasons that er david outlined i can't go can't be precise but er it's not something to get scared about
er do you wanna add
i was only gonna say we're we will probably have a much clearer idea by the time we get to the results
the u k pension charge will er go up to the extent that UNK salaries go up there's a standard surplus being UNK gently rising pension i mean there's obviously there's an x percent of UNK salaries is what the will tell you will have to provide and er not much more at the moment er therefore the charge will go up a little bit but not gradually and it's not much
there's two questions though
erm i'm sorry to come back to the central overheads er again but erm it considering that the other income largely related to ninety one i'm a little unclear why the central costs went down i can't believe there's been any salary cuts at
no we're not that
er no we had some larger other income erm i'm turning up the detail as we speak
there were the sale of er the shares of erm UNK fair our current which is one of our current assets and investments
we sold one percent one percent david
yes
erm towards the end of the year and the erm and UNK erm UNK had rather a good year so that's our capital insurance company in UNK erm no claims
so that had rather er i mean that made er made it's not big potatoes but it made more than a year ago and there were small movements on provision adjustments
that's all so the income was up costs were costs were marginally down costs were down
reduction of the costs appears in ink
mr must have been very UNK with his colleagues or
on the oil services division are there likely to be any further technology transfers this year and er secondly could david give some idea of the impact of the proposed b t u tax in the united states
on the technology transfer er i don't think that there will be any income this year if there is it will be quite modest we're talking about three to four million dollars and it's related to follow up payments for training
in fact given the what's happened politically in what was UNK and is now the UNK lands and UNK erm and the financial pressures in UNK it's not certain to me that the whole arrangement will go forward
there's no problem from our point of view if that happens but we're looking you know quite closely at it and we'll wait and see what happens
so far as the b t u tax is concerned erm it's really a political issue as to where the administration or the congress in the end decide to place the tax i mean in very simple terms the nearer you place it to the consumer the more effective it is but the less politically UNK it is which because consumers vote and oil companies don't an and so er i think it will be political pressure to push it nearer to the well head which will be less good for the oil and gas producers
i suspect a classic washington compromise in the end
adverse variance fee this year
no i don't think so but i mean i think on the whole that the pop the admin the erm clinton UNK policy is to try and encourage the development of UNK the use of natural gas it's environmentally er more acceptable and so i don't see any particular erm direct threat this year
yes
what average rate did you pay on it and what average rate are you paying this year
erm average net debt was down
i haven't got er i have to give you the figure afterwards erm no i have got it i have got it
erm it was about a hundred and fifty million but i haven't got it for nineteen ninety one erm UNK sorry you had some more questions parts b c and d
average rate
er accrued rate accrued rate was about erm on the on the on the interest charge was eight nine but erm er there are a lot of adjustments in there which we've looked at
i mean let's take one er because of the UNK inflation in UNK you pay fifty percent on debt there
er we have some credit
well that's two million pounds interestingly erm there are costs er we had some of our u s interest rates and we er that actually was an outgoing erm there are lots of other pluses and UNK and we you can kid yourself the rate being eight point nine accrued and five and a half adjusted er if you want to think you know if you th think the treasury job was a good one but erm the truth lies somewhere in between i suspect
what do you think the average
the average interest rate
erm i i'll come back to you on that one
yes
can you tell us a little about the prospects of fine china in ninety three
well i think er what i'll do because stuart who's the c e o rather happens to be with us er i think i'll ask stuart if he would like to make a few remarks
stuart
it's really too early to say
the first three months of this year we've had an increase in sales but those have really been UNK to improved er t to stronger u s and canadian currency rates
erm volumes are about level with last year and the improvement in profits is related to currency changes
so i wouldn't to be drawn on that royal UNK was late into this cycle and it's a little later than the publishing companies coming out
yes
ninety two ninety three and ninety four
yes
who would like to do that
erm
there wasn't much from our point of view from addison UNK in ninety two
bills up in ninety three and ninety four
the revise is every year
th there's a revision each year but there's no major reduction er programmes this in the current year
in fact this is a year when we're spending for the next UNK
yes
prospects there
well er i think that and i get it james and i go to friday UNK meetings i think there is er a erm better feeling and we would look for progress in ninety three
is there
er in UNK brothers in particular
yes
erm
with
yes i think th that er it did give it did it did give opportunities but i mean it's not a it's not an enormously major erm part of our overall UNK business
er james would you like to add
yeah i mean i er clearly like m most banks th they found some useful opportunities in september but i mean i don't say they're not huge players they don't have enormous capital they're not strict UNK in any of the markets
yes
sorry would you like
has there been any major change in the distribution of debt and cash erm of nineteen ninety two er compared to nineteen ninety one
no other than the er the UNK pretty much the same er as i said of the important changes i is a much heavier emphasis on variable rates
yes
a are you still intending to favour internal spending vis a vis acquisition opportunities on the basis that acquisitions are just too UNK or with the eleven percent UNK do you think you will be er jumping at the bit a bit fairly soon
er i think i think that er our organic growth tends to be erm er continuous and er as you know each year we're spending erm substantial amounts er on that er we prefer organic growth to acquisitions because we avoid er premiums in the long run er frequently er organic growth is actually more profitable er but we are quite likely to make some acquisitions er if erm the right er strategic opportunities er are created
we o er as you know we always review er our businesses as subject to a continual view i have nothing er active to report on that front
yes
erm UNK in the current year
it's stayed around about the eight just over eight percent there hasn't there hasn't been much movement
just on the export front increased optimism er can you just UNK what export sales were last year and whether or not you managed to er hold er local county prices overseas in respect of those exports
and what
y
sort of kick UNK if any there was on in UNK terms last year royal UNK month erm sorry eighteen month type basis
yes
james
erm well you've stuart who erm had it at his UNK equally but er they have substantial i i'll let him talk about oh over fifty percent export are you not stuart
your turn er and they have erm they do hedge this is i mean our policy is broadly to hedge er o on a twelve month rolling forecast forward er to what extent and what timing is a function of judgment and it is true that the erm er UNK for ninety three are seventy percent UNK already at a little above the current spot rate
erm but er i think will provide still very good factory profit for them and there is also of course er this there's still more to come
th they're our largest UNK er there's inter company sales which would gen can generate quite useful profits since they get sold on both of er penguin companies er and longman of course has a high content of erm er of er non u k sales and addison wesley also er i mean camco was the most international but it's erm not er it's not an UNK in sterling UNK terms
er but i think also the lower value of the pound er affects UNK and the number of visitors here and michael c o UNK would you michael like to comment on tourist numbers
er obviously the erm better for overseas visitors pound will help tourism in this country particularly in london erm the chairman says UNK in fact gets about sixty percent visitors over from overseas rock circus at the moment is about fifty percent and it's still rising which partially explains why it had a very good year last year
UNK castle gets about forty percent of visitors from overseas with whom a large proportion are americans and er i suggest that the increase in americans this year will be quite good compared with figures for last year so we do benefit er i might even mention that in holland er over half the visitors exhibition in amsterdam are not dutch many of them are germans but there are also americans and of course other overseas visitors there
so erm foreign earnings is important for us
our parks alton towers and UNK get a very UNK amount of overseas visitors which is normal for such places in this country and many other places in the world
but erm we're reasonably optimistic about visitor numbers
the concern in london particularly of course is the incidents of terrorist in of terrorist incidents and that undoubtedly affected er UNK in london not just at our places but in most tourist attractions particularly towards the end of last year
on the other hand it has to be said that the er publicity for that does not seem to have UNK very far amongst foreign visitors and there isn't very much evidence that foreign visitors have been put off coming here in spite of the considerable number of incidents that there have been in this country particularly in london of course in the last year or so
it's affected mainly the u k visitors
so we try not to mention them
we try not to mention david
did you
did you consider er an UNK second interim dividend
i'm glad you asked that erm yes we did we did give it consideration er we decided against it because it would have meant er to UNK the dividend on friday for technical reasons and UNK our results erm today and this could have been in danger of misleading er the market er because this lower results and we have an increased dividend and that was erm probably the main reason why we decided that we wouldn't do it er the slight increase in net dividend in fact should compensate erm and this is coincidence er f fo for the increased a c t on the
yes
could you give us some UNK give us some indication as to how erm UNK the excellent performance in penguin is likely to be through nineteen ninety three looking forward you obviously have a particularly high level of best sellers
well it was a particularly er high level of best sellers to erm er stephen king's erm and what i'm glad to say is that this is continuing into ninety three and i think we've got eight er eight best sellers on the on the new york times best UNK list so er you know prospects for ninety three also look good
yeah i believe recently have indicated they will start b sky b will you and if so when
james
well they said maybe they will maybe they won't according to the press releases that turn up
erm i think we're er we're quite clear at the moment that the correct erm interpretation of it from our point of view is as a fixed asset investment and unless something changes in the er constitution of the company erm although it may be erm the UNK thing become profitable i think one's got to play by the rules and the rules at the moment say it isn't one
which doesn't mean to say we won't have substantial erm p and l er contribution fro from b sky b
any more questions er
well thank you very much indeed for coming and er then if anybody wants to ask any further questions privately they're welcome
now i'm ha i'm handing round a summary of last week's lecture which i hope will make more sense of it and i have here if anybody wants to borrow it a UNK of chapter three in UNK book where he explains the blind UNK and the manual for the disk
now for copyright reasons if you want to do the blind UNK and i'd very much like you to you've gotta borrow the disk from me okay
so if you want it my advice is take the UNK or read the book
when you've read it come and ask me for the disk and i'll lend it to you
erm i've also got a rather smaller number of copies of ev UNK notes if you wanna do UNK which i also demonstrated briefly
so if you wanna do UNK i've got the notes for that
ya explained in the handout that's coming round okay
thanks very much
so everybody got a handout did they
right
i've also got more copies of the reading list which i've forgotten to bring with me but which i have got er upstairs and they're pinned to my door if anybody needs another reading list okay
but i forgot to bring those with me
erm let me remind you that at twelve o'clock today er i've booked s o one eight
who's coming to s o one eight
erm for fun you have a story and you're allowed to play
alright then
er i'll tell you a story and i'll let you play a game
s o one eight
okay that's at twelve o'clock
now what i want to do
let me just explain if you can't make it or if you don't want to do it i will er re do it all again in the lecture next friday at eleven
next friday at eleven i will go over it all again in the lecture
so er however i think you'll get much more out of it if you come today and do it first
if you do it first you're gonna really understand what i'm going on about
but er in other words don't worry if you don't understand everything today when you do it because we'll go over it next erm next week in the lecture and we'll be going over it in classes as well
some of you have done a UNK dilemma
now if you've done a UNK dilemma you don't have to come
you've already done it okay
now what i want to do in this lecture is to finish off the er introductory part of my of my remarks and take us up to the point where beginning at twelve o'clock the real part the real er core of this course begins when we start to look at social theory
now you'll recall that last week i was talking about darwin's basic concept and i tried to explain it to you and to illustrate it to you
one of the big problems about erm teaching people what darwin really said is that people's concept of evolution by natural selection is er contaminated by ideas which were actually UNK not by darwin but by the founder of british UNK spencer whose dates were nineteen twenty to nineteen o three
as you'll see a contemporary of darwin who actually lived a little bit longer than he did
it was spencer and not charles darwin who UNK the UNK and that's all it is survival of the fittest
it was not darwin
darwin erm was UNK upon to use it and did so occasionally but rather UNK and rightly so
i say rightly so because UNK theory of evolution was fundamentally different from darwin's even though it's often confused with it
UNK spencer believed that there was a UNK er life force if you like and that evolution to higher more complex and more integrated UNK was a fundamental aspect of physics biology and UNK
so he applied it erm more or less UNK not just to biological evolution and as darwin had
he applied it to er the evolution of the UNK as a whole and indeed to society and believed that there was an UNK inevitable UNK and upward tendency of evolution from simple to complex from isolated to UNK from erm stupid to more intelligent and so on
and standing on the UNK of course of this process of evolution erm er who were living in the most advanced societies and so on
there's a bust of spencer in the library actually near the opposite the erm enquiry desk
erm you can go down and have a look at him there
erm well spencer was a great bloke from many points of view but er unfortunately his ideas of er evolution were er mixed up as it were
erm one of the worst consequences of this was this awful phrase survival of the fittest
now erm what's wrong with this if you think about it is that er it's hard to know what fitness and fittest means and although i'm now gonna spend about ten minutes talking about it this will be the last time you'll hear me mention the word fitness and i strongly advise you to do the same for reasons which i will now n now explain
the trouble with the UNK survival of the fittest is that it gives the impression that evolution is all about creating a kind of super race you know like you saw in UNK propaganda films you know UNK erm UNK beasts as it were who were the th the sort of UNK of creation
the idea that evolution made organisms fitter in the sense of sporting sense of fitness or personal health
if you think about it even in terms of sport the whole concept of fitness is very ambiguous
for example erm you UNK but would that make you fit for UNK racing
of course it wouldn't
there's nobody in this room who couldn't win a UNK race against a UNK now without any practice even in UNK feet you could do it
and yet i don't think there's anybody in this room who could last a minute in a ring with a UNK because obviously being fit for UNK is quite different from being fit for UNK running you need a completely different UNK
so even in terms of sporting meaning of fitness it means completely different things in different UNK and it certainly means er different things in terms of evolution
for example er males are fitter than females er human males in the sense of sporting achievement and this is why all sporting events that we rely on UNK have to be UNK
you can't you know have UNK sports for males and females because males would always win
now from trivers and actually it would be better on the on the proper thing wouldn't it
let's try and get it on the board which somebody has written on and i told them about that and asked them to clean it but bring a spray can of white paint next time
erm excess male mortality in humans as a function of age
straight out of trivers
as you can see males die more than females throughout their throughout their UNK
that's more of that
erm here's a more detailed one
this is excess mortality of er rates for males and females age one to four for different years of the twentieth century
you can see that modern health care has made no difference so you can't say it was anything to do with health care
in fact if anything little boys die more than little girls even more now than they used to in the past so it can't be anything to do with health care in case
yeah these are all straight out of trivers
erm ratio of injuries to deaths er for all accidents as a function of age and sex and again you can see males have males do a lot worse than females and i think there's one more no sorry that's the lot
erm the facts are and this is all in trivers if you want to look up erm if you want to look it up in more detail that males die more readily than females from all causes that affect both sexes and some that even don't and you'd be astonished about like for instance you gather from john book on the myth of he heterosexual you're not allowed to buy in this country you have to import it from the u s
it's a kind of UNK er on the part of the part of the erm british publishing industry
but that book gave the astonishing statistic that in nineteen ninety or nineteen eighty eight in the u s more men died from breast cancer in the u s than women died from UNK contracted aids
i mean i didn't know that many men died of breast cancer but apparently they do
not as many as women die of course but men even die of breast cancer
so the point i'm making to you is this
that if evolution was all about survival of the fittest and if men are physically fitter in the sense of sporting UNK which they UNK are how has evolution produced the situation in which men have less life expectancy than women do from every point of view this far
well the answer to that of course is that what reduces erm male life expectancy is the very same thing that UNK their reproductive success namely the direct and the indirect effects of UNK
the male sex hormone UNK er makes males bigger er they've bigger bones more muscle and so on this gives them their sporting UNK and this is why of course er you've had all these better as a result
it produces that effect but it also makes er males more aggressive more likely to take risks which explains the accident figures more likely to become involved in violence
it increases their resting UNK rate by about five percent engine is running about one twentieth faster all the time so perhaps this is why it UNK out quicker
they've got less fat to UNK them from cold
they're generally bigger so when they fall they fall heavier
all this kind of thing
it all adds up to making males survive less well than females
however the other consequence of it is it UNK their reproductive success and you can erm you can see that it is indeed an effect of UNK if you UNK live longer than UNK males and the earlier they're UNK the longer they live
so they can expect to live more or less as long as any as any woman does
so erm if you think about it you could say well okay if the evolution is all about survival of the fittest and if fitness means surviving longer
why doesn't evolution select all males without UNK
hmm the UNK obvious
a male without UNK would live longer than a than a male with them undoubtedly on average five to seven years longer and erm generally be more healthy in terms of avoiding a lot of problems that they might have had through being male
but of course such a male could never UNK and natural selection is ultimately a question of reproductive success not of fitness and in fact from now on you will find me avoiding the term fitness and instead talking about reproductive success and you'll find that all the best literature like UNK book does the same thing
so from now on let's forget the concept of fitness which was UNK and not darwin's
let's just remember that it's wrong
let's not use this awful UNK the survival of the fit fittest for all its social UNK terms
because it's completely wrong and misleading and let's instead talk about the ultimate bottom line in evolution which is reproductive success
natural selection UNK for reproductive success
of course organisms have to survive and may need to be to have erm fitness in the sporting sense in order to have reproductive success
this is certainly true
but such survival or strength or erm or sporting UNK will only be selected if i if it UNK ultimate reproductive success
that's its final aim as it were
it's a secondary matter by comparison with reproductive success
and that all is all natural selection is
ultimate natural selection and this is darwin's idea not UNK
darwin's idea was organisms which have UNK praise for superior reproductive success will by definition leave more offspring behind it
and that's basically all it boils down to
so the reason why males die more readily than females and this is true for nature by the way not just human levels it's a practical universal effect that the males die more readily than females that males are ultimately selected for reproductive success for erm survival as such
everybody clear on that matter
okay
one of darwin's big problems and to some extent darwin didn't know about UNK
he had ideas of his own but they were all wrong
he had a theory but it's wrong
er the truth about UNK was discovered more or less the same time darwin put forward his theory in the early eighteen sixties by who was er erm carried out erm experiments in UNK in the UNK garden and apparently sent a copy of his paper to darwin
the letter was found among darwin's effects UNK
er if only darwin had opened it darwin would have saved himself an all load of old trouble
so the moral of this folks is always open your UNK mail even if it's from UNK
the only mail i get from UNK is a UNK mail actually it's all about some wine club that i never want to belong to but erm if darwin had only opened it er don't throw it away it could be it could be th it could be the paper from that will save you infinite trouble
well erm darwin didn't know about UNK and the result of this was he had big problems
one of his big problems was his theory as we've seen demanded genetic variation and in order to provide the raw material for natural selection to work on it demanded UNK
so darwin had a concept of mutation which was a random genetic change
erm was or so his critics said that er his theory just would not work and the kind of argument that they produced against him and poor old darwin really didn't have an answer to this and i it seemed a very severe problem at the time was look supposing that er i'm a UNK you might think
i'm a UNK okay
l s e UNK lecturer gives lecture on UNK
erm it's kind of er you know erm it's a headline in the sunday sport or something
you see i've never been in the sunday sport
my colleague has and everybody rather UNK him for that
it's quite an achievement being in the sunday sport
anyway wh UNK i say
yes supposing i'm UNK and i have i have a mutation which UNK my reproductive success one hundred percent
this is a very good mutation to have okay
however darwin's critics said because of sexual reproduction i will only pass half that mutation on to my offspring because even then everybody knew that half of an UNK inheritance in genetic in erm sexual reproduction comes from the other parent
so therefore they argued my children will only get half the mutation or half the effects of it fifty percent increase in reproductive success
their children will have half again twenty five percent increase in reproductive success
and in only seven or eight generations it's dropped to less than one percent
how said his critics can darwin explain how a mutation even if it's terribly UNK to an organism could ever get fixed as it were in UNK terms
it looked as if UNK inheritance which at that time was believed in was going to rule out the possibility that erm that such things er could occur
well of course darwin really had no answer to that and today we today we do because nowadays we know how evolution works and erm what we now know that darwin did not know is that the genetic code is based this is just an illustration from a standard book you can find this in more or less any book
er this is actually from i think a scientific american one
we now know that erm that the UNK is based upon a an organic UNK called d n a short for acid a UNK is just the one molecule with repeating making long in principle
the it consists of two UNK which are made of sugar UNK and which UNK round each other and the UNK are linked together like the UNK of a ladder by bases and there are four bases and always pairs up with and er and always pairs up with so that the pattern of bases on one of these sugar UNK always has a corresponding pattern on the other
what happens in er in UNK and how the genetic code is passed on is that er this double strand of er this double strand is UNK as it were and it is just like a kind of UNK in that the teeth are the corresponding bases
it UNK producing two separate UNK which can then be copied and this is basically how genetic information is passed on
within a cell what happens is this right a cell what happens is that erm d n a is copied on to something called erm r n a which is a kind of UNK messenger r n a it's a kind of copy and it's a single strand corresponding to one of the UNK on the original d n a with the same base structure
and it passes through elements in a cell called and as it passes through a the genetic information on the on the r n a d n a is read off and UNK are produced so the is a kind of read head which reads out the genetic information
the information it reads is a code which has now been broken and this is the code
this is the genetic code here
erm bases are read three at a time
in fact er u here stands for in d n a UNK er in r n a UNK in d n a
it's a little detail
what happens is as the r n a strand goes through the genetic code is read out three bases at a time and this is a is a table which UNK all the three base UNK you can have and shows you which amino acids they code for
an amino acid is a chemical sub unit of a protein and ultimately everything that happens in a cell it produces some kind of protein so you can see that erm the UNK or produces erm which is one of the one of the er amino acids and so on and there are also punctuation marks u a or u a g means stop as does u g a so when a r n a UNK running through a gets to a sequence which reads where was it now u a it stops reading because it knows it's got to the end of the gene
that is the way er UNK works
as i said this is just a very simple fine UNK description for you and you can look at the details anywhere
erm we don't really need to concern ourselves with it in detail thank god because UNK is a terribly complicated business and awfully technical and i don't understand a tenth of it and we don't really need to
an excellent new book that's come out and you can easily buy because it's only six nine and is book erm kind of bedtime reading
it explains how the genetic code was broken erm how they discovered about genes and so on very up to date UNK completely correct and a good read
so if you want to read up the background to all this is th one of the best books and one of the most recent on the reading list it's on the reading list on the second page or something
do you wanna ask a question or are you just stretching
no stretching
stretching okey UNK
erm ah right okay
so wh what i'm saying is erm our modern view the consequence of this is our modern view of evolution and i can't think of a better way to illustrate it than this is that organisms ultimately are can really been seen rather like this
this is one of the simplest organisms that we know about
this is something called a t four bacteria
bacteria is just greek for and er this is a UNK which UNK the human gut UNK
y you have UNK millions of these things in your gut and you need them to help you digest your food
if your bugs get sick a possibility is they're gonna get sick because they're being attacked by one of these things and it's a UNK terribly small of course
it looks a bit like er the UNK module that landed on the moon
it has a head which is a kind of protein capsule inside which the d n a is UNK up
there's er a collar and a what they call a which is a protein tube and then it has various UNK at the end that make it stick on to the outside of the bacteria
and what happens is they float around and when they come in contact with a UNK they stick into the wall and the d n a tube is inserted through the UNK wall into the UNK of the bacteria and the d n a is just pumped into it as if from a UNK
inside the UNK the d n a of the erm c of the t four bacteria then starts UNK the UNK material like the you saw before in the cell and instead of making the things that the cell wants to make it starts to make bits of the of the t four bacteria
the head is made erm the tail all the bits are made and eventually they all stick together like a kind of UNK and the result is a new bacteria is made and this goes on until eventually the cell there are so many inside the cell that erm the cell just UNK when there're about two hundred or so the cell is now UNK with t four bacteria it UNK and releases a whole UNK of new ones to start the cycle all over again
now you may think that er you and i are very different from a t four bacteria but personally and i on can only speak for myself i can't speak for you of course but personally i'm prepared to accept that basically i'm really nothing more than a very complicated and much bigger t four UNK
as far as evolution is concerned i and this is really the essence of our modern view i am really nothing more than the packaging of my genes because after all this is what evolution acts on
evolution ultimately UNK for the erm reproductive success of individual organisms and you can see very clearly in the case of the t four UNK that it is really nothing more than the temporary protein packaging of its d n a
now admittedly the t four UNK is a very simple organism it can't leap about so it doesn't need senses or a brain to direct it or muscles or anything like that it can't repair itself or change itself once it's been made therefore it doesn't need to digest food er to have an immune system or anything like that to repair itself or put itself to rights it doesn't need anything like that
erm it's a very UNK organism
because it UNK inside another cell in this UNK way erm it doesn't have to find a mate or even bother to split in half to UNK by UNK means
it's a very simple organism but basically what it's there for is to ensure the future of t four genes and this is what i it's doing and presumably natural selection has er selected it in such a way that it is an UNK design as far as far as doing this er is concerned because it would be in competition with UNK t fours who did it in different ways and presumably this is the kind of t four that seems to succeed
and i'm certainly prepared to admit that from the point of view of erm evolution i too am er little more than a UNK package er for my genes because after all if natural selection really were about fitness and UNK the organisms in terms of making the organism more perfect more fit more UNK why don't we live forever or almost forever
after all evolution has been going on now for about four billion years as far as we know and there aren't very many long lived organisms
there are some like erm oak trees live five or six hundred years if they're lucky UNK can live for a thousand years giant UNK for two hundred well these are quite impressive figures but let's face it it's not very long erm compared with the time that evolution has been at it
why hasn't evolution produced organisms that practically last for selecting for is reproductive success
reproductive success we now know and darwin didn't of course means passing on your genes
that is what a t four bacteria is for and that's what i am for and i would suggest y ultimately what you are for as well and this is why in the end erm nature will cast us aside
we're just the kind of UNK packaging
the mistake that the social UNK like UNK spencer made and that popular opinion still makes about evolution is the kind of mistake that UNK might make if they landed in a UNK supermarket car park
i mean a real UNK you know the ones you see in the u s where everything you know even the UNK are seven times bigger erm n not like they are you know the UNK land in the car park of the UNK valley UNK in washington state and observe people coming out of it with enormous piles of shopping
er what do they think
they think people are buying UNK and bottles and tins and packets
they might be astonished to find soon after that those very same UNK and bottles and tins have perhaps been thrown out in people's in people's
well of course you and i know that the reason you go to UNK to buy things is not to get the packaging not usually what you're interested in is what's inside the packets
we consume what's inside the packets we buy in our UNK we consume the contents of the bottle what's in the UNK we throw it away
it's no further use to us
it seems to me that's an analogy with natural selection
if you UNK the organism has a temporary packaging as a kind of protein coat around its genes which t four bacteria clearly is then once the genes have been passed on the packaging is no further use and can be UNK
so it seems to me that the existence of death the fact that organisms don't live forever and they certainly are not UNK in terms of personal fitness or UNK because they get diseases and they die suggests to me that our modern insight into evolution acting on individual genes is correct
namely that organisms evolved to be the UNK packaging of those genes
i know this is a bit of an UNK to our high opinion of ourselves as human beings er of course many people regard it that way but erm my view is that er we can't expect science necessarily to tell us things we want to hear
human fantasy and for our benefit
had darwin known about this you see darwin could have turned on his critics and said look in the first place you're quite wrong about UNK there is no or at least there doesn't have to be because UNK occur as errors or changes in the base UNK in the genetic code
this is our modern concept of a mutation
to go back to my earlier diagram what happens erm in a in a mutation let me find the right one is that the change occurs in these in these bases
one of these base pairs erm another combination is UNK either by er some kind of error in or by the influence of something like erm UNK background radiation or some kind of chemical effect or something like that
a mutation means a single based change in the genetic code which may or may not have er ultimate consequences for the organism
since erm sexually UNK organisms are and i've tried to keep technical jargon in this course to a minimum but one term we'll have to learn is UNK you can't do without it
UNK means that you get two complete sets of all your genes in sexual reproduction one from each parent
it's just greek for two UNK that's all it is
it's a greek word meaning two UNK as in a two UNK a UNK with two er wires in it
erm we are two UNK in a sense that we get one set of our genes from one parent and another complete set from the other parent
now if one parent has a UNK has a mutation supposing i let's go back to me being a UNK which i was rather enjoying erm i'm the UNK with a gene which increases my reproductive success by one hundred percent
darwin's critics were wrong when they said that all my offspring would inherit half of it
on the contrary half my offspring will inherit all of it
i will hand on that gene complete to half my offspring because all my offspring will get half my genes
therefore the chances are and this is statistical it's a statistical chance in general i can expect any mutation in me to be passed on to half my offspring complete
it won't be dilute therefore part of my offspring will find their reproductive success enhanced by one hundred percent offspring will find their reproductive success enhanced by one hundred percent
other words if we think of a mutation as a change in a single gene then UNK are not UNK
they're handed on complete to every generation and they have their effects in every generation
and as you can see if i did have a m a UNK gene that promoted reproductive success by a hundred percent what natural selection means enhanced reproductive success
always say this because you know developments happen all the time but as far as we know genes are handed on as complete UNK in units is what discovered
breeding experiments erm showed this
i mean he didn't know about genes and he was rather lucky that he chose to study the aspects of things he did
but we now know that what discovered was individual genes and as far as we know individual genes are always handed on complete and UNK
about this myself because i think it's complex
sometimes i think both genes are used sometimes only one not the other and i'm not sure that anybody knows exactly how and why that works out but erm
i was hoping not to mention this but since raised it we'll have to
erm some genes are different in that some genes are called dominant and some genes are called UNK
now this is not all genes just some genes
genes
if you if you get a UNK gene from one of your parents that have a corresponding dominant gene in the other then only the dominant gene is expressed in your body
however if you get two copies of a UNK gene from both parents then the UNK gene will be expressed
now this is important because another criticism th that darwin's critics made was hey look sometimes people inherit things that're very bad for them
a very good example would be UNK in queen victoria
queen victoria had a gene of UNK
she passed it on to about half her offspring
by astonishing good luck they all married
the british royal family is now clear of UNK they don't have it at all
so they go on UNK into their tiny little self UNK group as much as they like they're not gonna b suffer from UNK
er yeah i will say what i was going to say
erm th the russian royal family have er got it
now people said how could darwin explain how something like UNK could keep going
or of course what darwin didn't know bu but discovered was UNK keeps going because it's UNK
it UNK as it were behind dominant genes which are normally okay
it only shows itself if by UNK you get two UNK genes two UNK at that point in your in your erm you're in very serious trouble
but that doesn't happen very often and natural selection of course will then select out individuals with two UNK genes but since those don't show up very often it's a rather weak effect
it's a sex link as you say
erm
mentioning the white UNK reminds me of another thing i wanted to say because erm another UNK of this incorrect criticism that people made of darwin about UNK and you still hear this today and people should know better especially the social sciences is oh single genes cannot influence behaviour
even if you had a single gene which is terribly important erm because human beings are complex everything they do is affected by large numbers of genes a number of examples that UNK that
by far the best one is one suggested by the white UNK as being male
there is indeed a single gene male which has recently been and it acts as a switch
and what happens is that if an UNK has the single gene for being male it happens to have a white UNK not surprisingly it turns on thousands of other genes that then make the UNK into a male but that single gene has to be there to act as a switch and that's that gene is also present in UNK and UNK so the point i'm making is it is just wrong to say that all these UNK about UNK cut no ice with human evolution because human things cannot be influenced by single genes
i'm afraid that is not true
the situation is this
if you have if both your copies of that gene are UNK then it if only one is UNK and the other is dominant it doesn't both dominant only just beginning to find out but you're quite right it is contrary
there is recent evidence for instance that there is want erm different things from what females
the package does seem to be put together in one way that seems to be fundamentally fair
and that is when i can't remember what it's called and erm when the sex cells are made exactly half of an individual's genes go into each and when sex cells er come together in a UNK exactly half of each parent's genes are fitted together so that's completely fair well almost completely fair because there are a few genes outside the nucleus that only get they're in a rather minority
so it looks as if er nature has kind of erm struck a bargain in this respect that each parent can contribute exactly half but i think it's we're only just beginning to find out about what happens then and my guess is about internal conflict between genes because i strongly suspect that there must be a lot of that going on because as i think you've rightly seen if we take this view of evolution as selecting for individual genes then we would expect conflict even within the UNK
i think w i think how it works it it's i don't think you can say it's the right package
i think th that's a kind of er value judgment all i can say is
well wh i think all you can say is you end up with a with a package of genes which you got from your parents
you may be okay you may not be okay you've got two UNK per human figure you're not er all one can say is genes are kind of UNK together and natural selection doesn't really care
what natural selection does seem to care about as far as sex is concerned is that there is constant re combination and this is a question of sexual that we'll touch on later
it looks as if sex evolved because it's in the interest of genes to constantly be re combined self interest not always in company with the same others may want to be er mixing themselves up so they launch themselves in continually different UNK and this presumably each gene what is happening is a constant UNK process all the time by means of which natural selection is working on basically random changes in the final point i want to make and that's
yes genes yes
or are they
yes for every for every individual gene you get from your mother you get a corresponding individual gene from your father
at the same place on the UNK
at the same place on the UNK
but genes themselves are spread all over the UNK so you might well find that er genes there's more of them
than others yes but UNK is a complex issue
i dare say knows more about this than i do
ask her
i just wanna finish with one point
there's one final point i want to make because this acts as a kind of UNK to what we're gonna do now down in s o one eight and to the main start of the course and that's this
i now want to prove to you that this kind of evolution i've been talking about evolution by natural selection at the level of individual genes cannot produce social cooperation
the argument goes like this
supposing we start off with erm we had to explain the origins of cooperation
supposing we start off with a species of selfish individuals
now we define cooperation as altruism here and we'll go over this again
i'm just quickly introducing altruism as any behaviour that UNK the reproductive success of the beneficiary at a cost to the reproductive success of the UNK
now imagine what happens if a gene for altruism
what will happen in a population of selfish organisms
by definition the gene must promote the reproductive success of the selfish organisms at a cost to itself but a gene for altruism could UNK in a population of selfish individuals a population of UNK in whom a gene for UNK appears by random mutation
by definition the UNK majority must promote the reproductive success of the selfish the reproductive success of the selfish organism the UNK will be far greater than the UNK and within a few generations of selfish individuals
it would to find altruism in the way we could find but social cooperation or self sacrifice or altruism could UNK by natural selection
does everybody see that
q e d we seem to have proved that what happens all around us cannot namely altruism and cooperation
what we will now do is go down to s o one eight and we will discover the answer to this or we will begin to discover the answer to this
first by erm having a story and then by playing a game and in playing that game before us the answer to this deep problem will emerge
we will see how cooperation UNK
s o one eight for those of you who don't know is in the basement of saint UNK building
are any of you experienced map users
right okay
if anybody wants blind UNK i have it here UNK
yes
yes in terms of this definition it has to be because that's the only that's the bottom line of evolution and it's the only quantitative measure we can ever have it's the only when you're ready there's no hurry
yeah good idea
i dunno whether you wanted a mark for this
i gave you one
erm just one little slip you put eighteen fif nineteen fifty nine it was eighteen fifty nine wasn't it the origin of species
that was just a slip
an excellent very clearly and very correctly expressed
excellent essay
well done
a minus okay
okay great
i thought that was really good well done
fine thanks a lot
so that's the other one
yeah cos i haven't i mean there's a lot of reading to catch up on so i UNK
let's just have a look at the erm let's do the who've we got bill
malcolm we haven't got malcolm have we isn't it
what's your surname again tracy that's right
i've got you down as here for the last three
right so who's performing today
i am
right you are expert
well we're not supposed to start till five past so let's give them a couple more minutes just in case they're caught in the lift or something
reed sorry i haven't got reed either have i
no
right
i think this is better cos i think the friday one is UNK
so i think we've done the right thing
erm what's your surname again
that's right
okay
so i've mentioned everyone i haven't UNK anybody have i
oh no as i was saying to reed the other day er reed has joined our class by the way
let me introduce you because you weren't here when we did the introductions were you
let me introduce you to the class
this is tracy this is alex this is bill this is theresa this is UNK and this is UNK and there are one or two others who aren't here yet who may turn up
now reed is er joining us just for this term isn't it
and er we've allocated all the class papers so erm that means you escape unless you really do want to do er a class presentation
you could perhaps team up with somebody else if you wanted to so if you see someone and we're just going through the order in which they appear
so you missed er least week's that was number one that's number two
hi come on in take a seat
that was susan wasn't it
and malcolm wasn't it
no not malcolm UNK
UNK wasn't it
trust your UNK
you can have one of the other chairs
did anybody leave that UNK behind last night because i found it on my chair
oh it was friday was it
oh it was the evolution
yeah could be could be
okay it's just about five past so we can probably start with a clear conscience
if anybody else comes they're late
so we're doing dreams
theresa
all i mean you've said just about everything i think
i mean that was a very full and complete account
you obviously did a lot of work for that
what did you read
the introductory lectures was it
yeah and then i read
it is a big book you're absolutely right
er well done that was absolutely excellent
i mean you erm you really did cover just about everything
erm what about examples though
that was one thing that was missing
i mean i'm n this is no criticism because you couldn't er you'd have taken up the whole hour if you'd included examples
but did any examples occur to you
i mean have you had dreams of your own that you thought this related to in any way
now why was that
yeah you have a UNK dream okay
well look we won't UNK you by asking you to tell us what it is but what we will do
unless you want to
well erm er is it is it a very short one
yes
alright tell us the dream
because you've missed something
and that's the dream
that's the dream
now do you wake up from this dream in a state of anxiety
does it wake you or do you just
no it doesn't wake me
it doesn't wake you
so it's not an anxiety dream
you don't wake up thinking oh my god i've failed the exam no
well okay
this is an example of a dream
now what would freud call the dream as theresa has told us it
the manifest
right that's called the manifest content
now does everybody understand that
because this is quite an important distinction to make
that's the manifest dream
that's the dream as theresa UNK it and as she UNK it to us
okay
now erm if er theresa was interested in analyzing this dream er how should she have gone about it
what's the next step
having got the manifest content what does freud's theory of dreams tell us we need to do next
in what sense
yes and what would we do with those elements what
right and how would we do that
well er wh what we want to do what we want to do is to relate this manifest content that you've told us to what what's the other thing
to the latent content right
now the what UNK the two things together because we assume there is a latent content in this dream
what's how do we establish the connection between the manifest content of the dream and the latent
right that's the key word i was looking for
associations
UNK was that what you were gonna say
erm
because you looked as if you were winding up to say something
right that's right yes
that's another way of saying it
what the links between the manifest and the latent content are what in the technical jargon of psychoanalysis we would call free associations
in other words they're ideas that occur to you
so if you were if you were having an analysis shall we say theresa you reported your dream to the UNK
what the UNK would say to you in trying to help you to resolve this dream would be well report what you think of in connection with the manifest content
in other words friends at the school and the idea as you said at the very beginning of your paper is to report without any kind of erm UNK or judgment
you would just say things that pop in to you mind and er it's essential of course if you're gonna do dream analysis properly that you must obey that rule
if you UNK from it and it's terribly easy to UNK from it by rejecting certain thoughts oh that's silly that's not relevant that's too obvious that's UNK erm that's too freudian you know if you say that kind of thing to yourself you get nowhere
because you see what is now n why won't you get anywhere
what's the what's w why isn't this kind of process easy
why can't
because it
you do and you have to assume it's right whatever comes up
you have to assume it's correct
it's very difficult you never lose the feeling of resistance to it
i mean i've been analyzing every dream i can remember now for the last twenty one years and er i think i've got rather good at dream interpretation i must admit
erm but even today er with every dream the same feeling comes and you just have to UNK ignore it and say well you know that's what i thought
in other words what you've gotta try and distinguish is what you're thinking
in free association what you think about your thoughts and what you think about your thoughts
as theresa says we usually try and UNK them try and say no you know leave that out erm it's as if you had a kind of er UNK sitting in your mind telling me er telling you telling you er but it works with me too erm what you can and cannot say
you know as if erm as if there were some UNK present who wanted to make judgments
now in analyzing dreams that is the single and in a way the only problem
but you can overcome that problem and UNK enough free associations
you can usually then begin to see some kind of crazy logic in them
if you let them lead you where they want to go they lead back to this latent content and then you begin to recognize er the latent thoughts
now as you said in your paper the latent thoughts are often very different from the from the er manifest thoughts th they're way away from them
i mean it wouldn't surprise me in the least if you analyzed this dream you discovered it had nothing to do with being at school and nothing to do with taking exams
do you know what i mean
the you know would it's quite possible that the that the manifest content i has completely UNK your attention and the latent content is really something else
for example and i'm not saying this is this is so but it's not unusual in that kind of dream if it's recurring in the present to find that really it's about the present and not about the past
so it seems to be about school anxiety and exam UNK and so but those are very common kinds of dreams but very often when you find they're actually about the present they're about some UNK anxiety or conflict in the present which is UNK as if it were in the past because your associations of what's going on are connected with the past er one way or another
i mean for example i mean i'm not saying this is an association but you might find in your dream if you look to say i'm back at school then your association would be but i am at school now the london school of economics do you see what i mean
th that kind of thing can easily happen so school now i e l s e is represented as the school you went to when you were a kid
i mean th that's a typical kind of association that it's a link you can see the link is in the word but the effect is to is to UNK your attention
UNK you think you're thinking about one school whereas in reality you're thinking about quite a different one
now i'm not saying that is the basis because only you could supply the free associations
while we're on this question one of the few things that er theresa didn't say although perhaps she might have said it when i wasn't i don't think she did but one of the few things she didn't say is why freud UNK of the typical kind of dream book you find in any book shop
er the meaning of your dreams revealed you know you see this kind of yeah now why did he UNK of that kind of analysis
what was wrong with that approach
that's right
that's the that's the key point that and were making that only you or only the UNK can interpret their own dreams
so it's no good er me looking up in some book UNK dreams if i could UNK it like some kind of code in which every single thing in the UNK in the manifest content represented something latent for what we're trying to then kind of UNK as in a code book because er that's not valid at least it's not valid in general terms
it's a good analogy in terms of UNK private thoughts
she's got a private code book but the point is that only she knows how the symbols how the manifest and latent relate to each other because only she can make those associated links
it's you can't in general lay down UNK links and say every time somebody dreams about erm an examination it represents anxiety about their future career or something
i mean it might represent that but it might not
it could easily stand for something else
if for instance the dream associated an exam with er with some peripheral aspect of taking UNK which erm had nothing to do with any kind of test
it's quite possible
right now why is that bill
you're quite right
there is a ch lecture on dream symbols so why despite this excellent point that j m UNK made does he still mention symbols
yes that's it
that's right as theresa said at the beginning one of the prime characteristics of dreams is this kind of visual erm UNK and in the course of analyzing thousands of dreams of course which he did in his practice freud found that very often certain fundamental things that people tend to dream about quite a lot tend to appear in lots of people's dreams with similar kinds of er representations and among the most UNK and obvious of these were things related to sex
now freud wasn't saying that every time you dream about an umbrella you're UNK some kind of sexual wish erm but what he's saying is that UNK and other things that can erm become UNK or open out often do represent but you could UNK have an umbrella dream in which the umbrella through your private associations stood for something completely different it's quite it's quite possible
so we're not saying that every time somebody dreams about an umbrella it means erm that wh what he was saying is er that kind of visual UNK often does stand for in this case erm the male UNK but it need not
it's just a kind of UNK erm language and of course people develop symbols
i mean for instance in my dreams er cars have taken on a very distinct personal UNK that has really nothing to do with what you might think because of personal experiences of mine and i now know that whenever i dream about cars it always has this but that's because of something that happened to me and because of my personal erm kind of experiences so cars have become a dream symbol
but erm the so although he the point i'm making is although it was who says he mentioned UNK or became aware of it it's er it doesn't conflict with the point th that we were making earlier that the only person who can interpret their dreams is the UNK ultimately
there's no quick and easy way
susan did you want to
right let's let let's pursue that for a minute
i mean people sometimes you know give the impression oh erm freud thought all dreams were about sex
is that true
no
why not
right absolutely
well in the first place you don't of course because the manifest content may be totally innocent
it's only when you pursue the associations with the manifest content and ask yourself what does that make me think of that you start to think of things that you then realize leads to a latent content which may be sexual in nature but why er even if as theresa rightly says we d we have to say it's crude and UNK for that all dreams are about sex
there's no doubt if you analyze a lot of dreams that an awful lot of them are as a matter of fact
now why is it
yes
right and there might be another reason as well
i mean th that's kind of you're seeing it from above as it were why they should be forced out of the manifest if there's some other reason
and here you might think of other kinds of dreams that are so called typical dreams like for instance erm er has anybody had this dream where you want to go to the bathroom but can't find it
has anybody had that kind of dream
right now this is a typical dream it freud lists it there is a chapter in the interpretation of dreams called typical dreams
how do you think he interpreted this dream
because it's a very common one
right that's er that's er right the these are both the same kinds of dreams
er to answer your question really we need to remind ourselves what's what according to freud is the function of dreams
what are dreams for
what's their ultimate purpose
theresa did mention it
yeah right to maintain the state of sleep
that's th that was one of freud's fundamental findings
now the kind of dream that and we are very UNK and you want to go to the bathroom or something is a dream whi which is the result of a kind of compromise
on the one hand says freud there's a strong desire to go on sleeping but on the other hand there's this stimulus i'm terribly UNK or you know i really do need to go to the bathroom pretty badly and there's an inner conflict in your mind
one thing you need to go to the bathroom or to get a drink says wake up and go and do it the other thing th the desire to go on sleeping says you know well don't wake now i want to go on sleeping
so the dream becomes a UNK expression of this conflict and what very often happens is the there's a kind of compromise in which you go off and look for the bathroom or the drink of water or whatever it is you want but the dream keeps UNK you finding it in order to UNK the dream and the state of sleep so you go on sleeping for a bit longer
another example of a similar thing er that you mentioned towards the end of your paper was where an external stimulus UNK with dreams
for example er i had last year in the in the class a student said that they missed an exam
the reason was they set their alarm they were terribly UNK about setting their alarm clock so they'd wake up in the morning to go to the exam and er it was a very loud alarm clock so not the kind of thing you could sleep through but come the morning of the exam the alarm went off and the student started to dream that they were out hearing church bells or something you know they're walking around hearing all these church bells thinking isn't it nice you know it's sunday morning oh i could go on sleeping
so the very thing that was supposed to wake them up the noise of the alarm bell was turned in the dream into a UNK of now i can go on sleeping okay there's a bell but it's sunday morning you know the bells are ringing the church bells are ringing i can go on sleeping so they went on sleeping and they were late for the exam
so i mean there's an example of where there was a conflict and obviously it wasn't just the desire to sleep
my guess is there was also a desire to avoid going to the exam
so there was a rather more perhaps a deeper
than usual but that's how that's how freud would interpret that kind of dream
do you think that's convincing
do you think that explains your water or bathroom search dreams
but you don't wet the bed
oh no
well yes i mean that's what happens
with children i mean you sometimes find that children have that kind of dream they do find a bathroom and then they do wake up in a wet bed
er i don't think it's so common wi with adults who are supposed to have better control over these things but it certainly sometimes happens with children
and in and in that case of course th that UNK the other prime finding of freud about dreams
dreams exist to safeguard sleep but what's the ultimate what was freud's ultimate finding about dream the kind of essence of his dream theory
expressed in the in every dream is what says freud
right expression of a wish says UNK
erm do you think that's convincing UNK
right
that's an anxiety dream
did you have that dream more than once or just once
but it's still
no
er most people have that kind of anxiety dream
some people have them quite a lot
now it's easy to see if we're talking about the kind of dreams that reed was telling us about erm that there's a simple wish with these dreams and in the end you wake up and you go and UNK the wish in that case
okay
but erm what about anxiety dreams like UNK
surely this UNK the freudian theory cos how could er a UNK dream like that still makes her feel anxious
how could that possibly be the fulfilment of a wish
surely this UNK freud's central finding doesn't it
what d'ya think
do you ever have anxiety dreams
yeah so d do you think this is UNK
how do you think freud would account for them if he wanted to defend his theory
how could he explain such a dream as UNK do you think
anybody
well in a in a sense that's er that's the answer
the you reminded us of er another aspect of dreams that one notices if you actually do a bit of dream interpretation yourself is what called what freud called day's UNK
now a day's residue is some association which relates the manifest content usually to what happened to you that day and often i they're very UNK it's often that the day's residue is built into the manifest dream so it's quite obvious you had this dream because of something that happened to you on that day
very often day's UNK are among the first associations th that will occur to you
however if you pursue the associations and begin to UNK into the latent content what you often find is that those day's UNK which are specific to that day as theresa was saying relate to more general erm situations or indeed to things that actually happened in the past which that particular aspect of that particular day might remind you of
so you trace the in other words the day's residue becomes just part of the associations which leads back often to things which didn't necessarily happen today or which may even have happened in the past
and er so the so freud's theory doesn't necessarily require that any source of anxiety should be UNK to today's events what it what it does say is that very often today's events shape the manifest and sometimes the latent content of the dream quite a lot
however his explanation for UNK and UNK point about anxiety dreams would be that the anxiety dream is one in which dreams fail in their function
if we say you see that the function of the dream is to safeguard sleep and to fulfil wishes then it's clear that in the real world not all wishes are UNK and it may well be that the latent thoughts in some cases is so UNK and so disturbing that they cannot be sufficiently UNK and will lead to a state of UNK and that UNK proves of course that the dream has failed in its function of UNK sleep
in other words an anxiety dream is a kind of UNK dream a dream that attempted to disguise a er disturbing latent content but could not succeed in the end
so the anxiety breaks through and you wake up
i think theresa was first
mhm
yes in that sense in that sense the unconscious thought was expressed but the but the point was i the anxiety as it were got the better of the dream didn't it if you woke up
because ideally if a dream was really gonna work it would disguise the anxiety under some UNK manifest content that would stop you feeling anxious and therefore UNK wouldn't it
yes this kind of thing happens to people who've been in traumatic situations like erm er prisoner of war camps severe accidents and stuff like that and freud himself of course saw quite a lot of these cases after the first world war
er does anybody know what his theory of these was
well let me just quickly answer UNK point before i come back er to erm and UNK
erm fr if you look into these dreams what very often happens is or what people report is that whilst they're experiencing the traumatic situation whatever it may be being in a prison camp or something their dreams are often fairly straightforward they're to do with simple UNK things like being rescued UNK getting
after they have been released then these anxiety dreams start
and wh what tends to happen is the dreams are UNK although they often vary in small details and the idea is or this was freud's idea and basically it's the same as his explanation of anxiety dreams that what is happening here is that the mind has got a very disturbing latent content that it can't forget
it's trying to forget it and trying to turn it into a more UNK manifest content so it starts to dream about it but the latent thoughts are so disturbing it never UNK and consequently the whole dream work this process of UNK the latent content just doesn't get anywhere at all except for a few minor details
and so the whole memory comes back and er the individual just cannot be rid of it
so in other words that kind of dream represents an extreme example of erm of an UNK dream but the very fact that it's UNK and you keep having them freud would say is a demonstration of the fundamental idea th that the dream attempts to try and put the past right as it were you try and dream about it but you fail all the time
er i think it was UNK first
yes
well of course sometimes anxiety dreams can be a fulfilment of wishes because people can enjoy anxiety
i mean this is why UNK you know can make a lot of money out of some pretty UNK movie the th the kind of thing i couldn't go to see er cos i get the UNK i can't bear that kind of thing but some people enjoy being frightened don't they
i mean being frightened er UNK kind of you know thing in a lot films can be exciting for some people
and some dreams i'm not saying UNK is i'm sure it isn't but some people some people's anxiety dreams are of that kind
th they're being frightened because they enjoy being frightened and there's a kind of UNK wish fulfilment in that
and that certainly happens
UNK what were
something interesting happened to me that i never really thought about erm but i used to get these dreams where i used to dream that i'd be either falling off a cliff or driving a car and getting into an accident and like or driving off a cliff
and i used to wake up like two feet off my bed like i dunno my body
what you were UNK
i mean i would open my eyes and see myself like that wake up and then i'd UNK off the bed and then i'd sit there UNK and but i haven't had that in a long time and wh when i thought now a lot of times if i think that i leave either the front door UNK my house UNK or the garage door open i go and actually check that in the middle of the night
and i haven't had these dreams in a long time and i used to never do anything like that
so now i always and so i i'm thinking that it might be that i that erm maybe you know like i used to be anxious about something like that and i used to wake up and the dream used to happen but now that i've double checked that i know for sure that i'm safe you know for the night it doesn't happen any more by cutting off possibility
it certainly sounds like it doesn't it
as if you've done that you somehow you feel that you've got no reason to be anxious any more
oh that's right a very famous book yeah
well that reminds me of something that might cast some light on UNK dream
i don't know about these this person you're thinking of but er a very common reaction i certainly have this from time to time it really does UNK my wife cos i usually wake her up is you know you're just going off to sleep and you suddenly kind of feel you're falling does that happen
that's quite a common thing i think
i mean i kind of you know you give a start and unfortunately if you're in bed with somebody else you tend to wake them up because my wife never does that she's just too good to be true
but erm so now i'm blamed for UNK her up
but erm you know there's a wonderful picture i don't know if you've seen it by UNK called sleep which is a kind of head like figure it's a figure which is mainly a head with a kind of sheet UNK over it supported on UNK lots of UNK and this kind of represents this and the idea that if one of the UNK were to move the figure would wake up
now erm my there's a UNK a possibility that the kind of dream you're reporting is one which is UNK by that kind of reaction because i don't know whether theresa read about this but in interpretation of dreams there's a famous example that was provided to freud by one of his friends of a similar thing
what happened was the man erm went to sleep and while he was asleep something in the room fell on his neck
i don't know how this happened but er erm a piece of wood or something fell and hit him on the back of the neck and woke him up and he woke up from the vivid dream of being at the time of the french revolution of being lead up the UNK and having his head chopped off
and his point was you know this was quite a long dream you know th i the manifest content the whole argument of the dream took some time er and his objection was how could freud's theory explain this
well erm does anybody know how freud explained that dream
well his theory was that this guy was a writer or something a UNK or somebody like that and freud said it's quite likely that in the past he had either dreams about a similar dream or conscious UNK about how he would have felt if he'd been in the french revolution and what might have happened to him
he'd then possibly forgotten these dreams or UNK and then when the stimulus of feeling something on the back of his neck happened to him whilst asleep suddenly the fantasy came back all as a piece as it were and it occurred to me that your dream about driving off UNK might be caused by being asleep having one of these falling experiences then relating it to previous thoughts you'd had you know on the UNK or something oh my god how awful it would be if i if i drove off that bend below do you know what i mean
it's possible isn't it
it's a possibility that it's related to some existing thought you'd had
you know how easy it would be drive off and kill yourself or something
is it necessary that you had to have had some kind of fantasy before
yes
about the french revolution
why wasn't it enough that out of every experience that i mean like not much happens to the back of your neck like that that's one thing that i'd even think about i mean i'm not any kind of UNK but like anything like the back of the neck i would think of a UNK also
right yeah
but is it necessary that he should UNK about that beforehand
well you see what freud had to explain here was how he could have had such a long dream when the UNK reported that he woke up more or less instantly from the stimulus of something hitting him on the back of the neck
now unless we think that dreams can UNK very fast in the mind much faster and there is some evidence that that's true actually that dreams can in fact happen quicker than you could think of them in conscious time
nevertheless i think freud's view was that er the erm if it was a really long complicated dream you were UNK a previous fantasy rather than er necessarily creating from scratch because of this particular stimulus
i dunno
has anybody ha ever had a dream like that
not very common i suppose
erm
pizzas
giant pizzas all over the place
you greedy girl
so comfortable
really
and i had to make sure i didn't eat them because they were so comfortable
and the strange thing is my boyfriend was UNK about pizzas at the same time
and he kept shouting out feed me feed me so i woke up at one o'clock in the morning
but had anybody mentioned pizzas beforehand
or
no
i mean was this er a possibility that you ought to have a pizza
no we both like pizzas but to dream about them at the same time and he's screaming out in his sleep get me a pizza
yes i think you were sharing your dreams
well go to bed on a pizza
and it keeps re occurring
you have a pizza problem
well it's eleven o'clock
we've gotta call it call it a day now
theresa we are deeply UNK to you
we will leave erm tracy with her pizza dreams
erm you can you can carry on analyzing your dreams at your leisure
i'll be saying something about them in the lectures not today but next week and er now which reminds me who is performing next week
let's er UNK is right okay
oh and you is it
and then me
and then you
yeah
okay
thanks very much
you'll have to have another go in your dreams theresa
well now you now you've had a class on it you'll have to go back to it UNK and try and crack it
i did this but it's not for a few weeks time for my presentation on freud or
oh i know right yeah right
erm what i wanted
do you want to talk to me about that in the tutorial first or would that be
that's two weeks time
i can if you want it's just that i came up with a few things that didn't make sense they were fairly UNK things
i just wanted to know
well look when are we having our next tutorial
do you want to do this in the tutorial
i mean
sure
tomorrow is twelfth of november
yeah that's right it is
just under two weeks
i could do it then
could you do it then
it will only take a few minutes certainly
or do you want it cleared up beforehand
is it is that waiting too long
no that's fine
it's not waiting too long
when's my presentation
it's not yet is it
it's number seven we're only on number three that's fine
oh yeah you've got quite a bit of time number seven
yes you're doing it on is it number seven
yeah
no it's not it's number eight
number eight
number eight on the twelfth of november so you've got plenty of time
twelfth of november
mhm oh no it can't be the twelfth of november
no that's the tutorial it must be much later than that
sorry i'm reading the wrong dates here that's right it can't be the twelfth i must have meant the fourteenth
i mean it won't mean me UNK it or anything it's just a few things that i wanted to
yeah
okay i'll do it then
thank you
yeah we'll do it then
any suggestions on where to get the book because now once again the UNK i'll be getting my plane ticket ready to go home and then i also wrote a cheque with this one book store out at er erm i forget the name of it but it's out at er UNK road it's supposed to UNK in
have they got it
no
erm i'll oh dear copies either
the things is there's a small possibility it may be out of print cos there's a new edition in the pipeline
i wonder if they've let it get out of print
i will erm i tell you what i'll phone the UNK this morning and see if i can get them to er i need to phone them anyway
i could probably get them to send me one or two copies
i could do with one or two
i may be able to get you one
okay great
leave it with me
i will i'll phone my UNK now and see what i can do
i'll see you later on in class
yeah come in
oh hi oliver do come in
good morning UNK
er good morning cou could you put me through to please
oh hello it's christopher here
do you remember i phoned you a week or two ago about some books i wanted
now they haven't come yet so erm presumably they're in the pipeline are they
i'll wait till one or two people are here before i start
sure do an hour anyway
yes yeah oh it's quite like old days isn't it at l s e with the police outside and a riot on
it brings a tear to my eye
mind you it's not i mean i thought that black demonstration was pathetic
d did you see it
i mean you know when i was student at l s e you know the front of the of the demonstration was down at the law courts the back was still in at er oxford street or something you know
we had real UNK
but there we are
what's happening now does anybody know
they're what
are they trying to occupy the
well i wonder how many more are coming
it's five past at least it is by my watch
yes cos a lot of people are out in
are they
right
so we'll have to carry on
well we'll carry on regardless okay
is there a handout from last week
yes sorry there is
erm yes you're quite right here we are
just getting to that
there's the summary of last week's okay if you can pass those round
and while i'm focusing the overhead this is the er this is a postcard that er a student did this course some years ago sent me from the u s
freud the UNK so how's your mother he's asking the guy in the chair
nearly as bad as singing at you isn't it
okay now erm today as you realize with feelings of immense relief is the last lecture of the term so what i'm gonna do is to start talking about the er so called black books of freud the set UNK in this in this course and i'm gonna start talking today about the first and in some ways one of the most important of these totem and taboo and since it's the last lecture of term and you probably all forget what i said over the christmas holiday and won't be able to recall it afterwards through the UNK er what i thought i'd do today was talk about totem and taboo in the way in which it looked backwards rather than forwards
totem and taboo as we'll see is a key book not only in terms freud's writings on social sciences but in freud's development
and it kind of faces both ways it looks back to the early period of the development of freud's thought that we've already spoken about and its UNK back in the eighteen nineties and in certain other respects it looks forward to the kind of revolution that was going to occur after world war two
what i've called in my book essential freud the second psychoanalytic er revolution
so it it's in many ways a book that looks two ways as it were back and forward
and what i want to do today is to talk about totem and taboo rather more as it looks back than as it looks forward and not just to the past in freud but to the past in other respects as you will see
but first of all this phrase that i used to introducing it of UNK mo
the black books of freud
UNK is a leading french social UNK which those of you doing em social psychology or the social representations course will hear about
and in his book er the age of the crowd UNK refers to what he calls the black books of dr freud
now what has he got in mind
and why are they black
well what he has in mind are those very books which are the core of our course that is freud's writings on social sciences religion society morality social philosophy that kind of thing
that's what he means by the black books of freud
but why are they black
why should they be UNK
well UNK argument and i must say i agree with him is that they tended to be UNK by both groups who might have taken the biggest interest in them
they'd been UNK by the clinical psycho UNK analysts who have followed after freud and used freudian therapy because they're non UNK
these are er books which these are books which do not directly concern UNK applications of psychoanalysis and as a result many UNK who have been very UNK in UNK a kind of medical image for psychoanalysis have tended to regard them as UNK at best and at worst as rather er UNK on the part of freud
do you want a handout ben
so for these people the clinical UNK the black books haven't been very interesting or they've been actually UNK
one of them for example that we'll be looking next term freud's UNK co written with UNK on woodrow wilson was called in one of the major reviews when it finally came out in nineteen sixty seven the kind of thing that gets psychoanalysis a bad name
that's how one of the psychoanalytic UNK referred to that book
so this group the clinical UNK haven't really been interested in this in this kind of writing
the other group of people who you might have thought ought to have taken them up and been interested in them was the wider field of social science er writers after all social scientists ought to be interested in these in these books because they're about social science
again there's been an astonishing neglect not so much i have to point out in fairness of totem and taboo as we'll see
totem and UNK been pretty UNK
but putting totem and taboo on one side and as we'll see it's not really an exception but in general most of these books have been quite UNK ignored
i take a summary from there
one of the best examples of that is a book UNK from nineteen twenty group psychology and the UNK analysis of the psychology of the ego
you might think that that's a book that social scientists ought to be primarily interested in
but in fact if you look through UNK and UNK in the literature you find it's hardly ever UNK and when it is UNK people seldom if ever seemed to refer to what freud er says in it let alone take any notice of it
if you look at something like the institute for group UNK in london it's founded on other writings than freud's writings on group psychology
that's one that they seem to ignore er rather UNK
so social science has tended to ignore freud's books but of course it hasn't been able to forget about freud
and where freud has been integrated with the social sciences interestingly enough what's been integrated is not the black books so much as freud's writings on child development and other issues apart from those in these books
to take one of the most outstanding examples mentioned by bob UNK in one of his books i forget which one it is now but in one of his books bob UNK er mentions that the UNK of mid twentieth century UNK who some of you perhaps may never of heard of but er you certainly would have done in the sixties and seventies because he really was the major fi figure in anglo american social theory
UNK says UNK draws heavily on freud quite consciously i mean he says he's gonna integrate freud in his UNK of social thought
so he's completely explicit about drawing on freud and yet says UNK if you look at the works of freud on which UNK draws they are mainly his works on child development and clinical psychology
UNK seldom if ever mentions the so called black books let alone takes any notice of what they what they say
so even when you get a figure a major figure not a peripheral one a central major figure in social sciences like UNK who really does take freud seriously what does he do
he treats freudian psychology as a socialization theory
he doesn't pay very much attention to the content of these books that we're looking at in this course
so are the kind of reasons why UNK calls them the black books
they're the side of freud that has tended to be ignored even by the people you would've expected to take the greatest notice of them
if you ask in general why social science has been in so selective in its use of freud and so one sided in its interpretation the answer seems to be that since the nineteen twenties and up until very recently western social science has been primarily dominated by what i would call cultural UNK and by that i mean a school of thought which believes that to use a term borrowed from one of its founding fathers UNK social facts have social causes
in other words if you want to explain social UNK you got to look for the explanations in society
and cultural UNK is the idea that they way people think and act is largely determined by their culture their UNK their socialization their home environment peer group pressure this kind of thing and is not to be looked for in natural causes in their genes for example or in individual psychological experience as was the prime focus of freud in psychoanalysis
so the result is that where people did take notice of freud and here UNK is the prime example they interpreted freud as if he too were a cultural UNK
and in a minute we'll see the prime example of that or one of the prime examples of that
so social scientists interpreted him as a cultural UNK
yes they did
but freud
well i agree
i mean how could you do this
i i'm as astonished as you are erm the way in which people like UNK did it was they regarded these basic er personal psychological drives as a kind of UNK that could then be UNK by social pressure
for example UNK explicitly says that the drives of the id are socially UNK in the sense that the forms in which they express themselves are the result of socialization
i agree with you this is an astonishing kind of re interpretation of freud but it's but it's the one that was produced
i'll give a further example of that later in the lecture
now if with that in mind you then turn and look at totem and taboo which was published in nineteen thirteen first as a series of essays then as a single book
in other words just on the eve of world war one
if you read totem and taboo and i by the way i do expect all of you er to read it because it is one of the set er books and one of the things i'm not gonna do in these lectures on the black books is to tell you what the book says and just kind of repeat it in the lecture
i mean this is a waste of my time it should be a waste of your time if you're gonna read the book and we've already had both classes on totem and taboo
and i must say i was impressed i thought the presentations were excellent in both classes and we covered a lot of the material very well i thought
so i'm not gonna waste everybody's time by just saying you know freud said this and freud said that
i'm going to er talk about them rather than rather than repeat them
now when you read totem and taboo one of the things you may notice particularly if you've read more recent UNK social science literature is that it seems very old fashioned
there's something rather out of date about the whole style of the book
it's not the kind of book which you would find being written today by UNK or UNK or social scientists in general
there's something rather dated er about it
and the reason for this is that it belongs to a tradition a fashion if you like of writing which went dramatically out of out of fashion immediately after world war one
so at the time when it was published most readers would have regarded it as completely up to date in its in its style and in its presentation
so it wouldn't have struck anybody in nineteen thirteen as in any way dated
on the contrary it would've seemed a very up to date state of the art kind of book
unfortunately that kind of writing went out of fashion almost instantly and certainly in the nineteen twenties and thirties was replaced by a completely different tradition which has er influenced our expectations and perhaps explains why the book seems so old fashioned
in fact it belongs to a great tradition of UNK writing represented by people like sir james UNK who was he was the kind of UNK of british UNK prior to world war one
james UNK was a cambridge UNK who wrote er a number of books most UNK the golden UNK an enormous er volume i think it runs to thirteen volumes
one of the few things erm that i'm really proud of about myself is that i've read all of them
erm mainly out of UNK i do admit because i must be the only social scientist of my generation who's read all of them from cover to cover
erm but er it is a very long book and er it is a UNK and if you were to read the golden UNK or any part of it or any other work of UNK for that matter you would immediately be reminded of totem and taboo because UNK method is comparative
it's a great work of comparative UNK
what UNK does is to take in the case of the golden UNK and UNK and aspects of folk UNK from this society and that society all over the world and compare them to each other
and his work is informed by a vast reading and numerous personal contacts with cultures throughout the world
so on one page you'll be reading about what UNK do in upper UNK and on the next page you'll be reading about what the ancient UNK did that is similar
and on in the next paragraph there'll be something on the UNK and on the next one something on the australian UNK and so on
this is one of the things that makes the book so long
it's full of descriptive material
page after page after page after page of descriptive material drawn from all over the world both published accounts which UNK drew on erm with er kind of er UNK knowledge but also a lot of personal contacts which he had with people like UNK er UNK administrators and even er local people who would with descriptions and er and facts about the things he was he was UNK
the result was that UNK was UNK well informed about cultures throughout the world without ever having visited one of them
he was er what was to be er rather UNK called an UNK
he was one of these comparative UNK he wasn't the kind of UNK that goes out and lives with er primitive people for several years and then comes back and writes an account of them
that kind of UNK writing was to become very fashionable after world war one and was to be made into something of a UNK by people like UNK here at l s e margaret er to quote the worst case er an and others
and as i said it was er it was it was UNK but it had its own strengths and the margaret case er is one of them
as you probably know margaret UNK a huge fraud i mean there's no other word for what she did
she may not have consciously intended all of it but huge fraud it was because she UNK to give a picture which in her own words was er forever true that's a direct quote er forever true of UNK which we know er was not at all true
in fact margaret 's account of UNK was based on interviews through an UNK with twenty five UNK girls in the back room of the u s navy er UNK er on the main island of UNK during a time when there was considerable anti american er feeling
never lived with the UNK after the first week
she tried it for a week and then went to live with the americans and said the food was too UNK
she writes about UNK among UNK boys but we know from examining her field notes she never inter interviewed one UNK boy
her knowledge of UNK was based upon what a group of UNK girls thr told her through an UNK and what can only be called er UNK chat and gossip that she picked up from UNK wives and people like this
the problem was of course this was a culture where UNK girls do not UNK important american ladies who are talking to them through UNK
so when margaret said to them er well you don't know anything about rape do you
they said no miss and when she said to them you never think about rape do you they said no miss the thought never entered our head
derek who exposed the fraud took the trouble of consulting the police records for UNK at the time when margaret was there and although margaret claimed there was no rape in UNK because children were brought up so nicely in this kind of tropical UNK that she that she portrayed in the book the fact is according to the police records there were more UNK in UNK while margaret than were occurring in new york at the time was writing during the nineteen eighties
and new york has one of the highest rate sorry rape rates in the world
so when i say fraud i mean it
somebody like james UNK wouldn't have let margaret get away with that
i mean james UNK would have read her novel cos i think that's all you can call it coming of age in UNK because it's mainly UNK he would've read her UNK account and then he would have compared it with other accounts which had been published in german and other languages and accounts of UNK themselves and he would have said look there's something wrong here
there're tremendous UNK between what margaret and what these other people say
UNK would have known about that so although he was a much UNK at least he didn't rely on the say so of a single UNK who claimed to pay paint a picture forever true
so although UNK was doing a kind of UNK that was later to be rather dis UNK it had something to be said for it
and in the german tradition of psychology it's worth pointing out that UNK who those of you who are reading psychology i'm sure have heard of er UNK was a kind of er slightly older contemporary of freud's and i UNK you've heard of him as the founder of modern scientific psychology
he opened the world's first psychological laboratory in the university of UNK some time in the eighteen eighties i think i'm right in saying
UNK is projected as the founding father of modern experimental laboratory based psychology
but the fact is that spent most of his life and most of his writings on an enormous work even longer than the golden UNK er called the UNK or folk psychology and this enormous work it's in twenty three volumes or something er of the UNK is just like james UNK writing and indeed totem and taboo
it's er a work of comparative er folk UNK and folk psychology
and these were the very works the golden UNK which freud's UNK would have been reading in english and german
so when freud's totem and taboo appeared in nineteen thirteen it would have instantly been compared with these and that is the UNK of er UNK writing in which it would of been immediately been at home
so at the time as i said it would have seemed a perfectly conventional piece of work even if to a later generation like ours
it now seems rather old fashioned
now as we saw in the in the when we discussed this in the class the central theme of totem and taboo is what you might call to use a psychoanalytic jargon term UNK
UNK was a term UNK in about nineteen o five by the UNK and it was taken up particularly by psychoanalysis and as a psychoanalytic term it means the co existence of UNK thoughts feelings or emotions about the same thing
typically co existence of feelings of love and hate
and as we saw when we discussed the book freud gives a number of examples of UNK and the UNK to which they give rise
taboo is a UNK word and it means some kind of UNK law or UNK which you UNK at your UNK
if you UNK a taboo something terrible will happen to you
but if you had to explain why you have to obey the taboo you would probably find it very difficult in the in the sense that taboo UNK are not like legal rational ones
if you ask somebody what's the explanation for a fact you may have noticed if you walked down the strand here just from the school if you're UNK i'm sure you've all instantly noticed as you walked by that strand street which is a short street that sorry i'm UNK street which is a short street that leads off the strand into the UNK hotel is an exception to the rule that in england you drive on the left because in UNK in UNK street you drive on the right
and you may say well why is this
is this just an UNK if you look at the road markings you'll see it seems to be official cos the road is marked out for driving on the right and the reason is that er traffic law in this country says that vehicles drive on the left except in UNK street
and that is the one street in the in the whole country where legally you are obliged to drive on the other side
and the reason is it's for the benefit of UNK cos everybody knows that london taxi drivers are above the law
if you've ever driven around london you immediately notice this
these guys do anything you know u turns in the middle of anywhere they can do it you can't
well if you do it they just shout at you
it's so they can open the door behind them the passengers getting in on that side of the road
that has to be the reason
i knew i knew that it was because the that the taxi UNK had insisted but now told us the reason
alright now we know
that that's a rational law okay it's nothing to do with a taboo there's not some strange UNK principle which says in UNK street you drive on the other side and if you don't you'll be struck down with a fever or ill luck or something like that
it's a rational legal principle okay
now that is not a taboo
a taboo is quite different
a taboo is something you can't justify or explain or UNK as existing for the convenience of taxi drivers
a taboo is something beyond reason and as we saw what freud does in the book is compare it with UNK which are kind of personal UNK and in fact the sub title of the book is some points of agreement between the mental lives of UNK and UNK
and the principal point of agreement is the agreement between the UNK which like the taboo is something that the UNK cannot bring themselves to do fears for the consequences if they do it and er feels constrained by some UNK force er to obey even though it isn't rational
and as we saw freud UNK these and explains UNK and UNK as a means of dealing with UNK
well now i'll come back to the whole question of UNK er next term when i discuss the what is really the central issue of the book apart from UNK which is the incest question
i'm saving that for next term so i won't say anything about incest now
what i want to go on to discuss in the in the last part of the lecture is another way in which freud's work looks backwards or seems to look backwards
and that is that it seems to look back to the writings of darwin
and this is the other aspect of freud's debt to darwin which i mentioned at the beginning but said i would hold over for later
i said if you remember in the opening lectures that in many ways freud continues the tradition of darwin's own writing in psychology and i explained why earlier
but i said there was another important aspect to this i would mention later and now we've reached that point and i'll explain what it is
in the closing er pages of the of the book freud draws on a suggestion of darwin's which is that in the beginning human beings lived in what freud calls primal UNK and the primal UNK social structure is one that darwin had observed in many UNK
today we'd call it a one male group it's a social structure in which we have a single dominant male a UNK of females and im sexually UNK young
what's lacking from such groups is mature s sexually mature er males apart from the dominant male
there's only ever one
and the reason there's only ever one is that dominant male will not tolerate the presence of other males and drives them out
so females are retained in these groups but males are driven out by the dominant male whom freud called the primal father
now freud in trying to the explain the origins of UNK about incest suggests the apparently UNK and UNK idea that in the beginning human beings lived in these kinds of primal UNK and er there was no incest UNK as such
there was no taboo on incest any constraints that did exist on UNK on human UNK mating preferences were dictated by the primal fathers
he had all the women and nobody else had them
there came a day said freud the sons in frustration rose up against the primal father murdered him ate him in a UNK act of UNK raped the mothers and sisters and then having UNK the positive side of the negative side of their UNK about the primal father their hate for him their desire to UNK him and so on were left with the positive side UNK
because you see said freud they wanted to be like him
they wanted to UNK him and do what he was doing and enjoy his UNK and they kind of UNK him for what he was having and they wanted
they were UNK about him
and having destroyed him it was this other side of the UNK that came back to UNK them as a sense of guilt and deferred UNK and out of guilt they UNK the incest the incest UNK
now i don't really want to talk about the details of that now i want to come back to that next term when i talk about incest
the one thing that i do want to talk about here however in some detail because it's important is how freud thinks that this matters to an analysis of modern feelings and attitude to incest
and freud's answer is that it matters because human beings have inherited this guilt from the primal crime
in other words we have innate feelings of guilt about er UNK and murder because we've inherited them from our UNK in the distant past
this raises the UNK topic of freud's lamarckism
okay what is lamarckism
well lamarckism is named after er jean UNK de UNK better known to us as UNK and the prime notion of lamarckism according in darwin let's try and get that over there a bit more is evolution by will
this is a quote from darwin erm UNK if an animal for the satisfaction of its needs makes repeated efforts to UNK its tongue it will acquire a considerable length
e g UNK
if it requires to UNK anything with the same organ its tongue will then divide and become UNK
needless to say darwin thought this was this was nonsense
the other aspect of what darwin understood by lamarckism was UNK
here's darwin saying in a letter to a friend heaven UNK me from UNK nonsense of a tendency to progression and indeed darwin's view was the contrary to this and here's another quote from darwin after long reflection i cannot avoid the conviction that no innate tendency to development exists
so this is what darwin and everybody of his time understood by lamarckism
evolution by will and UNK
the idea that organisms were constantly being UNK
the idea was why has a UNK got a long neck
well the answer is UNK tried to eat food on higher branches of trees UNK upwards and as they UNK they stretched their UNK and they passed on their stretched UNK to their to their UNK
this was a way of UNK the UNK
well this is not darwin's theory of course and today we know erm that this is in fact total nonsense
however when people talk about freud's lamarckism they don't mean this
the problem is the term lamarckism has changed its meaning in the course of this century and now lamarckism if you say lamarckism to most educated people the first thing they normally think of is not evolution by will or UNK but inheritance of acquired characteristics
lamarckism assumed that as an animal developed a longer neck or bigger muscles or something like that through practice it could pass these on to its to its UNK
acquired characteristics could be could be inherited
the musical UNK of the UNK family for instance which was so UNK that in that part of germany where the UNK lived the word UNK which actually means brook started to mean UNK because there were so many of them er that kind of inheritance of musical ability was often explained in the past as inheritance of acquired characteristics
the idea was if you work hard at learning music your children will kind of be born with an innate erm capacity for it
and er of course today we know that this is UNK you cannot er inherit acquired characteristics
the point is this was not known when freud was writing totem and taboo
at least it wasn't known to very many people at that time
it certainly wasn't known to darwin
and darwin explicitly did believe in the inheritance of acquired characteristics
darwin did not understand the principles of er UNK
