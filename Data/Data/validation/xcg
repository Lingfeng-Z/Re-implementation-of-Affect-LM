he then told the court i had better not say she was an angel or no angel or the national press will have a hundred field days
she was a girl trying to find young men to satisfy her sexual UNK
he added i have to pass a sentence because it is against the law
it would be UNK to pass a UNK sentence whatever the court of appeal may think
the seventy one year old judge caused UNK in june when he said an eight year old victim of a sex attack was not entirely an angel herself
he gave student UNK two years probation for attempted unlawful sexual UNK
the court of appeal increased his sentence to four months jail yesterday
judge hill gave two year UNK to philip twenty one from southampton and keith nineteen of nearby UNK for unlawful UNK
now i don't know because you know there's a photograph in that story of mandy smith as well and er mandy smith looked like mandy smith from about the age of fourteen
erm any views

let me get that right again john you said you keep hearing funny noises
yeah
that you silly
ooh
i lie in here
i don't know i don't know you should've
have you got your hands sort of tied up behind you in that sort of coat thing
i haven't got anything
haven't you i have
oh right
all right

are you serious
yeah
good that's all it needs is one of us to be serious and we're okay
right
john
UNK
you're on the air yeah
yes halloween
right you were talking about its affect on children
mm
and er i've discussed this before and i've come to the conclusion that these children who come along with jehovah's witnesses knocking on your door they're more affected than any child once a year practising whatever you like to call it halloween or whatever
that was basically my argument
so excuse me for being a little thick
yes
i didn't i what d'ya mean
well when the jehovah's and the other religious UNK come knocking at the door with their various UNK and trying to persuade you that their religion is better than others
yeah
they have these very young children with them
yeah
and er i think they're more affected by outside influences UNK whatever you like to call it than one night a year of halloween
yeah well okay er possibly but er i think you're missing the point actually
i mean halloween is it's a UNK ritual it's there to worship the devil it's the most UNK date in the calendar if you want to get into black magic if you want to dance naked round er a UNK heart with sticks stuck through it
hey i say all these kids are doing is walking round with a bloody UNK with a UNK in it
they're not learning about religion where they don't believe in blood UNK etcetera seven or eight year old
yes but i think you know you have to give
go on
you have to give a little bit of er credibility there for people not being quite that UNK don't you
not quite that UNK
well i mean we we're not really er
if jehovah's witnesses come to the door
yes
you know what it's all about
okay
you either let them in for two reasons
you let them in to have a laugh at them or you let them in because you want to listen to what they're saying
okay
yes
you cannot put that together with halloween which basically is people going out thinking they're going out to have fun and they're having a bit of a laugh and everything else where's there's their underlying er connection with the devil
i don't think children realize it is a connection with the devil
but isn't that the most dangerous thing
no i think the consistent and persistent influence in the children which some of these religious UNK have i think that's more dangerous than one two nights of a UNK in a in a UNK or whatever
yes but could they not be UNK if you like into thinking well there's nothing much wrong there isn't such a thing as evil
no
you don't think so
evil isn't there
well of course there's evil yeah
and i think pretend there isn't evil
okay thank you for your call john
okay
you enjoyed that didn't you
be honest
well
yeah be honest you enjoyed it
interesting talking to er
a UNK case i know exactly how you feel
different opinions
thank you john
okay bye
bye
er right thank you john
erm go back up here
now we've got sir UNK erm i can't see the sir UNK retired senior judge on the phone
sir UNK good erm afternoon to you
good afternoon
er we really wanted to know what your view on erm sir nicholas UNK both in the commons i suppose and er reported the UNK of his wife on the front page of the daily mirror today
well i haven't seen that UNK but er i understand that he suggested
could i read it to you
yes please
UNK let me read
first of all the headline says women deserve rape says m p's wife and then the front page exclusive many women deserve to be raped a tory m p's wife said yesterday
sir nicholas UNK wife sam backed her husband's astonishing views that there is no such crime as rape
well that's absolute rubbish
i've had i think more experience of what a rape in court than sir nicholas
he may have had more experience outside court than i have because i've had none
but in court i have probably dealt with more rape cases than any other living lawyer
and my experience has been that virtually all rape cases have been the UNK interference with a woman
so why do you think sir nicholas and his wife have both come out and said something as ridiculous as this
they also go on to say that a lot of women deserve to be raped
well that again is nonsense
there is unfortunately a theory around which is of long standing to that effect
i UNK over a the criminal law revision committee when we reviewed the law relating to rape and we discovered that there was this myth that women asked for rape
it is a myth
why in that case do you think that sir nicholas and he he's not stupid i mean he's a career politician he's come out and said this his wife has said that they're both smiling on the front page of the newspaper at the moment and they go on to say it's not fair on a man if a women UNK and then changes her mind
well that may it may be unfair and until recently that kind of situation never came before the courts
there has unfortunately in my opinion been a change of attitude about which cases to UNK
mm
and in some of these cases there ought not to be a prosecution
but that doesn't mean that the ordinary case is one in which the woman is in any way asking to be raped
now sir UNK recently the police have made great UNK forward in encouraging women to come and report rape because until recently they didn't and they didn't want to they didn't want to face the shame and they didn't want to face everything else sir nicholas and again his wife which is the most worrying i think of this a women saying that women deserve to be raped erm it's going to make women less likely to come forward isn't it
well i agree
but again i think it has been unfortunate er that recently there have been a few cases in which it would have been better not to UNK
mhm
but they are a minority of cases
in most cases that i've dealt with and i've f i repeat i've probably dealt with more than any other living person in court er there has been a clear case of rape
could i move on from that sir UNK just to ask you whilst you're on the phone your views on er the story in the daily mail today
er judge ian i'm sure you'll be familiar with him he is the judge who
i know him personally
right
er he said or he's in a in a in a little trouble today for allowing two men who had sex of thirteen to go free erm a policeman told the judge that the thirteen year old was more like mandy smith than the UNK school girl with UNK but she was nevertheless thirteen and the judge said he had better not say she was no angel or the national press would have a hundred field days with him
is there not some call on judges to be just a little a little more UNK perhaps when they're dealing with cases like this rather than as UNK as he
well i agree about that
i think that er judge er 's remarks were a little unfortunate er but er he's now UNK retirement and occasionally all of us i've done it myself
mm
in the past make remarks which i regret
er but the basis of what he had to say is presents a problem which do face judges in the class of case
er unfortunately one has cases from time to time on girls of this age who set out to UNK men
er it's unfortunate that they should but when the men UNK to their er approaches then it's always a very difficult
mm
problem as to what to do about it
well the men although they may not have realized they were thirteen must have been pretty stupid not to realize they were perhaps below consent age
oh yes well i agree about that
but a great deal depends on the circumstances
i have experience of this class of case over a period of more than fifty years and it hasn't been UNK in the past even in the days when judges took a more UNK view than they UNK er inclined to do nowadays not to punish er in any with a UNK
mm
sentence as men UNK men not older men UNK men who behave in this way
now judge as you said you know er and erm sir UNK i know you're retired now he's seventy one do you think there should be a mandatory retirement age for judges perhaps
that maybe they get to a certain time when they're going to be out of touch
has it that it should be seventy from the future
mm
it all depends on the judge
i mean i remember judges who were er much younger than seventy who were beyond it
on the other hand i remember judges who were over seventy five
the most outstanding judge in my lifetime has been lord reed
er he does he doesn't figure very much in the tabloids
yeah
because
he was so good that he never annoyed anybody by silly remarks
but he was well over eighty when he retired
do you think we should have slightly younger judges
i mean there is the move to make people judges earlier than they have been recently
well it depends upon what you mean by early
as lord er the lord chief justice said in a television programme question time er two nights ago it takes a good deal of experience before somebody's qualified to be a judge and when you do become a judge you have a great deal to learn
you know there was an old legal story er saying rather er that er in the first five years that a j a man is appointed a judge he doesn't know the job
in the next five years he thinks he does but doesn't
and in the last five years he's too old to do it
that's worrying
i don't want to appear in front a judge in his first five years then
but that that's the problem that we all have this is one of the problems that the ju UNK that the judge has to bear
did you in your time ever send a man to execution
no i only tried three capital murder cases and all three they got UNK
were you were you glad about that
in two of them i was
sir UNK thank you for er speaking to me this afternoon
thank you
interesting talking to you bye
good bye
okay er we move on over six seven minutes to go before the end of the programme
let's talk to er steve erm where are hang on just one moment whilst i find you
hello steve
hello james
hi
hello
just er one final comment about this halloween
really with very few exceptions it's simply a bit of UNK fun
i mean let's face it
that's always the worse thing isn't it whe the most annoying this when it's UNK fun
er yeah
come into my parlour said the UNK to the fly
horror films
what's your comment about those
i mean
do you believe in devil
television
do you believe in the devil
on children than any other media
i agree steve i agree
do you believe in the devil though
do you believe that halloween has any kind of place with the devil or not
no
you don't
i don't
er then there is nothing i can say to change your mind
i mean you will you will go on UNK your own sweet way and erm i hope nothing happens to sort of
i mean we don't er we don't dance on UNK hearts here in gate UNK
well i don't know because north UNK pretty sort of erm er pretty UNK as far as black magic is concerned
well you
and d'ya know i i'm beginning to think you sort of protest so much that maybe you're a leader of a UNK or something
erm
put on the old UNK head and dance naked round the bonfire
is that right
well no i'm not no i'm not
it's just that i mean this is the only thing about halloween that i don't like is the import from america of this trick or treat nonsense
yep
i don't like that one bit
but leave that to one side
but that's only because it's an american idea that's the only reason you don't like it
no i don't i don't like it er it er no i simply don't like it
i can't really tell you why it's just i don't like the don't like the idea of children going round er begging for treats money whatever it might be
yes i agree with you there
but i really to believe that halloween does has no real influence
there are always exceptions you know to the rule
okay steve thank you for your call
you think it has no problem and er we'll squeeze in one more call before the end of the programme

don't know well i mean yeah the basically UNK closed
erm they've demolished all the north side you know what used to be the dynamics and that's all gone it's gonna become you know it's not very that's becoming a well in the process of becoming a business park but i mean well i mean it it's all executive erm and you know business stuff and on the surface you know we're still reasonably busy with that sort of thing but erm no that they have the only one four six we see now is just on the company UNK just you know until they complete the close down of the factory they UNK them up to UNK er and back every day
but that really won't last long much after the erm well we don't know i er nobody really knows i mean british aerospace has UNK into all of these property groups and rover and everybody's got fingers in the pie and we're not we're sort of caught half way between short term aims to make a quick profit from trying to get shell in you know and that sort of thing but i mean we just need to talk about nobody really knows what the long term policy of the main british aerospace board is
whether to you know sort of try and pick up the guys who are getting thrown out of heathrow and make a long term go of it or whether in the long term em they want to UNK it off for UNK and you know mining it for UNK and sending it for houses and you know that sort of thing

let's er find my the light thingy
no not today
no there's no film today
okay so who's entertaining us this morning
ah how nice it's from psychology
is it
yes
okay off you go now
well done excellent
well done joy erm a nice summary of a complex book and er there's obviously a lot of things that will have to go of the erm lecture on it next week so really this is not due to be talked about
by the way tom while i'm on it erm i mislead you yesterday erm i look in my list i realized i
it's tom who's doing it i just wrote tom and i thought you were in yesterday's group but you're in today's group so it can't be you it's tom
so ignore that i mixed you up with tom i do apologize
you're not doing
in fact we haven't got you down for a paper at all in this class yet i don't think so if you'd like to do one for us you can see me about it afterwards
okay well erm joy has outlined as i said this rather complex book erm what erm wh what issues do people want to er want to raise about it
what's it say that the people who don't like being in groups
well what would you say
erm
some people are more UNK than others
some people are
i think erm yeah they are
what taking the kind of analysis freud uses in this book what features in the individual would you look for in order to answer these questions
i mean what psychological characteristics would make one person more UNK than another or more needing or wanting or enjoying belonging to a group than another
can anyone suggest what features of the individual you might UNK as critical
mhm n why's that could you explain that
because in a group you y you get this erm the individual's ego and they th they take on this the super ego of the of a leader so they get this UNK idea so if a person got a stronger ego then they're then they're less likely to lose that and take on somebody else's ideas
yes i think that's certainly true isn't it and here erm dean puts his finger really on what is a central concept of freud's group psychology and one UNK in the title of the book which is group psychology and the analysis of ego or in german erm UNK analyse so erm
the fact that freud linked the two things together the very title of the book shows the evil th that group psychology and ego psychology were UNK connected with one another and er the central idea was that as dean rightly says is that in a group the leader or the leading principal and it doesn't always have to be a person although usually a person plays kind of represents the er the leader in the way that the UNK represents christ for example you know christ can't be here right now he's doing other things elsewhere i presume
erm the leader of the of the group is the focus and as dean has said and as joy explained takes over functions of the individual's ego super ego
what kind of functions does the leader exercise for the individual
because there's quite a list of them and i think they explain many of the descriptive characteristics of o of goods or that freud refers to
that's certainly true and in a sense that's the most obvious thing isn't it
the leader as always is er is a directive agency the leader as it were erm takes over the individual self determination by erm effectively telling the good what to do erm how can this er does this have to be in one direction only i mean one gets the feelings very often you know you see things in the newspaper crowd UNK and so on erm do crowds always have to become kind of primitive and UNK or can leaders influence them in other directions
cos certainly you sometimes you get the feeling don't you that okay being in the crowd or the group may reduce people's self determination and self control but the result is UNK
so does that always have to happen
well what would you say joy because you did touch on this in your in your comments
do groups always have to the behaviour and performance of their members or can they do the opposite
what do you think dean i mean
is that why you were thinking some people might not want to belong to groups cos they always see er the group as UNK from their ego
yeah perhaps i know that it applies to some people
mm
i mean i don't feel comfortable talking i'm talking in a whole group i don't feel quite as comfortable not actually here but in a debate situation talking to say two or three people
yes
there must be some people there that wonder what that was really
well of course tha that might just be UNK by large numbers of other people like you know having to stand up in front of a group of other people i think anybody feels the same
erm er embarrassment or UNK because there are so many other people erm there but i think you meant more than that didn't you and
yes yeah i did yeah
er you were you were saying that er for some people the group is a kind of a danger cos it takes something away from them and that's certainly true but the th the point i was i was getting at was that
if freud's theory of the group is correct that it's centred on the leader playing the super role then the presumably the leader could UNK members of the group to act better than they normally would because after all one of the super UNK functions is to set the goals for the ego and to give the goal the ego something to UNK to so er and as joy mentioned in her papers and i'm trying to remind you of y you said that quoting freud if you recall that freud says and i think he UNK this from the also made the same observation that in a group or a crowd people can act a lot worse than they normally would they can be more destructive primitive erm and er more governed by their erm base emotions as it were but equally in a crowd people can act better than they normally would
they can be more UNK more public UNK more erm UNK than they would be on their own because the super ego can presumably erm influence the ego in both directions it can make the ego erm UNK itself as it were to higher ideals and like someone sometimes sees this in group behaviour but equally of course it can erm UNK the ego by setting lower standards than the ego would normally accepted itself
so erm it it's important to remember that freud's theory explains both of these UNK and both the tendency for the group to make people better than they might normally be but also that the tendency for the group perhaps to make them worse and of course either can happen and presumably a lot depends on the on the leader the leader or whoever is playing the leadership function presumably has erm some responsibility for this
er in a sense you could say that the leader becomes the conscience of the of the group
now in the book and this is a diagram in the book that the person who did this paper yesterday in yesterday's class put on the board erm freud doesn't use the term super ego that term i think was first used by freud a year or two later in his book the ego which i think is nineteen twenty three
in nineteen twenty one he used the term ego ideal for what
the term ego ideal i think reflects very nicely this idea of erm the super ego as setting the standard to which the ego UNK
the later term that freud adopted to this super ego has become UNK in people's minds with conscience the idea of the super ego as the role of conscience and UNK presumably that's another aspect of the same thing and er UNK in his excellent book age of the crowd erm which is on the reading list which i can thoroughly recommend in discussing this point of how freud sees the leader as the kind of super ego of the followers quotes one of the UNK war criminals i forget which it was now erm UNK or UNK or one of these er people who when asked of the UNK war UNK why did you do the things you did replied UNK hitler was my conscience and that's er that's a very erm good example of this idea of er how the role of conscience can be transferred from the individual to the to the leader of the group and i suppose dean you would say erm UNK one of the greatest dangers of group membership because er obviously if that happens in a group then erm individuals are to some extent erm UNK their moral self responsibility and of course if freud's insight is correct then there was an element of truth in this in this excuse UNK hitler was my conscience
i'm not saying it's one that the tribunal should have accepted but what i'm saying is th there is an element of psychological truth in that because if freud's theories if er bond freud theory group behaviour is correct then that does seem to happen some extent that the leader as it were takes and presumably this is why some people erm presumably er feel better in groups perhaps that they get something out of a group that their own ego cannot provide but other people are uncomfortable in groups because they feel that their ego is being UNK and they're losing some of their some of their power
so some people are erm are really rather allergic to groups and i'm certainly one of them
which is why my career has never UNK
well no er at least i don't think he does er
well why
yeah
well this would be the other side of the picture
in the book freud UNK the bonds portrait of the crowd that joy outlined to us
the other side of the picture is the UNK as it were
now explore the psychology of the UNK a bit more for us heather i mean what
usually does
would everybody think that
well explain why because there's an interesting point here you touch on
erm
just expand that a bit
why do you come to that judgment
yeah you see you see the paradox
yeah i see what y you're getting at let me give an ex er an illustrated example which i think might help or at least bring the paradox out of those clearly
what about UNK groups
because if you took the ideas of freud's seriously and a lot of people who work with groups the UNK groups claim to do you think you would come to the same conclusion as heather i mean c could you have for example a UNK group could you do group UNK
well if and if you took this freud's theory seriously
what are the implications of that for group UNK
you see the individual
it's not so good is it not yeah
you see the individual UNK dilemma we've got no problem with the UNK who comes for individual psychoanalysis they have been on their own th there's no problem there but what about the group UNK situation
what what's the problem there
well yes i mean th this is certainly the was born in fact i commented on this in my in my book when i was talking about this book before group psychology i made one or two erm fairly erm critical comments about group UNK
i would like to think that if freud were alive today he would have said the same thing of course when freud wrote this book in nineteen twenty one er there was no such thing as group UNK it hadn't been invented yet it was to become very much after world war two but partly existed before and perhaps it's past its peak now but erm it did become very much a after world war two and the point i made was and this is really wh what heather ha h has just said that if you take freud's book on group seriously how can you do group psychoanalysis
you can certainly do group UNK therapy and here we touch on another point that erm joy reminds us of and freud makes quite a bit on the book the parallel between being in a group and being UNK because the role of the UNK is to take over completely
you go or the person who has been UNK so that in the most extreme cases as we know the UNK person UNK into a kind of UNK whether a kind of sleeping UNK with no ego and their decisions are now being made for them by the UNK who tells them what do to and they act as a kind of a UNK as if their ego ha has been turned off al altogether and clearly there's a parallel here with what freud's going on in the group
so if you think about it a UNK group could certainly use UNK therapy like UNK and my guess is that most successful groups like UNK anonymous or groups of people who wanna stop smoking or do UNK and things like that succeed for that reason cos every member of the group UNK every other member with a kind of group super ego and says look you mustn't smoke you mustn't drink you mustn't put on weight and it UNK every individual's erm super ego by means of identification with the shared value of the group and similarly reduces feelings of shame and guilt if the individual fails the group cos next week when they come back they say oh dear i've put on five pounds erm that they're gonna feel bad about it because it UNK against the ideal of the of the group if it's weight UNK or something
however the suggestion is quite different from analysis because as what we've seen what happens in analysis is in analysis the individual faces up to their inner and UNK them themselves it's a kind of a UNK solution to use to use to use UNK term
the in analysis you don't get er someone else to do it for you or you don't get the UNK to play the role of your ego which is really what happens in this suggestion
you get your own ego to face up to its own problems and to make its own decisions er as i mentioned before a very painful process and a and a and a rather UNK one
so it seems to me that you cannot do analysis in a group because by definition the ego of a person in a group is UNK from whereas in individual psychoanalysis and ideally the ego of the person is added to and UNK to give them more competence by being made to face up to its UNK
so i must say i entirely agree with heather on this it seems to me inevitable logic of freud's theory and erm my own view is that group psychoanalysis is a contradiction in terms you cannot do psychoanalysis in a group of this and those who say they can i think have n never understood what psychoanalysis is all about and are misleading the public and people pay good money for it
i think if you say you do suggestion therapy in a group that's fine that's honest and correct but to say you can do analysis in a group i think is actually erm UNK in the sense that it is not true analysis it must be suggestion therapy
right
no
oh of course the opposite happens in a group i mean what happens in groups you know UNK groups tend to be like this one they sit in circles and they kind of focus on very often on the leader who often plays a very powerful role even if they claim not to
very often in UNK groups they do claim not to but in fact er the leader does play a very dominant role er and even when the attention shifts to members of course the fact that all the other members are watching them means that their reactions and what they say and think and do in a group would have been very much constrained by their actions and expectations o of the other members
now erm this is this is UNK group behaviour but whatever it is it cannot necessarily reflect erm that individual's own erm peculiar self as it were using peculiar in the in the strict sense and proper to them because as we've seen what happens in a group is the individual
so erm you can't even see the things you're looking at i don't think in a group for the for the reason heather said because what will happen is you will see reflecting individual the values and aspirations of the group and especially the disturbing effects of the other members and the leader
what you're not likely to see is the UNK of the person erm showing themselves and if they do show too much the likelihood is that the rest of the group will start to erm freeze out that individual regardless because they're no longer corresponding to the to the ideals of the group and er so consequently erm i personally have no time for group psychoanalysis and i would never recommend it to anybody although of course for non UNK things like losing weight or in stopping smoking or drinking there's a lot to be said for it but one shouldn't confuse that kind of group UNK with erm analysis cos analysis as we've seen is quite different
so that's an important point and one which is not in freud's book although i'd like to think it would have been had he written it much later on when group erm therapy had become very fashionable
though my guess is that it is very UNK is that right dawn that people think that
do you think it's less fashionable than it was
and in the in the sixties and seventies it was all the rage but i've got the feeling it had a
yeah well therapy of all kinds i mean
that's true that's true
mind you UNK is getting on now as er
as he reflects the situation of a few years ago
the erm i mean if there's only one much worse that they know that everyone much better for their
well that's true
yes
and so if they er when normally there's only one reason
yes i think whenever one makes judgment about therapy being better or worse you have to say er on what criteria and there are certainly certain criteria on which group therapy would do better for certain problems like us making feel people feel better if they had a UNK or problem which erm make them feel worse because they felt isolated from the community so it means other people who have got the same problem makes you feel better erm and er certainly suggestion therapy can produce dramatic results especially in the short run
th the problem with suggestion therapy whether it be UNK or group therapy is it doesn't tend to last in the longer run after the person stopped going to the group or they haven't seen the er UNK for UNK
there's a very good example of that some years ago er in one of these groups i had erm a student had a severe UNK problem and he said that he had UNK and for two years he was fine he had no UNK and suddenly one day under stress it came back an and ever since erm then he was having some other kind of treatment i think but er but that's typical
i in the shorter run erm often suggestion therapy will work but seldom in the long run and er then it needs UNK you need to go back and have more
so but there is something to be said for it i'm certainly not running it down what i am saying is you can't
certain people have claimed that in group psychoanalysis and that i think is UNK because they are not doing analysis they're doing something different and erm i think it is something described i think very well in this book although of course as we said this was written erm er group therapy
okay any other points that people want to raise about this
there's one paradox here that i think can confuse people and we ought to talk about a little bit and that is the UNK aspect
again joy mentioned it because of course it's important you'd expect in a in a freudian theory
the UNK aspect of group membership now how does that work
what happens to people's libido in a group
cos this is important and it can be confusing and there is t er there is a little of a paradox in here which will come out even more clearly next week oh no the week after
the week after when marie anne does civilization and
can anybody see the paradox i'm getting at when we talk about the libido in the group
well let me put it this way er it's the two's company UNK a crowd problem
t to what am i
two's company UNK a crowd
i think if you had asked freud what's the minimum number UNK for one of for the bond freud crowds freud would have thought for a bit and i think he would have said three
he certainly wouldn't have said two why not
why is two company and three a crowd
they can't be a
er well er perhaps not but what's the i mean what's the context in wh which people quote that saying
left out and two would UNK and
right but the two's company and UNK a crowd idea is that if you've got er two people they may have er some UNK interest in each other and they may have a couple but a third person is just a UNK
it it's the eternal triangle they're the stuff of which UNK and soap UNK are made
what wo what would they do without the eternal triangle
virtually none one UNK so ca can you see the problem here
the problem is freud believes in the libido the libido erm UNK you towards another person for UNK and that makes a couple and this can be very UNK as well
so how on earth can there be a UNK dimension in a group or a crowd whereas we've already said the minimum number is three and actual number of course is vastly greater
so how can there possibly be a UNK dimension to crowds if crowds are just erm many more extra points in the eternal triangle
how does freud get or to refer to marie UNK erm subject couple weeks how could freud think that libido was involved in groups when he says in the book that she's gonna tell us about tha that society and civilization erm is in conflict with UNK wi with individual's erm UNK self interest th their personal UNK
right now how does that come about
could you could you expand that a little bit duncan
how does the libido of the individual UNK because freud certainly thinks it does
some form of identity group demands of the group
that's certainly true
sorry
go on
isn't it that the unconscious and the ego comes through
yes
right that tends to happen too
so you're
so we expect the libido if anything to be erm to be more evident in a group
what kind of libido are we talking about
because here i think we see one of the chief reasons why freud adopted the term libido and why when we talked about libido through last term i said we would see that there were some very good reasons in freud's erm application of his ideas to society for having this libido and that now we've come to it what kind of libido are dean and duncan talking about
because i think we have to make UNK here between different types of libido
what kind of libido duncan is involved in the kind of thing we're talking about
well it's to do with ego ideal
what kind of libido would you think would be involved with the ego ideal
well er wouldn't it be UNK
the idea of love directed towards one's own self is specifically towards one's own ego
you will recall that when we talked about the libido theory i said that there were erm different one of the reasons why freud had to introduce the libido theory was he wanted to get away from the narrow biological reproductive concept of sex to do with UNK and reproduction which is of course he'd want to expand it to include psychological never seen before er or never seen before so clearly such as erm love of the self and this he gave the name UNK well he didn't actually somebody else invented it not long before and he took it over very quickly
er UNK and UNK libido is that part of libido which is concerned with the ego and it is this aspect of the libido especially which is involved in a group because as i think erm somebody said over here when developing this point this leads to for example a group UNK
what do i mean by group UNK
that's right
that's right
i mean erm you know erm when i go to the london group erm we all know that erm actually er there's a kind of there's an inner feeling you know well we've got the right computers we we're the you know we believe computing and we we're very sorry you know we're erm we may not actively UNK them but we we're sorry that they have to bother with such an awful operating system and everything else
so there's a kind of feeling and this happens in all groups doesn't it that a group to which one's
which one identifies there's a kind of feeling erm you know we're the members and there's something special about us and er at the best we're sorry for the non members we'd like to have more of them and so we might UNK and UNK the gospel you know you know throw away your UNK become or in the worst possible way we might be an exclusive group and say we are we are erm special we are we know the truth and everybody else is UNK and you know they should be killed or driven out or in some ways UNK against because they're wrong and we're right
because we're right we're we we're better people as a result so th there's a tendency just as in individuals can get proud and even arrogant and self satisfied so does the tendency for groups to get proud arrogant and self satisfied because and what UNK this group erm feeling is UNK
it's not the heterosexual strand of the libido because there of course there is a problem
as far as heterosexual object libido is concerned three is a crowd and two is ideal
two's company UNK a crowd but when you're talking about this UNK and more UNK libido to do with ego then of course three is not a crowd in fact three erm is er is the is er just as easy to accommodate as three thousand or three million because it's it can be UNK into the group
however how does that come about i mean if supposing you were a member of a very large group like the catholic church getting on to a billion people say well you can't possibly identify with a billion other people you can't meet them in one lifetime let alone ties with them so how does how does UNK libido UNK the members of vast groups like the catholic church
how does it actually come about because you couldn't meet the majority of
in a lifetime
everyone can
right
shared value
the as you both say the UNK libido of the individual is concerned initially with their own ego
the group usually has a leader or symbols which represent its aspirations like the statue of the virgin mary or golden churches or something to which act as representatives or UNK for the aspirations the ideals of the individual's ego and every member of the group shares those that leader or those UNK or those ideals and consequently the group is UNK by a kind of UNK flow of individual UNK libido towards the centre towards the leader and that makes them more UNK with each other
so that the erm we really are again and this is what this diagram in freud's book is supposed to illustrate that the erm every individual ego has its own ego ideal and objects external objects like erm say the UNK can become the focus of this erm UNK libido because every individual identifies the UNK with their own ego ideal
so every catholic feels an identification with every other catholic because they've got a considerable aerial overlap in their in their ego ideals and er UNK libido is directed towards the central focus
so it's not as it it's erm UNK spread everywhere in the first place it's directed first at the focus and then when you meet another person whom you realize has the same ego ideal then you identify them with them by a kind of secondary erm secondary identification
what about
well
well his parents i mean the extreme UNK are on the rise i mean in south america you know i mean the world's largest UNK churches are in UNK and UNK and millions are now becoming erm born again christians in south america
erm so erm but of course i mean t to make the point because it doesn't really UNK what you're saying heather because of course the rather more extreme kinds of UNK that do emphasise for example erm er narrow UNK teaching much more so you could say that erm and i think this would perhaps be the answer to UNK point to some extent because it goes back to UNK original point that erm here we're we we're talking about a general theory of groups but of course some groups can be more UNK than others
some groups can be more UNK where the individual identifies less strongly there are fewer UNK there's less erm UNK er certainty about doctrine and so on so more room for an individual variation and those groups will be relatively er UNK and there would be less identification of the individual with the leader or the leading UNK
other groups however possibly smaller ones or more erm or more er or ones that are kind of more fired up with er wi with feelings of group membership you find the opposite you find stronger UNK more emphasis on leaders and consequently followers
so what we're talking we're not saying you know there are groups and there're individuals and there's a gap in between what we're saying is there's a kind of UNK from very UNK groups where the individual is practically UNK by the by the group to erm more or less complete UNK where individuals belong to emotional groups that are very weak and where identification with the with the UNK is pretty minimal
erm you know like for instance i mean erm i mean i suppose i feel british but i mean i don't feel i have any very strong identification with other british people because there are so many other people in the world speak english and erm often people from other countries who in many ways you identify with them more
so but still i suppose i have some residual identification with my own ethnic national group
it's not one that will UNK me with erm with great kind of UNK as might have happened in the past when you look at UNK movements so erm presumably we're looking at a range of behaviour which goes from extreme UNK group membership to relatively weak identification with a group but really doesn't to anything else but saying you know if you ask me what i'll say i was british
well that doesn't mean very much
does that answer your question
so we know we should and remember of course that in the book freud chooses two examples as joy told me the church and the army and these are just examples and of course freud chooses them partly because they're very big groups so they in some ways they er UNK the principles he's talking about because clearly in a small group like this you could say well look what is going on is really i mean we all have we all know each other and it's a face to face group and really what happens here is an of the dynamics group and i think it is actually
for example one notices over many years of you know having teaching i must have taught hundreds now in different class groups can't help UNK that although you're the same subject is the same the syllabus is the same the reading list is the same the room is the same the time of day may be the same but the groups are completely different
some classes erm go with a buzz and everybody gets a lot out of it you think you know oh that was that was worthwhile we achieved something
other classes struggle all the time to get anything done you feel you know why are we having this class we're not making erm it's not making a lot of educational sense and one comes to the conclusion after many years of bitter experience that it personal dynamics it depends on who's in the group and some groups erm this one successful and some groups which i won't mention are relatively unsuccessful and one feels okay that's because of the inter personal it's who's in the group and how they UNK with each other and try as one might i suppose i play th the leading role in this group
try as one might one can't change the group but clearly these are not th the examples that freud chooses are really big groups where the kind of factors he's talking about comes through very clearly because y you cannot explain what happens in the catholic church or an army
so he chooses the examples he does to illustrate his theory and of course he's chosen inevitably good examples
well yes sorry perhaps i myself
i meant not in the same way
at the end of the day there must be something
oh i'm sure that's true
yes now what i meant was that erm in a group like this the th the leader or the leadership role may be relatively minimal and the UNK of the members may be relevant but i hope it was cos i think it's a mistake for class in groups and that so one would hope in this kind of group the individual variation would be so important that these kind of group UNK that freud is talking about in this book but clearly in other groups they're more important partly because you can never organize a group by kind of having a meeting with everybody
i mean you couldn't have a meeting with the whole catholic church for example to decide on doctrine
so what happens of course in an institution like that is the leaders define the doctrine congregation for the doctrine of the faith lays down the doctrine of the faith and then the UNK are then obliged to believe it
the followers a are obliged to believe it and so the faith the creed of the catholic church then becomes an article of membership and if you don't UNK to the creed then this has implications for your standing in the group and you can for example be UNK and UNK not believing whereas in a group like this i don't think we need a creed we certainly wouldn't UNK anybody because we didn't believe a particular thing because we can all negotiate our personal relations face to face
do you see that's what i meant by it
yeah this is just
mm
oh it does oh it does yes
oh this is a very important book of course and one of the one of the astonishing things is the way totally ignored and if you look through even people who write about UNK and the social sciences and there's a lot of them this book is hardly ever mentioned and i normally nowadays UNK look for it in the in the references and index an and many books th that UNK to talk about groups and UNK is never mentioned i think and those that do don't ever seem to understand what it says
an astonishing fact
well look folks we'll have to stop now it's gone eleven and i have to give a lecture joy er that was an excellent er summary well done
as i said i'll be talking about this in the next couple of weeks in the lectures and i hope to cover various things we didn't have time to touch on
next week we're being UNK by heather
now
oh first thing is last week's summary
let me pass that round
just pass that round that's last week's summary
today's lecture is on erm what you might call female interest in sex and in particular in the concept of erm female choice and i was struck er this morning by looking at nature
nature of course as you know is the world's leading science journal and er i have to read nature every week
the reason why of course and i take this as a matter of pride because er not only am i think probably the only member of the l s e as published in nature recently but erm er the other thing i take pride in is the fact that erm one really can't ignore it because all the time stuff is being published in the world's leading science journal which is directly relevant to this course and how many other courses are in l s e are like that
for example a couple of weeks ago there was a thing on UNK for UNK and this week there's a fascinating thing on UNK and female sexuality which erm UNK er some of the points i'll be i'll be making and although as sue rightly says erm most of the articles in nature are rather technical and difficult to understand if you're not a specialist they do make concessions to the rest of us by publishing very often erm UNK er in the first part of the journal erm and there is one on this and er i can recommend that
in fact i'll UNK it and pass it round if people are interested
i also find
yeah
yeah
alright i borrowed this one from the senior common room
but it is in the library it's in the library erm every week so m my you know you can get it down the down the library
oh no i wouldn't i wouldn't recommend anything to
i mean it's far too technical an and i wouldn't either but erm it's er as i said it's just er it was struck me as UNK since i was talking about this today
okay now you remember i said that the key concept in our modern understanding of sex and sexual behaviour
one of the virtues of parental investment er theory i would say is that er it's particularly sensitive to female interests in sexuality and nobody who knows me or has read er my works would could possibly suspect me here of fashionable feminist prejudices er so i don't say this because i think this is what people like to hear but because i happen to think it's true i'm afraid i'm one of these old fashioned and you may think stupid people who believe that you should er say things cos you think they're true not because you think er it's what you think want w want to hear or if you say it you'll be accused of sexual harassment by a lecturer as i was last year
erm the UNK to the UNK to say things which i did think were true but i knew were true because many of them were facts
erm the reason why parental investment theory is particularly sensitive to the female point of view of course is as we've seen one of the fundamental consequence of UNK is the fact that females normally invest more in offspring than do males whereas males concentrate on mating success normally females normally concentrate on erm parental in individual offspring
so the divorce of sex from reproduction which is erm a very common and even fashionable view in the later twentieth century and of course is one very much UNK by modern birth control technology and things like that this divorce of sex and reproduction is in a way you could say a UNK male way of looking at things if the UNK er contribution to offspring doesn't go much further than the initial UNK
for males sex may be very important but for females reproduction may be may be more significant if it involves as it does in the case of all UNK and certainly human beings considerable parental investment on the part of the mother
so i think that er to put parental investment theory centre stage is more reliable and better than the rather old fashioned biological approach which in talking about sex emphasise things like sex UNK and UNK so that a sex UNK in a UNK for instance was something that a male had but a female didn't and this gave rise to UNK effects like those of UNK erm which are thought to be very important
well these things may er describe erm sexual behaviour and how to UNK it but they can't explain it and nor are they really fundamental because after all okay in UNK males may be the sex defined by the x UNK but in birds it's the other way round in birds it's the female UNK and all in other words all bird UNK start out as male and differentiate into females if they're going to whereas in UNK all UNK start out as female and differentiate into males in so far as those terms have any sense
so it seems to me that parental investment erm theory is much better because not only is it UNK applicable it also explains why the sexes a are the way they are in ultimate UNK terms and that talk about UNK and sex UNK never can do
now if we took this view about parental investment theory it would immediately erm concentrate our attention if we're talking about human beings as we are in this course on er one critical factor which er is UNK important and that is er body fat
now you may say well why does body fat matter er for female reproductive success and the answer to that if you think about it is pretty easy
a female UNK is if you like erm the egg in other classes of higher animals a female lays an egg the egg contains all the nutrients or possibly UNK
in the case of a UNK the egg is retained within the body so the mother's body is effectively another part of the egg providing it through the UNK with nutrients and so on
so the state of the mother's body is critical for the reproductive success of any UNK egg
this probably explains why UNK the age of which er UNK begins UNK er why the age of UNK has dropped progressively in the last century from about fifteen and a half to about twelve and a half er today
the reason appearing to be that UNK is weight UNK and in particular is turned on by er body weight reaching erm a certain proportion i think it's about eighteen percent of weight erm represented by body fat UNK
there is some evidence
sorry twenty four percent twenty four percent body weight erm about a quarter in other words when a young woman's body is about one quarter fat she can start UNK for obvious reasons
there is some residual evidence that daylight length may be a factor and that the UNK of electric light has also UNK the age of UNK but this effect is not erm absolutely clear and there's some controversy about it
most people think if it if it's if it's real at all it's er it's much less important than weight
of course few quantitative studies have been done of this but those that we have show pretty UNK results
a study of the UNK hunter UNK in UNK show that a woman's body weight was erm directly related to her reproductive success as was her age of UNK in other words the younger the younger UNK and the heavier the woman the greater her lifetime reproductive success and this again er shouldn't surprise us
another one of the most er interesting bits of evidence about this is the rate of UNK
now as you know there are two types of twins tha that people can have
you can have UNK twins in which case the UNK is a half and the twins although they were born together result from two UNK separate eggs they were separately UNK
so in other words they were just like any other sibling just happens to be they were erm conceived at the same time and er developed in the womb together
identical twins have UNK r equals one genetic identical every gene in one is represented in the other and they result from a split in a UNK egg which splits into two and then each UNK as if it were wer were a separate egg
now the rate of identical UNK erm is remarkably constant which suggests that it whatever causes it is relatively independent of other factors
perhaps it's erm some kind of mistake in the way erm cells divide after they've been UNK i don't know but this is not true of UNK
studies in europe for instance show that er in populations which experienced UNK during world war two such as the UNK the rate of UNK dropped dramatically during the war but then recovered to its pre war level after the war and this strongly suggests that the rate of UNK was related to how much food women were eating and when they were UNK they were less likely to two eggs than when they were fell fed
this is an affect well known in some UNK animals like sheep it's well known that if sheep are if UNK are well fed just before they mate they're much more likely to er to twin than if they're er not given extra food supplement and nowadays erm farmers wh who breed sheep for UNK er frequently feed UNK a special diet just before er conception for that very reason the rate of UNK increases
so this again is quite interesting evidence for er for the importance of body fat for female reproductive success
another interesting erm angle on this is anorexia UNK
anorexia is a relatively modern illness er the first descriptions of it are found in the nineteenth century and today it's er by no means an UNK illness in er mainly in young women very occasionally in men but er y it's more or less safe to say it's er it's a disease of er women and almost always younger women
it's hardly ever reported in the third world and er taking the facts that we've just been talking about into account it would be UNK to see anorexia as related to conflicts about the beginning of a young woman's reproductive life because what normally happens is and has certainly happened in the only case of this that occurred in my family the young woman in question lost so much weight that she stopped cycling and in fact erm UNK changes went into reverse she actually UNK she started UNK and er she had this anorexia problem and she stopped cycling and all her body changes reversed she went back to pre UNK again erm because of oh no oh no it didn't she lost her body hair and stuff yeah er her UNK changes
mind you she was starving herself to the point of UNK her life and had to be UNK but er oh no her UNK her UNK well her UNK changes went into reverse they absolutely did
erm so it's UNK to see er anorexia as part of this whole picture because it usually happens in younger women usually at the beginning of their reproductive careers and there is usually or so UNK report conflict usually with parents related to things like career er possible choice of marriage partner which erm create conflict about the young about the young woman's er future reproductive life
so it would be erm it would seem natural to think that anorexia fits into this picture somewhere
admittedly the details may be complicated but erm it certainly seems that these our knowledge about fat and reproductive success may erm throw some light on this
in other words fat issue it's probably an issue
now erm all this really goes back to eighteen seventy one
as we know er darwin published his great work in eighteen fifty nine cos he had to he really didn't want to but was forced but in eighteen seventy one he published another important book called the UNK of man or evolution in relation to sex and in this book darwin established a principle which a which at the time he was widely criticized and UNK and this was the principle of female choice
essentially what darwin realized was that sexual UNK particularly where it makes the male UNK different from female is not always the outcome of inter male conflict very often it is we saw examples of the films of UNK of erm elephant seals those kinds of animals where the UNK differences appear to be the result of inter male conflict for instance elephant seals are seven times heavier the males are seven times heavier than the females on average because sheer weight is what wins those astonishing battles they have on the UNK when they kind of UNK at each other
they have these enormous UNK teeth again UNK each other and the thick UNK round the neck again as a defence and if the UNK go in they go into the UNK and not to arteries and stuff like that
so a modern sexual UNK is UNK in terms of erm inter male er conflict and it may be in the case of human beings er most of them are for example the larger body weight of males that we saw when we looked at sexual UNK in human beings is probably UNK erm in terms of inter male conflict like it is in UNK
er my guess is that UNK may be the same
i don't know what you think about this but what occurs to me is this supposing you had to kill somebody with your bare hands how would you do it suggestion
you gotta kill me
the obvious thing is to UNK okay
erm we haven't got anybody here with a UNK so we can't demonstrate and anyway it would be a dangerous experiment if we did but supposing you tried to UNK me and i've got a big UNK you know a kind of UNK marx style UNK well a big UNK er you get your hands round my neck and what can i do
i can do that and if i pull my UNK i'm gonna UNK your grip
so my suggestion and this is only a suggestion the UNK which in the past have been interpreted as a kind of erm UNK signal in other words a kind of erm sign on the face of the male as they're UNK my guess is that th that UNK may actually have evolved to protect the throat because erm the critical thing in killing somebody is to block the UNK and that's and in fact even UNK do this you saw in the film when a lion kills an UNK or something he doesn't go to all the trouble of making horrible UNK he UNK the UNK and holds on until the UNK or whatever it is just er
most UNK do
it
yeah
yeah
well perhaps they do that too
perhaps they do that too unless the
UNK go each side of the when they squeeze the UNK
anyway of course actually while you mention UNK teeth sue it's worth pointing out that UNK teeth are usually for use on other males
er it's true that hunting animals like for instance er female cats the cat family UNK and we know UNK do most of the hunting not the males that do the hunting normally they have UNK teeth
however the males have got bigger UNK teeth and certainly in most UNK er for instance horses males have big bigger UNK teeth most UNK
UNK for instance have enormous UNK teeth but the males have them and not the females so the idea here is that normally a big UNK tooth a sexually UNK tooth is probably related to inter male conflict rather than to killing and whether how that affects your er what you say about the UNK i'm not sure but certainly it would be a safe erm UNK to say normally big UNK are an aspect of sexual UNK and in UNK are very common
so what was i saying
oh yes erm perhaps UNK are more to do wi with inter male conflict than anything er and most of the other characteristics are
erm the one element in human sexual UNK if you can call it that strictly speaking it isn't its primary sex difference is the size of the human UNK
nobody knows why it's er it's as big as it is female choice is a possibility only a possibility but er it's hard to know otherwise why it is that way
erm now it it's interesting to point out that female choice and of course one of the best examples of that is birds where the female chooses not you saw it on the film but this is just a reminder
where the female chooses not so much the male as what the UNK got is erm female choice as i said when darwin suggested was widely UNK partly because i it UNK victorian prejudices
people said things like for instance well females aren't intelligent enough to make choices and er which is which is clearly pretty silly and er there was also i think and the uncomfortable erm prospect that females could in some way or another control the evolution in males which i don't think it UNK to the UNK either and in fact many social UNK like edward UNK for example rejected the whole concept of sexual selection as darwin called it the female choice because it didn't promote survival of the fittest
erm UNK tails may make them beautiful and more UNK successful with UNK but they don't make them fitter in terms of erm life expectancy
on the contrary UNK don't live long in the wild because of those enormous tails make them easy to catch for UNK
so if UNK er fitness as understood by social UNK is reduced but erm and this was one of the reasons why they why they liked the idea of erm female choice and er the call so called sexual selection
the consequence of course you want to say something
no they don't UNK them when a when a UNK comes along they just run or fly if they can
sometimes there are displays that are erm b but like erm the UNK that have UNK but i think you find them in both sexes because you see if it's to scare off a UNK why doesn't the female have them
and my guess is the UNK normally would
i don't know about the UNK
er
oh yes you get that you get that kind of UNK but again you'd expect it in both sexes i should think unless it just happens that males for example normally are bigger and then it's taken on a secondary characteristic which is a possibility
i honestly don't know the answer to that
okay erm so the consequence of this and as i said this is not fashionable feminism this is this is this is real science
that the consequence of this is that we can no longer take the view of females as being passive victims of male advances
often it looks as if they are erm but they don't need to be
here's a here's an example of this in book
this is a UNK
now you might think well UNK have UNK groups and they've got these enormous UNK and they could bully and er i mean a UNK group looks kind of fascist kind of social structure you know when a male UNK female but in fact field observations of how UNK actually deal with their females show that they're very tender erm towards them and they have to have the cooperation of the female in order to mount
in fact if you think about it erm any UNK or UNK can easily stop a male mounting
you don't often see photos of this i've only ever found one here's one or i did find one
this is un the top the top one well and the bottom one unsuccessful mounting attempts by male UNK sorry UNK male UNK on a female
the female erm just doesn't want to know
in fact this is more interesting than you may think because female UNK have a UNK they have they have a UNK and a UNK reasons which aren't fully understood and in order to mate the male has to insert his real UNK into the female UNK in order to reach her UNK and it's a bit complicated
so if the female doesn't want it and this one clearly doesn't she just sits down and if she sits on her UNK there's no way the male is ever gonna get into her but in fact this is true er in general terms of er if you think about it a female UNK i mean it looks like male UNK the male UNK and it looks as if she has to submit but she doesn't
all she has to do is to walk away he can't walk cos his fore legs are on her back legs are on the ground
if she moves forward there's no way that he's gonna get anywhere with her
i remember making this point a couple of years ago yeah i made this point last year and i showed these pictures i spent about twenty minutes on it the following week i was i was UNK accused and it was a UNK it was a serious UNK erm er that i that i said that females always had to submit erm i was very angry about that
pity it wasn't in the national newspapers because my lawyer said i could have retired on the proceeds
laugh unfortunately you can't erm can't erm when i was giving this similar lecture two or three years ago erm there was er a student in the class she put up her hand she said yes she said that's absolutely right she said what you're saying about the female doesn't have to submit she said i used to work as a as a stable maid at newmarket at a stud farm and she said er you've gotta have five people for er to cover a UNK
you have one on each leg erm and one erm on the UNK and apparently they use special tools that er UNK the UNK and stop her moving so she hasn't got any choice and when they lead the UNK in they got these five guys there erm with these various tools and they make hold the UNK still to make sure the UNK can mount because apparently very often the mares won't have it and th they kick or they walk away
yeah but remember that these are expensive race horses you see this is er
yeah
but you see the point i'm making that in UNK it's easy to get the impression that you know er particularly in er UNK type UNK like erm UNK that the males mount and females submit they don't
not only of course u unfortunately of course and sue mentions there are tragic exceptions to this and one tragic exception i is human beings because unfortunately it is possible for a male human being to force er a female at UNK because we tend to do it lying down and males are bigger and stronger
and hands er i don't think rape could happen if we were UNK much more difficult
erm so quite apart from fro from that this approach to the whole question concentrating on parental investment and female choice would not only make us sensitive to female choice in the sense of either UNK to a male or not but secondly it would make us er wonder what happened even after a female had UNK and we could predict couldn't we that females ought to be UNK about the subsequent fate of any UNK erm UNK and indeed there's plenty of evidence to show that human females highly UNK and far from passive even after they've been UNK
for example in er twenty five erm percent of cases er of UNK in women as reported by UNK there's an UNK reaction to sperm
in other words a woman's immune system is er able to UNK erm er antibodies against a against sperm
in ten to fifteen percent of UNK there will be no UNK and er forty two percent that do UNK will fail to cycle and will be re absorbed again
so it's a very high proportion we're talking about
er in other words what i'm saying is that erm a woman doesn't have to accept a UNK er egg once it's been UNK
er twenty eight percent for instance of all UNK er will be UNK and in england and wales mothers of large families which i think was defined as more than six children er had more spontaneous abortions than others
in sixty percent of spontaneous abortions the UNK are normal and thirty percent in the first UNK show gross UNK
in other words it looks as if mothers erm actively discriminate against er UNK which are not normal and are not gonna develop into in into er offspring who will survive
yeah oh yes but the point is that the mother knows it's she's not her reproductive system is not a passive erm i mean you see how it looks in
yes exactly look exactly
i in a UNK it looks as if that the mother's body i is an oven and once you've put the UNK in it's gonna rise it's not like that
the point i'm making is that in fact erm a woman's reproductive system UNK actively
one of the most astonishing pieces of evidence for this comes from a study of two hundred and sixty eight female prisoners in the u s these are all convicted criminals
they had three hundred and seventy three live children between them and on average they should of had twenty seven children with birth UNK if they'd been the same as the rest of the population the non criminal non prison erm non prison population
in fact they had none at all
however their entire spontaneous UNK
so the implication of that study and it's a rather astonishing one although it fits exactly with the argument we're developing is that because these women were living in very difficult circumstances in prison they were even more UNK about the offspring they were actually and they didn't carry a single one to term that had a birth UNK
so the idea is that the more difficult the situation the mother finds herself is in the more likely she is to UNK and the more likely any retained er UNK is to be normal an and to and not to have any UNK
another example of that for instance and this is something we'll have to wait a full explanation of this we'll have to wait a little bit later itself
at least seventy three percent of all UNK in the first UNK are male
this suggests that er mothers discriminate against male offspring
seventy three percent
seventy three percent in the first UNK in other words the first three months are male
now er let's just accept that as a fact as we go by erm it looks as if mothers not only discriminate against un UNK offspring but also against males
why they discriminate against males must wait
where do you get the
no oh in the general population
in the general
this is the general population and as you will see this er patches on the whole issue of sex ratios and what is known as the trivers UNK effect and i'll explain that later cos it's so important
we have a separate thing on sex ratios and i'll explain why males are UNK against in this in this respect cos as we'll see there's a profound er reason why er this should happen
finally and this is a suggestion on my own although actually i discovered afterwards it was also made by somebody else erm but it does seem in many ways er erm an obvious interpretation is this could be the background also to post UNK depression
post UNK depression is a UNK phenomenon where women who have just given birth feel fed up UNK don't like the baby don't want to be mothers can't really take an interest in it
it's a very UNK erm syndrome for many women and er there's quite a lot of evidence that it's UNK linked and most women suffer from it in one way or another
some admittedly have it much worse than others but nearly all women er seem to seem to have it erm to some extent and one wonders why
well the UNK city UNK if you will recall some years ago buried a maternity hospital on the day of the UNK
all the mothers died at once
however fourteen days later they were still pulling out er live babies and they'd been in there in the UNK for fourteen days
they had nothing to drink nothing to eat they kind of UNK and apparently they UNK into a state of a kind of UNK and UNK but they were still alive and they were alive when they when they were pulled out fourteen days later
the reason probably is that human UNK the UNK human beings have much more UNK fat than any other UNK
if you look at a new born UNK or UNK they seem skinny little things compared with human babies
human babies are usually fairly UNK when they're born they've got considerable UNK fat
my suggestion is that the evolution of UNK fat in UNK and post UNK depression is an example of co evolution and what has happened is mothers are UNK to be depressed for the first few days after birth because in primal conditions when remember this is where evolution set the parameters of human behaviour in primal conditions it would probably pay a mother to test her new born offspring to see if it could survive because if it was UNK or if it was UNK or if there was some reason why that baby couldn't make it to UNK and its own reproductive life that mother should not invest in it because that's her reproductive success
so it might pay a mother to wait for a few days and see what happened to the baby
a healthy baby might survive and UNK one might not
sue you're sceptical
i'm a bit worried about that ninety percent
i see
yes
yes i heard that i've heard that theory
my
but it does happen in that way
yeah it does happen in that way
m my m my explanation of that though is that it's true i it could just be a UNK side effect
it could just be that and of course it would be very naive to assume that evolution had UNK us always to be happy with everything
in fact if you think about it evolution might promote your reproductive success by making you vaguely unhappy most of the time cos that might make you UNK for more success
so it would certainly be naive to think that whenever people felt unhappy erm it was er was some kind of UNK and that evolution couldn't explain it and it may just be that the women feel a bit fed up because of UNK changes and it doesn't awfully much it's just one of things you pay for being a mother
well not immediately no
and it's and it's certainly UNK linked
and at first of course a woman doesn't have milk she has UNK
yes not very much
but you see my explanation may be that because of that erm the UNK of post UNK depression is slightly UNK because erm the mother needs a signal from the baby or in her UNK signal that will then start changes in her breast tissue which will produce milk when the time comes
so she needs the baby to do that and at that point once her milk production schedule is under way as it were at that point when just before she's about to start giving them then she should test the baby because that's the big UNK cost to her
the UNK cost is providing milk
she can have the UNK anyway
yeah oh yes
sure oh i can imagine
well it's just an idea
yeah
it's just an idea i it may not be right
nobody's
i mean it may not be right but it i mean as i think you can see it has a kind of logic about it erm and i it may be that it it's not the right explanation but the very fact that erm we're suggesting it i think shows that erm again it's naive to think that UNK is a kind of er is a one sided affair where you know mothers sacrifice themselves er for their offspring because nature demands it
at the very least this theory about post UNK shows it's not that simple the mother has a self interest as well as the offspring and our modern insight into parental investment theory shows us that we have to take every individual's self interest seriously we're not committing th the crude errors of group UNK and saying you know mothers exist for the benefit of society to have children they should put up with it
i mean the trouble with group UNK thinking is you completely discount the costs that some people pay for the benefits of others and so oh well you know everybody benefits from mothers erm having children and UNK themselves to their offspring
our modern parental investment UNK view wouldn't allow you to make that error instead you'd say you know you've gotta look at the costs and benefits of the mother too and perhaps there are benefits to mothers in actively testing as it were their offspring erm rather than just UNK er accepting that they're gonna have to be mothers and gonna have to get on with it and again you see er i would er and this may have been the big mistake i made last year er but again i stand by my er view on this and it's a perfectly UNK one erm again i think those who say that abortion is unnatural and kind of erm UNK against er you know nature are wrong
i mean that the data on spontaneous abortion is so UNK that it seems to me that artificially UNK abortions are just a continuation with modern technology of something women have always done anyway discriminate against their ab about their offspring sometimes UNK against them
so those who say UNK artificial abortion is unnatural are i think er on a on UNK on very thin ice because you could equally well argue that it was just a continuation of a natural trend
if this doesn't happen it's almost like it's never happened any other way
yeah that's right yeah
yes
yes but you see the yes an and that of course is a is i is a good one
as i said at the beginning i think one should be wary about using the word natural because sometimes people use it you know to promote something you know like on advertising you know it's natural must be good for you but at the same time there are certain things that are natural that are very bad for you like death and if i were to say you know death is natural nobody would think i was advocating suicide of course not
well sorry i just mentioned that in passing but
yeah
well er in general i would say that erm and this goes back to my earlier discussion o of the pleasure principle
it would seem that erm i it wasn't in the interests of one's ultimate reproductive success to be too easily satisfied too much of the time because remember it's a question of relative reproductive success an and the individual that gets that little extra is effectively gonna be gonna be the one selected so yes i would think that erm it's probably naive to think that natural selection would make you feel er satisfied and content all the time it would probably UNK erm a state of mild UNK which is i think what most people actually experience in life
yes
then you're less likely
right
well possibly and less likely to enjoy it i mean i've made a complete failure of my life so i'm not and i never really enjoyed from the beginning i must say
well
if i'd been given the choice erm you know if they'd said you know okay you're next you going i'd have said no thanks send somebody else but er
well
well perhaps not erm no my life was all a terrible mistake erm
i it was because of the doctor was too stupid to UNK breast cancer when he saw it UNK my mother to have another baby told her it was a UNK erm er sorry erm
sorry UNK er and it would help if she had another baby and it was of course was actually cancer it was a disaster
but there we are thus on such er tiny UNK do entire lives hang
where did we get to before we got into this
er oh yes abortion yes now coming back to the point about abortion
one of the and this we'll get on to later when we talk about culture the culture problem
it seems to me you see that it's naive to think that there's a complete divorce between culture and technology like for instance abortion technology or birth control technology and nature
it seems to me what actually happens if you think about it is that is that technology and culture builds on trends that already have a natural foundation
for example birth control you see you could use the same argument you could say oh the UNK say birth control is unnatural and we know they have a whole position on that and yet the data on UNK shows that in fact most women generate antibodies to some sperm so the those UNK suggest that actively UNK against sperm on the part of the women is actually natural and all that is happening in modern birth control technology is that women are developing or building on a natural er foundation that is already there namely to be UNK about when they become pregnant and by whom
so and i would extend the same argument to abortion and i would say erm wh what happens in abortion admittedly erm an artificial abortion mean means that presumably a spontaneous abortion has hasn't happened but a modern woman is using extra means that she has er at her disposal probably to deal with extra problems which evolution originally could not UNK and ultimately her self interest might be just as well served by having er UNK the abortion ultimately as it would by erm by not having but i mean this is just my personal view and i don't
well
yes i think i think their view is dominated by the old group UNK or point that women are there to do their duty
yeah that females are there to do their deed for the species or the race or whatever an and er and indeed i mean not so long ago you know in our own country i mean
i think it's a moral issue
yeah oh it is a moral issue
yeah
but the link between sex and reproduction is always likely to be more critical to a woman so you see th the point i'm making is these UNK seem to me to be to have a kind of relevance to er women's experience of sex that is some ways greater than it is to male males can you know once they've done their UNK work they're really through as far as erm as far as biology is concerned not perhaps as far as social
were you gonna say something sue
oh i think so i mean i again i hope there aren't any UNK in the audience who are offended by my remarks but it's just my personal opinion that yeah th you know th that is the case and at the least i mean whatever judgment one makes about this thing i repeat what i said earlier about you gotta be terribly careful when using the word natural
i think it's UNK and subjective to use it in a term that carries any kind of recommendation or erm UNK and er i think i think one has to exercise caution in erm in the way you use tha that term perhaps it's better not to not to use it at all
well that makes a kind of convenient break actually because what i wanted to start on er then was things which really perhaps ought to be UNK till next
what i wanna talk about next week is some er UNK of human female erm UNK such as concealed UNK and UNK
just before we leave it er to come back to the nature it's quite interesting what these people found was they studied UNK in i think denmark and what they found was UNK but females can store UNK for months
they counted the number of the UNK and they found the females were UNK much more than they needed in order to have offspring so the big problem is why do female UNK go to all the trouble of extra UNK with extra males when they could easily just make do with one or two and store the UNK and er the consequence as you could have predicted i think having attended my lectures is that there does seem to be selection for erm sperm competition in male UNK and the UNK seems to be that females are openly UNK male sperm competition because they're mating with many more males than they need to and there doesn't seem to be another gain they don't get UNK from a male they all they get is sperm
the question is why
they enjoy sex
sorry what makes what more likely
sex
the female
yes
she's more likely to UNK
yes
some behaviour like that
yes it might but the authors don't mention it actually as a possibility
perhaps you ought to write in to nature
why females have UNK
mm
i mean if males have UNK why shouldn't
well that's next week's
yeah i agree with that i agree with that
that's the UNK theory we'll be talking about that
yes as you'll see i mean basically i think the erm the reason is they just need to hang on until the UNK finished but we'll
we'll come to that next week
okay then welcome to everyone and er hopefully a few minutes but if it does
yes i realise
god of power and love be with us during our meeting
look kindly on the tasks we have begun and assist us in our further undertakings
give us the wisdom through the help of the holy spirit to realize our aims as a UNK council to understand what is needed to find a means of achieving our end and to do so with UNK sensitivity for the feelings and opinions of our fellow UNK
guide us oh god with your love as we UNK the coming of your son and give us all grace to welcome him into our hearts as his mother welcomed him in bethlehem and we ask her help as we pray
UNK mary
jesus holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners
amen
thanks ever so much
is that anything important
well it was somebody who wanted to know if her treasurer man was here
and it was a young fellow who lives up lane so i felt quite comfortable in saying i didn't think they had any young fellas who lived in lane
i haven't received any apologies
i know is due to come
she said to me earlier today she was coming
who else is missing then
and yes
the minutes of the last meeting the twentieth the nineteenth of october which is quite a long time ago did anyone have any particular comments
there's no comments on the minutes
fine next item
just to get you into the mood perhaps is it possible to have a report back on the visit to
those who were down there
haven't come prepared with any notes
i did you'll have to forgive me i mean i think for the sake of those who were not at the meeting erm what we should really say is that actually said that he wanted to hear what kind of a parish we are so that he could attempt to match the incoming priest with you know the need of the parish
that was actually what he said and he did then go on to say that you know he is one of a group of people who i think they call themselves the appointments committee and that their job where appointments are concerned is crisis management
so i mean having said you know that he was interested to hear what kind of parish i mean it was it was obvious that it would also depend on who was available
that was the general feeling but he did he gave us about an hour and a half
you know we had a long time really just to kind of UNK out
erm we'd had a meeting prior to going so we had a fair idea of you know we kind of got together and shared some thoughts before we before we went
i don't know if anyone wants to put anything into the pool of things that points that we raised and er or a general feeling that they had after that meeting
did he have any questions about our parish or did he just listen to what information was being given
yes he certainly did ask questions about our parish
he did ask questions yes
what
can you remember anything
what was important in his mind that's the thing
mass attendance erm mentioned the hospital he asked me what the hospital was like you know whether it was acute or whatever erm
he noted there were the two schools
yes he asked about the schools in the parish as well and about the situation in and
and how it really fitted together if they fitted together
but he did say there was a possibility that and could in time be made into a parish of their own
did he have any comments on our erm constitution having seen it
he did he just can you just go through it with a fine UNK if you wanted it proved
he asked about parish organizations as well didn't he
yes erm
i think well that many questions
i mean we did most of the talking i think really
well he was
sounds like you
he wanted we had to tell him you know basically
and what he did was he wrote down quite a number of things
oh yes
i mean he had to once or twice correct the emphasis of what he was saying
but erm what
he did say that with the mass attendance at around about nine hundred that we would only get one priest
one priest yes
ideally we would have two but nine hundred practising one priest
but he said he was going to ask for two
yes
the other thing we were UNK over was the erm the exact wording of collaborative ministry and the things
whether it was on UNK it down and he said we would be happy about that
down yes and we said no we wouldn't
that would be incorrect
we wouldn't be happy i think was what we
did you ask him what the point of that was it a UNK
he said it was to prevent the priest being mixed up it was an opportunity to a new priest to come in and sort of if it had become he could establish groups
not all parish councils are
i was told that the last thing a parish priest coming in would want would be to take place before he
it would he did say any sensible priest wouldn't want them to stand out i think those were the words he used immediately anyway
but in some parishes it er had been useful for them to stand out because the parish council was made up of people who had grown old with parish UNK and er it was a chance to make a new start
particularly
i mean you do get parishes where the parish priest has been there for the last thirty years or something like that
he's had
feels like it
i think what he really wanted was an outline of the parish
what we were expecting and erm he wanted to know to a large extent how we felt about all the erm things that are going on in the parish
i think as much as anything he was testing our mood on whether or not whether we were going to be helpful or
really i mean i think i cos he'd obviously done no preparation at all really for the meeting
i doubt if he'd i mean if he'd looked at the constitution it was only a constitution it was oh yes that's their constitution
i mean he hadn't a clue what it what was written in it
no i mean he didn't know we were an elected body did he
that's pretty basic isn't it
and he kept saying things like well you will make them welcome won't you
he did actually he made a comment about receiving the parish magazine and that th you know his awareness that the parish had been kept fully aware of the erm situation with the
you know he was he was kind of very conscious of that erm you that the parish were aware and that we all understood the situation and he commented on the UNK of the which he said not all religious orders have been so generous in the past
erm but he also thought it was quite nice that they were and good that they were as generous or have been as generous as they have
can i make some comment about the meeting because something arise from that meeting which was in er important information for me namely that the UNK are anticipating that will remain to look after i gather
i mean i think that came through the meeting
i think they're probably grateful
could i just raise one quick issue which i was going to mention under any other business but i'd like to get it out of the way and that is er the departure
er if staying i'm trying to make arrangements for to stay locally and most likely will be leaving round about easter so when it comes to the departure it will be myself
i would be very grateful if the departure could be as low key
i actually i actually would request that at this stage very early on and quite seriously
but i think i think most UNK and certainly th everyone on the parish council are very aware of both my feelings and the and er clearly it will be important to mark it and i'm sure we would wish to work together in doing so
well we thought a nice service of UNK actually
thank you
very low key very low key
erm but i think you i mean i do actually seriously
yes alright
yes father
put that forward and to get it out of the way
is there anything else we need to say about the
one thing that he did make very clear at the end was that if we thought of other things that he should know about or it would be helpful for him to know about we should contact him so he's left it very open for us to have an ongoing contact which i thought
i felt on the whole it was quite positive
i mean obviously on the whole he can't guarantee what sort of priest we're going to get but the whole meeting was quite positive
do you feel it will be appropriate for to do a bit of a write up about that wh what can be said
yes
yes
yes
as a follow up to the statement that was made on the evening on the sunday evening when you gave your explanation when made the point about the visit for a weekend away or a day away and to involve the UNK
and the announcement that we were having that visit
actually did go in the newsletter so the parish were aware that
in the newsletter
we did ask him about you know what arrangements were normal in his UNK for er UNK
he said that it is er a matter between the incoming and outgoing UNK so
he also interestingly asked us if we'd have any objections to another religious order
quite what he wrote down at the end
because he said he wrote down something like you would be quite happy to have another religious order here which is not at all what had been said
what had been said was we would be open to the UNK i can't remember now the exact words he used but
we wouldn't object
we wouldn't object yes it was very you know the emphasis was very different and just as the you know the emphasis on the UNK erm he wrote down that we would be happy to stand down and in fact what we said was we
we would be prepared to
we would like to continue and be prepared to serve and help the new parish priest
however we recognized you know that stand down
well we didn't quite say that but we don't really want to
in order of to help him out
mhm he did actually say that he thought it was highly unlikely
unlikely yes
but of course when religious orders come in they usually want to be in the inner city and wouldn't exactly qualify
we will serve the UNK and man in power as much as possible can if possible
is who would er who would write that was it you yourself would you be happy to try and draft something
it might be quite a difficult thing to draft
it is
er because clearly there are some points you wouldn't want to be too specific about
don't know if we could hold them to it
on the other hand the point for example that one priest is a very distinct possibility is something which could be expressed in some way i would have thought
what about
i think it's quite er a possibility or probability that he will stay
erm actually that was mentioned at the open meeting wasn't it
this will go in the parish magazine will it
yes
and the bishop sees the parish magazine
yes
so therefore it will give you the opportunity of destroying the
well if i draft something and then let look at it cos she made notes
yes
yes it was we did stress that
i'm trying to think of a or two you see
mhm
or more
can we then turn to the er reflection item with feedback on day
i didn't see this as being primarily er a reflection on the day as such although they haven't actually had the opportunity to sort of UNK it over
and i think such an opportunity might be helpful to actually UNK it over
but i have a feeling it might be easier to UNK it over at the next meeting
don't know whether people might be in agreement with that
it's not a very UNK it over evening is it with this
but the longer we leave it the harder it will be to
erm can we not just UNK some thoughts
yes
around about it like whether we liked it or not whether he was it was a good thing to have had it we should have been better not to have had it with the situation at the time you know that kind of UNK over might be
i think it helped us to get to know her apart from anything else
i think it helped us to get to know one another better
i know a lot of us have done terms for a long term but to be together closely and observe each other reacting and doing things it gives a better idea of how people think being in this together
yes
yes i have to say i enjoyed it far more than i expected
i actually enjoyed it
i found it er UNK in a way
the only thing that i did find was that the getting to grips with the issues er th was certainly as difficult possibly more difficult than i realized
erm i felt very much that er without 's very UNK erm UNK of the last session that it would have been it could have been yes very i mean a very UNK day
i actually do think what we've got down in the third session is an enormous help from the point of view of our future review
but er that was that was very much er UNK at things that might have been at the last moment
i certainly enjoyed it
and so did i
there was certainly a lot of pressure during the day
yes
well we had to discuss on the way home in the car that it would be better to have parish council meetings during the day rather than the evening
because we were so much more awake and alert i certainly was
you all seem to be very alert in the evening
i don't know not always
it helped not having the UNK
i think it's louder do you agree
but not a lot
well they've UNK the room we can turn it up now
UNK in the UNK
take the fuse out so we can't hear it
absolutely
does anyone would anyone offer a more critical appraisal of the day
i think we were a bit UNK really
i think th the difficulty with that kind of day is that unless you've decided what the UNK going to be before you start you're not actually going together are you
you know so i mean in a way it's more for a new parish council coming together erm you know perhaps one of the most important things we have to learn is that it's it is difficult to be very specific because you know we're not an action committee
we are we are about trying u understanding each other trying to understand the parish understand what the parish is looking for
erm and if we decide that we're going to just kind of as a result of a day like that do three things or something like that you know erm i'm not sure that that's helpful but
no i think maybe
we should maybe have concentrated on getting to know each other and another time try to focus on things perhaps i don't know i just
i think the whole field is quite complex when you UNK on it
i think there's a danger if we keep surveying a wide range over a long term you end up by not moving forward very quickly in a particular direction
now i know it is sometimes bad to be very narrow in your outlook but i think it was a good idea to focus on we consider as a pretty high priority and make as much progress as we can without forgetting other things and try and teach ourselves to do something within a fairly short space of time
is that not a
because when you do that then that encourages you to oh yes well we can you know that went quite well but we ought to have done that and that and then you immediately you you're UNK to do other things and people get used to splitting up and tackling things in a focused way
you were making a good point there
that is what happens in sub committees isn't it
we get down to the UNK there really
well that's yes and to some extent i think even the general meeting has to be fairly focused
i mean i personally think that we've that with that third session looking at things certain topics have come out
yes
that we need to focus on so we've highlighted what to move forward on those issues
yes
some of them are already UNK there
like which
well we've also already had a report to the magazine
yes
is this an appropriate time to erm
it might be yes
yes okay
because i i've received a letter erm from a UNK if i can find it er which i have UNK for everyone which i think was a direct response to the fact that there was something in the magazine and perhaps a direct response to other meetings and to a general feeling as well
erm because it might it might be helpful you know to see how
sorry
that's not our parish
that's
is this the only response we've had to that article
it's the only response i know of yes i don't know had anybody heard
has anybody had a
there are general sort of comments that they don't really know what the parish council does and they're not very sure erm sort of it was mainly through the children's card thing perhaps a little bit of money that their child you know didn't me meet any recognition but wouldn't it have been nice to know exactly what the picture had been for and sort of the UNK doesn't necessarily get UNK through
you know we're not direct enough in what we say is actually happening with parish council money
again this is it depends on the sort of person doesn't it
the sort of person who's ready to pick UNK or the sort of person who's what
i think erm it does tie in erm er what you've just said with one of the points that made at the p c day that the p c now has no UNK organizations or parish organizations
i mean there are parish organizations represented here but not a very large number
but not official
but they're not the representatives and this does have some bearing i think on er remark with regard to erm where does the parish council p c actually fit in
one of the areas erm that i think we specifically try to UNK on are is actually in the gaps
we've said well let's not look at the parish organizations specifically because those are covering areas that we don't need to look at
we're trying to look to the gaps and i wonder if we are as you suggest in the comments that you've received perhaps losing we're not perhaps sufficiently direct in addressing the parish organizations which are after all the core of a parish
i mean those if the members of the parish organizations are going to read what's in the parish magazine with the greatest interest
the point of the change in our constitution was actually to er move strictly away from all parish organizations having a right to representative here and just a small number have elected
i mean we consciously have moved the constitution away from
basically because it's felt that the parish council shouldn't be UNK with those organizations that is their operation
yes
erm and the direction of the parish council should be more in terms of defining strategy and so on
i'm a bit worried at some of what is saying here erm which seems to me like wanting to er create bureaucratic structure within a parish that charts UNK of everyone and they should know therefore i just don't think is that's my personal view i don't think it's the right approach at all to a parish
yes you've got to have a certain degree of structure in it and that happens i think through the parish council in a number of the key areas but you have got to retain a degree of flexibility otherwise you will just UNK initiative you'll UNK growing issues that happen
i mean in the parish over the erm what five to ten years the things that have grown are in their own the various other support groups and so on
now i'm not necessarily thinking that would've happened if the parish council said we will set up a group
yes
to do it don't necessarily think that type of event happens
yes i i'd agree
i wonder if we should have that poster on sort of permanent display there to show the links that p c have with different organizations and also the sub committees that people have brought in because actually the c w l congress is a bit odd as is actually on the sub committee and i on the p c day you know actually said that the people at the had asked you what goes on at
they did ask me if they but erm i can im i can't imagine that hasn't told th the of the c w l has she
no
well it doesn't sort of UNK on the sunday school or isn't likely to
cos she's very much involved in it and er it is a good system
i used it in germany
does it matter if they're not erm if they don't know of each other 's existence
presumably if people can't get to sunday school you would hear about it and do something about it
no to be honest i wouldn't i wouldn't say there was
no i didn't mean there was
i think to be quite honest if they're not interested enough to try to get to classes
i think
yes well i certainly in this parish i cannot see how people couldn't manage to get to classes
if they really wanted to
if they wanted to yes
and the s frankly er i think the same as er the comment on where our UNK lie
if anybody has a talent then they should offer it
you can't go around pushing people to do things that they don't want to do
if they offer then that's fine
i'm afraid you'll find that a volunteer force is much better than a pressed one
i think each group works on their own behalf don't they to encourage others to join their group
do you
yes
think that person would be or not
i'd be much more impressed by some positive suggestions of what we might do cos i th you know months ago i was UNK outside church over a lot of similar issues and i said then you know
i think the comment about the is quite extraordinary actually
but nothing ever positive nothing ever positive is ever said
it's always destructive and critical
couple of points though about this erm how the parish council is recognized within the organization because it's important and that did our day as well and i suppose in a way it's the one or so positive things out of this that we kind of UNK on to that the communication part is important and erm there may be others that feel the same way that we're not actually communicating what it is that we're doing so maybe
and what they're meant to do for us
we can look at involvement with the organizations
i mean you can do that in various ways by inviting them all to come along you know have a saturday down at invite them to come along as representatives of the organizations and talk with the parish council
suggest a surgery
whatever it might be
when i first asked wh how many replies we'd had er i was quite pleased that we haven't had many because it shows that people read it or may not have read it
those read it thought yes this is this is i've got nothing to object to nothing to er to write and complain about or nothing to take issue with so anyway i find that encouraging
do you think we ought to make our mission more erm we ought to have a mission the parish council
like why we're here
well there's something similar to that on the poster isn't there that we do
yes but i think there is something to be said for communicating this in a different way
i don't think i mean it's probably to say as we are ourselves struggling for example with the issue of general welcoming
i mean th i feel that's actually quite crucial
i actually think we shouldn't take too much notice of the letter
i don't
no but i mean th there're so many issues that we are trying to get to grips with we have to actually communicate it to people and say well this is
but it's how to do it that's the problem
yes
yeah
yeah
but i don't think we ought to be too UNK about one letter like this
i'd agree
yeah but i do think there are some
yes there are some issues there yes
i think a point that comes over very much is the one about the structure and when i talk to people and listen to what they say they're still in the very traditional
which i must say i certainly in that a parish council is it and everybody else is linked in at lower levels
now this is people's traditional expectation and they still have it whereas we're of the mind that instead of this er you've very UNK got in this circle and the last day that i suddenly realized that we're all equal and moving around in a reasonably organized manner but still we're rather loose whereas the traditional view is a parish councillor says it and everybody does the rest with a few er UNK and UNK at varying parts in your parish
now we have to get over to people this changed idea and it hasn't been got over because nobody that i've listened to or talked to knows in fact people say what does the parish council do
i never hear anything about them
so first of all the method of dealing with things in such a changed manner has to be put over to people and i think the links which were traditional which no longer apply have to be and it must be a link going out in directions like this
now you can have it by the written word and the spoken word but i think the links we must continually have all the time are personal links talking to people
it's no good us saying oh well nobody writes about that article because a vast majority of people that's all they know about it if they've read that article at all and not everybody reads the parish magazine
you stand a better chance if you put something with the sunday and even then that might not be completely enough to reach down to the UNK but i think some method and that's why i suggested surgeries actually was that we have to talk regularly to people face to face and once you're in a room with people then it goes doesn't it
and we can find out all sorts of things
we can find out far easier what is really required and they can begin to realize that we're not just a set of photographs at back of church with names underneath that we're actually person who are thinking of speaking
the links are to my mind not close enough and they're not the right type of thing for this changed situation which we've got
that's the feelings i get
cos if people won't read the parish magazine then i don't think they'll come along to the
well i wouldn't UNK to that
i think because people are n sorry people are UNK at coming forward
we're the exceptions
i say that without hesitation
we're willing to come forward and talk and try and do things
the vast majority of people if you've run any organization of any type you will know very well people need leading er and it's not a matter of UNK it's explaining what is available what are the possible goals
now people will listen to you and they'll have had their own personal goals but they feel not worthy of expressing it anyway because they think well i've had this idea i'm probably up the UNK and they never say anything
but then they suddenly listen to what you say and they think well that's funny i was thinking about that when i was saying my prayers the other day
i thought that too
so i'm always reaching down to people and i don't mean down as being inferior reaching out to people is a better phrase and i never give up about people wanting to UNK
if you're in an organization and you're leader you have to encourage them
with certain organizations you've got to get a whip out occasionally but this is not that type of situation
but i you have i'm sure to go to people and not be at all surprised if some people you can never raise the enthusiasm because that's human nature and you accept human nature as it is but if you're positive and encourage and lead without being UNK to a high degree i think you get more responses
i'm glad you've made reference actually to that picture of the circles because i erm i came up with that after we'd had the parish day and i you know UNK who was there on the parish day and then trying to see how we reach people and who were missing and how important was it that everybody should be there on parish day and wasn't it that people who are involved should be there on parish day because that's a point at which erm you know parish council can meet those very people
erm i would be happy i mean i UNK i put some lines in just because i was thinking that way at the time but i'd be very happy if other people would scribble it out change it throw it back at me you know i would like to see i suppose just to see if we can erm if that because i have to say that although you know part of reading 's letter erm i feel it's it feels destructive and it feels very critical
that's right
and it feel like it's telling us we're not we're not doing anything right
at the same time i think others or the points she raises erm you know are good points and i don't think that we should just my personal feeling is that we shouldn't just UNK it
i'm sure she's not the only person who feels like this
i think i feel like it myself in fact
a lot of the points she raises i would raise myself i would see as areas that we can be tackling but how we tackle them you know i again i would endorse what said erm we'll go back to and say right now you've highlighted some issues now how do we do it in practice
and we actually tackle it
but i'm not sure that is the right response
i think that is one of the problems
we are still feeling our way ourselves and
i think that's very important and i think it's there's er actually i have to say er i detect in 's letter because i am quite sure that a year ago she would have questioned the parish council's existence and indeed she's being erm to my perception highly critical of er the fact that the parish council has even UNK to sort of taste the oxygen outside their own homes
and i think what is actually happening at the moment in the parish is that there is some perception there is a perception that something is that things are changing and that the parish council is of importance
did you say starting you did say starting
i did but possibly too strong a word but certainly i think erm i think the struggle in the last couple of years with regard to the parish council has been to actually introduce it to people's perception as of anything but importance
and i actually tend to UNK to the view you know that if we did have a surgery in it would be a non event
and certainly it would have been it would have been in the past
i think it would only become an event if parish councils do something which people took exception to and say that it's
but i mean
there're always people that'll criticize though aren't there
but there are ve but
yes
there are very few people that will actually come along and say well done
yes
but you don't expect that
well no you don't expect it but that's a fact of life
it's a fact of life yes
one of the one of the things that i mean the is cards
now these are cards are typed right going on to the sub committee
now if the parish council had said look we're going to use these people would actually say why should we and i think that's a debate
you know it is something very specific
but i do actually i do actually think it's fair enough to say that the parish council can be and should be more clear more direct in telling people what it's doing
and i think it can afford to be now because i don't i don't agree with you
the parish council has not been here as long as the parish
it's not been
it's not been as far as the parish is concerned
not ours no
but this is a traditional thing which is happening
well i traditionally in most catholic parishes the only person who's it is the priest
the priest yes
but where they've gone on to have parish councils you've had the typical UNK structure and when i talk to people and listen to what they say they don't express it to me as such but the UNK you get over is that's the sort of structure they're used to because the structure of the church is built in anyway and the whole structure of the church
this is only a reflection of larger areas of the church above that's if i may use that phrase which is happening
not necessarily the but certainly from below the top it's happening all over the world it's er UNK everybody they don't know whether they're coming or going
it's certainly down to our level
what of course you're saying here it comes out here in 's letter er the structure because er you said earlier that you realize now that we're looking we're filling in the in the gaps if you like of the local organizations
well you see here's a typical example here of the way is thinking she says could there have been er could there not be more contact and cooperation er if i am in a group providing music which she is there's every chance that the readers will have no knowledge of our intentions prior to our arriving in church but why don't the music people tell
that was one of my thoughts where's the cooperation in that
well who's going to say that
where's the communication
well somebody did say it
i thought it would be you know it would only
either the parish council can say it in any form that they wish or they can instruct me to say it
well
i think the point is
and if it's for the parish council i'm very happy to do so
yeah that's right
but the point is that if musicians go to service they know there's enough readers and if the musicians decide to take on part of that reading one service surely it's only courtesy for the musicians to say to the readers whose lists are published months in advance terribly sorry but we're gonna do this time and do you mind stepping down
i mean that's only courtesy
it's UNK
yeah
but i must admit it's up to each person that UNK it to say that great we don't need the collectors
and somebody said to me at the last children's mass thank you you're the only one that tells us we're not needed
this is the regular men who do the collecting
so yes i think it sounds UNK but
no
but it's not our job to people is it
no i'm not
the men collect it and know that of the children doing it you would think that they'd have noticed over the years that at the end of each month it says on the UNK list it says children and i think that
some things are taken as read and they're not actually said
i think it
i must say when i read that in 's letter i didn't read that specific erm comment i read something much wider really that really i felt that what she was saying was you know that when there is a group then readers er musicians everybody else reflect together and come together before they actually you know they don't all operate the same but they come together and they reflect together on what the theme is or you know what was the main point of the readings
erm i somehow felt that that's what she was feeling that there was something like that lacking
erm
well we recognized that two three years ago but it hasn't been filled yet
so we're aware that there is a gap yes
is it not something that erm the literature group coming out of the erm the course have begun to tackle you know the idea that there should be some kind of coordinating personal body or something that erm
er has agreed as a result of those new meetings to coordinate music and that means again filling gaps
oh i see
erm
but she's not a committee on her own is she
she's not no
she's one person
yes but i mean one person can very often do things
better than yes
better than others
anyway we're going to talk about coordinating readers and musicians so they can double do it if they wish
you know as not
i see
it may well be that they're doing it with er other ways of doing it and er that's discussion but i do actually think that there is sometimes something to be said and i think a group can say it more easily than individual is if you want something done do it but don't come along and complain
you know and i feel i do feel very angry i mean th the family that she's referring to who can't who have difficulty hav getting transport for sunday morning they're not UNK but are actually in the parish and they know perfectly well that if they ask they will get transport and indeed in the past they have asked and they have got transport
you know i mean people play funny buggers here and excuse my language
and i mean we could all go along and say what we want and what our needs are but that's not what we're talking about
that's not what parish councils about either is it
that's what a parish is about
there are times when people are in need and that's fine but the problem in this parish is not the people in need not being supplied the problem is that people are simply receiving what they wish to receive and not actually making very much contribution
now we may well argue we're supposed to encourage them we've actually got to make them create the conditions in which people are encouraged to come forward and take part
how to get on to the parish council the other day so i thought was quite UNK step yes
yes
people are recognizing us
you did touch earlier on about welcoming which is at the forefront of my mind all the time
er i mustn't be guilty of UNK but in the last council meeting of the night again the subject came up of how we could welcome people coming to mass and this is nothing to do with a request council at all and er we ended up and i think it's fair to say what we decided er here that people would individually they didn't know approach them
er i thought personally that was a bit too but i'm forever trying to organize
well no it is a start
did it a year ago
yes
and it lasted about a week
i know not everybody thinks this is the what welcoming is about but be aware that somebody in the parish knows also of the problem and they themselves are trying to feel their way forward to er some s partial solution
it's just a thing i thought i'd mention here
you know this is what i would expect every group in the parish to do to tackle areas where
i think it could be organized easily
yes
and this may well be something which we should be saying to the priest
yes
to the parish organization you know you are
you know
i think it's very interesting th that you know that has raised this point that you know why couldn't the parish council come to us
you know because i think we as parish council would have thought that we were UNK if we suggested that we should go to observe somebody's group meeting
you know that's something that we've been very careful about
we've been very careful not to be seen to be UNK or for anybody to think that we were going to tell groups how they would run their groups because the groups are fairly UNK and they pre existed parish councils er but a you know this is almost a direct invitation and we could actually respond to this in terms of an invitation and ask other groups if they would be interested in our UNK in our going to visit them rather than a surgery where maybe we'd sit here and nobody would turn up
erm you know that we that we've been invited to reach out and why not respond
yes that that's a good way of doing it
i think that's an excellent suggestion
it is yes
and to er voice our own concerns which obviously UNK with parish organizations
so how do we how do we tackle that
is that something that the UNK of it is worked out in and then but everybody takes part in it the whole parish council somehow takes part in it
would anybody have er an objection to taking part in an activity
i think if we do we would need to properly structure how we what our objective was are we just explaining what parish council is about offering to listen
