i'd now like to talk about high capacity and solution for that requirement in enterprise wide client server
often in the open systems arena applications will grow beyond the capacity of any single machine
traditionally when systems have grown this large companies have employed UNK solutions hardware software UNK
and these systems lose the advantages of open architecture for instance we talked about having over two hundred front end tools UNK database
and are typically good at either online transaction processing or decision support but not a combination of both
and without this capacity how can we expect large scale mainframe users to down size or right size into open systems
response to these requirements is rep is navigation server
navigation server is a software extension to the s q l server
it UNK it for distributed UNK parallel processing
it creates the appearance of a single UNK machine on a network
however in fact behind a UNK or a navigation server there will be any number of sql UNK working on UNK s q l now this solution provides us with total linear UNK as we run out of processing power we will add another node to the environment and take advantage of all of the processing power of that node using parallel s q l this is a hundred percent software solution it's not a hardware software combination
developed on s v r four with n c r and it's a key point that this is a combination of work which have done with n c r and the first release of navigation server will be available on the n c r thirty six hundred architecture
which enables us to have many hundred erm UNK in a single hardware cabinet
so we would run many sql UNK with a navigation at the front
but other platforms will come in the future so we can see us using sta very low cost standard hardware components we might stack up erm half a dozen or a dozen erm UNK with a high speed UNK between them each running a sql server
we've now created this UNK machine which is no longer constrained by the absolute size of any one component within that machine
and we can add UNK to that UNK machine as we need more processing power
so we have high capacity with low entry cost using standard components
so we're now able to support mainframe class applications with thousands of users in this data centred type database running thousands of applications with a mixture of decision support and online transaction processing
as we've already suggested this is a cost effective solution it is a software only solution and enables us to use lots of erm low cost hardware components
i we come back again to those distributed database issues and tackle UNK
as i as we've said this is a requirement which is consistent with enterprise wide client server
as we expand the client server architecture to become a universal solution we will need to integrate more UNK sources of information
we will need to leverage our customers existing investments in other technology
we will need to provide an UNK approach to UNK from one technology to another so we're not forcing our customers down the fantasy land alternative
john's already stolen my UNK on the straw poll erm that i was going to do but suffice to say that we normally do that at these types of seminars and there's always a few people in the room who put their hands up and say they've got more than ten data sources in their organization
and if truth be known there are many more in that audience
in the real world we have to recognize that we cannot convert customers to only use the database
we must be able to provide a level of UNK that UNK users and the UNK from not only where the data is stored but in which relational database management system
solution is UNK sql gateway no other product UNK the level of UNK that UNK provides
UNK sql gateway provides complete location and vendor UNK
all the clients on the network are UNK using a single dialect of s q l so our UNK no longer have to know the UNK and differences between each of the UNK of the sql of each database they're UNK against
they s use a single a dialect which is UNK s q l s q l implementation
all of the sources on the on the network look like so for instance i can do joins across two UNK r d b m UNK you can have a table with departments in UNK in UNK and salaries in d b two and i could use a single select statement and join all that information together in a single request to the UNK sql gateway
but what i can also do is leverage the power of client server UNK to s q l we talked about UNK efforts in stored procedures and UNK
i can actually use UNK sql gateway and write stored procedures stored procedures against all of the data sources it supports including for instance d b two
so i'm not limited because i'm by the lowest common UNK of other gateway approaches
and because the UNK sql gateway looks identical to a sql server on the network we still have the ability to integrate and front end tool
so i still have over two hundred front end tools which can
access data from the UNK sql gateway which actually has physical data stored in many different types of UNK
a wonderful example for today since we're in leeds is er united leeds it also e such facilities as
typically they're very used to the mainframe environment and what the mainframe environment offers
the mainframe is a single machine sitting in a UNK room
it's easy to control
it's a single physical piece of hardware
it's technology which is mature it's been around about thirty years and there's lots of good sophisticated control tools for managing that environment
as we move to the brave new world of client server we're talking about a technology which is indeed fairly UNK is more difficult to control and is essentially quite complex
as we move towards wide area networks of UNK then we have something which is a very sophisticated system for delivering information
one of partners is stores who are implementing a strategic store based application which involves having an r s six thousand in every single shop with a sql server on every single box
with three hundred and sixty sql UNK there's no way they're going to have a d b a in every store
what they need is UNK control as if they had a single mainframe
so aim with our control UNK is to deliver mainframe UNK in an open distributed environment
one of the components of the control server family is the backup server which is part of the sql server ten release
traditionally open system database UNK have been constrained by the speed of any one backup device
the backup server that is providing at release ten has or UNK device UNK to provide linear UNK of the backup to multiple da tape and disk devices
so i could have for instance thirty two tape devices running in parallel to back up my database
so for instance if my backup window is an hour and that's how long it take me to backup my database today if had the backup server and i was using one device it took an hour if i used two it would learn one dialect of s q l as
incorporating in partnership with UNK such standards as d m e and d c e which UNK indeed helped to define
so this UNK of the network the hardware as well as the database architecture
earlier we described a paradox which was that each user or group of users has a different need for information and the way that is presented to him
furthermore this is UNK by the wealth of different types of desktop devices for presentation of information
what i'd like now like to do is to describe some of the components of tools strategy to enable and UNK us to deliver enterprise wide client server solutions
however no matter what the user or device requirement there is a requirement for one thing and that remains critical and constant
and that requirement is productivity
back in the nineteen seventies computer hardware was very expensive and difficult to use
only highly trained professionals UNK to UNK with a computer
in the nineteen nineties with the UNK costs of hardware we can UNK afford to provide more and more people in our enterprise with access to a computer or the information within in
and this simply shifts the cost of providing that solution to an investment in the people and not the computer hardware
so we need to train them to use our systems and we need to be concentrating on the productivity not just of the UNK which is traditional what we've done with four g UNK but the productivity of the end user
the user community will run into thousands and thousands and therefore this is our biggest investment in our i t infrastructure
today in many large organizations we'll see three generations of desktop delivery mechanism the old dumb terminal the thirty se tw thirty two seventy dumb terminal for instance
delivering character based data to the desktop
people have then UNK towards using g u i typically at departmental level
they'll have UNK on one particular g u i delivery mechanism
which is traditionally you know windows three open look or UNK maybe o s two
and then into the future where will that g u i capability lead us
well we've already talked briefly and we've seen a video about gain UNK and how that might enable us to address application requirements in a different way
with applications that actually look like the way you do business
and traditionally these three types of delivery mechanism mean we have to rewrite or UNK applications in their entirety for each type of device
that's further UNK the maintenance burden on the i t department or the information systems provider
has three components to its client architecture to address the needs of the different users and the different devices
each component has been announced as part of the system ten announcement and in fact a p t and gain UNK are available in production today
in june will be UNK a complete architecture which UNK these technologies together providing an object based integrated environment for all user requirements and device types
so indeed we do not need to rewrite applications for each different type of device or user
well what we'd like to do now is just try and address each of those different four g UNK in the architecture
first is a p t which is essentially a heads down data entry facility
so that me we may have for instance erm order entry clerks entering many orders per day
they actually don't spend too much time looking at the screen they're actually using dumb UNK to enter data very quickly
and therefore we have a low cost er per seat of entering that information into the system
that's a procedural thing we do one thing we do another then we do the other then we come back and do it again
and that type of application is very well erm very well used by dumb terminal applications
enterprise g u i will enable us to take advantage of erm g u i desktop devices such as windows three
this is a type of environment used by decision makers where they may be working on one piece of information in the application and they need to make a decision based on an information which is elsewhere in the application
so they'll move from one window to another make a decision on that information in the other window and come back to what they were doing before
this is a non procedural approach to making decisions based on the information inside the system which has been entered by the dumb terminal users the heads down data entry
and for this we would use object based technology object UNK technology to enable us to have this business processes UNK inside the desktop
and for the future of applications we talked about gain and UNK and what that might deliver in applications that look like your business
where we can deliver applications where the users actually don't need training
this is a self training interface
enterprise g u i is a tool which is presently in development er which is subject to an announcement in the june UNK and in fact actually at the next customer update which is providing erm in june
it's a UNK based g u i development environment which is using object based technology
it enables us to develop application on for instance windows three and exploit all of the UNK and features of windows and UNK on open look UNK and macintosh
it will
enable us to develop applications on macintosh taking advantage of all the features of macintosh and UNK on windows UNK and open look
and that is a g u i environment which is UNK and UNK
we don't UNK windows three in open look we don't UNK the macintosh on windows three
we use all of the UNK sets so we're not using the lowest common UNK approach
but one thing which makes this product stand out from the crowd is its ability to address the needs of work group computing
based on its object based UNK
so i can develop application code and share that across my work group or the department of developers
so this is where we believe the market place is today with application development in the g u i desktop
we've already seen a brief UNK of gain UNK
this is the type of technology which may indeed eventually replace the traditionally data entry heads down data entry facility and user
we have a an order entry clerk who's now ordering hundreds of orders a day and that is from a UNK from our customers and that UNK has come form the computer system of our customers
and they have a data entry clerk who's entered that order onto their system and then printed it out
so we have several levels of interaction with a computer in terms of entering information
UNK will enable us to place a UNK or our system or an extension of our information infrastructure in our customer's environment and enable them to UNK with our systems though an UNK self teaching UNK rich environment
so we can get rid of all of those different costly UNK with a computer with er UNK of com of paper output erm dumb terminal input paper output dumb terminal input
so all this can be do done and integrated through UNK
one er one of UNK first customers in the u s was er e d s e d s have er will be using gain technology to deliver erm what they're calling UNK applications for the world cup in nineteen ninety four in u s a so that in the in the er the world cup environment there will be UNK around UNK the er the training camps for instance where players or er fans can go up and touch using a touch screen can see the er the highlights of the last UNK versus england game they can find out where the nearest UNK restaurant and they can find out the team news for the next game
and all of this using UNK capabilities
so we're extending the way that information systems can be used by users who traditionally have not been en UNK or enabled to get at that information
one of the other key partners of gain UNK is sun
if you buy a certain level support from sun UNK they will ship you an application which is built using gain UNK
and that application is a self teaching way to use a s sun UNK
traditionally if you buy a w UNK and you turn it on out of the box look at the screen and you'll see a percent sign
what do you do next
you turn to the manual and try and work out how it's going to how you're going to UNK with it
well gain UNK will enable you to turn on the UNK and it will talk to you it will show you videos it will show you UNK as to how that UNK should be used to best advantage
so system ten is the UNK of several years of work that we've been doing with other hardware and software vendors but most importantly with our customers
we've worked together to make sure our products address the needs of the real world
approach is one which is essentially pragmatic
i've talked during my presentation about each of the UNK which we laid out at the beginning of the morning which talked about the UNK needs of different parts of an enterprise from their information systems if we are to deliver the UNK er the advantages of enterprise wide client server
i hope that we have proved today that sql server is well proven advanced technology UNK server enables us to deliver data to who needs it where they need it when they need it even if there are system failures that navigation server provides us with a high capacity with a low entry cost that UNK sql gateway enables us to have complete vendor UNK and integrate all information for decision support
i hope that we've been able to convey the way that control UNK will enable you to control the client server environment as if you're controlling a mainframe and i sincerely hope that we've been able to talk erm UNK about our tool strategy and how we can address the needs of each different group of users with different desktop devices in a consistent manner
is committed to deliver solutions for real world problems
has set the client server agenda for other vendors for four years and with system ten we hope to continue to do so
before we finish what i'd like to do is erm show you a video another UNK from er one of strategic partners which is the UNK company
er once we've showed you that video UNK gonna come back and just sum up very briefly and then we'll open the floor for questions and answers
thank you
time
er one thing that does UNK me following UNK presentation is how the average british football fan will cope with a gain UNK in UNK in the world cup
er could be quite interesting
erm i get the easy bit after UNK difficult presentation er talking around nice slides like this and yes that's the yellow brick road around what we've talked about this morning
er a quick summary because we have UNK
er just as we owned that famous street in new york i'd like to think with the technology and the architecture that can deliver today we we'll own the road to enterprise client server
er and you can all read what we've talked about there
that's where we've come from we've talked about what's a available today and we've talked about where we'd like to take our users in the future
er and i can think of erm nothing better than to leave you with this slide er which i think sums up where we're coming from today and what we'd like you to take away from today
er i'd like to i ask our UNK this morning to join me on the stage to take any questions from the floor and ask if you could er fill in your er y your UNK your sheets on the on today's events before you leave please
er there is an information pack er to take away with you and er in reverse order you've seen the film you can read the book
within that pack there is erm er if you like the book that takes you through the slides that have been put up there today
er so please if there are any questions er let's have them
someone's got to be first
yes sir
is it possible to store er UNK information or is it basically er UNK
yeah the question was is it possible to store UNK information on the database
er UNK answer that one
yeah i can answer that
erm absolutely
erm one of the things that is very good at is in technical applications such as UNK
erm we're very strong in the manufacturing arena and there's several applications based on er which are u delivering UNK solutions in fact
erm so yes we can and in fact the gain video that you saw UNK some UNK drawing as well
so yes it is absolutely appropriate for that sort of application
anyone else
yes
how much stock if any stock does n c r hold
repeat the question
repeat the question for anybody who didn't hear that how much stock if any does n c r hold in
well i will answer that er holds no stock of the product because the product is er the current products are sold by us exclusively
er some of the new products er you talk we talked about like navigation server we will be working with n c r on precisely we'll be shipping those products
yes
open systems in the UNK context erm what plans do you have to integrate with n t as and when it becomes available
yeah the question was er what are our plans to integrate with n t as and when it becomes available
er perhaps one of the things that wasn't mentioned this morning is our relationship with microsoft in that the microsoft sql server for a the o s two environment is actually a developed product er and we have a joint marketing agreement on that
again john if you want to pick on the on the on the
well you can be assured that we have a very close relationship with microsoft and microsoft will er tell you the same story
in fact erm when for example microsoft access was reduced it included in the box the o d b c driver to access the sql server database
we'll be available on n t erm i don't think i can say UNK with the availability of n t cos a no one knows the availability of n t and secondly there will UNK be some UNK but it will be very soon as quick as we can make it after that
erm also of course erm n t is not just a platform for the UNK machines
so erm n t is significant to UNK and to UNK and they're target platforms for us as well
yes
how does er o d b c fit in with erm sort of microsoft and er future
again the question there how does the o d b c fit in with the microsoft and er future
UNK
okay
erm we mentioned already today about a p a p i on the desktop called erm open client
and that is a er an a p i which is very similar in approach to o d b c in that it enables you using a consistent interface to get at any data source within the organization
this that was erm ahead of the standards if you like and we also need to follow standards and be standards UNK and o d b c is the first implementation of s q l access group is standard for the desktop
as john has already said when s er microsoft first introduced access and therefore the o d b c software the only database which had the driver UNK in with the box was sql server
so we're very committed to o d b c it is one standard which we're following it is an alternative a p i for the desktop which is obviously strong because of the microsoft relationship erm but we will also UNK follow other standards in terms of a p is for the desktop as well
is there any erm is there sort of clash in using the er the UNK s q l gateway and o d b c
no none at all
in fact when we ship the o UNK sql gateway we also ship erm the catalogue tables for o d b c with the gateway so they work in combination
right
with the UNK sql gateway that er you'll be able to access d b two data is that still going through the open sql server or is that actually going d r d a or are there plans to go d r d a UNK
i don't think i need to repeat that i think everyone can hear the questions er
okay erm in terms of the technical erm way it works erm the o UNK sql gateway does go through the open server for UNK at the moment and i think john could probably comment on the i b m relationship
yeah as part of the activity at UNK last week erm i b m made certain announcements
there was certainly the announcement of a relationship with us because i b m share this vision of the enterprise client server model in integration of the mainframe into the open systems environments
they also announced a thing called d r d a two
i think that announcement was actually made i told it was going to be and has committed to support d r d a two and that effectively provides an alternative a p i perhaps as o d b c with UNK backing will become the norm in the p c environment d r d a will be in the i b m environment
part of d r d a two is er two face commit coordination which we're also committed to support
so that will actually mean that a single transaction can span say d b two or indeed other i b m data sources in a database
well i'm conscious we kept you a long time this time this morning and i certainly do appreciate your attendance and presence
er sorry
helen
can i just ask one thing
some of you have managed to escape already without filling in your seminar
erm could i ask you all to do that before you leave please
i think what that means is you can't get past helen unless you do fill that in UNK
er UNK once again thank you for your time and attendance this morning
there's been an awful lot of information UNK
we sincerely hope that's been of use to you
er and obviously there are certain er a number of people er surrounding you
feel free to hang around and ask some more specific questions if you wish
er but thank you for your attendance and safe journey
further questioning
was UNK at her house in the UNK area of derby
her body was found on tuesday night
two years ago her husband burned to death in a mystery fire in the same house
yesterday detectives arrested a man and a woman in connection with mrs death
meanwhile two people are being questioned in connection with the murder of a UNK man
peter UNK was UNK just two hours after being released from policy custody
his body was discovered on saint andrews road
he was well known in the local drugs scene
police say they've arrested a thirty eight year old man and a twenty six year old woman
one of the UNK universities is to spend thousands of pounds UNK the latest high tech computer equipment
derby university is one of the UNK in the country
hundreds of students have just begun their first term and computers are essential in just about every subject
now the university has decided to spend one hundred and fifty thousand pounds UNK more than a hundred of the latest computers
students from all UNK will have access to the machines at the UNK road site
staff say the computers will be used for everything from report writing to course registration
hundreds of car UNK turned up today for the south lincolnshire motor show
it was rough going for some of the UNK as they put a new four wheel drive model through its UNK
meanwhile the public had the chance to try out their driving skills on a slightly smaller scale
the show continues tomorrow
that's the news so far we're back tomorrow lunchtime and don't forget to put your UNK back one hour we all get an extra hour in bed tomorrow morning
for now though from all us UNK good evening
central weather sponsored by legal and general
good evening
cloud has been affecting most parts of the midlands today but not quite as much as up there in scotland although that's gonna make a bit of an impression on us tomorrow
for tonight though UNK feed back across the region from the northeast
there might be some UNK floating around down in the UNK part but generally those temperatures will be above freezing
this dry pattern will continue into tomorrow but the cloud i've told you about in scotland will wander down towards us bringing some UNK cloud for a while
but generally a dry and fairly bright sunday
bye
erm my first job was erm helping the keeper
with the pheasants
i started there when i was about fifteen and er erm they used to breed about er six hundred pheasants there you see
and my job was to going round with the keeper and feeding them every morning
they used to have a erm hens there you see they used to go round the small farms buying hens then for half a crown each just for sitting on the eggs to UNK them
and then they used to put them in er small boxes out in the field and er i used to go round in the woodlands and cut some you see put them in the ground with a small branch on them and then we used to make some string and UNK out of erm wire to go round their feet you see
and then we used to put these UNK the through the UNK and tie their legs to the string
and have them in the get their feed first thing in the morning you see
and as soon as they finished their feed and they had some drinks from the small tins as well we used to put them one by one back in these boxes where the eggs were and they used to settle down straight off then after they had their feed and they used to erm settle down no trouble at all
and then the old keeper used to come round and see that we were all right and they'd be there till the following day and carry on for about three or four weeks you see
and then as they UNK you see you used to take them in into the UNK then
because we had finished with the hens then you see and they used to sell the hens for about two shillings or something like that you know
in the old time
and then erm they eggs would be in this UNK for about a week and then they used to arrange UNK for them to go out do you see we used to fence a field below the mansion in the field there because there was a good in UNK right round the two drives and then there were shelter you see
and then we used to fence it half
and get a shed there or a hut anyway
and then we used to put some UNK there and small runs for them and we used to carry them there every night because they settled down better in the night than in the daytime
and the hen with back again there if they hadn't sold them
take the hens
and erm we used to have about six hundred in all there they say
and then when they had come about two months old something like that er we used to carry them out now into the woodlands and with the rest of the hens
into the woodlands
at night
as when it was eight to nine o'clock at night sometimes up to twelve o'clock depends on how many was going out
because they settled down better in the night in the woodlands
mm
if you took them in the daytime they'd come back but taking them in the dark when they were asleep into the woodlands they'd settle much better do you see
in the UNK and all that
and then we used to after that we used to go out every in the morning and at night taking some feed out to them wherever they were do you see
now then after they cut the in the farm all the UNK erm there might be about four or five loads there do you see
they used to take the what they called the UNK the spare after they carried the sheaves in
the spare of the of the straw and there was some er seed among them do you see
used to take a load of that to one part of the woodlands
another one to another part there and so on
about four or five
and then we used to call them because that's where we were feeding them do you see
after they had settled down among the UNK we used to take these do you see
and then they would walk for them do you see do their way up for them
and then we used to feed them on these UNK there do you see
er twice morning and night
and er if you went quietly back after putting the feed out say before dark put the feed down there and you went quietly back and watched them you wouldn't believe how many would have been there
there'd be about two or three hundred
perhaps on the same erm UNK
because there were some old ones there before the young one UNK gone there do you see
and erm then they settled down
there on that patch do you see
now then my place for feeding was the upper side of do you see
all the woodlands of the upper side there was three UNK there
three erm place to feed them
and we used to watch them
go there sometimes about four o'clock give them a feed out and then we used to i used to stay there in a small shelter there
and they'd go down right over the main road right over the fields over the railway through the fields along the beach there
and about four o'clock to five o'clock they'd be coming back
and as they were coming back they would be UNK
for used to go over the road and they used to go over the railway
you could hear them coming from the distance back
and they make to the same place to their feed
and that's in that place just round about there
that's where they were UNK overnight on the trees
just on that path there do you see
and they'll come from oh two or three miles back to the same tree
same tree every night
no different tree
but to the same tree
and the s the trees they would like to come was the UNK and the UNK because they they've got a UNK like of leaves do you see and they were well sheltered there among these
and they were hidden among them do you see
so they were quite warm there
doesn't matter what the weather was
they were quite warm there
and they'll come to that tree every night
the same about forty to fifty on that field on that tree they'd come to that tree every night
doesn't matter where they were
and erm the keeper had from up towards the mountain do you see
three er UNK there again
and then that was there the old ones and all
from the past used to come there do you see and feed
and UNK in the same spot there
aye
and then in between i was to go round with him say in the afternoons or some mornings and he had heard about a fox somewhere
perhaps up in the or up in the mountain
we used to go after lunch straight up to the mountain or wherever the fox was
and dig them out young UNK and all
did you
aye
and catch them alive in the UNK
and that was a job
and er we used to dig down we used to put the dogs in used to have about two or three UNK
put them in
and block all the holes
perhaps you'd block all the holes
perhaps you'd put one in
just to mark
and then we used to listen with our ear on the ground and we could hear where the dog was do you see and then we used to dig down there because we knew it was fighting there with the with a UNK do you see
the fox we used to we used to dig down there and come to the UNK
and then the old keeper he was quicker than i am because i was l erm because he was used to the job do you see
and then i was taken the dog out slowly do you see and the old UNK coming out forward do you see
and he used to have a small piece of stick with a on the end of it cut from er a tree or a bush
and as soon as she puts her head down out for the for the dog do you see fighting he used to put this v on her back right at the back of the neck
just above you know on the UNK anyway
and hold her down
and the he could get his hand do you see round her nose anyway around her UNK
catching hold of her and she couldn't get back do you seem because he had slipped this hand down this stick got hold of her and he you see and then i let go of the dog and take the front feet and we used to drag her out like that you see from the UNK and put her in a bag
as soon as she was in the sack it was a sack then you UNK get them now
old fashioned sack
as soon as she was in the sack she was as quiet as a lamb
very quiet
and then
not struggling
no struggling at all
as soon as she was in the bag
mm
she was quiet like a lamb
no at all
we used to tie her in there and get the UNK out then do you see we used to dig for the UNK
they might be about er a month old perhaps six weeks old and we used to get them sometimes most of the time we would get about four there sometimes three
and we used to catch them alive take them out put them in a bag together again and off home again do you see
and then er we used to make a big chest for her do you see
you used to have two or three old UNK there
and we used to take one of them do it up put some straw in and everything and all that and then tie there was a ring in the ground you see in one of the
and a chain there and we used to tie her to this chain so that she could get into the box and out again and then we used to put the UNK there first in the straw and then we used to put her there do you see
just take the bag put it in and let go and then shut her there for the night just for one night
and with a lead on and off do you see
and then in the night when it was dark the old keeper used to come there open the top of the lid and shut the door because she was in a she was in a loft do you see above the UNK with er an iron er ladder going up and down you see and then shut the door on her there do you see and she could get in and out then from the chest
and then the job was on the following days was after be shooting rabbits to feed them do you see
for about oh three or four weeks
till we had a customer do you see through the office in
a customer from somewhere in england where they used to hunt them do you see
i see
and then er perhaps they were get a customer in about two or three weeks perhaps less than that sometimes
and then the next job was to make a UNK for her to go on the railway do you see
erm er erm big UNK with some strips of wood along the top
and then plenty of straw and everything and put the old UNK in and the UNK and some food for and then the old erm the old er erm what did they used to call it
oh the not a land rover then
mm
that's what they call it
aye the
that's when they used to come up and put it in the straight on to the station
and then the depot on and off to wherever was the place like
aye
and we had finished with them
aye
another time was about october i don't know what he was doing with them but in october middle of october we used to go out to the beach and shoot erm oh what do you call them now
they've got long UNK like that
you can hear them in the summer just before UNK in the UNK
the er the UNK
UNK that's it
the UNK
used get as much as he could of them i don't know was it to keep the amount of them down or not
i'm not quite sure
because they used to be in the UNK hours
hours in the UNK and when they were going all thick and heavy there he used to go round about october just for that one day and shoot as much as he could and bring them into the mansion
what they were going i don't know
aye and er he had a g special gun for that job
it was a about thirty six barrel
length of barrel
and he used to c take UNK erm about an inch and a half thick and about three inches long
specially made
single barrel
and on the end of the erm stock there was the to take the kick do you see
and er sometimes you'd have a stand for it because it was too long
and he used to have a small stand on it do you see to hold the barrel and then he could manoeuvre around just like a machine gun
wherever the birds where aye
and for shooting er wild erm UNK
and er wild UNK as well
in fact they used to call it the gun for the wild UNK do you see
and they used to be coming erm about the end of september through the beginning of november they used to come to the beach from different directions during that time
and that was the time to shoot them
aye different birds
erm er different UNK erm and UNK
aye
were the small ones all different colour
but the were UNK white the big ones then were the ones for eating anyway
aye
yes and i had a lot of er experience with training dogs and all that for hunting the old foxes and all that
did you
yes
yes
on f er was it on foot
yes
oh yes on foot aye
and erm we used to carry erm used to have a pair of UNK with him and i used to have the old er telescope do you see
and er we used to look if we could see some on the side of the mountains from the distances you could pick it out with a pick them out with er with this telescope it was a heck of a good telescope aye
it was so good this telescope we had when i was watching the pheasants in the field i used to be there all day for the UNK would come along do you see
then we had to shoot them do you see
the UNK
and it was funny the UNK use to keep away for the whole week nearly
but when the sunday morning used to come the old and the old erm UNK keeper used to tell me tom he used to say i you know it's sunday again
yes i said look at them UNK he says to me they know it's sunday because you'd never shoot on a sunday
no
no
he was a UNK he would never shoot on a sunday
doesn't matter if he saw his fox he wouldn't shoot it on a sunday
no
aye he was very keen er keep the sunday clean
aye
aye
and er the only thing we could do then was to chase them away go round you know and just chase them away
but this telescope the field was just below
the mansion of
and i could see right across the fields and right across the UNK onto UNK
from there and i had this telescope
and i could see during the week this was in the mornings you know say about eight or nine to ten in the morning and i could see the figures of the ladies there cleaning the windows in the morning
and the front
you couldn't see them right if you were a few yards from them but just the figures moving you know and their arms going backwards and fore cleaning the windows
yes it was so good as that
it was a good telescope
aye
one of the best i ever saw
aye
and erm you could see a long distance with it like that you know especially if you could see a fox from er about a mile and a half you could see right going along the rocks in the mountains
aye
aye
and erm say the fox had been in the ground and the and the young UNK for about three or four days
and we used to hear somebody saying there was a UNK there and some and some young ones
we went up there with the dogs and let them in to the UNK
block everywhere let them into the UNK
one dog would go in and she'd just shake her tail and come back and you couldn't get her in afterwards because she knew that they'd cleared off
i see
they had moved
yeah
anyway the UNK was there but she was wise once she had gone through oh it's alright
she wouldn't go in then and you knew then well they've gone
what they were doing the old UNK was walking them higher up into the mountain for safety
and the old dog knew that it was empty no use digging down or anything she had gone do you see
aye they were quite wise like that
yes
and one time i remember er we had gone among the rocks there and we had er two erm two fox UNK there
and one was fox UNK
and er that one would fight doesn't matter what was there it'd fight its way out
anyway when i came in and he didn't come out
it was oh about two to three o'clock in the afternoon
and he didn't come out
dark when the r it came UNK and dark again and he hadn't come out
and we left him there and we went home
up there about six o'clock in the morning ad we managed to get him out them
and he was UNK all over his face everywhere
and of course the old keeper knew what was there alright when he saw the old dog coming out
it was erm UNK
a UNK
UNK aye
mm
and that one was fighting with the dog do you see
because they've got a shelf do you see in the UNK for safety
if er something comes in they can attack him on his back do you see
and that's what happened you see he had him on
about his ears and all his face like that
but the old dog survived alright
aye
aye
the old keeper he knew how to treat him and he was on alright in about a month
aye
but erm we set some UNK then
gin was one then
you could use them
we went back with these UNK put them in a half circle right round UNK nine of them anyway
and er a fox trap as well as the gin trap that one's a bigger one
anyway the following day he was there
the third day in the trap
aye
aye
he had gone to the big one and he UNK about his two in his legs
aye of course we couldn't go near him we shoot him from a distance
aye
and that one we were doing in the meantime
between the feeding the pheasants and all that aye
and i was there for the erm oh about fourteen months in all with the shooting
how old were you
and they were starting shooting the pheasants about then it's altered now
it used to be the twenty first of october
mm
right through to the middle of january
yes and we used to have about two or three er days of shooting during that erm that period anyway
aye
aye
yes and er we used to have about two hundred three hundred birds on the for the shooting and then perhaps about a hundred and fifty or so or something like that on the second
and erm we used to help er in the woodlands then used to give us a help
and they'd be all down in the cellar do you see
and up in the cellar after the shooting we had to make them to a UNK like that a UNK and a hen
in a UNK
and hang them up in the cellar all night
because there was two or three rooms there do you see a proper place for hanging up
and the following day we had to go in and help and pack them in UNK
do you see
specially made for them
pack them there the whole UNK
aye
and erm take them and down two or three loads down to the station
pack them off
for manchester liverpool and er different places like that
aye
aye
and of course on the shooting they used to have a good feed of you know in the mansion in the cellar
aye
all tables laid out all kinds of meat and UNK and everything
yes
yes
and plenty of drinks aye
who would be at the shoot then
well they used to invite do you see
lord for instance and er there used to be one from this way UNK somewhere the place was the place was called
and erm that one was just along beyond UNK here somewhere
and anglesey i remember from anglesey he was from that way somewhere
and erm colonel from
and erm some from towards er that way from the estate there somewhere
used to be about four or five you know aye
and the major himself of course
and er the some of the family as well
yes
i remember one lady there she was only young and she was she was only about twenty five and er she had a twelve bore single barrel gun
i thought it was too heavy for her she was only small
but sh she was the second best UNK there
for the day for bringing them down
aye
was she
aye
everybody was surprised
she was such an accurate er UNK
aye
aye
you see one was close to the woodlands and in fact missed she was just in the bottom of the field and she's sure to get the bird
and then as we were beating you see inside through the UNK and all and a UNK got up and we used to shout do you see for them to know that he was coming
aye
but the noise of him and the flapping was good enough sign too
yes
and i had been loading for the major the last time that i was out shooting the last time for me like
aye
aye the one that used to was poorly
he a UNK for him
aye
two guns of course
and then you had to be quick at it you know
keep two UNK in your hand all the time and then as soon as you'd handed your gun and you were taking the other one and he was the empty one
they used to swing out themselves do you see just open trigger handle for the barrel to open they used to spring out and then put the two new ones in you see and close it straight off
and you had to be quick you see because the birds sometimes used to come and stop over
yeah
yes
and then and used to miss you know sometimes he would be missing every one nearly and he'd be cleaning his glasses all the time dash it
aye
other times he couldn't miss
aye
aye
oh i enjoyed it
and erm then i went to the woodlands as a UNK
and i started from there as a UNK
i was about sixteen and a half then or going for seventeen aye
and i was there for twenty five years
aye in the woodlands
and i've been er erm loading for him two or three times after that
aye
aye
yes
and er then i carried on in the woodlands then cutting trees down and erm UNK up too
i was on the circular sa saw there for about eight or ten years
doing nothing only UNK all day
aye that was during the wartime aye
aye
and erm UNK trees
cutting trees for blocks for them for roads
and they used to go through about oh i should say about erm carts then you see horse and carts
and they used to take about six loads a day you see
of er blocks
er every week
they had to go through a lot of blocks
and about seven to eight UNK of coal
they used to have them in the summer ready for the winter
and they used to stack them all in the cellar
for the twelve months like
aye
and erm the trucks were about
yes and i was there till about erm nineteen fifty three
i started in
august nineteen fifty three
and i was there till i was erm twenty six years in
aye altogether
yes
and of course my work here i used to do in i used to plant a lot in
of trees
but in when i came to it was mostly erm planting threes again
and in i was planting an average there was five of us working and the students and we used to average about fourteen to sixteen thousand every year of young plants
but clearing was a job mostly
i didn't mind planting we were quick planting but clearing for planting that was the worst job do you see
you and open the UNK and all that
aye
but erm going back to er to twice we had an oak land fire
twice
i remember it was oh about nineteen twenty eight something like that it was
and s it had been a heck of a storm
and we had a UNK right out in the erm UNK
and it was a UNK of er
and we didn't go there to cut them at all because they were right open right in the open and there was ho hope for them anyway
we left them there to season we didn't bother
and er of course we had then
anywhere we were c clearing the river up because blocked that one summer day and it was very hot for about a month or so
and we were at it clearing this there right in the UNK
and there were some er UNK
they when they had bought a UNK of UNK
you want them for pit UNK
and they had bought them
and they had these two or three UNK there cutting them up
and we could hear somebody calling and shouting
we couldn't make out what was wrong
and er they were still UNK and calling so i went up on to the top of the bank and they it was this UNK that fell down in the UNK and caught fire
somebody had been UNK there do you see in the UNK and left some bottles there
and of course the sun caught the bottles and set the fire to the UNK of the grass do you see
and it was all peat
all these trees had been growing on peat do you see and the peat was dry
anyway we went up there but we couldn't do anything because the ground had taken fire do you see all this peat
and the rabbits were UNK out from their house
and they had no single hair on
they were as clean you know the backs of them as clean as my hand
they had not because the ground was on fire do you see and they were UNK out
and screaming
you could hear them UNK off from a distance
and we were trying to kill them everything
take them out of their misery but you couldn't cope with them because the ground was moving with them
oh we felt terrible for them
anyway the trees were all burnt to dust
aye
it wasn't only about half an acre or less
aye
all the trees but they had all fall down do you see flat
and of course they had UNK by then and they were just like matches going aye
and we didn't bother we couldn't do anything much for these rabbits and try and kill them you know as much as we could aye
aye
er it was better to leave it to burn out do you see
and the second fire i had was just before the last war
we had been clearing oh about six acres of woodlands
been all been cleared f erm what we used to call it cut and clear UNK you see
all cleared
ready for planting and of course oh there were some UNK and everything
i remember we cleaned it all up and it was right on the boundary wall between property and
and we had a small bonfire in a way of small UNK and all that
all the UNK
and we had put it on fire and it had died down you could have put it on two or three UNK when we were leaving the place do you see and it was all quiet and all right now and off we went home
about four o'clock in the morning the following morning a farmer was knocking on my door
and he said come here the whole forest is on fire
i couldn't believe it till i went out
dressing UNK and off i went out
to the front of the house and then like we see all the side and the f on fire
so i went back dressed and off i went called the and i went up to try and beat it off
no hopes it was travelling under our feet non stop
we were beating and beating
anyway in the end they called the fire brigade
we could see it was going out of control
even big old trees you know they were coming down
mm
burning and the top of them coming down you know it was dangerous
and the fire brigade was coming along the road we could hear it coming you know
and it came a heavy shower UNK shower
and it lasted about three quarters an hour and it all UNK down
we were as glad as anything when we saw this rain coming down
we were UNK to the skin we didn't care
as long as we could stop the fire
because it was travelling you know on er oh a line of about ooh i'm sure about six hundred yards
because he had gone back to the woodlands where the trees were
and it was going along through the woodlands travelling like the river
and covered in sweat
but when this rain came down it was like it had been sent to stop it you know
a heavy rain we were UNK in about five minutes UNK to the skin
aye
aye
but it stopped it like that it was only just UNK you know
and of the fire brigade we couldn't do anything better
they all turned back that was all
aye with their UNK aye
that's the only two fires i had
and what happened you see the wind got up during the night and this small fire we had you see started spreading back among the UNK and then the more it was back the bigger it was t gaining ground and it was getting to the old stuff do you see and then it was a good UNK then
and it started we could see where it started from this fire
and it was like a black carpet all the way
aye
if we had put some two or three stones on it you see that'd been better
but we thought it was alright we didn't bother
i mean it was right up to the wall and the we'd have bothered
but you can see what will happen
and it was right through
yes and when i came to as i was saying we were clearing all half of
cos they didn't have the whole park only i think it was three hundred er no five hundred acres in all
taking the front grounds and the gardens and the UNK and the woodlands
erm there's about two hundred acres of woodlands do you see
and erm the farm the erm mr timber merchant he had bought when he came up the whole park
you see during the wartime
and now then this half that the college had do you seem he had taken most of the timber from there do you see
there was a timber control and they had been there controlling him
but he had cut do you see all on the inside and left along the UNK
all the trees along the UNK and they had UNK
and then do you see he had taken most of the stuff from here because he had four UNK going do you see
the biggest one in UNK
and now then all the small stuff was going as well do you see for UNK for the stuff
for the stations railway stations because they couldn't get any coal do you see
and the same from we'd been selling from there as well
to make fires in the in the waiting rooms and all that do you know
anyway we had cleared nearly everything only the tops of the trees were there left to rotten and they were been dropped on the UNK
and then all the UNK was there as well do you see UNK
all you wanted was the rough stuff out do you see all the timber that was good and the bad stuff as well get it out
anyway what happened do you see the ones that he'd cut in the beginning when he bought the place
and he was here before he bought the place
the UNK everything had grown through the branches do you see
so there was the job of clearing
and all the water courses been blocked up and then it was UNK as well
anyway we cleared them and erm we started by the clearing all them
er all that patch along the and during nineteen i started in nineteen fifty three and about the end of nineteen fifty four before christmas most of the lot that he had left behind came down
UNK trees and everything mixed with them
it was a heck of a gale
er a UNK gale
and it started about midnight
and we were down there about half past seven in the morning and the trees were still UNK then with the wind
do you see
and due to them taking a lot of the trees do you see from there and opened the wind in do you see
i see
take them i mean along the main road he had taken the trees at the back of them and they had no shelter and they were down in the main road
and all over the place
you couldn't get in or out of here
because every entrance had been blocked with trees
big UNK trees and er UNK trees and everything
every road there was the main drive the drive from the erm what do they call it
er the lodge on the main road from UNK and the east lodge half way to that one was blocked as well then three blocked
the entrance from in to the woodlands was blocked
and in the h other half of the park them had come down as well do you see
so there was no entrance there and all they could do was clear by the main lodge
and go through the fields open a way through the field do you see
from the mansion
and then we were clearing all the for the week afterwards opening places to go in and out do you see
now then being that was working on the other side took all the trees on the main drive do you see and he bought them and cleared them
and the UNK are still there today the old UNK and all that
anyway that took a lot of our work do you see back to clear them
and selling er most of them like
another firm from UNK bought them er on the UNK
and erm it was mostly planting then as i was saying
and we were buying plants from er
and why i went there to buy them was because it was the same climate as and the trees there was no UNK in the plants do you see they were starting growing straight off cos they'd been was the same climate
aye
yes
as
and then i had some that was acquired from the UNK alright again
same climate
then i had some from mid wales and they were slow in UNK because they took about twelve months to settle in there
and get used to the climate
most of them came on all right in the end
some were dying back
and erm i had some UNK along the UNK main UNK
from UNK in UNK
er and i had about twelve thousand along there
from UNK in UNK
i took a day to go and fetch and mid wales i had a lot of er of erm UNK er norway UNK and
the american black they call it
and we had thousands from there as well
but er by the time i was ready to retire i had planted all the half park
about two thousand acres in all
within about two acres by the time i retired
had you ever worked out how m how many trees that is about
no i hadn't kept a of the whole like
but we were doing on average about fourteen thousand sixteen thousand each year
yes
mm
except the first two or three years i was here
we didn't plant much then
cos i hadn't had the gang then do you see there was only two of us then
and with a clearing and we were having the help of the students of course
but there wasn't much students then we had about four of five in the beginning
so i couldn't get the swing of it then do you see for about two or three years
or two years anyway
about three years i had some more gang to help me and the students were increasing then do you see
yes
but erm towards about the sixth year we used to plant about the average of fourteen thirteen fourteen sixteen thousand aye
of course it wasn't a matter being that they were plants only about
they were only about nine to fifteen inch tall do you see
but the they were going up from er twelve to eighteen inches
an er they were coming in er the UNK they were coming in UNK of a hundred
the being that they were UNK and older they were coming in UNK of about fifty do you see
so we had to as soon as they come we had to open a UNK and heel them in do you see
cover them up
and make sure the frost wasn't getting at them
make sure the wind or the frost wasn't getting at the roots
or it killed them straight off
and that was an extra job
and then we could use them straight from that ditch as we were planting do you see
planting about two hundred three hundred four hundred a day depend on the crowd we had aye
yes
and erm as well as that we were cutting young trees what was left like on the UNK for UNK do you see for the farm
and erm selling them
of the UNK
and cutting UNK to b to sell as UNK as well
aye and making posts UNK for the farm and all that
yes helping the f the joiner with er with UNK as well with a big circular saw
that would keep him in timber do you see keep him going
aye
and open the UNK
which was that one was a heck of a job
being there was no erm what they call them now
er erm the UNK isn't it erm
j c b type thing
j c b that's it
mm
it was all done by pick and shovel then
aye and took more time
yes but we was to get the hand of the farm fellas to do the erm the digging with the with the UNK and all that yes
yes
aye well was different to
was more flat but was all side
working on the side do you see so all the water was running away do you see
there was not much er UNK there at all
no
that's all on the side
well now then you had to get different spaces for to here
the same spaces wouldn't do in that did in
for instance erm because it was all side douglas UNK douglas fir was doing better there than in
was doing all right but norway UNK was doing very badly because during the war during the wintertime do you see there was only the UNK there and there was not much salt in the air
do you see
so the wind was more fierce there off the UNK
and them will survive there but during er the winter starting october you could see the face of the UNK of that was facing the sea it all UNK up towards the end of o of er december
and they would be like that UNK bread
all the leaves getting off
until well in the following summer they would recover again
because the wind was so cold off the UNK do you see
it was UNK them right through
could hardly get some to grow there
UNK were doing alright
but the they weren't doing very well at all there
no
and erm in erm the er yes the not the norway the er the ones that was growing in the shelter of the oak trees they were surviving alright
patch here and there
but as soon as you cut the oak trees down and the ash they would catch the wind then and UNK do you see
aye
you had to be very
UNK there wasn't much UNK in it was mostly round the mansion and at the back of the grounds
that was all
because it didn't do at all well there
because UNK likes a lot of lime in the ground you see
well that's
does it
oak and ash doesn't like much of it
erm again UNK was doing much better in and the UNK one of the best places for UNK and UNK
but the oak you didn't get the good class of oak here
you could get a better class of oak in
because of the rocks there
it was all UNK and the oak well likes the rocks do you see and they were doing better
they were slow in growing of course but they like the rock better
and it was a better class of oak all through
ash the same again
if you cut the ash in it was UNK but if you cut it in most of it when you cut it down it was more like cream colour
red and cream colour
and erm it was a better class altogether of ash
and the bark on the outside was a UNK colour the bark of it
but here it was UNK do you see rough UNK
aye
and er if you get UNK in the ash UNK it's a good class of ash
is it
yes
one of the best cos it's tough do you see
whereas the ones here it's UNK
they'll snap
aye
well erm again was very good for UNK
a lo lovely class of douglas UNK there very good
aye er in er two or three places right in the woodlands in on the slope we had erm douglas fir there going up two hundred and fifty and two hundred feet tall
good heavens
and the UNK and erm diameter on i'd been cutting a lot of them down the diameter of them was from four foot to about six foot
in the UNK like aye
and erm all the timber for one
and erm another one from er erm oh what do you call that place
on the way to manchester
mm
it's beyond UNK quay that way
they were buying a lot from
they were two brothers
and they reckon it was the best class of er douglas fir they ever had
aye
this er fellow that was for in UNK told me we had to keep an extra erm for douglas fir he says
we were
because it's such a good timber he says
aye
aye it's hard to saw them
aye
yes
revelation
and i looked to behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death
david koresh like jesus christ died aged thirty three
british followers of koresh are facing trial for murder
tonight UNK has new evidence about the waco tragedy
for the great day of his UNK is come
david koresh was an UNK product of rural texas
he liked rock music cars guns and teenage girls
but to the branch UNK he was the lamb of god
today there is dispute about how far he caused his and his followers deaths or they were victims of a needless tragedy
the american government has just brought out two new reports providing fresh evidence about the life and death of the man who called himself the sinful messiah
koresh lives on in the hearts of such branch UNK as survived
two of them revisit the site of the mount carmel centre their former home outside waco that koresh UNK
they've come to look for their UNK
janet had been a branch UNK for years before koresh came along
there's not much left is there
just a heap of rubbish hard to believe that there were over a hundred people living in there is there
her husband is in jail in waco with the other men soon to go on trial
sheila lost her husband and four of here seven children in the fire
the site was UNK immediately afterwards
last week the justice department's report UNK that the fire was deliberately started inside
most UNK dispute that
if the cause of the tragedy is contentious the scale of it is not
eighty four people died here on april the nineteenth of whom at least twenty were young children
twelve of the youngest were found still wrapped in the UNK bones of their UNK arms
of all the dead about twenty four were british
and of the adults who left during the UNK or who managed to survive the fire three UNK will soon go on trial for UNK to murder the federal agents who were killed or wounded in the initial shoot out
many of the branch UNK seem to be educated and UNK people
the question remains
how did people like that come to finish up in the UNK that happened here
the UNK split off from the UNK day UNK church in the nineteen thirties
they take the book of revelation more literally and believe the second coming of christ is UNK
among the UNK here are the UNK of families who came from britain and from all over the world
i like to have the memories of them
yeah i don't
but you hate to think at the same time what happened how they were burning you hate to think of
yeah i
those things
the government calls them a UNK because of their UNK to david koresh
their spirits are with us and that we got to keep on going
and their loyalty remains
having lost your husband and four of your children you don't think that david koresh might have been er a UNK leader
a UNK figure
no
he's always been very kind very UNK always very UNK of our sins
i don't think so no
don't you ever feel that he dragged your family in to this terrible UNK unnecessarily
no sir
no sir i think that we were all there we all stayed because god would take care of us
we still believe that there's going to be a kingdom over in israel and that david koresh is going to come back and be the head of that kingdom and that it's going to be a peaceful place as UNK in the bible
it talks about the UNK being UNK and being UNK and UNK because they are going to see peace and harmony and happiness and this is what we are looking forward to this is why we're not UNK why we're not you know all upset because we know this is going to come
three british branch UNK men are in waco jail and will be tried for murder soon
i spoke on the telephone to one of them UNK who comes from nottingham
this is no different to the christians that lived back two thousand years ago
it was either the system or god that's what er the position of the f b i put us in
we did not fear death at all
the thing about it is that it is not death of the body that is important to us it's the soul
david koresh grew up in the bible belt
he was born vernon the UNK son of a fourteen year old girl
brought up in the seventh day UNK church he would later be UNK and join the branch UNK
his mother now mrs UNK knew young UNK was to be a religious leader
he was a failure at school but as a UNK he became obsessed with christianity
he would pray for hours and UNK large sections of the bible
his mother remembers his growing talent as a preacher
i knew it had to be a gift from god
and all a prophet means is a UNK of god it's nothing he's
just a man you know but i felt that god was leaving him i really did
he amazed
me it was UNK
he described himself as the sinful messiah
mhm
what does that mean
well he was a sinful person as we all are erm i think he did not as the way i understand it you know jesus came perfect in everything but he had a he had a message to give and he could give it better i think because he had experienced so many things
the sins of the world and all this kind of stuff
waco UNK officers close in on mount carmel not this year but six years ago
vernon was arrested for leading an armed attack on the then branch UNK leader one george who'd thrown him off the property
shots were exchanged and firearms UNK
in a UNK leadership contest had dug up a dead UNK and challenged his rival vernon to bring the body back to life
in court the jury concluded that was UNK
vernon david koresh to be escaped conviction because the jury couldn't agree on his guilt
the vital evidence was removed from the waco UNK and guns were returned to him
george had been UNK as UNK leader
vernon returned to mount carmel with his young wife and a handful of followers the UNK leader of the UNK
to UNK his power he needed new members and his UNK out across the world
koresh's closest aid right up to the end was steve
he flew to london in nineteen eighty eight
he headed for the seventh day UNK college new bold in UNK
had been a student here back in the seventies before he was UNK for getting drunk
came as in the christian community would say a UNK in sheep clothing
no one knew of him coming hardly anyone knew who he was
the first thing he did he made friends amongst the young men in the college
he was a latter day john the UNK preparing the way for david koresh
a former UNK himself he was well equipped to give the students he met koresh's new UNK on the book of revelation
i've UNK over a couple of the things
good
you know as an UNK do you know what it says in the book of revelation
yeah
revelation fourteen and lo a lion was standing on the mount UNK and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand which were UNK from the earth
any man that worships the UNK and the image the very same shall taste of the wine of the UNK of god
he took things out of context and everything focused on UNK the end of the world UNK
koresh UNK in on this and tried to bring it closer to where we are to make it more real so it was UNK in the minds of all his followers
when koresh himself came to britain banned from new bold he had to hold meetings in peoples homes
god in the flesh do you know who i am
god in the flesh
new bold college couldn't prevent its students from going along and some young seventh day UNK were UNK to be UNK
after all koresh's UNK vision his talk of the seven seals that only the lamb of god can UNK sounded like UNK of what they already believed
UNK with UNK christianity they were impressed by his apparent certainty but he persuaded his potential british followers with more than just his UNK knowledge
what better sinner knows a sinner than a UNK sinner ha
gradually the meetings got longer and longer until eventually they began not in the evening but they began in the morning and they lasted from perhaps ten in the morning until the early hours of the next day
course people were very tired
the evening i was there were about twenty five people in the room and people were falling asleep
but what's the point of holding a meeting that goes on for more than twelve hours
well i only see one point and that is to try to confuse somebody to UNK them
but those who accepted koresh's teaching deny they were being UNK
every sin isaiah says i'm guilty of i agree
i'm perfect to give you this message
as a recruiting exercise the meetings were a success one who joined then now a nurse was janet
we were not spell bound by david
you know we were intelligent people who asked intelligent questions
now remember we all of us came from the background that you know this world was going to come to an end very soon
that god was going to do something UNK okay
erm exactly what we didn't know we were al we all knew a little bit about the seals however we had studied about the seals in a different way and it didn't make sense and we were young people who were searching
as well as janet four students at the meeting became branch UNK in britain
one was her brother UNK student john who recruited in manchester
he was to die in the fire
UNK from nottingham was a former seventh day UNK
as we've seen he's now in prison
cliff from derby was another new bold student a UNK artist he too would die in the fire
and diana john former girlfriend and a psychology graduate
she had two brothers and two sisters at home in manchester
manchester south seventh day UNK church
the family used to come here
the father sam a builder still worships here on a saturday the UNK
all five children were musical and UNK for academic success and professional careers
john was able to convince most of the family to follow the sinful messiah
diana returned after her first visit to waco to go about recruiting manchester UNK using her father's church membership lists
hello it's me
how are you
her father was the only member of the family to reject koresh's teaching and the only one still alive
the fire in waco killed diana both her brothers both her sisters and her mother UNK
when she decided with the rest of the children to go to waco monday and they told me the sunday
just a few hours i would say before less than twenty four hours before they went
that they were going and that nearly killed me that nearly killed me because i knew then this was serious
very serious
this came as a shock to you
it was more than a shock i put my head in my in my hand and i remember UNK right at this spot and just crying my heart out
you are a UNK husband and a UNK father
definitely i am
in this situation have you UNK blame for the deaths of your family
whom do you blame
i the main there are two persons whom the devil used as instruments in the destruction of my family equally
and one is they call him david koresh and the next is a woman in london call vicky
i think that's her name
why do you blame her
because her home was a headquarters for vernon in britain
UNK is UNK her flat in north london
it was never a headquarters as such but david koresh the self UNK lamb of god stayed here when he visited london
and here he held bible meetings that convinced vicky and over thirty others to come and join him in waco
she was allowed to leave the mount carmel centre halfway through the UNK
speaking for the first time vicky is now UNK with the man she once thought was a prophet and is writing a book about it
i still believe that someone is to come by the name of david and setting up of god's kingdom but
but it's not david koresh
no it's not david koresh
vicky was UNK at the mount carmel centre last year by an australian UNK
she lived here on and off for three years
conditions were primitive
there was no UNK
life UNK of UNK work UNK by lengthy sessions of bible study addressed by the prophet himself
i will the lord has said unto me thou art my son
this day have i UNK thee
ha
someone's the son of god someone
it would become clear to vicky that koresh's UNK for the outside world that he called UNK included UNK for some of its laws and for normal standards of behaviour
someone is going to rule whether the big world likes it or not
thou UNK break them with the rod of iron thou UNK dash them in pieces like a UNK
the guy's tough
he's got more than guns
he's got god
sometimes his bible meetings are very interesting and another time it can be very boring
he would tell us about his love affairs and things what he did
you know just raw you know
what he did how he'd do it and things like that
and you know children men and children would be there and he just don't care
sorry wh what how would you mean what he did
you know how you know how he make love he would tell us
the mount carmel compound in the texas countryside outside waco had a UNK leader
once his followers many educated people were convinced that koresh was a prophet a mouth piece of god they would do anything he asked of them
koresh had married rachel who was the fourteen year old daughter of another branch UNK
together they had three children all of them would die in the fire
but koresh believed himself entitled to all the UNK women
david established that erm in isaiah two twenty two it says UNK eve from man and this is one of the UNK that david showed us that er shows the man or the women that they have to leave their wife or if it's the woman she has to leave her husband and her and her boyfriend and become his wife
so he used a verse of isaiah
yes
to justify sleeping with all the other UNK wives
yes and all the men give their wife to david
so how many of them got pregnant
many of them
so how many children do you think david koresh had
david had many children
so that if any of the women were pregnant at mount carmel david koresh was the father
yes because all every man give their wife up
even koresh's closest UNK steve had to give up his young wife judy to the sinful messiah
she had koresh's baby and called herself judy koresh
the whole UNK was known as the house of david
but koresh didn't just take UNK wives
he demanded their young daughters too and most parents UNK
koresh was UNK about his sex with UNK children and they left his room in the early dawn
but one branch UNK who later went to the police was a witness to what went on
he came to me he had a problem he and i were good friends and he said that erm that this one girl s erm UNK was his favourite wife and that he had been with her since erm she was twelve
the problem that he was having was that she was his legal wife's sister and there was some UNK or UNK developing between his legal wife and er this other girl and he wasn't sure what he what to do about it
what did you think about david koresh sleeping with twelve year old children
well i think it was terrible but the parents agree with it
both mother and father they agree that erm that david should do that because you see david established that he is the only he is the only man on this earth who have er holy seed in him
holy seed
yes and
that's what he called it
yeah he call it the holy seed and that he could have righteous children
if koresh broke the law it was the county sheriff who should have intervened
the waco sheriff UNK turned a blind eye to koresh's activities
but when mark UNK and made allegations of child abuse sheriff jack eventually sent social workers to visit the branch UNK
there was really no evidence of er of child abuse
there was only allegations and again i say today that we have not ever found any proof of any child abuse out there
that's not to say there wasn't child abuse now i have my own thoughts and in my own feelings feel that there could have been some child abuse especially ch sexual abuse
erm but we could never prove that
UNK was david koresh's legal advisor but took his turn in helping construct the UNK wooden building
thinking himself safe from the law koresh committed more excesses
was one of the so called UNK men
king david of the old testament had UNK men to enforce discipline so did david koresh
there was a UNK with which koresh beat his followers and he UNK them by openly UNK in crude detail about even worse UNK
upon julie who UNK for her young daughter and wanted to leave
what i am saying here now is not hearsay this is what david UNK us in his bible meetings
what he did
he took julie upstairs in his room and he push her he push her on his bed and he raped her
he said to us that you know that is dick was so hard and he told us everything of what he did to her he push his dick inside of her and he said he was very rough with her and she was crying and crying and crying
for entertainment koresh forced the branch UNK to watch violent and UNK videos usually of films about the vietnam war to UNK a UNK and defensive UNK
koresh had guns from the beginning and he made his UNK men in to trained UNK
his weapons were part of his message
you see if there is going to be a war and god's people had also to be UNK and so there was that element of religion as well that we had to be trained as UNK for the lord
on several occasions they had er displayed guns where people would back into their UNK or er show some indication that they were going on to their property then guns were revealed people coming out of the buildings out there with guns and what have you
there was some reference to it as being their country
i would not go out there on to their property without letting them have knowledge that i was coming to their property
but of all koresh's dubious activities it was gun dealing that would bring him in to conflict with authority
one of his members had a dealers license and drove to cities like UNK to buy and sell at gun fairs
koresh financed his UNK by trading in weapons
a common place enough business in texas
this was koresh's business premises
a building near mount carmel called the UNK
here koresh took receipt of mail order fire arms from all over america including machine guns like the a k forty seven the simple UNK that convert semi automatic weapons into UNK and even hand UNK
fully UNK they are all illegal
only when a package burst open did the sheriff receive a tip off from the postal service u p s
er u p s er called us one time on some hand UNK er the kind that you would use sat on your desk for a UNK
a box of them had er they were delivering had erm they had damaged the box and some of them had fallen out
and they called us to go out and look at them
they were not the illegal so we couldn't stop them from delivering them
then we received information black powder and er other er types of er conversion UNK for semi automatic rifles to convert them to automatic rifles and that kind of thing
all of this information we were giving to the federal people a t f who are responsible for investigating and control these kind of activities
as a result this house opposite koresh's compound was occupied in january by agents of the alcohol tobacco and firearms bureau the a t f an agent called UNK bible classes and a log was kept of koresh's movements
UNK were issued to arrest koresh and to search mount carmel for illegal weapons
koresh used to regularly drive into waco in his black sports car he had no fear of arrest
last week a government report said that if the a t f had arrested koresh in town all the UNK that followed need never of happened and those who died might still have been alive
instead the a t f decided to mount its biggest ever raid
over a hundred armed agents set out for mount carmel
the raid was meant to have speed UNK and surprise
speed the a t f were transported in cattle trucks that were visible from miles away
UNK the raid was UNK by three military UNK that were fired upon before the cattle trucks even got here
surprise the raid had been talked about in waco for days
the news media were UNK and were following the police UNK
one television news UNK got lost near here and asked a UNK for directions adding there's going to be a big UNK with those religious nuts over there
the UNK him for the warning and drove back to mount carmel
he was david koresh's brother in law and one of the UNK men
UNK fire from the UNK automatic weapons UNK the a t f men when they tried to enter the building
last weeks report shows that not only was koresh UNK of the raid but the a t UNK agent had told that to the UNK
the report says they should have called off the operation once the element of surprise was lost
with both sides suffering dead and wounded UNK lawyer UNK put in a desperate call to the deputy sheriff UNK who he knew
against a background of UNK the call was recorded
yeah this is lieutenant may i help you
yeah they're shooting at us in mount carmel
mount carmel
yeah tell them there are children and women in here and to call it off
oh man i can hear the UNK
god almighty i knew this
UNK
tell them to call it off
who is this UNK
tell them to pull back
what
fight to the last man they started firing first
cease fire
oh shit
what's the matter
they're what do you think they're doing all this firing on us right now
alright i'm trying to make contact with the forces now standby
why do you think such extreme violence was used against law enforcement officers when they arrived to carry out their duties
well er because it was UNK
because the a t f UNK it
violence UNK v violence and when the a t f assaulted er those people they UNK themselves
when you think about a hundred plus people inside of a compound with all of those weapons you need a mass a large scale operation
the important thing was that it go forward only with the element of surprise
unfortunately the element of surprise was lost and the operation still went forward
UNK report UNK that with four a t f men killed and sixteen wounded the raid was a UNK
but there could be no let up now
koresh was UNK not just the local sheriff but the government of the united states
federal officers were dead
a tragic process began to UNK and faced with a UNK they could not understand officials made a series of UNK that would end in an even greater loss of life
david koresh and his followers were where they wanted to be inside the UNK of mount carmel
they settled down for a long UNK and so did the outside world
president clinton replaced the a t f with the federal bureau of investigation the f b i
meanwhile the army provided UNK vehicles and UNK
the aim was to get the UNK to give themselves up
but over the UNK weeks only a handful came out the rest chose to stay
everybody else for a look through the field glasses it doesn't cost you
last week's report for the justice department UNK that the f b i's tactics didn't work
instead of a UNK resolution the UNK dragged on into its second month
initially the f b i's fear was that there would be a mass suicide
when vicky came out after three weeks she confirmed that fear
UNK she brought er a green thing a round thing and she gave it to one of the ladies i cannot remember which one
saying that erm you know th you know that it's a UNK and it's going to be quick death
even in that early part of the UNK a decision had been made that you were all going to die
we are all going to die then they all they that th that they're going to blow the place up
so a mass suicide had erm you know the people were planning a mass suicide in the first few days of the UNK
is this because david koresh had persuaded everybody that their lives would have to end in this UNK
well david said that we were at the end everyone believed that they were that the time has come that we was at the end of the world
if that was the mood in the early days of the UNK later on the f b i knew that koresh's attitude may have changed
koresh's lawyer were one of the few the f b i allowed to speak to him
gave UNK evidence that koresh intended to survive the UNK
the tape of a phone conversation late in the UNK that has not been heard publicly before
this is what my focus is once i go out of here i want to go out walking
i told them you know i had no intention of committing suicide i'm not that way
let me tell you the word there spreading is that you have UNK to kill all everybody
er
that is UNK
that there would be a mass UNK i know it it's i
that's not that's not even UNK
koresh told that he'd give himself up once he'd written his UNK interpretation of the seven seals
we know koresh started work because the computer disk containing his first chapter survived the fire
although the f b i thought this another UNK it helped persuade them that mass suicide was unlikely and that it was therefore safe to force a conclusion
at dawn on april the nineteenth fifty one days into the UNK their patience ran out
president clinton authorized the f b i's tanks to bash holes in the walls spray c s gas and fire in gas UNK
over loud speakers the f b i told the UNK it was not an assault just an attempt to force them out
but the UNK stayed put
last week's report would call the entire UNK operation a failure
what you had was f b i agents who were trained to be UNK to be to do things to force a conclusion
they didn't have to do something
it's this macho attitude we've got to bring this to a conclusion that i'm arguing about
i think the best conclusion would have happened if they'd just let it happen rather than trying to force the issue on april the nineteenth
er it was the it was the wrong decision
six hours after the UNK operation began around midday the mount carmel centre burst into flames in three different places
about a hundred were inside just nine escaped
one told be his experience on the phone from waco prison british survivor UNK
er i myself went for the nearest exit which was out a window i assume everyone else erm UNK and i could hear quite a few people running down the corridor from the first floor
erm i myself came out a first floor window erm a lot of a lot of UNK had already been blocked by the tanks
how did the fire start
at the time the government didn't expect a mass suicide
but f b i agents are now UNK they knew the fire might happen
they had listening devices in the building and early on the nineteenth allegedly heard koresh ordering UNK to UNK around
the justice department won't release those tapes but its investigator has no doubts
there is substantial evidence that er demonstrates that the fire was caused by those inside the compound
not just caused by them but that it was UNK set
er we do have interviews with the number of members who had UNK the compound indicating that there was er UNK er erm m UNK type products that were being spread around the compound
er that the fires were set at about the time that the erm er that the UNK began UNK the walls of the compound
i think the evidence will be overwhelming that fire was set UNK by koresh and h some of his core followers
but the british eye witness UNK says that the fire was started by accident
i was in there with the flame and er there was no erm for any erm or anything like that
i'm not sure if david keep us from erm the building we know then that there was no
but as the fire here at mount carmel started in three separate places the f b i is probably right that it was deliberate
but there is no proof of mass suicide
the question remains therefore whether the f b i was wise to force the issue with the gas attack or whether it UNK the situation
the justice department report UNK the f b i
but many in america have received that report UNK
to avoid an UNK death by fire many UNK shot one another or themselves
david koresh had already been wounded
f b i agents now believe that is was his trusted lieutenant who had given koresh everything including his own wife who shot the sinful messiah in the head with a rifle before turning the gun on himself
no weapon was found near the body of david koresh
a high velocity rifle lay beside the remains of steve
the flag of texas UNK the UNK of state authority over koresh's kingdom
what little remained of victims of the fire was carried away for identification and UNK
the UNK and the government cannot agree about responsibility for their deaths among them young cliff john the family UNK and four of his children
why did all so many people have to die like this
why did they you know when you think that they were in er one place there was thirty two
in that square place that was over there it was a UNK some of them were so UNK together they were holding each other
there was like five or six bodies at one point
they realized later that these are UNK together
such a heat and such a UNK they were afraid
they would not have done this
they wouldn't have allowed them you know didn't want to kill themselves like that
they didn't want to die
we all wanted to live i know my children too
in order to make his own sort of erm UNK vision come true
erm he decided to stage a fire in which it would make it appear as though er this was a result of some sort of erm armed UNK between law enforcement and his group
but who actually he wasn't given what he wanted which i believe was an armed conflict between law enforcement and his group in which he expected to die in which he expected his membership to die
the UNK of the UNK on the UNK site of mount carmel
koresh has been UNK by the government and his followers UNK as UNK
they became the object of public UNK and UNK
and very few stopped to think about what had happened
the true test of a free society is not in how it treats its best citizens but in how it treats its worst its most UNK
and if we can do that to someone because well they're religious nuts they're a little bit different
or they're a lot different
then we can do it to you or me or anyone else and that troubles me
what remained of david koresh was UNK buried here in this UNK grave in the small texas town where he grew up
the branch UNK still exists
its members believe koresh will return soon and today they are still actively trying to make UNK in britain and wherever people are susceptible to the appeal of a sinful messiah
good morning
good morning to you
what happened to sunshine
i don't know
you might have arranged it better
how many UNK are you going to land on today sir
well we're going to have two
we have this one and then we're going further south and operate with the other the second one
what happens now that you are UNK down
well the aircraft simply do an orbit come back around back into wind and then come UNK in under my directions using hand signals
th the only thing i mentioned to the crew is to be aware of static there's a lot of static electricity at the moment
so er just er let me handle that
okay
yes thank you
kieran UNK man on the UNK helicopter and the rest of the duty crew that morning were UNK operator terry pilot norman and UNK tim
the UNK medical officer of the UNK lifeboat is dr tony and he would normally be UNK casualties to be UNK but that day he himself was to be UNK up from the lifeboat to the helicopter and once that part of the exercise was completed and he was back safely on deck i asked him how was that
that was great
absolutely
you enjoyed it
lovely it was a bit of an UNK i thought
i mean i thought i'd be absolutely frightened out of my mind but erm no
i think you just have a philosophical attitude if they're going to drop you they drop you and that's
what did he mean when he's saying the static
static electricity
yeah
well it's like getting out of a car on a hot day and putting your putting your hand on the door i think
but i didn't feel anything
the only thing was noise
have you done it before
i was involved a few years ago in the in the UNK the rescue er that the UNK went ashore on hoy and er the helicopter there took the casualties of the UNK and dropped
yeah
them onto the lifeboat
was that a soft landing you had back there
no i got a very sore
yes
dr tony UNK medical officer
once the exercise was completed satisfactorily the UNK helicopter duly UNK us and flew of at speed to UNK with the stromness lifeboat
the UNK boat the david and elizabeth king e b is a UNK class self UNK lifeboat and has been on station since nineteen seventy
once she was safely UNK back up the UNK into the lifeboat shed i spoke to some of the crew
firstly jack UNK since nineteen seventy
are you going to be sorry to see that boat go
och well you have to shift with the times and the new boat which is much faster will be a great help
have you been out with the helicopter before
yes quite often
we've been exercises this is the third exercise with the helicopter
when was the last called out
not on exercise with the helicopter
that'll have been the UNK run ashore on er UNK and we were all come ashore on but it wasn't er
i think that'll been the last helicopter
have you worked with that helicopter that was on exercise today
well er everything navy helicopter from UNK we were out with
the big UNK
UNK
we're were out with before
yes we're never out on an exercise with the
jackie UNK of the UNK lifeboat who was awarded the r n l is bronze UNK for UNK for his part in the rescue of the crew of the ross turn from the UNK tail of UNK in nineteen seventy three
the new UNK lifeboat will be a forty seven foot UNK class fast UNK launch
she'll be a tonne lighter in weight but very much faster
i asked the UNK ian who'd looked after the david and elizabeth king if he'd regret seeing her go
no i'm really looking forward to getting the new lifeboat because i think it'll be a great advantage from the station here
at least we'll have a lot of speed
the show a big advantage and a bigger speed er out here
have you had any problems with this one over the years
oh none at all
it's gone like a dream it's er i've had no major problems with it at all
it's just been a good boat to us
really
but you are going to be sorry to see that one go because you've looked after her for so long
ah yes i have looked after it for ever since it was new and er and it was the one that UNK the station after the UNK lost here but as i say you've got to look forward and i think it's a good idea to have a new boat here
cos it's a good young crew and everybody's pretty enthusiastic
ian UNK
billy has also been in the crew since the david and elizabeth king came on station
and i asked him about that particular morning's exercise with the UNK helicopter
well it's like what most exercises are it seems like a lot of nonsense but actually when it comes to the crunch you actually know what's going to happen you know the procedures and everything like that
so that it's it has certainly got a lot of value an exercise like that even with entirely good conditions
how many exercises have you done with the UNK before
oh we've done two or three we usually do one well er i wouldn't regularly but probably one every year or you ken something like that
today it was UNK
that's just what they usually do for an exercise there's no much you cannot actually UNK an actual rescue so that's the best you can do
but the conditions today weren't exactly calm anyway so it was a pretty fair exercise
well i suppose but er you can imagine a lot worse than that
billy
and the rest of the crew that morning were billy second UNK john assistant UNK jimmy and UNK
also angus who was the youngest on board that day
well i'm not actually signed up but i'm going to start signing up now as a crew member
i just go out on exercises now and again fill in for somebody
you have a relative though already on the crew
yeah dad he's the UNK
and i also have a brother that's on the crew
have your family always been involved with the lifeboat
as far as i've been told and remember dad's always been on the boat yeah
different boat
will you going to on the new one
will you be here when it comes do you think
yeah
by that time hopefully i'll be signed up as a crew member
angus
and my thanks to all connected with the UNK lifeboat for my day out
i spoke later to jackie lifeboat secretary and asked him how many of a crew he had to call on at any time
we now have fifteen men who have past the medical exam and the board of trade eyesight test and are now fully UNK lifeboat crew
there is one or two not quite completed training yet
there's a great family tradition obviously in UNK as there must be in every orkney and shetland lifeboat
oh yeah
yeah the crew seems to UNK
the father would be on the boat and the son would as a young boy would come to meet the workers that came back and he begins to help with the ropes and the UNK up of the boat and the washing down and so on of the boat after she's been on service and so on
and as the years go by and the father UNK the son comes on to the boat so it is really a very family thing the lifeboat service
what particular memories have you got of this lifeboat
my memories of this boat would be mainly the big rescue she did and the UNK tail of UNK aberdeen UNK ross turn
was ashore in a UNK among the rocks there and the lifeboat had to turn in a position that was just about twice her own length
the crew were all UNK on to the side of the UNK and the last men off billy and john took 'em they got hold of them by one leg and they pulled them off
and the lifeboat was able to turn and to get safely back out again
which was really quite a rescue
i out there the next day and all that was showing above the water was the mast
wee bit at the top of the mast of the UNK
she has sunk by that time
my earliest memory of rescued people being landed by the lifeboat would be in the nineteen thirties see
going down with my dad who had been president of the lifeboat here for about fifty years to meet the lifeboat as come in with UNK i was just a wee boy at the time but i remember the UNK the UNK and one of the first to be put ashore off the lifeboat that night was a wee UNK and she came across the pier and she came to me because i was the only kid down there that night
and er maybe about five six years ago a parcel of blankets came from UNK for the UNK lifeboat from this same woman and there had been no contact whatsoever between the time she was rescued and then which was amazing
have you heard from her since then
never heard from her at all since then
but it is the r n l i it's something like a huge club because er go where you like you're always received well among the UNK and the shipping people
and so i've quite often been in stromness and somebody said to me how are you getting home tonight
you see
as much as to say well if you need a lift home just let me know
so it is it's a marvellous thing really the r n l i
erm er ken could you er just give me an outline of what happened
what's happened to you
what's sort of going on since the last time i interviewed you
which was about
er
is it two years ago now i think
is it two years
good lord
er that time we was living in bay wasn't we
that's right yes
yeah
erm we was living in the high street i believe
you were
yeah that's right yeah
quite a nice place actually
er yeah
that was only a t a temporary house
er we managed eventually to get a erm a flat off the council
we was in a two bedroomed erm council flat but they were intended for old age pensioners like you know
right
so that again was temporary
erm i think we was there about nine months
it wasn't a bad place but er a very small one you know
erm from then we got a council house which is where the wife's living at the moment
erm i think i think we'd have been there about UNK no
about a year when we decided to split up
so consequently she's living in bay and i'm living on my own in up in holyhead
i moved back to holyhead and been living in a UNK since june
er and i got the job at the centre in august
erm went back into photography that's basically all that's happened to me
er did you s w when er when i saw you when you were living in
mhm
erm you gave a very full account of the sort of pressures that erm you were under because you didn't have a job and you related it to the necessity of involving yourself in what you UNK called the black economy
erm er you've indicated that er you've separated now from your wife
yeah that's right
erm do you think the fact that you didn't have a job er contributed to that in any way
er that's a hard question
erm i don't think it did
i really don't think so
because we're both level headed people and not having a job was obviously a big thing in our lives and i'd indicated to anne that if we did move away i would stand a much better chance of getting a job
but she preferred to stay up here with her family and her friends
so i then told her that if we were gonna stay here the chances of me getting a job were very slim
so she'd have to face the prospect of me being on the dole for a long time
and she says she preferred that to us having to move away
erm i took her at her word i still looked for work i didn't stop looking for work but i took it that she was happy enough me being on the dole if it meant that we could stay around bay or anglesey
erm we didn't have any major pr er the major problem was money
that was the only that was the only problem associated with not having work
i kept myself very busy anyway erm in various erm hobbies that i had
so she was ne er i was never under her feet
i'm not the sort of guy that sits around the house like you know
so i was never under her feet or any of them sort of problems that a lot of people find
i find that friends of mine who are unemployed their wives tend to th tend to think that they get under their feet a lot
they're never away from each other erm whereas myself i was always out
and er i'd come up and stay with my brother in holyhead about two or three times a week
er overnight like you know er when i was doing my work at the centre the unemployed UNK centre
when i was involved in various projects i'd stay overnight so i'd be out of the house at least six hours a day
so it was just like i was working really except very poor wages like you know
erm i think the biggest problem we had in our marriage and the reason it broke up is because er i'm a UNK and i love to get involved
and anne isn't
she's the sort of woman that likes to stop at home and watch soap UNK and gossip about this person that person and the other person
with her friends like you know
erm and when she was talking to me about different people i'd never know who they was because i was never i was never that interested in bay to er to find out who they was or to remember she'd point out somebody and say that's so and so and then when she'd mention him a couple of days later i'd go who's that
you know
so i'd never get involved in the er in the UNK side of bay life
er consequently we couldn't talk about anything
she wasn't interested in my photography or er whatever i was involved in the centre
and i wasn't involved in the gossip in bay
we didn't stop talking like but the talk s just sort of UNK around the house and the kids and it didn't go any further than that
although i tried to get her interested in hobbies she just wasn't interested so
and i put that down to the biggest contribution
just a lack of interest in each other or
you did express some er anxiety if i remember when you spoke to me about erm not about not providing enough
mhm
for the for the family
we were you ever under any sort of direct pressure to keep the money
keep it coming in for whatever
erm th it seemed to UNK
there was pressure at times like er coming up to the start of a new season
obviously there was new school clothes that was needed
erm the UNK pressure erm from that for that sort of stuff was came form me
i felt i had to i when i went to school m my father couldn't afford very much and erm i remember starting the first term of first day of the term with shoes with a big split in it
and the headmaster taking me on stage and showing everybody what a bad example i was because i had shoes like UNK
and that made a big influence on me and i UNK it'd never happen to my kids
so the biggest pressure for that type of thing came from myself
i always made sure my daughter had new clothes to go to school with like you know
not just but in g in good order all the way through the year
so consequently at times there would be er periods of stress for myself where i just had to get enough money to give my daughter some new clothes like you know
and then there'd be clothes for anne
anne liked to feel that er although she wasn't a UNK any more that she was at least UNK dressed as well as the other women in bay like you know
myself i never worried about i was one of the biggest UNK you've ever seen in your life actually
erm looking back on the photographs
that was taken in the last few years er i j i i've never bothered about clothes in my entire life
what i look like
since i since i left school and i was able to afford my own clothes and i knew that erm a responsibility for my own clothing was on my own shoulders it has never bothered me since for myself
but it always UNK me for other people like you know
erm but no real stress
once anne had accepted the fact that i wasn't gonna work in the UNK future and it was her choice that we stay cos i gave her a clear choice it was either move away where i could get work or stay and suffer the wages of the dole like you know
and once she'd made the choice that she wanted to stay no matter what the consequences were as far as money were concerned well that was it
i didn't worry about that too much except just these periods when say a UNK come in or clothes were needed something like that
how did you solve the problem then of er
of providing
erm a lot of it was working on the side
er that is what you call the black economy yeah
yeah
er when it was needed it wa it was always needed in a hurry
although we had we had warning that erm obviously that you knew the kids were gonna start a new season in september you'd start saving the money and a bill would come up
something would come up you'd need the money
now i think i told you last time that er the whole time me and anne had been together we're not UNK
it's very rare we go out
we both smoke but er i smoke roll your own cigarettes and i and half an ounce lasts me a week
so it's not a big expense like you know so that we weren't spending the money on ourselves it's just needed in the house and needed for the kids like you know
erm we didn't waste money in any way
but when it when a bill came up and it would take away the money that we'd saved for UNK new school uniform so it always seemed to come in a rush and there was always something needed like you know
like next week you had a week or whatever and then i'd just go out and er ask me friends wh who's UNK whatever
i've done everything from working on a building site for a week and UNK to bring me cards in and giving a false name to er potato picking erm doing hay anything
there's a lot of it around there's people just a lot of people these days see the working on the side is a necessity
and UNK not just the people who are on the dole but the employers too
the local farmers erm building site contractors
they see it as a necessity
i was talking to a guy here now erm who comes to the centre about er two weeks ago
and he'd been on the dole er i think two years and he's just started up a building site
a contracting business and he's done it by the skin of his teeth
but he's done it he's sold his he's UNK his house up to the UNK and everything
and he won't employ he won't employ full time workers
he takes somebody and gives them the work on the side
and he doesn't pay them any less than he pays a qualified man
than he would pay a qualified man
he just won't do it
he says the guys on the dole need the work
he says i'll give it to them
i see
but he won't take anyone on full time for the simple fact that just takes one guy off the dole and makes his life good
whereas taking him taking one guy a week for a week is putting no one in UNK and giving somebody a decent wage for a week
he says i'd rather do that
so when you s use the word n necessary
yeah
you meant that they thought it was a good thing to do
yes
erm not a not a good thing to do when i when i said necessary without it a lot of people would er i don't know er UNK i don't want to make it say more drastic than it is
but myself i'd have had to send my daughter to school on m more than one occasion with a UNK uniform
and by working on the side wh which i say as very necessary to get her that uniform
it wouldn't have made any difference to my daughter's well being but it made a hell of a difference to her erm her social standing
to the other kids
wh which is a major thing
th this impression that i got or er erm that incident at school played such a big part in my life after that i was UNK embarrassed for the rest of my school life
by that one thing
everybody knew that incident
everybody used to call me UNK
and it stayed with me right until i left school
even though i changed school halfway through
erm our school was pulled down and three schools amalgamated into one big co comprehensive
and before the end of the first term everyone knew me as UNK
even the other two schools you know
so it's a thing that stayed with me for a long time
and that made a big difference to my life
erm to my self respect and i just i was determined that it wasn't going to happen to my daughter so in consequence i saw that working on the side to get to get the uniform so that she could go to school in a new uniform same as all the other kids as a necessity
er it wasn't a good thing it was just necessary
and a lot of people that i've spoken to who've had problems have turned to that alternative because they could see no other
if i'd have gone to the to the social services or er the d h s and says to them my daughter's got to have a new uniform to go to school with because her self respect is gonna suffer if she doesn't they wouldn't have given be nothing
they'd have just turned round and says well we can't help that i'm sorry
so i just went i knew i did the only thing that i knew i could do
and that's work on the side and hope to get away with it
and touch wood i've never been caught
you said that in the nature of things you've always needed the money almost as of yesterday
yeah
erm so you have to get work fairly quickly
yeah
when you er i mean you're in that er situation how do you cope with the idea that you need the money you need the job but you've got to somehow sell yourself and get employed on the best terms
yeah
well obviously you compromise
erm the most important thing was getting the money
so you didn't UNK
at all
if a guy i mean i've worked for farmers i actually worked for a farmer once from seven o'clock in the morning till nine o'clock at night for five quid
and that wasn't the first day that was eight days er eight days solid from sunday to the monday following monday
and i worked for him for five pound a day because we needed the money
and there was nothing else going
and that guy took advantage
he knew i needed the money and he knew he'd got me for a he'd have got me up at six o'clock in the morning if he'd have needed me
no problem at all
i was actually living on his farm at the time
and he used to get me up at seven o'clock come to work for him
he used to get me up at six to go in work for seven
and if he'd have needed me at six he'd have got me up at five
he used to give me an hours warning and then we'd work through until it got dark out in the fields and then we'd go into the sheds and UNK the hay or whatever he wanted to do
and he'd make sure he used me till about nine o'clock
he just knew he had cheap labour
i couldn't argue with that
there was nobody else to turn to
you know there was there was no other work going at that time
so i just put up with it and worked it
and we got the money
was there ever a moment when you f when you were striking the bargain if one could call it that
mm
when you when you knew that he'd got you by the short and UNK
oh yeah
definitely
all the time
you knew that he knew that
oh yeah it was so obvious yeah
erm this guy that i was working for h he's er he was quite well known for it in the area
erm that he w he knew that you needed the work
and consequently that's why he only p i mean i'm talking now about oh about four years ago
which is erm no i'm talking less than four years ago i'm talking three years ago maybe
and all the other farmers were paying the guys who were working for them on the side ten pound a day for working from nine o'clock in the morning till about five at night
and yet this guy was paying me f er half that for tw nearly twice as many hours yeah
erm he just knew it and he was well known for it
he was the last resort of anybody i knew
but if they needed it they knew they could always get work with him
the guy was taking on ten people at o he had ten people working for him in one day
all at five pound a day
and all working long hours
i've never heard of anyone working the hours i worked but then again i was living there and that was my disadvantage
he could get me any time
and he knew i didn't have to be home for the kids or whatever he knew my circumstances so well and he knew th exactly how much he could use me you know
and he wouldn't let me go at nine o'clock if he thought i hadn't have been UNK and ready to fall down you know
he'd have kept me there longer than that
so in fact he knew that he was known as the last resort
i'm not so sure that he knew he was known as the last resort
ah
but he knew he was well known for knowing that he'd got you
and when you come to him you were desperate for work
so he probably did realize that he was he was the last resort but i don't think he was the he was the type to actually think that out you know
he just saw you as cheap labour and that was the end of it
i don't think he actually thought about it
otherwise he his conscience would have bothered him i think
he was a terrible guy
since i saw you last has your has your girls gone to secondary school
no
she's still in er still in the small school
mhm
erm wh what other means did you use to ensure that there was this you know the family circumstances were kept up to par
erm well we sold things
did you
yeah we've had to sell things now and again
another extreme last resort
and that was the extreme last resort
erm oh god she sold the wedding rings
but that was quite early in the marriage that was
erm we've sold endless tape UNK and hi UNK
you name it we've sold it
we've had to
and then we've basically the only two the only thing i haven't turned is crime
if you don't call working on the side as a crime which i don't
erm i've never turned to stealing
it's been UNK in my mind a few times but the i UNK i wouldn't go to prison the first time
but you'd to me you don't you don't turn to stealing to do it for a one off
if you're gonna turn to stealing then from then on it's gonna be not the last resort any more it's gonna be one of the first UNK because it pays so much quicker
and in the circumstances i'm talking about where i would work on the side then it's always gonna be erm turning to the quickest resort rather than the last resort you know
so stealing being a quick resort you'd i'd f i know for a fact i'd find myself turning to it firstly and not lastly
which is wrong and i'll end up in prison
and that's where i don't want to be
and i've never wanted to be
although i have been there myself
but not for stealing for erm something else
so er i can't think of any other UNK i've turned to
you
no
you talk er you know when you were saying that you'd erm you'd sold an endless succession of things wh when you bought things er you know when you were married it was there always that element in it that it was here for a just
a short while
a short while
that used to be mentioned between us er a few times i can remember it being mentioned a few times
i wonder how long we'll have this one
erm er i think it wasn't really a problem
erm it could have been a problem if we'd have both been so me UNK that we wanted to keep everything we'd got hold of you know
but we knew that it was probably inevitable
but we knew that also that erm if it had to go i t had to go
i if it was necessary then it would go same as everything else
everything else would go too
erm but one thing i would say is that erm we didn't go into long term erm debt to get things like three pieces and bedroom suite and things like this
i suppose we could have pushed ourselves and got these things but i think we both knew that erm if we did we'd probably have to sell them halfway through paying for them
and end up the same circumstances we was now er with out the stuff that we'd we were paying for the next six months of the year
so this was mentioned in fact i think at one stage
we had so many conversations about economy and all this er can't really remember
i think it was mentioned once
when er when the time came that you decided that er y you and your tape UNK whatever had to part company how do you how would you go about trying to get the best price for them
erm i don't think it was it was that difficult actually
er being on the dole and having friends who were long term on the dole we tend to buy from each other a lot
ah
so all you'd do is you'd cast about for a friend you'd decide on a price that you would accept and if it was a friend if you had to sell it and you needed fifteen quid to buy a pair of shoes or whatever erm and you'd like twenty you'd turn to a mate and go have you got twenty quid and he he'd say yes or no
if he says yes then he's holding the tape recorder if he said no you'd say have you got fifteen
and er he'd maybe say yes and he'd get it for fifteen you know
but i've always had at least ten friends who are long term unemployed and we've always bought each other 's stuff
you know he i i've even bought m my own tap er no it was a wireless
i had erm an eight ba er eight band wireless which i bought for a hundred and twenty quid when i was working
erm when i first came out the army
paid a hundred and twenty pound for it
i sold it once when i was UNK for fifty quid that was before i was married
erm and while i was married i bought it back for twenty and a few months later i sell it for ten pound
to the same guy that i'd bought it for twe er for twenty off
mm
so you know
and he'd bought it off his friend who'd paid fifty for it
so i couldn't i couldn't charge him twenty cos he'd only charged me he'd only charged me twenty so i had to sell him back to him for a UNK you know
but er this hundred and twenty pound radio was knocking away for a five quid in the end er i er i heard
and it was an UNK it was an excellent radio
it really was an excellent radio
that's just the way it goes you know
so er there was er a market for there was a market for all this
yes definitely
amongst er really a small group a relatively small group
yeah erm of course er some you'd sold it to you might have other friends who you didn't have as friends
yeah
so it would slip out of the group
right
you know
erm but like i say w er i'd have always had about ten friends who i would buy things off and they would buy things off me and they're all on the dole
it's very rare you you'll find actually somebody who's working who would who would buy these things off somebody unemployed because they'd expect too much off them
you know
er like if i was selling somebody who was employed i erm i had a radio if i was willing to accept twenty pounds off a friend of mine who was unemployed i'd expect thirty of a guy who was working
i wouldn't charge i i'd try and get as much as i could off him cos he was working
and he'd know that and he m he probably wouldn't buy it off me
because he knows that somebody else has been offered it for twenty quid
or at least it will go for twenty quid in the end if he doesn't buy it
so he won't buy it
that's what i've always found anyway
so when it came to er i haven't really asked you whether you found the process of selling painful
but i just assumed that it was
yeah
not at all
wasn't it
never been that attached
no
to things UNK no
do you think the blow such as it was in s selling something was it would it have been UNK because you s there was a you knew the people you were selling to
i mean if you had to take it along to a shop and
erm that's fu it is it's a funny question that because i've never liked selling to shops
i've always much preferred to sell it to friends
erm so i suppose you could be right
i suppose you could be right and i was feeling an a er an actual blow but not something i've ever thought about or never put into words like you know
i've never actually thought about that
i couldn't really have done it
it's not something i would have considered
i've always i've always felt if i thought it was necessary then that's the end of it er as far as i know
er i haven't realized any feelings of erm you know er sadness over selling it or anything like that
it's always just been necessary and there it goes you know
so you could be right i don't know
i don't really know
erm when you er had to stock up again wh h how would you do that
where would they come from
erm usually new
we'd buy new
even though we'd sold it for a UNK low
when we were UNK again and we could afford something you'd get it from a catalogue or whatever
erm we'd just buy new i suppose
but occasionally well not occasionally but quite often at least once or twice a week you'd hear of somebody who is in the UNK business they'd got something for sale and you could get that quite cheap
and that was another source of stuff
erm that might have been as well another reason for selling to friends erm because most of the stuff we bought anyway was new so that doesn't really come into it
but if it was hot or semi hot we used to sell it to friends anyway we wouldn't sell it to a shop
cos the same thing still apply because most of the stuff was new but we had of hot stuff over the years like
which is another for of necessity
er as i see it
i'd never turn anyone in that turned to stealing
unless of course they UNK from people i know didn't deserve it
mostly shops and not as easy targets or not as UNK targets but just as targets
if they started UNK from old people and things like that
erm were you under any er any pressure to accept erm g goods that had been acquired by indirect roots
erm
no
you weren't at all
no
i mean they there was a fact that they knew you were unemployed er or wasn't in any s you were yours yourself a target
yeah
erm i wasn't aware of it
i wasn't aware of it at all ever
i'd just be offered same as e most of my friends and other people that are UNK were offered
mhm
and you ei you had a chance to say yes or no
if you said no that was the end of it
erm the only thing i've never considered buying hot is camera gear
er because the i say photography is er something i'm gonna ca continue with and if i start buying hot gear then i can't use my equipment where and when i'd want to
you have to be careful where you're taking it and all the rest of it
so er i've never considered that
i've found myself under pressure to say yes when somebody's brought along a nice new UNK camera and er i just c couldn't accept it
but no one's ever put me under pressure
not that i'm aware of anyway
you er last time i saw you were i didn't know whether you'd been starting up in er in photography but you had been next door i think or i'd seen a lot of your stuff
yeah
but you w you w you were getting into it and you had high hopes for developing your work
that's right yeah i was also er doing a bit for a guy in at the time
erm things didn't work out that way because he found he was er could do cheaper himself
well not so much cheaper cos i was most of the time i was doing it for nothing anyway
erm he got his own interest er and in the end he decided on all his own stuff like you know
i UNK i suppose it was cheaper in a way because erm he found himself in the shop a lot more he couldn't afford the staff that he had he had used to have two people working for him
he had to let one go so he was in the shop a lot himself
and there wasn't really enough work for two people
erm so he set up the corner as a UNK and started doing playing about with his with his own black and white printing
so er i fell off with that one
erm i lost interest in photography f er after a while because the er the photography at the centre there's always been ever since i joined there's been six of us who had er a l a lasting thing with photography
there'd be other people come and had we'd show them round the UNK and teach them how to print how to take pictures and as soon as they knew how to do that they'd fall off and go away
and we st we tried to start up well i tried to start up erm a sort of self help workshop where we all we got materials off the centre they supplied the materials
we went out we took photographs we come back we printed them up and we helped each other to learn more techniques and whatever
we all read books and passed on what we learnt to the others
there was only two of us that showed any interest at all in that and that was the guy that was working here he was running the photography and myself
the rest of them just e didn't put anything into it at all
and er i just lost interest all together and stopped doing it
i was i used to come up here every week anyway cos i had friends here but erm i never er i didn't take pictures for months and months and months
so that really fell off
and it's only just lately since i split with the wife er i took a couple of months to sort myself out
cos although it was an UNK split i still needed time to settle down and get used to the fact that i was on my own again
erm kids
and UNK sort out which direction i was going
and after i got the job at the centre erm that took up a lot of time for er a few weeks till i settled down
and then i r i realized that the job was only gonna last a year cos it's only a year job so the best thing i can do is to go all out for what i wanna do when i leave the centre
so i'm using every resource i can a at the centre to push my photography at the moment
hoping that by august next year UNK come of this photography and i can walk straight into a maybe go to a college or if that isn't on the cards into some sort of a technical lab or something
something that'll keep me going in photography anyway
i don't think i'm good enough to set up on my own
i don't know what august will bring but i don't think so
but at the moment i'm really pushing on the er erm portrait photography cos i'm quite good at that
see what that com see what comes of that
you s you said that you're using every resource
mhm
within the centre
how
yeah
yeah
erm what i'm doing basically is er putting on as many exhibitions as i can using the UNK name and making sure that i've got a good amount of my work in there although i don't push anybody else out
they don't really contribute as much as they could so that leaves me with an awful lot of space
so i push as much of my stuff over as i can
erm i used the UNK resources like the phones and that for phoning round
er the various exhibition places asking about that and making sure they all know my name
i write them letters i get people to send er like photo gallery in cardiff erm i rang them up they were sending us stuff and it was addressed to a woman that used to be in the UNK er activities officer about UNK three years ago
or even four years ago four years ago
and nobody bothered changing it because the UNK still coming in anyway nobody's changed the name
so i rang up and changed the name to my name so that sh the women who runs photo gallery in cardiff now knows that ken runs the photography group in holyhead so she knows my name now
and she rang up here when they offered us the space she rang up here and asked for me
which is a step in the right direction she knows my name
so th that's the sort of thing i'm doing
and the place is used a lot erm like the local UNK council meet here and i make sure that i open up for them
cos they meet on an evening that we're not used
the UNK not used like next wednesday they're coming here
and i make sure that i'm here and i open up for them and i make them a cup of tea
so the local UNK council all know me and i think they all like me as well so
anyway i can push myself forward with the local people and w an anybody with anything to do with photography
that's what i do
using everything i can get
i've also i forgot to mention when you said i has anything happened to you
i also have done some work for the local papers as well
i was at one time er the UNK printer not the photographer but the printer for erm a free hand out paper called the UNK
i used to do all their printing for them for their UNK
just needs to be erm back again
yeah i was doing their printing for them and er i've also taken a few shots for the UNK
and one or two for the mail
erm so that way as well like you know
you said that erm photo gallery is it in cardiff
yes
had allocated you some space
that's right yeah
no
is it a pr is it a prestigious
yeah it's very prestigious actually erm er a local photographer who was helping us to run the er the photography workshop we call it not a class because we don't teach formally we just work together and help each other out
erm he is a very good landscape photographer e er in a same style as UNK adams who's his hero
and he does very good work
excellent work
and he does twenty by sixteen prints you know er which he tries to sell
he isn't selling very many i don't know why
erm he wrote to photo gallery and asked them for er an exhibition date and they gave him one in nineteen ninety
so for them to actually come and ask for our work to be UNK er UNK there is excellent
but it's not just erm it's not just this unemployed UNK centre they're asking ten they want ten unemployed UNK centres throughout wales to contribute work
but what we're doing is making sure that ours is gonna be the best there like you know
that's what we're trying for anyway
cos we haven't seen the rest yet
but er that's what we're hoping for
but it's v er everybody's trying to get in there
erm lots of new UNK there and lots of the old established UNK there
er UNK has just had one there
oh yes
so you know
and at the moment we're on the ninth of this month i received a copy today they s they sent me some material erm they've actually been given photographs by people like er UNK adams UNK er david er bailey
couldn't remember his name
good god he'd never forgive me
david bailey er they've all given prints for them to sell to help the funds out at the ce at the er photo gallery
so that's how prestigious it is like you know there
everybody uses it
and a lot of people go there to have a look
a lot of the UNK you know
so it's a it's a good place to be
no doubt about it
so you've got the er somehow the idea of a career has formed
yeah
erm i wouldn't say it's an idea i'd say it's a hope
a great hope
i'm hoping to do it
what i what i'd really hope for is to be able to do it without having to go to college and just do it by experience but that's i'd have to be awful good
especially as i don't like colour and i only like black and white
i hate colour photography
erm i don't just hate the thought of doing i just i don't like colour photographs at all
they don't do anything for me at all
i love the UNK range in black and white
so erm i'm hoping to be able to do it just off what i can do m my experience as it is like
or what it will be by the time i've finished this job
but it's a it's a hard field to break into
it really is
and i think the most i'll get out of it at least for a few years is local portrait photography
it'll only be after i've m met a few people and photographed them well that maybe my name will be start to be mentioned around that is another reason for UNK the UNK council and any other councillors that come in
and th any other UNK that come in
i er i court them a lot
and when my technique has improved because i i've as i said i've just started getting back into po portrait photography and i forgot a lot of what i learnt before
now when that's improved enough i'm gonna start asking these councillors and that if i can take their photograph
and when i've done a spot on photograph for them when somebody else is mentioning a photograph you know er to go up in the town hall or whatever er they the local mayor has just had one done by one of the guys in the workshop and i know for a fact i could do one that's ten times better than that
but i haven't said so obviously
you don't do that sort of thing
erm but i'm hoping that one day he'll see i know he's seen my work and i think i've got a UNK suspicion that when he came in here he was gonna ask me to do it
erm but he got he got UNK by this guy and they were talking and he mentioned a photograph and he got in like you know
i w i wouldn't swear on that but i think that's what happened
cos he was looking at me when he come in
and he was moving in my direction although i didn't know he was coming in for a photograph
erm and it was only afterwards reflecting on it i think he was coming to me
er cos he had seen he had seen two or three of my prints
but he hasn't seen the rest
and i think that once i've taken e a few of the local UNK then when they want a photograph taken my UNK get mentioned somewhere along the line and they might come to me
i you mentioned going to college or rather not going to college
mm
yeah
erm is it something you want to avoid or so or not
erm i'd re i'd really like the experience and the knowledge that i could learn at college but i'd like to take a short cut too
i'd like to work in photography now instead of you know erm going to college and spending four years at college
i don't see it as a waste of time but i see it as erm as may be an as a n a necessary delay
i do see it as a delay even though w i'm gonna learn and my UNK improve a hundred percent
i'm just hoping that i could learn as i'm as i'm earning you know
well not earning but learn as i'm actually working in photography like
i'd like to work with er a good photographer rather than go to college
i reckon i could learn a lot more
i dislike i dislike the idea of learning in a in a formal class
i like the idea of learning on the job you know
that appeals to me a lot more
but it's hard to do
you s you you've UNK er you you've sort of g given an impression that er this er this the centre h depends if you want to get a lot out of it you've really got to sort of work at it quite hard to er bring it up to anything together
i d didn't quite understand that
missed a word there
in the sense that er you say that you had a camera club
yeah
or
aha
erm but it really depended the persons who really got the stuff out of it was just two people in the end
that's true yeah that's because the others weren't willing to put in
the s working at the centre i can tell you that one of the especially being the activities officer which is what i am one of the biggest problems with the centre is not being able to put things on it's getting people to be interested in them
there's an awful lot of UNK in holyhead
i used to say beforehand but i wasn't as totally convinced as i am now
i am totally convinced that the people in holyhead want you to put things on pick them up at the door drop them off teach them how to do it er and drop them back again
and that's the only way they consider going
we've had to cancel five classes that we set up erm in november
five different classes we had to cancel because nobody turned up
er one of them i was running myself which is on maintenance
er which is a something that a lot of people mention to me
you know er oh i wish i could learn how to change a p put on a plug properly
or change a fuse or mend a chair
whatever
so i've done all this i'm quite a UNK in the house so we talked about it at the UNK at the centre here and we actually asked another guy to do it who's erm sixty odd and he comes in here everyday er and he was willing to start it or to run it
and we was gonna when we saw the interest when the when it was proved there was enough people coming we were gonna buy him the tools for that to do the job properly
erm the buy who was gonna do it unfortunately has eye trouble and er towards the beginning of the start quite near to the start his er eye trouble picked up a lot more
and he couldn't do it he couldn't concentrate
so i took it over no problem at all
and i was running it and the first week i got there and one guy turned up
and he turned up because he turns up for everything
no matter what it us you know
so i taught him how to change a fuse
it took me two hours to cha to teach him how to change a fuse an and erm w wasn't only how to change a fuse but the correct fuse for the correct appliance like you know
so i taught him that the first week and the second week we went back and there was still only him so it i taught him how to UNK a plug how to do it properly and er went back a third week and he was s still the only one there so we went through it again see if he'd picked it up and he hadn't so
now he can ch he can actually wire a plug properly
which is a UNK
because the way he was wiring them to start with would have killed somebody in the end
so he got something out of it but he was the only one that ever turned up
and i went there four weeks
and nobody turned up for it
and yet eve er quite a lot of people had mentioned it and it was well advertised
one of my jobs here is to erm is to sell the centre in a sense
and we use newspapers we don't use the television because we can't get on it
er i actually make whichever comes up i make a poster for it and i UNK the town with them
e there's hardly a shop ion holyhead you can go into wh which hasn't got one of my posters in it for something or other like you know
and usually for all of them
which is a lot of posters
erm and just people just they just won't come
they just don't like to get involved in something which is ongoing for a few weeks you know
the main thing seems to be sport
the young guys will come for the sport the young unemployed
erm but if this trend continues i can see them shooting down the activities side of this place and just using it as an advice centre
cos there's already a s a UNK centre
and er
and if we're doing the same thing they're gonna s sooner of later they're gonna click and they're gonna say well you know that's too much of a good thing like you know
shut one of them down it'll probably be us
see it coming
it's a terrible place this
you've erm you've indicated that er you used the word a UNK
is i mean i do you think it the fact that there is it is an area of high unemployment has anything to do with it at all
erm i really don't know
i couldn't say actually
it's something i've obviously thought a lot about
because my job depends on it
m my job depends on getting them in here
the more people i get in and get involved in classes the better it's gonna look at the end of the year
erm i've obviously though about it quite a lot and i can't figure out a reason for it
i can't say that it's high unemployment be i don't know what's unemployment got to do with it
if they've got free time
yeah
if people are gonna sit around the house while they're unemployed they're probably the same people who sit around the house when they're on a saturday and sunday when they're working you know
they just don't do anything with a saturday and sunday
i've known loads of people who are working full time and they come home friday and the go out friday night stand up at the bar and drink twenty pints or whatever ten pints
and they go home and they don't move out the house until monday morning
terrible people
i don't know i just can't understand what drives these people at all
i couldn't live an existence like that
i've got to get something out of life
you know besides the fact that i wanna work when i'm when i'm not working i still like to get out the house and get involved in something
otherwise you there's no point
i co i couldn't i couldn't go to work monday and friday monday to friday and then spend all the weekend in the house and then just go to work monday to friday again and do that week in and week out
there's no i can't see what's in life for em at all
it's terrible
but that's seems to be what a lot of the people round here do
i know for a fact my own brother and i mentioned this before the last interview
he spent seven years just sitting on his UNK in the house
and he ruled his house with a rod of iron you know
every decision that was made in the house was his wife had no say in it
er he said what was gonna be cooked for tea he said when there was a cup of tea made
his house was in his entire kingdom
and he didn't want anything else
for seven years he didn't want anything else
and then he moved to holyhead
erm and he started coming to this centre he came to the centre once or twice with my other brother for some advice i think welfare right advice
and then he bought a computer to use in the house nowhere else like s it was still his house was his kingdom
and he found he couldn't handle it
so hearing there was computer classes here he started coming and he didn't like it and he stopped
and then after a couple of weeks he still couldn't get on with his computer so he came back
and he stayed and now he drops in here most days of the week and he practically runs the computer class in there
and he actually UNK with people which is something he's never done
that guy has never mixed with people and yet now he just he UNK with everybody
so this centre has actually changed his life
and his attitude a hell of a lot
but like i say for seven years he just sat and didn't want to do nothing
and a lot of people are like that
has the has the centre in any sense erm political UNK
erm again that's a hard question because i'm thoroughly non political absolutely non political
erm i know for a fact that peter who who's the supervisor erm is a UNK and er union man same as geoff but neither of them push it
er the UNK supposed to be totally non political and if it ever got political they'd close us down
the same as they did with the one in bangor they closed that down for being political
er some of the comments political i suppose yeah
but there's no erm there's no sort of political influence at all
that i can see
but me being me i could miss it
because it goes straight over my head anyway
if it was subtle
unless it was out and out screaming let's kill thatcher i wouldn't even notice it i don't think
so you're asking the wrong person i'm afraid for that one
you you'd have to be very er very hard line for me to notice it
ah yes
yeah i'll have to go
thank you very much ken
excellent
well i hope i've been of some help
yes you have indeed
john former associate of the UNK we were offered details of his criminal record for four hundred pounds
UNK general secretary of britain's largest trades union secrets of his credit card and bank account are on sale for two hundred pounds
sarah someone who UNK guards her privacy we bought some of her secrets too and everyone's personal details can be bought
tonight UNK asks how save are your secrets
personal information about us once typed on record cards or UNK into filing cabinets is now kept on computer information which once even the bank manager or doctor couldn't find is now accessible to thousands through a computer keyboard and everyday this information is UNK sold to employers investigating potential and current employees to companies investigating competitors and customers and to anyone willing to pay in a trade which grows UNK daily
literally dozens of companies in britain deal in personal data
earlier this year one of them approached us
robert said he could reveal the secrets of people's credit card and bank accounts health and criminal records national insurance and tax details and ex directory telephone numbers
so we decided to test these claims
nowadays there's an enormous amount of information about us kept in computers and there are laws which certainly sound as though they should stop it falling into UNK hands
despite this there is a growing market in the sale of personal data as companies and employers try to find out the details of our personal lives
but how do they do it
to find out four people all well known in their fields agreed to let us find the details of their financial health police and other records
the results of our investigation are deeply disturbing no individual in the country can be sure that their secrets are safe banks and other data holders seem UNK to stop the growth in this trade and the government is UNK to crack down on it
we started our investigation by asking robert to come and see us we prepared for his visit by hiding a camera in this umbrella which lay on top of a brief case
financial UNK
settled down with a cup of tea robert explained how easy it was to UNK the databases of britain collecting details of people's private lives
there's not a great deal of danger of detection is there
no there's not i mean i've been doing this for fifteen years and quite simply is if you like i've been up the ladder the contacts that were i've had were relatively junior fifteen years ago
yeah
are reasonably senior and the great thing is once they do you one favour that's it and it's better because rather than have for example a junior police officer who has no idea of covering his tracks
mm
the people that i deal with are d t is and stuff like that
yeah
and they make sure they every time they do something like this there UNK on the line there job's on the line
quite
they make sure that they cover their tracks completely
none of their yeah
absolutely no chance of detection
right
we told that we had to do some preliminary research for possible television programmes
he said that he who gives a service is worthy of his hire
one of the subjects of our investigation was high profile leader of the low paid UNK head of the trades union unison
you won't move over and let a labour government introduce a national minimum wage
his salary is a matter of public record but we wanted to discover the truth about his bank account
we are interested in you know in his finances
mhm
and how much he has in the bank you know how he stands with his credit card so on and so forth
erm we don't know where he banks but we do know his home address
that's alright
erm so i just that's the first i mean how easy is this going to be do you think and
reasonably easy and reasonably UNK
to pick up his bank and credit card details and to check them out assuming we've got a current address
yeah
erm we're talking under two hundred pounds
right okay
and so how long does it take
anywhere between three and five days
and indeed within the week was on the phone with the details of 's bank balance
a few days later he came to the office to give his report in person
right that one
this lot i say it's amazing isn't it
these are all balances as at what day was yesterday
either wednesday evening
he's just got one account at midland has he
yep
yeah
this is a copy of the letter they sent if you'd like to look at it in your own time and tell whether the information in it is correct
bank correct sort code i wouldn't know i assume it is balance is er correct er the cards erm i mean the UNK correct apart from er saying it's a UNK card but in principle yeah i mean all that is correct
seeing it there the n the y name of your bank the fact that amount that's in the account the er gon details of your credit card what's your response to that
i am just UNK that it's so easy obviously to get into these er accounts and the health records as well er i mean there really bright here mr has no criminal record i don't know where they went for that it's true it's nice to have it er made public but er where did they go to get that information
police records
erm er it's er it's obviously annoying for me personally er but the worst thing about it is that it can be done at the drop of a hat you say i want information on x and they say yes we can provide
and they do provide er h i mean i know we want an open society but that's ridiculous
's bank in UNK was just one of 's targets we do not know exactly how he managed to UNK their security but he was undoubtedly helped by the fact that his main business is debt collecting and he numbers most of the big banks among his clients
this gives him an UNK knowledge of the way in which banks operate and contacts inside them
i mean it's a case of er if you like a back UNK exercise i've got one contact down bank which for no real UNK money or anything else
mm
i've helped develop his department into the best UNK department in britain as far as the banks are concerned
yeah in terms of the response rate
yeah
that he gets yeah
he's got he's got an excellent department and he's kept it within the UNK old fashioned nineteenth century guidelines
yeah
and i mean the everybody in the debt collection industry talks of this department
i've done it for a number of smaller companies and charged a fortune for it
yeah
but this guy i haven't cos this guy can get me a great deal of information
yeah
and also supplies me a great deal of work
this back UNK may include taking data directly from the banks computer but more often it provides details of the UNK systems which makes it easier for the enquiry agent to embark on the well timed UNK
the best time of day would be between twelve noon and three thirty or four o'clock this is a time when the manager is generally out having one of his long UNK er the assistant manager would probably return to the bank about round about two thirty and the situation in the bank er between these times would be that there would be only a handful of staff usually junior staff on duty who are more susceptible to passing information than the senior staff
and it's not just a problem for the UNK branches it's a similar one for the credit card companies at southend
they know about the UNK release of personal data they have procedures to try and protect data but there is a commercial UNK to keep customers happy when they have a problem with their credit card
what you do not want to be told is erm sorry you've got to come down in person to our offices they're in southend by the way erm please bring along your UNK certificate d n a chart and UNK signed by erm the spiritual leaders of at least three merger major world religions
what you want is to be able to answer a few sensible questions UNK identifying you the trouble is there's probably a UNK of only ten of those questions you're going to get asked three or four of them but those questions your date of birth your telephone number the er address of your bank and so on and so forth if you're a private detective you can get those you can have them on a sheet of paper and you can pretend to be whoever you like
incredibly UNK of this sort to get hold of data is not a criminal UNK in this country there is no law as such which makes it illegal to steal information and the main piece of legislation the data protection act contains a massive UNK it only applies to the holders of information not to third parties trying to get their hands on it
under the act the holder of information has to UNK the type of information they hold where they've got it from and who they intend to UNK it to
this is the entry for one of the big banks they're entitled to UNK information to a whole host of organizations like debt collecting companies credit reference agencies private detectives and so on
a UNK of data under the act is only UNK if they UNK give it to someone who is not entitled to it
there's not a lot the act can do in terms for example of UNK people who use UNK it may just be possible i've been advised but it's extremely difficult from an UNK and other point of view to do that
the act really sets out to control the computer users who have information on all of us or on individuals generally and their servants or agents their employees and so on it doesn't set out to control these third parties
the computer UNK act sounds like another law which might help it's enforced at this police unit in london but it too seems UNK to stop UNK or UNK their way to get hold of personal data
the computer UNK act is aimed at criminal activity it was primarily aimed at people who either UNK into other computers or UNK the computers that are in front of them
it did not aim for the situation that we've been discussing where people are trying to get the information
now because of course we now have more computers in society than we ever did before and we don't have lots of paper files before us UNK invariably the information is being held upon the computer
so we ourselves as members of the public erm we don't have the formal protection in law probably that we should have
it is aimed either at the external UNK of which there are far fewer than press reports suggest or at the employee who though they have legitimate access legitimate UNK limited access to a computer nevertheless go beyond that UNK but in order for the act to be successful in order to get a successful prosecution the prosecution have got to show that the access was UNK and in the absence of clear codes of conduct clear on screen messages that can be quite tricky
so there is no the two acts that people might think have some roll in stopping this do not
do not actually provide the protection that people think
so is there any sort of protection in the law
no
banks don't like to admit that there employees let secrets escape from their computers which is possibly why none of the individual banks were willing to appear in this programme
privately they know it happens
but it's not just financial details which are for sale you can buy virtually anyone's employment details as we found out
UNK
darling i'm home
naomi is an UNK known for her part in the UNK henry show
have a nice day at the office dear
hello parks and gardens yeah i'd like to report a missing flower bed
UNK
like many in her profession her work is UNK and with her permission in august we asked robert to try to get hold of her employment details
saying it with flowers
quickly obliged
he told us that at the time was unemployed and within a few days he even gave the date and place where she signed on for unemployment benefit
i don't know when you got this at that time it was correct that i was no longer working that i'd finished working for as it says here er bill UNK company on the fourth of september
that's correct then is it
that's absolutely correct yes
er as is my tax reference number and my national insurance number
both of those numbers are correct
absolutely correct
god erm
now subsequent to erm us getting that letter they told us that you er you'd signed on
is that correct
yes
they told us within three days of your signing on
my go what within three days
they what they knew after i'd had my fresh claim interview or something like that
mm
but how it's so sh how
basically what happens when you start signing on is you go into a national unemployment computer and that national unemployment computer will pick up as long as you've got the date of birth and the national insurance number you can pick up when a person started signing o and where they're signing you then check with the local office to see what address they're claiming from and what their claiming for and everything else
also managed to gain access to yet another computer he got her ex directory telephone number
worrying for her and the twenty percent of the population who are ex directory
like many people some years ago was UNK by nuisance telephone calls
everybody gets phone calls like that unfortunately occasionally but it kind of i went through a phase of it happening to me so i therefore had to change my phone number because it was er it was really unpleasant being UNK er up by these calls
and how long has that particular number been your ex directory number
er probably about three years and i've had no dodgy calls
there are private inquiry agents who offer the service of getting hold of people's ex directory telephone numbers
how are they able to do that
right erm that's something that i don't really think i should erm reply to even though we are aware of the situation and are taking steps to identify the problem and put a stop to it
but it is something that you recognize as a problem
oh yes obviously we need to keep our data secure
well it's a threat to your personal safety
absolutely i mean i feel more so about my phone number and address my phone number particularly erm you know money's money and so what but when it's when it's your personal safety i think i think it's appalling
the an ex directory number is available to lots of other people erm you if you were ex directory yourself would give your ex directory number to friends family maybe work colleagues maybe er you might fill in forms UNK and you may put your phone number down on that salesmen
so you think that the number of instances where it's your s your security that fails are really relatively small when people get hold of ex directory numbers
yes i do i think it's very tightly controlled within b t
do you think it's at all possible that anybody who has this number like presumably your agent has it or friends have it is it at all possible anyone would have given it out to somebody
no because everybody who has it is aware of the fact that you know they've se known that i've changed my number before and they know why
if a b t employee did UNK information against all their training and against the rules that we've got in place in b t then we would obviously take that very seriously indeed and erm dismissal would no doubt follow if it was found that th the person had disclosed information
we've got the see if you can get us this number and nine times out of ten he comes back and says here it is and on the tenth occasion he'll come back and say too risky
the risk which a b t employee runs for UNK is a criminal prosecution
the same UNK is also meant to protect criminal records in the police national computer but even here it's not a sufficient deterrent
is this sort of out of the question or
no we can pick up on a criminal record if he's got it
right i mean i don't want to sort of UNK into how you do your business that the in the getting of that information that's that is relatively straightforward is it
yes it is it's literally frightening a police contact erm that simple
yep i see
it's relatively straightforward his own computer will give access to it
right
to test this claim we set on john
well we want that
UNK got it
i've got it
tim
thanks very much mr
UNK you want wine you want wine
no
well it's not mine never drink when i'm working
once an associate of criminals such as the UNK and UNK he has a number of convictions for violent crime
but now living in south london he hasn't been behind bars for ten years
just finished
good on ya
there you see a man that works in UNK you don't see many of them
you agreed that we could try for the purposes of this program to find out what we could about your criminal record and also about your health records
yes
things that are not available to the public generally
well i was shocked when i heard that yours whi yours you yours would attempt to you got my permission yes but i'd be highly surprised if you got them
's criminal record along with five million others is stored here on the police national computer based at UNK
in these data banks are also vehicle details UNK descriptions and a vast amount of other information
this can be UNK within seconds by police officers across the country
the senior police officer with overall responsibility for data protection is john
it is most important that the people have confidence in the way in which police handle this data
why do you think it's important it does remain confidential though i mean why shouldn't all this be you know in the public UNK anyway
well now there's a question which raises the whole problem of privacy
erm that in fact one of the odd points here is that when a person is convicted that information is public but nevertheless as the years go by and indeed er this has been recognized in for instance the UNK of offenders act it becomes private information and if someone's looking for a job the fact that he was convicted of an offence many years ago should not be er relevant
hold on one moment and i'll just check for you
and to keep this sort of information confidential those operating the p n c have to follow a detailed compliance manual
every enquiry and who made it is UNK and there are regular spot checks but still information UNK out
but their have been UNK of the system haven't there i mean there have been occasions
oh i would be it would be nonsense to say that there hasn't been UNK of the system sometimes through the UNK of an officer sometimes certainly in the initial stage because of their lack of awareness of the er provisions of the act
but i think that has now been tightened up and indeed the log of which i speak and the audit manual has indeed increased the awareness of officers increased their care in the handling of personal data and the number of complaints is in fact reducing
these measures may make getting information off the p n c more difficult but they do not make it impossible
more than one and a half thousand local police stations have online access to the computer
when we prepared for our next visit to the secret camera was hidden in a jacket the lens behind a badge in the UNK
relaxed and UNK in his office explained how he used a local policeman to obtain details from 's criminal record on the police national computer
so is that off the p n c ultimately or all from his local
no that's off the p n c it i mean it's obviously through his local police station but it's off the national computer
right
but our guy very i mean basically what happened is our guy waited till a senior officer went into the screen
mm
erm when he was asked about and stood over his shoulder and trying to take mental notes
yeah yes
if there's a lot there hard to take the note i suppose
yeah
i mean it's cos it's not of course as we know it's not a secret that he has one it's just a question of exactly what it is it's the
yeah
erm
that's it
i don't know i mean these are definitely the sentences
what we were told about that your criminal record is that you had convictions for armed robbery and UNK assault is that out of the record that you were aware of is that correct
yes i'm that is correct yes but th this is just amazing to me that er this th this can happen you know what i mean
but there are companies who advertise in yellow pages that they will do investigations on behalf of employers of future employees
and when you talk to them they will say we can find out whether they've got a criminal record or not how can they offer that service in the public UNK without having access to your computer
the service which is provided by those people is in fact UNK and indeed we ourselves would be interested in how in fact they obtain that information
but it wasn't only criminal records we were interested in we said we wanted 's medical records too
his health record for someone that does this sort of work his health is terrible
without the knowledge of 's g p obtained information from his medical files
there's a reference there to you being referred by her to UNK district hospital
yes
erm for a certain treatment in october ninety two and ag also more recently is that correct
yes that's correct yes
that's correct and that the further down i mean it says that er there is a er it says that the reason you've had been the reason you've been sent for this treatment is because of er a particular condition you've got
yes
yeah that's correct
yes straight
and the la i think the last paragraph which is er refers to some advice that has been given to you
advised by his doctor to give up straight to give up smoking
yes
and give up drink yes that's right yes
so all of that information matches
aye yeah that's that i mean i've went to that doctor and it's like a doctor's surgery surely is should be sacrament yo you shouldn't know what i mean
medical confidentiality you're just sitting there with bloody a private conversation we that i went for treatment with my doctor and the recommendations that she's given me in well what's the point er what er what's going on
now why i mean do you think it matters that these things are so that these things are so that these things which we thought were in you know private to you and not available to other people so easily why do you think it matters that they actually are apparently in return for mo payment are available to anyone
it's UNK that means that people in this country have got no privacy at all
none whatsoever they can can't even have a confidentiality with a UNK
if that's the day they'll be telling me they can get documentation now from UNK in the UNK that'll be the next bloody thing you'll be telling me i can't under you know what i mean what's it all about
although 's g p herself did not release the health records getting hold of such data seems to be an easy task for the private investigator
at the beginning of september we asked robert to investigate our fourth target sarah
and i don't know whether her health records will be of relevance or not really erm it's much more likely the health records of her daughter who's called UNK
right
erm and UNK she's called
mhm
erm would be of you know could be of relevance
okay
yeah
no problem
it should have been a problem because the personal details of UNK are meant to be secret under the terms of a high court UNK granted in the middle of last month sarah is not allowed to discuss anything about her daughter with anyone other than her legal and medical advisors
they have information about UNK about my daughter which i do not i cannot imagine how they have obtained it i am absolutely UNK
i spent the past nine and a half years doing everything i can to keep everything about my daughter secret
they have the name and address of the school she goes to i goodness this is UNK
i had my daughter treated under an assumed name until she was five to try and prevent the press from finding out things about her and they have the secret name that i used for here in here
it is believed that this surname is used by her mother to divert attention from her
the names of my g ps and their address when i was last seen or when UNK i suppose their talking about UNK was last seen by our g p
UNK this is wicked it's UNK but i'm absolutely UNK now i'm not allowed to speak about her because that's going to be harmful to her but any tom dick or harry can get information which they have no right to about her and about me about anybody else and can UNK it
seems to have got most of his information about sarah from the data held at her local family health services authority in bristol registered under the data protection act it holds a large amount of information on patients within its area including the name and address of a UNK doctor
one day in september UNK doctor received a call from someone who claimed to be from the family health services authority asking for details from his files suspicious he gave nothing away
i then rang the family health authority er myself and they'd never heard of the person and had no trace of the name i gave them
erm told me that they had a lot of or a lot a number of people ringing UNK to be someone asking for information and they like to keep a log of these UNK phone calls i then rang the patients mother and told her what had happened as quickly as i could
what is the thing about this that concerns you most of all
the implications for my daughter's safety and security and mine and the rest of my family's because there have been a number of occasions over the years when i've had to turn to the police because of my anxiety about that when there's been a lot of attention from the media and when the press have published our address and so on erm and we've had i've had specific death threats particularly against my daughter on one occasion
so it's that is very UNK to think that erm somebody putting it about or happy to make available to others information about my domestic arrangements and my habits
and of course the pro the information about UNK is the is the thing which concerns me most
er anything else
erm yes there is one other thing about the program er which you might be interested in
mhm
the UNK about you
erm it's about how people sell personal data er for money to other people erm and erm you're quite er you will be quite a substantial part of the program
hmm
naming us
yes that's right
i just wondered what your response to it was seeing as er what you're doing is getting information to which you're not entitled and selling it for money to other people
ah i'm sorry i can't comment
thanks
well don't you think that it's really rather UNK for you to be doing this
after all people are entitled to some UNK aren't they about their you don't feel that there's any need at all to give any explanation of your behaviour
you don't think that an explanation is due here
this information after all should have received confidential and does belong to other people doesn't it
what i thinks embarrassing is that
and you're just stealing it you're just stealing it so that you can make money aren't you
do people have a right to have their health records confidential do they not
have you got nothing to say what so ever
UNK not no
robert is not alone in selling personal information from data banks
many companies using only the most casual UNK offer these services so we spent a day on the phone talking to detective agencies listed in yellow pages asking them what they had to offer
we said we were a research company thinking of UNK a future employee
before they came we removed all trace of our connection to television UNK the office furniture a bit and UNK a camera in a bankers box
the bank enquiry line
if they're clean
okay
yeah
to obtain UNK facility current bank balance and comments on how the account has been run
yeah
that would cost you fifty pounds for that
right
plus v a t
right we can supply bank information for instance we can supply you with the balance erm we should be able to let you know what sort of standing orders there are erm but that would be charged at an extra rate because
yeah
we would have to find out
yeah
about the bank
and that's not easy
it's a grey area and everything that we do is totally ethical and professional but obviously what were talking about is obtaining information
yeah
there is a hell of a lot of information er at mm the fraud squad
yeah
i e associates and that sort of thing
yeah
which i can have checked you know what i mean
yeah
you throw the name bill UNK into that
yeah
and it'll come up that he's and that's probably the sort of person your going to get somebody who's is a smell about rather than
yeah
do you know what i mean
yeah
and so that's why erm you know we only use certain contacts who we know are very reliable
yeah
erm and in a position really where they wouldn't be challenged
right
but of course they want to be paid quite well i
sure
UNK to add
to ascertain s criminal record hundred pounds to ascertain that
if it's got a full criminal record if their known er that could be it could be as cheap as fifty pounds for a criminal record i can't make any guarantees on that
right
because the there's only one way of obtaining somebody's criminal record and that's getting a police officer to do it
to do the UNK
yes
right
basically we have erm access
not official access but we do have access
yeah
i know people in this sort of line of business who will sit here and tell you all sorts of
crap
here
excuse me er anyway it's bu really there's no we haven't got a crystal ball you know
yeah
yeah
it's about grey matter and tr and a bit of you know UNK and UNK and a bit of erm UNK and it's who you know and not what you know i mean really excuse me one moment
he's a good lad
yesterday we got five UNK agents to come into our office all of them offered to get details of people's bank accounts
mm
details several cases details from the er the police national computer er for sale at prices varying from sort of fifty pounds to a hundred and fifty pounds
mhm
and we've just rung these people up from the yellow pages i mean this does suggest doesn't it that there's quite a f quite a big market out there for this stuff
well it may well suggest it i mean i have no reason to doubt the statement you've made or even statements made in newspapers they've added to my concern from my own investigations
what i cannot do is go around and do a full enquiry to find out what the position is an enquiry indeed might be difficult because you may have found these people but actually UNK down er to who does it and what actually happens may be more difficult
it is not clear why it should be that difficult UNK every day enquiry agents are used to discover details of employees and customers financial health and criminal records
very large solicitors firms insurance companies and very large UNK these were just some of the customers of which the private detectives who visited us UNK
and they will never be short of custom until the government acts
we asked the home office to appear in this program but they refused instead they sent us a letter full of encouraging noises about how seriously they took the question of data protection
however serious action to close the UNK in the law will have to wait on the parliamentary timetable and the european legislation until then with more and more companies wanting to know the truth about their employees competitors and suppliers and with more and more information being put onto computers the trade in personal data looks set to UNK
in the security world everything is a compromise as there are no UNK erm you want an absolutely secure health service don't have a health service don't let ever give any information out erm if you fall ill away from your home er you're called into a hospital you would like the thought that er the hospital can ring up your doctor and get information about you fairly quickly you don't want to have a whole bureaucratic erm apparatus saying no that information isn't available
it sounds as though it's going to go on forever then
it could well go on forever unless one of two things happens unless everybody guards themselves against giving information away which as a matter of practice many will do and many probably won't or secondly that some legislation is brought about to make this an offence and to treat it seriously
there seems little doubt that legislation would reduce the extent to which confidential personal data is sold
but as those who want the information get more UNK we may find that our personal privacy has been eroded forever
my own feeling is that er as against someone who is er reasonably determined and reasonably UNK there is very little privacy there is more privacy if you are extremely rich and can afford to have bank accounts in UNK and can afford to hire lawyers to prevent stories about you appearing in the newspapers but for th for the majority of us erm there is very little privacy
could i have your name please
harry
how old are you mr
ninety two
where were you born mr
yorkshire UNK yorkshire
when did you come to live in north wales
erm september nineteen eighteen
where did you work in UNK
the er for the electricity the council electricity supplier
and where was that station
that's down in erm er i don't it's where the UNK is and that's on erm i don't remember the road the other end of the town
the gas the UNK and the electricity were both together
i see
was this th during the early days of electricity in the in the area
well the electricity er was originally er in nineteen hundred
yes
there when the er first electricity station was built
it was in er going order when er i came
i see
there were it came under the north wales electricity supply
yes i see
and that supplied the coast
i see
more or less
with the UNK stations
i see
how many people would be working there with you at the time roughly
would you remember
in the electricity works
yes
oh with the distribution there'd be some like some like over twenty or twenty five twenty five
what was the nature
mr er mr er and UNK er his assistant was
and then there were these shift engineers and myself er and the boiler room staff
what was the nature of your work
what sort of things did you do
erm maintenance on the engine room and boiler room
i see
on the plant
where did you live in UNK at the time
er in erm here in road
and then er no i beg your pardon that's wrong
i'd been away after that before i came to the electricity works here
i was working in UNK putting in a big textile plant in
i see
and from there er in i came back here in nineteen thirty eight
and should've gone abroad but i wouldn't go i er i er i had this position offered in the electricity works here then
aye
nineteen thirty eight and i s i was here about s ten years er the nationalization was in nineteen forty seven
and i er i went then when the na it was a nationalized this station was closed down and i went to UNK power station
i see
and i was there till nineteen sixty when i retired
i see
did you have to travel from your home here in UNK to UNK to your work or did you
oh yes i went on the bus
er travelled on the bus
did you
i got many a lift you know with someone that were there
how many hours a week
but i st i stayed in UNK the first two years
i see
to be near hand because i was on maintenance on call you see as maintenance
i see ye how was the electricity generated in the UNK power station
well er there were erm UNK engines and generators on a positive shaft right through
but then you see the town was on er on er on d c and they'd be at that time they were beginning to change over to a c the whole country's a c now
and to get onto the grid supplied by the UNK stations
i see
and so they put three sets of UNK in
that was to convert from d c to a c to bring it er from a c to d c to bring er bring it into what the town was er being constructed for
i see
that was until the grid got into proper operation and the then they got nationalized then they transferred back onto a c it was to bring it into line to s to keep the town supplied through all the er UNK that were being constructed for d c they had to bring the a c back to d c that was UNK
now there were three sets in the electricity works here and two in the UNK down the town hall
and the UNK is that th the er UNK on the UNK got in a bad state and er the UNK the er mr asked me what could you do with them
turn them mr never heard of it
i said i have
i says and we'll do it
oh yes he says you get on with it
so i did
was it
i
dangerous work
no
no
oh no i we couldn't
i designed and made the drawings for some UNK and we made them i'd two or three men with me and they made these UNK and them underneath the sets
and then took er took the k took the tr the erm took the UNK off and the UNK and fitted it on top and then got special tools from UNK dock at liverpool power station that i asked for tools
and they turned these they got UNK in where the UNK fit
now they should be perfectly plain straight and we got a t i got a true cut on eighteen inches with a mr was so he made a special report on erm what i'd done
and i did the three sets in the er electricity works and the two in the UNK
and they were a complete success
so how long were you working in the UNK power station
twelve years
and where did you go from here
UNK
what UNK the generators in the UNK power station
oh tha er that's er that's erm hydro water
i see
oh yes that's er more or less well it's the nearest approach to pe to er what do they call it
oh UNK motion
it's continuous the water
now that water comes through it starts er from er on two machines
high pressure and it travels UNK three miles is three miles long and a mile wide and they've never touched bottom
it's fed by underground springs
and when the heavy UNK heavy er it rises you see well you've got to put more power switch more power on to the machines down below in the station
we've got three sets we've got four now there was another put in wh that one when i when i was i
that one we put that in when i was there
i see
that a UNK and erm er the er generator that's a positive
the water hits it you see well it isn't like steam
i've been in steam stations as well as steam UNK a long time since but with steam you can use it over again
yes
g passes through UNK er and that er and then through the er through the UNK and it its got back into the UNK at the proper temperature
but with water once it's hit the f wheel on the UNK it's finished
yes
but it takes it er at er with a pressure of five hundred pounds a square inch
as much as that
yeah but you can't get speed on water UNK that you can on er steam
now steam there's steam UNK er the UNK are three thousand to the minute
now on water you can't get them only on eight hundred about eight hundred and ninety
or eight hundred or n eight or nine hundred
how was the water UNK down
through the pipes
i see
how many pipes
nine
they're nine foot diameter
are they as much as that
er coming from UNK from when they start
yes
and then there's big UNK wire UNK to stop any foreign matter coming through
they start at nine foot diameter
yes
and by the time the then the er UNK reduced all the way in three miles and the drop is the drop is twelve hundred foot
that's down the mountain side
the last drop
and when it hits the UNK it's the UNK ten inch
so you can imagine what's coming er UNK coming
yes
all that weight of UNK coming through all the time
what was the
and then it goes it runs away into the through the er bypass into the con er river UNK
now you said the pipes were nine feet in diameter
yes
what's were they made of metal
metal pipes
oh yes
how
hi high UNK steel
high UNK steel
oh yes
how thick was the steel
th er inch and th inch and three quarters
would be well you can see them pipes
and the then there's UNK they're every six er every er twenty two feet i think it is
and then the UNK the UNK
the UNK are two and half inch and then they're UNK together er corresponding er UNK bolts one after the other
all the way round and those bolts are eight eighty eight by one and half and two inch
were these pipes examined by anybody
oh yes
UNK or daily
oh ye yes th erm er th er the hydro electrical engineers london
they're the consultants for the hydro stations
but you know wh what they're getting now
er it it's UNK er UNK
all that water that goes th that goes down through the machines is all sent back to top
UNK
er oh yes er the er it's a permanent shaft right through
i can show you it
it's a positive shaft right through
and it er and the pumps the pumps at the bottom are one hundred thousand horsepower
really
that sends the water back to the top
this is what it looks like
that's the pump storage
i see
there's the there's the UNK here and there's the generator and here's the pumps
i see
that sends it back t back to the top
th that's the UNK there on the shaft isn't it
yes
yes
yes
i see
that's very interesting
they take er they take a bit of explain if you'd like to take that to look at you can do
thank you very much
i'll bring it back i'll keep it
er
safely for you
there's no hurry no hurry
thanks very much indeed
it's very interesting
well in fact you could keep it if you want
no i er
i can get another
no i'll bring it back for you
i can get another if you er
no it's
but er it it'd take a bit of time to er if er i explained it all to you
yes
how it's er how it's operated
you see the UNK pipes and the UNK and this you can't see a thing of this you ought to go and have a look at this place sometime
i'd like to very much
i'd like to
did these pipes ever break
mm
these UNK pipes did they ever break at all
no
no
was there no accident at all with them
too solid UNK
this is the main this is the er the station that wa was only opened in nineteen sixty seven
i see
you can take that if you want
er
oh thank you very much
now er in the in the an engineer if you've any engineer friend engineering friends i could explain it all to you but it takes time
yes
if you've if you've got they'd be able to explain that to you
because it's all it's all set out
er i take the er UNK itself in the UNK was erm
well they aren't UNK er a UNK a UNK
mm
they're er generators
i see
UNK the current
how was the
it's like this you see
er it's one UNK working a against another
i see
is there a UNK of wire round it
er oh yes the lot
you see the out the er the UNK and then there's the UNK outside it's massive UNK millions of mi thousands of miles of wire
and then there's a gap between you see
the higher the voltage the closer that gap is
you can't adjust it it's way it's originally designed and made
and that produces the UNK the er electrical you can't see it of course but we know that everybody knows
you can't see it but that's where it's generated in between the in between those two
that's now it's working the is working against the power
you see you see that's the generator and these are the these are the UNK that's the UNK that goes round
i see
and the UNK generated in the centre
this is all the apparatus that goes up to drive it
and then there's governors and all that sort of thing to regulate it to keep it exact
to keep it in its place so all the engineers knows what they're doing
anyway if you've any UNK engineering friends they'd be able to explain that to you
i can do it but it'd take
thanks very much
a long time it'd take a long time
ooh aye er it's er highly technical and i
yes
i mean i it's a long time since i left it
there would be somebody on duty twenty four hours a day
oh yes
continuous they never stopped
it's a public what they call er mr here used to say
it's a public service that must be kept going
they worked all night sometimes on UNK you know
they're inside UNK and the coal passing through you know
but now in these big new super stations like UNK in north yorkshire one of the biggest stations er in europe coal fired and UNK in UNK
you see the coal now is UNK
the it comes straight from the UNK from the er mines and it's sent through UNK on these UNK go round railways that go slow and they stop over this and then it's all UNK with heavy steel balls into powder and coal and into the UNK it's just blown in
at a terrific pressure
and that's the furnace that creates the steam and the steam goes then to the UNK and a matter of half a million er UNK power station and UNK their units are s half a million horsepower half a million or six hundred five hundred million horsepower
tremendous
i used to have a little stick
cherry wood
oh i did all my all my working days i us i used to keep it keep it in my pocket you know
and er i could yes i could hear well then
i could put it in it were only about ten inches long and i made it and UNK it erm on a UNK i put it my ear and side of UNK and i could hear all what were going on inside
if there were a fault i could detect it
is that right
aye
they've got instruments for doing it now but i used to stick to my bit of stick
they used to say that UNK coming here with his bit of stick
he knows more about it than what we know with these instruments
how they used to talk
it was a primitive form of UNK
was this thing going then
when i said that
i'm sorry er wh what were you say
it was a primitive form of UNK
like a doctor's UNK
yes
or er i used to use them too
did you
UNK yes
did you really
oh yes
but i used to th i er used to stick to my bit of stick
i got better results than what they did with their with their fancy UNK
what else can you tell me about er the generation of electricity in UNK
ooh i could tell you a lot
oh i could keep you going all day
there's some things that used to happen
aye going flat out you know they're er heavy UNK the machines are going flat out er at the s one night i sat i sat er all night and ne nearly part of next day at side of one of governors to make sure it didn't shift no more than a about a sixteenth of an inch
er if it had gone over would have thrown the whole lot out of er out of gear
they're that sensitive you know
are they
oh they are very sensitive is er is those machines
they are
er
apart from your normal work what did you do in your leisure er leisure time
oh i'd a little workshop and used to make stuff
what sort of things
oh er i'd made one or two little machines and machine tools and stuff like that
there's one on t on the board er in the er engine room at UNK at UNK in the machine room that i made
and i last time i were there i went there for erm well to put it fairly straight i went to consult on something that'd been done
ooh it was all that do in these UNK that
and i made them UNK and whatnot when they come to do it at UNK when they come to want them doing i said to the to the chief engineer i said he told me about they were going get these UNK done here machine
they're massive machines you know
oh he says oh i says well what do you do
oh stones made by UNK
now that's er that's er a UNK stone and it goes it fits on a UNK at side of machine
now there's the machine is g there the UNK copper er these UNK and it's on main shaft that goes right through the generator and the UNK
and they've got to be kept true
now you'll never get a true surface with a UNK stone
with a com stone
because it er the machine was UNK the stone away the stone wasn't UNK the UNK the UNK the copper
i stuck to that theory all the way through
oh yes it does
oh no it doesn't i says but you do your ow er have it your own way
but it made awful mess
and i told them about this job i'd done here
oh he UNK it
i says well alright that mi er very nice chap to deal with and oh i got on alright with him but he wouldn't have this
so oh after i retired some years we have a dinner every year you see it'll be it'll be coming off in december
and it's er we go to UNK power station to have a drink and then come to er well we've been at royal hotel at UNK these last years or two
but anyway apart from that i said to mr he's the head over all the UNK stations over this erm i said mr li these UNK i told him doing the
oh he says i never heard of anything like that
he says next time we have them to do at UNK we'll send for you
and the maintenance engineer at UNK mr i know him very well he came here er like you did downstairs come to see me one evening
oh aye he says er you come up to UNK tomorrow
i said bit short notice isn't it
well he says want you to come and see this idea that we er how we do these UNK
i says what do you them with
oh he says we a UNK and er a diamond tool
that's no good
i says that isn't same as what i said
we turn it er turn them i said with a er cutting tool
well he says he says we're doing it with a with a with a er a diamond tool
i went to UNK came for me with a car and mr couldn't be there
but he asked me if i'd send them er a full report of it after day after they'd done it
i wasn't doing it
i went to see er how they were doing it you see
oh
er says er it would that diamond tool were only sending dust copper dust
it should have been a UNK erm a copper coming off with turning tool
and i asked the man in the engineering
i said what speed are you going on
oh he says a hundred
a hundred i says no wonder the er it you've made a mess on it i said
you have made a mess on it don't mind me saying so but you have
i said i've come all way from UNK to see what you're doing
and after write a report
hundred i says d i says do you know how mu what speed i were running when i did them
at two thousand eight hundred
you want high speed and a er low cut for copper
fine cut
don't want to get a lot off you can't but you want the speed the high speed for UNK copper
you know th that's the end of th
i said that i said a hundred and you're only running at a hundred
oh well alright and i told mr about it
i wrote a report out for them
i says you're all er very er i says your method my method it's far and away in er better than what UNK is
